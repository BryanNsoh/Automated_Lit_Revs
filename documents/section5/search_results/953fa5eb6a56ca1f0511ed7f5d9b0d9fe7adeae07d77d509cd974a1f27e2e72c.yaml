    Get rights and content Abstract Organ printing can be defined as layer-by-layer
    additive robotic biofabrication of three-dimensional functional living macrotissues
    and organ constructs using tissue spheroids as building blocks. The microtissues
    and tissue spheroids are living materials with certain measurable, evolving and
    potentially controllable composition, material and biological properties. Closely
    placed tissue spheroids undergo tissue fusion — a process that represents a fundamental
    biological and biophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed
    tissue self-assembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intraorgan
    branched vascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids.
    Organ printing could dramatically enhance and transform the field of tissue engineering
    by enabling large-scale industrial robotic biofabrication of living human organ
    constructs with “built-in” perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree. Thus,
    organ printing is a new emerging enabling technology paradigm which represents
    a developmental biology-inspired alternative to classic biodegradable solid scaffold-based
    approaches in tissue engineering. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction The ultimate goal of tissue engineering is to design and fabricate
    natural-like functional human tissues and organs suitable for regeneration, repair
    and replacement of damaged, injured or lost human organs [1], [2], [3], [4]. The
    engineered tissues and organs are technically “artificial” or “man-made” based
    on methods of their generation, but at the same time they are also “natural-like”
    living tissues and organs. At least theoretically, an ideal tissue engineered
    human organ must eliminate, dramatically reduce, or more realistically reinvent
    the problem of biocompatibility [5], which is a critically important issue for
    any biomaterial-based approach for creating artificial organs, devices or prostheses.
    Without tissue engineering, living functional human organs can be produced only
    during natural embryonic development. How close tissue engineers can recapitulate
    and capture the most essential structure–function features of normal natural human
    tissues and organs, and how far they must try to imitate developmental histogenesis,
    morphogenesis and organogenesis, are still open for debate. Because of economic
    constraints and the intrinsic limitations of producing living tissues and organs,
    it is reasonable to assume that biofabrication technology will probably not allow
    one to create a 100% authentic copy of functional living human organs. Rather,
    engineering of natural-like functional vascularized tissue engineered organ constructs
    capable of restoring essential function is a more realistic technological goal
    and represent a great accomplishment if successful. Developmental processes already
    serve as a positive control or reference point and provide powerful insights into
    tissue engineering [6], [7]. Furthermore, the integration of developmental biology
    and tissue engineering, or the so-called biomimetic approach, is not wishful thinking
    but rather work in progress [8]. It is interesting that one initially suggested
    term for the tissue engineering field was “chimeric neomorphogenesis” [9]. Thus,
    it is safe to predict that deep understanding, biomimicking and employing developmental
    mechanisms of embryonic histogenesis and organogenesis can be very beneficial
    for tissue engineering. The goal of this paper is to introduce and discuss a novel,
    rapidly emerging developmental biology-inspired paradigm of solid biodegradable
    scaffold-free minitissue-based biomimetic approach, or more specifically, organ
    printing using self-assembled tissue spheroids as a possible alternative to classic
    solid biodegradable scaffold-based approach in the field of tissue engineering.
    2. Intrinsic limitations of biodegradable solid scaffold-based approaches in tissue
    engineering Classic biodegradable solid scaffold-based approaches, that still
    represent a dominating conceptual framework or paradigm in tissue engineering,
    originated from attempts by chemical engineers to create porous scaffolds from
    biodegradable polymers as a temporal template-like instructive support for cell
    attachment and tissue neomorphogenesis [9], [10]. Thus, as clearly outlined in
    a recent insightful review on the mechanism of biocompatibility [5], the classic
    solid biodegradable scaffold-based approach in tissue engineering has its roots
    in biomaterial science and represents an adaptation of degradable polymers used
    in medical devices for the purpose of engineering living tissues. However, as
    pointed out in the review [5], at least initially, “…the successful use of degradable
    materials in medical devices has, unfortunately, been extrapolated into the ‘potential’
    for such materials to be used in tissue engineered products, without an understanding
    of the requirements and specifications for these two quite different applications”.
    There are several basic assumptions behind classic biodegradable solid scaffold-based
    tissue engineering approaches: 1) cell growth is substrate attachment-dependent;
    cells need a solid substrate for attachment and proliferation; 2) tissue constructs
    must have an organo-specific shape; a solid scaffold is essential to keep the
    desired shape; a tissue construct could not maintain its shape without a solid
    rigid scaffold; 3) the scaffold serves not only as an attachment substrate, but
    also as a source of inductive and instructive signals for cell differentiation,
    migration, proliferation and orientation; 4) the porous structure of a solid scaffold
    will allow optimal cell seeding, tissue construct viability, and vascularization;
    and 5) mechanical properties initially provided by the rigid solid scaffold after
    its biodegradation will be maintained by controlled neomorphogenesis of parenchymal
    and stromal tissue synthesized in vitro or in vivo in the tissue construct [2],
    [9], [10]. Indeed, it has been proven that cells can attach to the scaffold; the
    solid scaffold can maintain a tissue construct shape; functionalized scaffolds
    can serve as a tool for instructive morphogenetic signaling and directed cell
    differentiation; and, finally, cells inside porous scaffolds can maintain viability
    and eventually neoformed tissue can replace the biodegradable scaffold [10], [11],
    [12]. However, in spite of proven feasibility of solid scaffolds, this classic
    approach still faces some limitations and challenges [13], [14]: 1) vascularization
    of thick tissue constructs is an unsolved issue, 2) precise placing of different
    multiple cell types inside 3D porous scaffolds is technologically challenging;
    3) achieving organo-specific level of cell density in tissue constructs remains
    a big challenge; and 4) recent reports on the effect of matrix rigidity on stem
    cell differentiation [15] can undermine the value of solid rigid biodegradable
    scaffolds at least for certain tissue applications. Another important limitation,
    somehow overlooked, is the fact that from a cell''s point of view even three-dimensional
    sophisticated porous nano-structuralized scaffolds often represent a two-dimensional
    substrate or basically the same 2D plastic Petri dish. In essence, the nature
    of interactions between cells and solid scaffolds on the cellular level at least
    initially is basically two-dimensional. Moreover, it has been shown that collagen
    and other extracellular matrix molecules secreted in soluble forms are washed
    out from a Petri dish due to the absence of a confined space typical for real
    3D tissue [16], [17]. Thus, synthesized but not cross-linked yet extracellular
    matrix molecules could be potentially washed out from 3D porous scaffolds, too.
    Another issue is biodegradability. As written in the above-cited influential review,
    “There is no point in designing a system that will facilitate complex tissue regeneration
    if that tissue is ultimately destroyed by the influx of inflammatory cells associated
    with degradation process or if material stimulates the immune system as it degrades
    and releases antigenic material [5]”. From another view, in vitro cell seeding
    on a solid biodegradable scaffold with sequential, relatively slow, complete scaffold
    biodegradation and tissue neomorphogenesis leads to laborious, expensive, time
    consuming and commercially unsuccessful tissue engineering technology. As Chris
    Mason boldly stated, “The time has come to engineer tissues and not just tissue
    engineer” [18]. It is also not immediately obvious how a chemically modified and
    functionalized 2D surface of a solid scaffold designed to biodegrade can maintain
    its functional activity in a 3D tissue construct in vivo [5]. Recent reviews on
    the problem of vascularization in tissue engineered constructs based on using
    biodegradable solid scaffolds also state that after two decades of intensive efforts
    the effective solution of this problem has not yet been found [19], [20], [21].
    Thus, it appears that at least some of these limitations are probably intrinsic
    to the tissue engineering approach of using 3D porous solid biodegradable scaffolds
    as an instructive template. Moreover, the absence of clearly formulated pathways
    or roadmaps for automated, industrial scale tissue engineering using solid scaffolds
    is another serious reason to suggest that the search for possible alternatives
    is becoming a technological imperative [22]. It is becoming obvious that the minimal
    essential and sufficient criteria for an alternative approach — one that is technologically
    more advanced and potentially superior — must include enabling precise placement
    of cells at a high level of cell density, efficient vascularization of thick 3D
    tissue constructs, automated robotic large-scale industrial biofabrication, and
    greater reliance on developmental biology-inspired biomimetic principles of 3D
    tissue self-assembly, rather than on template-based tissue assembly. 3. Back to
    the future: developmental biology origin of minitissue-based tissue engineering
    concept One of the most logical and obvious ways to look for possible alternatives
    to solid biodegradable scaffold-based tissue engineering approaches is to understand
    how tissues and organs are formed during normal embryonic development. The knowledge
    of developmental biology as a science can provide powerful insights for tissue
    engineering as a technology [6]. In this context, probably the most interesting
    fact is that, during embryonic development, tissues and organs are formed without
    any solid scaffolds. Although overall embryonic development is a relatively slow
    process, certain essential morphogenetic steps and events during embryonic histogenesis
    and organogenesis are relatively fast. The main technological and economic imperative
    in tissue engineering technology is a rapid tissue biofabrication. Thus, the challenge
    which developmental biology-inspired approach to tissue engineering is facing
    is the balanced combination of powerful biological insight with technological
    imperatives and constraints. It means that even if it is possible to recapitulate
    or biomimic certain essential developmental biology processes in tissue engineering
    technologies in order to develop commercially sound technologies, the bioassembly
    process must be as a minimum both accelerated and automated. Organ printing or
    the biomedical application of rapid prototyping, also defined as layer-by-layer
    additive biomanufacturing, is an emerging transforming biomimetic technology that
    has potential for surpassing traditional solid scaffold-based tissue engineering
    [3], [4]. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach that
    offers a pathway for scalable, reproducible, mass production of tissue engineered
    products; it allows for precise simultaneous 3D positioning of several cell types;
    it enables creation of tissue with a high level of cell density; it can solve
    the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; and finally organ printing
    can be done in situ [4]. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is to
    fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organ constructs suitable for
    clinical implantation. The conceptual framework of solid biodegradable scaffold-free
    tissue engineering is based on the assumption that tissues and organs are self-organizing
    systems, and that cells and especially microtissues can undergo biological self-assembly
    and self-organization without any external influence in the form of instructive,
    supporting and directing rigid templates or solid scaffolds. Self-organization
    is defined as a process in which patterning at the global level of a system emerges
    solely from numerous interactions among the lower-level components of the system
    [23]. Self-assembly is defined as the autonomous organization of components into
    patterns or structures without human intervention [24]. In this context, the evolving
    morphological pattern in embryonic development is an emergent property of the
    self-assembling system, rather than a property imposed on the system by an external
    ordering influence [23]. The best possible examples of tissue self-organization
    and self-assembly are again in the field of developmental biology. An historical
    analysis strongly indicates that the emerging solid biodegradable scaffold-free
    minitissue-based biomimetic approach in tissue engineering has deep and strong
    roots in developmental biology. It began with Aron Moscona''s pioneering works
    on dissociation and aggregation of cells from organ rudiments of the early chick
    embryo [25], [26], [27]. It continued through a series of remarkable papers with
    another intriguing title “Reconstruction of tissues by dissociated cells” by Malcolm
    Steinberg who formulated fundamental thermodynamic rules determining tissue self-assembly
    and developed the well validated, both in vitro and in vivo, “differential adhesion
    hypothesis” explaining the fluidic nature of cell sorting and tissue self-assembly
    [28], [29], [30]. As early as 1960, one of the world''s leading developmental
    biologists at that time, Paul Weiss, expressed hope in his paper with the impressive
    title “Reconstruction of complete organs from single-cell suspension of chick
    embryos in advanced stages of differentiation” that his pioneering study “…will
    deflect at least some attention and investigative effort back towards the fundamental
    problems of self-organization” [31]. Thus, the early work of developmental biologists
    demonstrated that in vitro tissue assembly (“tissue and organ reconstruction”)
    from single cells or tissue aggregates is feasible. The valuable contribution
    of several generations of outstanding developmental biologists must be respected
    and appreciated. It is important from an historical perspective, but it may be
    even more valuable for proper future development of the tissue engineering field.
    Hence, this section is called “back to the future”. The most essential element
    of the conceptual framework underlying the emerging minitissue-based approach
    in tissue engineering is based on the developmental biology-inspired assumption
    that 3D tissues and organs of desirable material properties and composition could
    be fabricated without using solid porous biodegradable synthetic or natural scaffolds.
    There are several partly already validated and some still not validated assumptions
    or arguments that taken together constitute a conceptual basis for minitissue-based
    approaches in tissue engineering: 1) functional macrotissues can be fabricated
    from functional minitissue blocks without solid scaffolds; 2) scaffold-free tissue
    assembly and maturation can be accelerated (see corresponding section below);
    3) initially strong material properties are non-essential and/or may even impede
    efficient organ biofabrication; 4) viability and shape of solid scaffold-free
    3D tissue constructs could be maintained by other means such as a microfludics-based
    irrigation dripping perfusion bioreactor with removable porous tubes; 5) macrotissues
    and organs can be built by directed tissue self-assembly of robotically placed
    tissue spheroids with ‘built in” intraorgan branched vascular system (see corresponding
    section below). Perhaps the most compelling conceptual framework of novel solid
    biodegradable scaffold-free minitissue-based biomimetic tissue engineering paradigm
    could be presented as an integrated combination of ten basic assumptions summarized
    in Table 1. Table 1. Conceptual framework for organ-printing technology. • The
    most important assumption is a developmental biology-inspired belief in the possibility
    of creating functional human tissue and organs without solid biodegradable scaffolds
    or template-based approaches. •High cell density is essential for fast tissue
    assembly and accelerated tissue maturation. • Minitissue or tissue spheroids can
    fuse and be assembled into macrotissues through the tissue fusion process or directed
    tissue self-assembly. • Standardized size and viable minitissues or tissue spheroids
    with different compositions and organization, including microvascularized tissue
    spheroids, can be rapidly fabricated in large quantity. • Due to their size, the
    material properties and shape of minitissue or tissue spheroids represent a processible
    “bioink” suitable for precise, automated dispensing or digital ‘punching’ onto
    sprayed hydrogel layers (“biopaper”) and sequential bioassembly and biofabrication
    into macrotissues and living organ constructs with the help of sophisticated computer-aided
    robotic devices (“bioprinters”). • Self-assembled vascular tissue spheroids allow
    generation of a “built-in” intraorgan branched vascular tree within 3D thick tissue
    or organ constructs, suitable for perfusion. • Microvasculature can be formed
    by the self-assembly process and be seamlessly integrated with an intraorgan branched
    vascular tree by self-assembly, tissue fusion and sprouting processes. • It is
    possible to develop accelerated methods of tissue maturation. • A microfluidic-based,
    irrigation type tripled perfusion bioreactor with temporally removable porous
    microtubes will enable the construct to maintain shape and buy time necessary
    for tissue maturation of the perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree. • A
    minitissue-based solid, biodegradable scaffold-free tissue engineering approach
    enables automated, robotic, large-scale industrial tissue engineering using computer-aided
    design of organs (“blueprints”). 4. Tissue spheroids as building blocks 4.1. Material
    properties of tissue spheroids A recently published review paper with the characteristic
    title “Cell as a material” [32] logically implies that minitissues, and more specifically
    tissue spheroids, can also be considered as a material or more correctly a “living
    material” with certain measurable, evolving and potentially controllable material
    properties (Fig. 1). The most popular direct method for measuring material properties
    of rounded microtissues is tensiometry or controlled compression of cell aggregates
    between two parallel plates [33], [34] (Fig. 1a). However, the requirement of
    ideal spherical shape is a limitation of this approach. Recently, a novel tissue
    aspiration method was developed (Fig. 1b), successfully tested on cushion tissue
    explants, that showed a desirable level of sensitivity [35]. Fluorescent microbeads
    have been embedded in tissue engineered constructs for studying material properties
    based on microbead-induced mobility [36] (Fig. 1c). Material properties of tissue
    constructs formed by fusion of tissue spheroids placed on very elastic and thin
    electrospun polyurethane scaffolds could be also measured by classic tensile test
    (Fig. 1d–g). Biofabrication of tissue spheroids incorporating magnetic or fluorescent
    microbeads is one of the most intriguing approaches to be explored for development
    of novel assays for studying material properties of microtissues and tissue spheroids
    before and after their fusion into larger tissue engineered constructs, as well
    as for non-destructive biomonitoring of tissue maturation in these constructs.
    Semi-quantitative estimation of material properties of tissue spheroids can be
    also based on the enveloping behavior of two adjacent tissue spheroids during
    the tissue fusion process [37]. Theoretically, the more cohesive tissue spheroid
    will be enveloped by the spheroid with lower cohesive tissue or inferior material
    properties (Fig. 1h–j). The fluorescent recovery after photobeaching (FRAP) method
    is based on the assumption that there is a certain correlation between fluorescent
    probe diffusion and density of extracellular matrix molecules such as collagen
    [38]. The estimation of electroconductivity and electric impedance is another
    indirect non-invasive high-throughput approach based on similar correlations [39].
    The development of a broad arsenal of highly sensitive, direct and indirect quantitative
    and semi-quantitative methods for the estimation of material properties of tissue
    spheroids and microtissue is an essential task in the development of predictive
    solid scaffold-free microtissue-based tissue engineering approaches (Fig. 1).
    This is especially true in the context of controlling the tissue fusion process,
    achieving a desirable level of tissue maturation, and for high-throughput screening
    of ‘maturogenic factors’ or factors that enhance extracellular matrix deposition
    (see Section 7). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Methods of biomechanical

    relationship for tissue construct fabricated from fused tissue spheroids; h) envelopment
    assay – initial step of tissue spheroid fusion; i) fusion of tissue spheroid with
    equal level of cohesion; j) fusion of tissue spheroid with different levels of
    tissue cohesion – lower cohesive tissue spheroid (green) is enveloping more cohesive
    tissue spheroid (red). 4.2. Scalable methods of tissue spheroids'' biofabrication
    Tissue spheroids have been used as an in vitro 3D model system in biomedical and
    tumor research for several decades [40], [41], [42], [43]. It is not surprising
    that an impressive arsenal of methods for the biofabrication of tissue spheroids
    has been eventually developed. This topic was recently systematically and comprehensively
    covered in excellent review paper [44]. In order to estimate what method of spheroid
    biofabrication is most suitable for large-scale industrial tissue engineering
    and for organ printing, it is essential to formulate appropriate criteria or well
    defined specifications. First and most important, it must be a scalable technology.
    For example, in order to build a human kidney we need to generate one million
    glomeruli and nephrons. Second, these spheroids must be maximally standardized
    in their size in order to make them processible or be dispensable through a bioprinter
    nozzle or by other means without clogging problems and their destruction. Thus,
    standardization of tissue spheroid size is desirable for continuous dispensing.
    Third, the method of tissue spheroid biofabrication must not induce significant
    cell injury and/or DNA damage. Fourth, the method of tissue spheroid biofabrication
    must not compromise the tissue spheroids'' capacity for sequential tissue fusion.
    Finally, the biofabrication method must be flexible enough to allow generation
    of a diversity of tissue spheroids of complex composite structure. Thus, facing
    the fact that most of the existing methods are not scalable [44], it is safe to
    predict that development of methods for scalable biofabrication of tissue spheroids
    will soon became a rapidly growing field in solid scaffold-free tissue engineering.
    4.3. Fluidic nature of tissue fusion process Fusion is sometimes defined as “melting
    together”, which is logically implying the liquidic nature of the fusion process.
    Tissue fusion is a ubiquitous process during embryonic development and can be
    recapitulated in vitro [45]. It has been shown that the kinetics of tissue fusion
    of two rounded embryonic heart cushion tissue explants placed in an hanging drop
    fits perfectly to fusion kinetics described for two droplets of fluids [46]. Moreover,
    based on direct measurement of surface tension and calculation of viscosity, tissue
    spheroids are indeed fluidic-like structures [46]. Thus, tissue fusion is in essence
    a phenomenon of fluid mechanics driven by surface tension forces and can be adequately
    explained by physical laws and Malcolm Steinberg''s “differential adhesion hypothesis”
    [28], [29], [30]. From another point, motile living cells, cytoskeleton and number,
    and redistribution and activation of cell adhesion receptors are also essential
    for the tissue fusion process [46], [47]. The accumulation of ECM and associated
    restriction of cell motility and enhancing tissue cohesion in tissue spheroids
    [48] can change kinetics or impede the tissue spheroids'' fusion process. Thus,
    the exact effect of accumulation of extracellular matrix and specific ECM molecules,
    as well as ECM remodeling on material properties of microtissues and tissue spheroids
    and associated modulation of the tissue fusion process, remains to be elucidated.
    5. Organ printing as directed tissue self-assembly The term “directed tissue self-assembly”
    looks like a strange combination of words because it is basically a contradiction
    of terms. One can logically argue that it can be either “directed assembly” or
    “self-assembly”, but not both together. However, we found an even more controversial
    combination of words in the title of a recently published Nature paper: “Self-directed
    self-assembly of nanoparticle/copolymer mixtures” [49]. It is interesting that
    the authors of this paper use similar arguments in describing their novel approach
    in nanotechnology which is different from the scaffold-based approach: “Previous
    efforts have concentrated on using such scaffolds to spatially arrange nanoscopic
    elements as a strategy for tailoring the electrical, magnetic or photonic properties
    of the material. Recent theoretical arguments have suggested that synergistic
    interactions between self-organizing particles and a self-assembling matrix material
    can lead to hierarchically ordered structures”. Extrapolation of the last sentence
    in this quote provides a powerful insight into similar principles of self-assembly
    based scaffold-free tissue engineering. It appears that the terms “directed self-assembly”
    and even “self-directed self-assembly” are acceptable at least in the nanotechnology
    field. Self-assembly of closely placed tissue spheroids by the tissue fusion process
    into macrotissue constructs is a documented proven reality confirmed by different
    groups around the world. Direct contact of adjacent tissue spheroids in a permissive
    environment is an essential precondition for tissue fusion driven process of macrotissue
    construct self-assembly. Thus, organ printing or robotic additive biomanufacturing
    using precise layer-by-layer placement (“direction”) of self-assembled tissue
    spheroids (“bioink”) in sprayed tissue fusion permissive hydrogels (“biopaper”)
    is in essence an example of technological implementation of the concept of “directed
    tissue self-assembly” (Fig. 2). The scalability and suitability for automation
    with using special robotic bioprinters (Fig. 3) are probably the most attractive
    aspects of directed tissue self-assembly technologies. Download : Download full-size

    3. Bioprinters: a) 3D dispensing Laboratory Bioprinter – ‘LBP’ (designed by Neatco,
    Toronto, Canada in cooperation with MUSC Bioprinting Research Center, Charleston,
    SC); b) 3D robotic printer – ‘Fabber’ (designed by Cornell University, USA); c)
    3D robotic industrial bioprinter — ‘BioAssembly Tool’ (designed by Sciperio/nScript,
    Orlando, USA). Organ-printing technology using self-assembled tissue spheroids
    in certain aspects is also conceptually very close to the recently invented concept
    of digital printing [50], [51]. Conventional freeform fabrication has already
    been adapted for printing a variety of sophisticated 3D tissue engineered scaffolds
    from synthetic biodegradable polymers with sequential bioreactor-based cellularization
    (two step biofabrication process) making them especially suitable for fabrication
    of hard tissues. The continuous rapid prototyping technology based on simultaneous
    robotic dispensing or photopolymerization of stimuli-sensitive biomaterials containing
    living cells (one step biofabrication process) was also recently applied to bioprinting
    soft tissues. However, continuous (analog) rapid prototyping technology is usually
    limited to a single, homogeneous material such as hydrogels or hydrogel mixture
    with specific rheological and stimuli-sensitive properties ensuring non-destructive
    bioprocessing of living cells into 3D living tissue construct. Digital printing
    offers much more flexibility in selection materials for bioprinting. Digital (discrete)
    materials are fundamentally different from analog (continuous) materials [50],
    [51]. Digital materials may be broken into two main classes. The first class involves
    accurate placement of drops of material that harden in place like droplets jetted
    from an inkjet system. The second class of digital materials involves assembling
    of prefabricated voxels. In this context, a voxel is defined as ‘a physical bit
    in digital matter’ [50], [51]. According to the digital printing concept, ‘the
    physical voxel’ must passively self-align with its neighbors while being capable
    of self-assembly and be easy to make precisely in large quantities. Tissue spheroids
    could be considered as ‘spherical physical voxels’ that are relatively easy to
    fabricate at desirable standard size at large scale. The attractiveness of using
    tissue spheroids is based on their relatively easy industrial biofabrication at
    large scale and potential suitability for both emerging variants of bioprinting
    technology. In continuous (analog) bioprinting, tissue spheroids could be continuously
    dispensed with hydrogel. In digital bioprinting, tissue spheroids could be used
    as a discrete materials (‘physical voxels’) and be digitally ‘punched’ into sequentially
    sprayed layers of hydrogel or even be digitally self-assembled without using any
    hydrogels. 6. Bioprinting of an intraorgan branched vascular tree Another potential
    advantage of the minitissue-based approach is its promise to solve the problem
    of vascularization of thick tissue constructs, arguably the most critical and
    still unsolved problem in tissue engineering. Recent reviews on this topic summarized
    the existing approaches to vascularization and stated that the optimal solution
    of this problem has not yet been found [19], [20], [21]. Moreover, even the term
    and the meaning of the word “vascularization” is basically not very well defined.
    For optimal perfusion, organs such as kidney need a well developed hierarchically
    complex branched intraorgan vascular tree. Inspired by recent progress in microfluidics
    hydrogels assumptions that effective perfusion of thick 3D macrotissues and organs
    are similar to assumptions that it is possible to design effective transport system
    by building dense network of interconnected narrow roads without highways. Thus,
    one can argue that a correct definition for proper vascularization of tissue engineered
    organs must include all essential elements of the intraorgan circulatory system
    and not just capillaries and microvessels. First, we must have an intraorgan branched
    vascular tree “built-in” 3D macrotissue construct, which allows perfusion of the
    tissue engineered organ most effectively. Organization and branching patterns
    of an intraorgan vascular tree must be, of course, organospecific and vasospecific.
    Secondly, the arteries and veins at the onset of an intraorgan vascular tree must
    have material properties sufficient for surgical connection by sutures with recipient
    large vessels. Finally, the arterial and venous vascular trees must be seamlessly
    connected through microvascular network and be suitable for perfusion. Our approach
    to building an intraorgan vascular tree is based on using three basic types of
    tissue spheroids: solid (non-lumenized) vascular tissue spheroids; mono-lumenized
    vascular spheroids (cyst-like spheroids with one big lumen); and histotypical
    microvascularized tissue spheroids. The principal concept of building large diameter,
    intermediate diameter and microvascular segments of a vascular tree or roadmap
    for organ printing is demonstrated in Fig. 4. The microvascular networks can be
    self-assembled either from single cells placed into hydrogel by vacuole accumulation
    [52] or from endothelial tissue spheroids [53]. Biofabrication of microvascularized
    histotypical tissue spheroids is also a reality [54]. It is already proven that
    essential parts or segments of a vascular tree can be engineered at least separately
    (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Moreover, it has been shown that small isolated fragments
    of the microvascular tree can be reunited by self-assembly in vitro and in vivo
    [55], [56]. Thus, we can argue that building a complete intraorgan branched vascular
    tree with 10–12 orders of branching is technologically feasible. The proposed
    concept of bioengineering a natural-like intraorgan branched vascular tree from
    three types of self-assembled vascular tissue spheroids is specially designed
    for organ-printing technology. It is important to mention that the layers of vascular
    tissue spheroids for bioassembly of the vascular tree will be placed simultaneously
    with the layers of microvascularized organo-specific tissue spheroids. Thus, after
    finishing bioprinting, post-printed tissue fusion, and accelerated tissue maturation,
    the bioengineered vascular tree will be suitable for perfusion and integrated
    into 3D tissue or organ constructs. Bioengineering a natural-like hierarchically
    branched intraorgan vascular tree that can be ”built in” a bioprinted 3D tissue
    construct represents an enormous challenge, but it is obvious that without bioengineering
    perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree, it is practically impossible to
    print viable human organ constructs. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    is clearly demonstrated (b). 7. Concept of accelerated tissue maturation The biomimetic
    concept of accelerated tissue maturation in microtissue-based approaches implies
    that the desirable material and biomechanical properties of engineered constructs
    could be rapidly achieved without using supporting biodegradable solid scaffolds.
    In order to achieve specified biomechanical properties of tissue engineered constructs
    it is essential to know in advance not only the material properties of mature
    adult human issues and organs, but also the developmental kinetics of tissue and
    organ maturation, as well as the structural determinants of material properties
    of specific tissues or organs at different stages of development. Although cell
    membrane, cytoskeleton, cell nuclei, cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix contacts
    also contribute in certain degree to material properties of most living human
    tissues, it is obvious that any advanced accelerated tissue maturation technology
    must deal predominantly with enhancement of synthesis, deposition, assembly, cross-linking
    and intermolecular interactions of extracellular matrix molecules especially in
    case of organs consisting of dense connective tissues. However, stromal elements
    of human parenchyme organs such as kidney and liver also determine a substantial
    part of organ material properties. Collagen and elastin are two of the most essential
    structural extracellular matrix proteins in the human body that determine material
    properties of dense connective tissues as well as connective tissue stromal elements
    of parenchyme organs. Thus, accelerated tissue maturation in essence is about
    enhancing collagen and elastin deposition. In the absence of a solid scaffold,
    biofabricated 3D macrotissue constructs must undergo a rapid process of tissue
    maturation or fluid–solid transition in order to maintain their shape, composition
    and integrity. Traditional relatively slow physical, chemical and genetic approaches
    for tissue maturation — typical for biodegradable solid scaffold-based tissue
    engineering — is not well suited for requirements of rapid tissue maturation in
    a scaffold-free minitissue self-assembly based approach. New innovative approaches
    must be explored. Rapid polymerization of photo-sensitive or stimuli-sensitive
    polymers is probably the most logical option [57], but increased hydrogel stiffness
    can interfere with the tissue fusion process [58]. Designing hybrid bioprinter-processible
    tissue spheroids with rigid internal microscaffolds, or using biodegradable macroporous
    microcarriers [59] in combination with exploring “jamming effect” [60] or rapid
    transition from fluid state (spheroids'' suspension) to solid state (spheroids''
    jamming) as a function of spheroid packing density, could be potentially fruitful
    approaches. Although these two approaches conceptually can rapidly enhance material
    properties of tissue constructs, they represent a compromise between solid scaffold-based
    and microtissue-based approaches and do not fit well to the definition of true
    biological process-based accelerated tissue maturation. The development of irrigation
    dripping tripled perfusion bioreactor with temporal non-biodegradable removable
    porous tubes (Fig. 8) can also help to maintain fragile tissue constructs and
    “buy” time necessary for post-processing tissue fusion, remodeling and maturation,
    and also can be used for delivery of “maturogens” [4]. Another interesting approach
    is based on using so-called ‘sacrificial’ hydrogels. The removal of hyaluronan
    by hyaluronidase and sequential tissue condensation is a critical step in embryonic
    chondrogenesis [61]. It has been shown that removal of hyaluronic acid by hyauronidase
    enhances material properties of embryonic heart cushion tissue explants [35].
    The recently discovered, strong enhancing effect of “molecular crowding” or “excluding
    volume effect” on collagen deposition [16], [17] opens a very promising approach
    for accelerated tissue maturation. The recruitment of circulated soluble forms
    of extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin and collagen type 1 can
    also be employed as an effective rapid method of accelerated tissue maturation.
    Soluble variants of ECM molecules could directly contribute to accelerated extracellular
    matrix assembly and deposition. For example, it has been shown that the addition
    of soluble fibronectin and collagen type 1 increases tissue cohesion [62], [63],
    [64]. Finally, emerging methods of nanoassembly and self-assembly of extracellular
    matrix molecules are another possible approaches [65]. Thus, development of effective
    “maturogenic cocktails” and innovative technologies of rapid tissue maturation
    including methods of rapid self-assembly of extracellular matrices is extremely
    challenging, but feasible and important goals. Download : Download full-size image

    microporous non-biodegradable tube. 8. Conclusions and perspectives The emerging
    microtissue-based approach emphasizes the increasing recognition of the value
    of fundamental developmental biology expertise in tissue engineering, which is
    extending far beyond the already generally accepted fundamental role of research
    in stem cell biology and regenerative biology in advancing tissue engineering.
    Thus, it is safe to state that the ongoing integration of developmental biology
    and tissue engineering is already a work in progress. However, it will be also
    fundamentally wrong to assume that microtissue-based approaches do not have any
    technological challenges. It is obvious that large-scale biofabrication of tissue
    spheroids; development of continuous and digital industrial bioprinters; robotic
    bioprinting of 3D macrotissues and living organ constructs using microtissues;
    bioengineering of a perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree “built-in” these
    3D macrotissue constructs; development of microfluidic-inspired irrigation dripping
    tripled perfusion bioreactor with removable non-biodegradable porous tubes and
    accelerated tissue maturation technologies are serious technological challenges
    that need to be systematically addressed in order to facilitate successful development
    of a microtissue-based approach. The minitissue-based approach also demands synthesis
    of more sophisticated soft natural-like biomaterials and extracellular matrices
    such as bioprocessible and biomimetic stimuli-sensitive functional hydrogels [4].
    The most attractive feature of the microtissue-based approach is that it is suitable
    for industrial scale robotic and automated biofabrication of human tissue and
    organs. The rapidly evolving microtissue-based biomimetic approach employing developmental
    biology-inspired principles of directed tissue self-assembly is a potentially
    transforming and superior technology and, thus, represents an emerging paradigm
    which, if successfully developed, can dramatically enhance our technological arsenal
    and significantly advance the tissue engineering field. Finally, the fact that
    growing number of research groups are employing solid scaffold-free microtissue-based
    approach provides certain optimism for further exploring and development of this
    new direction in tissue engineering [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]. Acknowledgment

    in India 1. Introduction Modern day farming demands increased production of food
    to accommodate the large global population. Towards this goal, new technologies
    and solutions (Chen et al., 2015, Misra et al., 2015, Goumopoulos et al., 2014,
    Amaral et al., 2014, Ngo et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2014,
    Qu et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2013, Riquelme et al., 2009, Garcia-Sanchez et
    al., 2011, Camilli et al., 2007) are being applied in this domain to provide an
    optimal alternative to gather and process information (Behzadan et al., 2014,
    Dhurandher et al., 2014) to enhance productivity. Moreover, the alarming climate
    change and scarcity of water (Postel, 1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000,
    Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts, 2010, Mueller et al., 2012) demand new and
    improved methods for modern agricultural fields. Consequently, the need for automation
    and intelligent decision making is becoming more important to accomplish this
    mission (ur Rehman et al., 2014, Suprem et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Hart
    and Martinez, 2006). In this regard, technologies such as ubiquitous computing
    (Burrell et al., 2004), wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks (Diallo et al., 2015,
    Srbinovska et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013, Karim et al., 2013, Zhang et al.,
    2013, Krishna et al., 2012, Zhang and Zhang, 2012, Misra et al., 2011, Mirabella
    and Brischetto, 2011, Lloret et al., 2011, Garcia et al., 2010, Bri et al., 2009,
    Lloret et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2006), Radio Frequency Identifier
    (RFID) (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011), cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Misra
    et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2012), Internet of Things (IoT) (Atzori et al., 2010,
    Gubbi et al., 2013), satellite monitoring (Moghaddam et al., 2010), remote sensing
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013), context-aware
    computing (Moghaddam et al., 2010) are becoming increasingly popular. 1.1. Motivation
    Among all these technologies, the agriculture domain is mostly explored concerning
    the application of WSNs in improving the traditional methods of farming (ur Rehman
    et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz
    et al., 2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004, Yick et al., 2008, Ruiz-Garcia et
    al., 2009). The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has enabled
    the creation of small and cheap sensors. The ubiquitous nature of operation, together
    with self-organized small sized nodes, scalable and cost-effective technology,
    enables the WSNs as a potential tool towards the goal of automation in agriculture.
    In this regard, precision agriculture (Chen et al., 2015, Cambra et al., 2015,
    Barcelo-Ordinas et al., 2013, Baseca et al., 2013, Díaz et al., 2011, López et
    al., 2011, Park et al., 2011, Matese et al., 2009), automated irrigation scheduling
    (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Reche et al., 2015, Greenwood et al., 2010, Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010), optimization of plant growth (Hwang et
    al., 2010), farmland monitoring (Corke et al., 2010, Voulodimos et al., 2010),
    greenhouse gases monitoring (Malaver et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2013, Mao et al.,
    2012), agricultural production process management (Díaz et al., 2011, Dong et
    al., 2013), and security in crops (Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2011), are a few potential
    applications. However, WSNs have few limitations (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Yick
    et al., 2008) such as low battery power, limited computation capability and small
    memory of the sensor nodes. These limitations invite challenges in the design
    of WSN applications in agriculture. In agriculture, most of the WSN-based applications
    are targeted for various applications. For example, WSNs for environmental condition
    monitoring with information of soil nutrients is applied for predicting crop health
    and production quality over time. Irrigation scheduling is predicted with WSNs
    by monitoring the soil moisture and weather conditions. Being scalable, the performance
    of an existing WSN-based application can be improved to monitor more parameters
    by only including additional sensor nodes to the existing architecture. The issues
    present in such applications are the determination of optimal deployment strategy,
    measurement interval, energy-efficient medium access, and routing protocols. For
    example, a sparse deployment of nodes with a long data collection interval is
    helpful for enhancing the lifetime of a network. However, challenges may emerge
    from the choice of the deployment region. As an example, if the field area is
    separated by obstructions then it will lead to attenuation of signal, thereby
    affecting the inter-node communication. In the Indian scenario, the WSN-based
    farming solutions need to be of very low cost to be affordable by end users. However,
    with the increasing population, the demand of food-grain is also rising. Recent
    reports warns that the growth in food grain production is less than the growth
    in population (Shanwad et al., 2004). Also, India is one of the largest exporters
    of food grains, and thus, researchers (Shanwad et al., 2004, Mondal and Basu,
    2009) demand to boost production by incorporating advanced technologies. Consequently,
    new and modern technologies are being considered in many agricultural applications
    to achieve the target (Mondal et al., 2004). The current state of development
    in the Indian scenario comprises of technologies such as WSNs, General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing, and Geographical
    Information System (GIS). 1.2. Contributions In this paper, we surveyed the variants
    of WSNs and their potential for the advancement of various agricultural application
    development. We highlight the main agricultural and farming applications, and
    discuss the applicability of WSNs towards improved performance and productivity.
    We also classify the network architecture, node architecture, and communication
    technology standards used in agricultural applications. The real-world wireless
    sensor nodes and various sensors such as soil, environment, pH, and plant-health
    are also listed in this paper. In Section 5, we study and review the existing
    WSN deployments both in the global as well as the Indian scenarios. In summary,
    the contributions of this paper are listed as follows. • We study the current
    state-of-the-art in WSNs and their applicability in agricultural and farming applications.
    • The existing WSNs are analyzed with respect to communication and networking
    technologies, standards, and hardware. • We analyze the prospects and problems
    of the existing agricultural applications with detailed case studies for global
    as well as the Indian scenarios. • Finally, we present the futuristic applications
    highlighting the factors for improvements for the existing scenarios. 1.3. Paper
    organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    the basics of WSNs, its requirements, potentials and different possible application
    in the agriculture domain. Design of a wireless sensor network for agricultural
    application is discussed in Section 3. The technologies and standards used in
    agricultural applications are analyzed in Section 4. We further discuss about
    the currently existing state-of-the-art and real-world applications in Section
    5, and analyze the prospects and problems of the existing solutions. In Section
    6, we provide few future direction of work pointing out the factors for improvement.
    Finally, the paper concludes in Section 7. 2. Wireless sensor networks and its
    potential for agricultural applications In this section, we discuss two widely
    used variants of WSNs—Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSN) and Wireless
    Underground Sensor Networks (WUSN), specifically used in agricultural applications.
    2.1. Terrestrial wireless sensor networks WSNs are a network of battery-powered
    sensors inter-connected through wireless medium and are typically deployed to
    serve a specific application purpose (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al.,
    2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the
    ground surface. The advancements in MEMS technology has enabled the creation of
    smart, small sized, although low cost sensors. These powerful sensors empower
    a sensor node or mote to accurately collect the surrounding data. Based on the
    sensed information, these nodes then network among themselves to perform the application
    requirements. For example, consider a precision agriculture environment where
    WSNs are deployed throughout the field to automate the irrigation system. All
    these sensors determine the moisture content of the soil, and further, collaboratively
    decide the time and duration of irrigation scheduling on that field. Then, using
    the same network, the decision is conveyed to the sensor node attached to a water
    pump. Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed one such automated irrigation system using
    a WSN and GPRS module. Fig. 1 depicts a typical wireless sensor network deployed
    on field for agricultural applications. The field consists of sensor nodes powered
    with application specific on-board sensors. The nodes in the on-field sensor network
    communicate among themselves using radio-frequency (RF) links of industrial, scientific
    and medical (ISM) radio bands (such as 902–928 MHz and 2.4–2.5 GHz). Typically,
    a gateway node is also deployed along with the sensor nodes to enable a connection
    between the sensor network and the outer world. Thus, the gateway node is powered
    with both RF and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or GPRS. A remote
    user can monitor the state of the field, and control the on-field sensors and
    actuator devices. For example, a user can switch on/off a pump/valve when the
    water level applied to the field reaches some predefined threshold value. Users
    carrying mobile phone can also remotely monitor and control the on-field sensors.
    The mobile user is connected via GPRS or even through Short Message Service (SMS).
    Periodic information update from the sensors, and on-demand system control for
    both type of users can also be designed. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)

    Another variant of the WSNs is its underground counterpart—Wireless Underground
    Sensor Networks (WUSNs) (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Vuran and Akyildiz, 2008).
    In this version, the wireless sensors are planted inside soil. In this setting,
    higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation, and comparatively lower frequencies
    are able to penetrate through the soil (Silva and Vuran, 2010, Yu et al., 2013).
    Thus, communication radius gets limited and the network requires higher number
    of nodes to cover a large area. The application of wired sensors increases the
    network coverage by requiring relatively smaller number of sensors. However, in
    this design, the sensors and the wires may be vulnerable to farming activities.
    A typical agricultural application based on underground sensor networks is shown
    in Fig. 2. Unlike the TWSN-based applications shown in Fig. 1, in this figure,
    the sensor nodes are buried inside soil. One gateway node is also deployed to
    transmit the information collected by the underground sensor nodes to the surface
    sink placed over the ground. Thereafter, the information can be transmitted over
    the Internet to store in remote databases, and can be used for notifying a cell
    phone carrying user. However, due to comparatively shorter communication distance,
    more number of nodes are required to be deployed for use in WUSNs. Download :

    2.3. Differences between TWSNs and WUSNs We highlight the specific differences
    between the TWSNs and WUSNs in Table 1. Table 1. Differences between terrestrial
    and underground WSNs. Feature TWSNs WUSNs Deployment Placed over ground Buried
    under-ground Depth Anywhere over ground Topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (>30 cm)a
    Communication range ≈100 m ≈0.1–10 m Communication frequency Higher (868/915 MHz,
    2.4 GHz) Lower (433 MHz, 8–300 kHz) Antenna size Smaller Larger Energy consumption
    Lower Higher Cost Lower Higher a References Martinez et al., 2004, Vuran and Silva,
    2009 reported a glacier monitoring network where underground communications over
    30 m distance were possible. Further, using higher transmission power, 80 m distance
    under ice were also covered. 2.4. Usefulness of WSNs In the following, we highlight
    the salient features of WSNs that have enabled themselves as a potential tool
    for automation in the agricultural domain. (i) Intelligent decision making capability:
    WSNs are multi-hop in nature (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al., 2002b,
    Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In a large area, this feature enhances the energy-efficiency
    of the overall network, and hence, the network lifetime increases. Using this
    feature, multiple sensor nodes collaborate among themselves, and collectively
    take the final decision (Kulkarni et al., 2011, Bhattacharjee et al., 2012, Wu
    et al., 2012, Yao et al., 2013). (ii) Dynamic topology configuration: To conserve
    the in-node battery power, a sensor node keeps itself in the ‘sleep mode’ most
    of the time. Using topology management techniques (Ren and Meng, 2009, Chu and
    Sethu, 2012, Li et al., 2013), the sensor nodes can collaboratively take these
    decisions. To maximize the network lifetime, the network topology is configured
    such that the minimum number of nodes remain in the active mode. (iii) Fault-tolerance:
    One common challenge in deploying the WSNs is that the sensor nodes are fault-prone
    (Younis et al., 2014). Under such circumstances, unplanned deployment of nodes
    may lead to network partitioning, and in turn, the overall performance of the
    network is affected. However, in countermeasure, the sensor nodes can ‘self-organize’
    by dynamically configuring the network topology (Misra et al., 2011). (iv) Context-awareness:
    Based on the sensed information about the physical and environmental parameters,
    the sensor nodes gain knowledge about the surrounding context. The decisions that
    the sensor nodes take thereafter are context-aware (Vijay et al., 2011). (v) Scalability:
    Generally, the WSN protocols are designed to be implemented in any network irrespective
    of its size and node count. This feature undoubtedly widens the potential of WSNs
    for numerous applications. (vi) Node heterogeneity: WSNs are often assumed to
    be comprised of homogeneous sensor attached devices (Misra et al., 2015, Li and
    Hou, 2005, Ren and Meng, 2009). However, in many realistic scenarios, the devices
    are heterogeneous in respect of processing and computation power, memory, sensing
    capability, transceiver unit, and movement capability. (vii) Tolerance against
    communication failures in harsh environmental conditions: Due to the wide range
    of applications in open agricultural environments, WSNs suffer the effects of
    harsh environmental conditions (Misra et al., 2014). The WSN protocol stack includes
    techniques to withstand the effect of communication failures in the network arising
    due to environmental effects. (viii) Autonomous operating mode: An important feature
    of WSNs is their autonomous operating mode (Misra and Jain, 2011) and adaptiveness
    (Nicopolitidis et al., 2011). In agricultural applications, this feature certainly
    plays an important role, and enables an easy as well as advanced mode of operation.
    (ix) Information security: The WSNs carry raw information about on-field parameters.
    To ensure the security of sensed information, WSNs provides access control mechanisms
    (Misra and Vaish, 2011) and anomaly detection (Karapistoli et al., 2013) to restrict
    unauthenticated users. 2.5. Potential applications We list the possible agricultural
    and farming applications which can be implemented using WSNs. • Irrigation management
    system: Modern day agriculture requires an improved irrigation management system
    to optimize the water usage in farming (Adamala et al., 2014, Greenwood et al.,
    2010). The alarming reduction of ground water level is another motivation for
    the requirement of an advanced system. In this context, micro-irrigation techniques
    are cost-effective and water-usage efficient (Raina et al., 1998, Westarp et al.,
    2004). However, micro-irrigation efficiency can be further improved based on the
    environmental and soil information. In this regard, WSNs are applied as the coordinating
    technology (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Lorite et al., 2013,
    Moghaddam et al., 2010). • Farming systems monitoring: Currently, various improved
    systems and devices are used in farming. In this regard, an improved system to
    manage these devices eases the overall operation, and enable automation in faming
    (Kim et al., 2014). Also, such remote monitoring systems help towards enabling
    improved management in large agricultural fields. Further, with the input of additional
    information such as satellite images and weather forecasts, the system performance
    can be improved. • Pest and disease control: Controlled usage of pesticides and
    fertilizers helps increasing the crop quality as well as minimizing the farming
    cost. However, for controlling the usage of pesticides, we need to monitor the
    probability and occurrence of pests in crops. To predict this, we also need the
    surrounding climate information (Matese et al., 2009, Bhave et al., 2013) such
    as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A WSN can autonomously monitor and predict
    these events over a field of interest (Bhargava et al., 2014). • Controlled use
    of fertilizers: Plant growth and crop quality directly depend on the use of fertilizers.
    However, optimal supply of fertilizers to proper places in fields is a challenging
    task. The use of fertilizers for farming may be controlled by monitoring the variation
    in soil nutritions such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), and pH.
    Consequently, soil nutrition balance may also be achieved, and hence, crop production
    quality is also maintained. Gonçalves et al. (2015) studied the effectiveness
    of mobile nodes to improve agricultural productivity in a smart system with Precision
    Sprays. • Cattle movement monitoring: A herd of cattle grazing a field can be
    monitored using WSN technology or Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) (Voulodimos
    et al., 2010, Kwong et al., 2012). Thus, real-time monitoring of any cattle is
    also achieved. This technology can be implemented further to monitor whether any
    cattle is moving near the vegetation fields or not. • Ground water quality monitoring:
    The increased use of fertilizers and pesticides lead to decrease in the quality
    of ground water. Placing sensor nodes empowered with wireless communication help
    in monitoring the water quality (Lin et al., 2008, Zia et al., 2013). • Greenhouse
    gases monitoring: Greenhouse gases and agriculture are closely related to each
    other. Greenhouse gases are responsible for increasing the climate temperature,
    and thus, has direct impact on agriculture. On the other hand, greenhouse gas
    emission comes from various agricultural sources. Malaver et al. (2015) presents
    the development of a system of solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and
    WSN to monitor greenhouse gases – CH4 and CO2. • Asset tracking: Wireless technology
    enabled farming equipments attract the possibility of remote tracking (Misra and
    Singh, 2012) of these assets. A farmer can track the position of the farming vehicles
    and irrigation systems from his home. • Remote control and diagnosis: With the
    advent of internet of things, remote control and diagnosis of farm equipments
    such as pumps, lights, heaters, valves in machinery are also possible (Fukatsu
    et al., 2011, Coates et al., 2013). 3. Design of a wireless sensor network for
    agricultural applications 3.1. Network architecture for agriculture applications
    In this section, we discuss the network architecture considered in various agricultural
    applications. We classify the architectures in various categories and highlight
    the potential agricultural applications suitable for each one. Fig. 3 provides
    a visual depiction of the architectures classified with respect to different parameters.

    Fig. 3. Classification of network architectures with respect to different parameters.
    Based on the movement of the networked devices and nodes, we classify the existing
    architectures in the following categories: • Stationary architecture: In the stationary
    architecture, the sensor nodes are deployed at a fixed position, and during the
    application duration, they do not change their position. Typically, applications
    such as irrigation management system, ground water quality monitoring, and controlling
    the use of fertilizers require stationary architectures. In such applications
    with TWSNs, the data logger (data collector) sensor nodes are typically placed
    over the field. However, in WUSNs, the data collector sensor nodes are placed
    under-ground. Also, as shown in Fig. 2, aggregator nodes may be placed under-ground
    to collect all the data of the underground sensors and communicate with the outside
    TWSNs. • Mobile architecture: Mobile architectures comprise of devices which change
    their position with time. An example of applications based on such architecture
    will be an autonomous network of tractors and cell phone carrying farmers serving
    the purpose of ubiquitous farming operations. • Hybrid architecture: In the hybrid
    architecture, both stationary and mobile nodes are present. For example, this
    type of architecture is applicable to farming applications consisting of stationary
    field sensors, mobile farming equipments, cell phones carrying users, and moving
    cattle. Based on the types of sensor nodes and associated devices, the existing
    architecture used in agriculture are classified as follows: • Homogeneous architecture:
    As the name suggests, homogeneous architecture comprises of sensor equipped devices
    of similar potential. This type of framework is typically used in applications
    based on the unplanned deployments. In such circumstances, the network is deployed
    mainly for in situ monitoring of the desired agricultural parameters. However,
    this type of architecture lacks variety in terms of communication hardware. Consequently,
    the schemes and communication protocols are designed keeping this limitation in
    mind. One example application of this type of architecture is agricultural data
    collection application on the use of pesticides and changing quantity of soil
    nutrients. • Heterogeneous architecture: In this type of architecture, various
    types of sensor nodes, and devices are present. These devices vary in terms of
    computation power, memory, sensing capability, and transceiver units. For example,
    in any irrigation management application, the on-field sensor nodes communicate
    their sensed information to a master or sink node, which again transfer the information
    to remote user. In this case, the sink node is capable of communicating in multiple
    modes—RF and GSM. Another possible application may be the farming systems monitoring
    and agricultural asset tracking. In this application, multiple heterogeneous devices
    are included with on-field sensors. The application model shown in Fig. 1 depicts
    a heterogeneous architecture. In Fig. 1, the field sensor and gateway nodes are
    of different configurations. The architectures are classified into various categories
    based on the hierarchy. • Single-tier architecture: This type of architecture
    is most common among the agricultural applications, specifically small-scale ones.
    In this type of architecture, the on-field devices and sensor nodes directly communicate
    their data to a sink node placed near the application area. This type of architecture
    is also referred to as the single clustered architecture. • Multi-tier architecture:
    In a multi-tier architecture, there are multiple levels in the overall application
    hierarchy. The on-field sensor nodes remain in the lower level of hierarchy, and
    form the basic clusters. Thereafter, the next levels of hierarchy include multiple
    clusters to reach the gateway nodes. Typically, multi-tier architectures consist
    of heterogeneous nodes. Fig. 4 shows a multi-tier architecture with three levels
    of gateways. The basic unit of the network is formed by a cluster comprised of
    sensor nodes and a cluster head, referred to as the 3rd tier gateway in the figure.
    These gateways again form a cluster with the 2nd tier gateways as the cluster
    head, and thus, the hierarchy is followed iteratively until the remote sink is
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (271KB) Download : Download full-size

    of sensor nodes 3.2.1. Embedded multi-chip sensor nodes The components of a typical
    multi-chip sensor node are shown in Fig. 5(a). Typically, a sensor node consists
    of an application-specific sensor array with a transceiver unit for communication.
    A processor or micro-controller unit is used as the “brain” of the node. Optionally,
    a sensor board includes memory units to store data. Depending on the application
    demand, the architecture of the sensor nodes varies to meet the demands. For example,
    the processing power and on-board memory size are increased to meet the requirements
    of more intense or intelligent processing. Download : Download high-res image
    (255KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. System components: embedded
    multi-chip vs system-on-chip sensor nodes. In this respect, another important
    technology is System-in-Package (SiP), which is defined as any combination of
    multiple chips including passive components (such as resistors and capacitors)
    mounted together keeping provision to attach external components later. SiP reduces
    the product cost with optimized size and performance. Thus, the SiP technology
    has potential for applications in agricultural scenarios. SiP based agricultural
    systems can be applied in different applications simply by attaching different
    sensors with the main package. In the following, we discuss the associated factors
    in the selection of the components of a sensor node as per the requirement of
    agricultural applications. • Processor: The computation power of the sensor node
    solely depends on the choice of the processing unit. A micro-controller provides
    few advantages such as low cost, flexibility to communicate with other nodes,
    ease of programming, and low power consumption over the traditional processors.
    Mostly, these micro-controllers work on 3.5–5 V. However, power consumption is
    one of the most important factors in sensor nodes. Considering this fact, micro-controllers
    are preferred over general purpose processors. • Transceiver: Transmission and
    reception are the two major reasons of energy consumption in sensor nodes. In
    agricultural applications, the network planner chooses the deployment to ensure
    optimal power consumption of the sensor nodes. • Memory: The sensor nodes have
    two types of on-board memory—memory associated with processor and external memory.
    Depending on the application requirement, sensor nodes need to store historical
    data for intelligent decision making. In this regard, flash memories are used
    for additional storage. • Power: It is also an important factor for selecting
    the sensor nodes, as the battery power of the sensor nodes is limited. In many
    agricultural applications, the nodes possess alternate energy sources such as
    solar power. However, solar power is available during the day time only, and at
    other times, the nodes rely on battery power. Also, frequent change of battery
    increases the cost of maintenance. Thus, we need energy-efficient algorithms such
    that the energy consumption of the sensor nodes are reduced. • Cost: One very
    important selection factor of the sensor nodes is the total hardware cost. A low
    cost application design is always preferred for any application level, and consequently,
    it is the most important issue in terms of applications targeting the low and
    middle income country (LMIC) markets. 3.2.2. System on Chip (SoC) sensor nodes
    The System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, on the other hand, follows more application
    specific design targeting minimization of the power requirements and design cost.
    SoC provides an integration of multiple programmable processor cores, co-processors,
    hardware accelerators, memory units, input/output units, and custom blocks. Fig.
    5(b) shows the components of a typical SoC based sensor node. The envisioned applications
    for SoC is mainly in designing Network on Chips (NoCs) (Koch et al., 2006), systems
    for multimedia and streaming applications (Karim et al., 2003) which are computationally
    intensive. Currently, in agricultural applications, the use of SoCs are very rare.
    However, the advent of SoC has a lot of potential for the agriculture and farming
    domain. Firstly, the use of SoCs based sensor nodes instead of current day embedded
    multi-chip sensor nodes will increase the computation power, and decrease the
    energy-consumption. Also, the size of the nodes will be less and thereby, portability
    of the overall system increases. Compared to multiple silicon dies in SiP, SoC
    is single die based, and thus, SoCs result in lesser size, but, higher cost. Table
    2 briefly lists the differences between the embedded multi-chip nodes and SoCs.

    we discuss the details of the wireless communication technologies, and the standards
    used in various agricultural applications. Also, we study the different wireless
    sensor nodes available in the market for use in these applications. 4.1. Wireless
    communication • ZigBee: (ZigBee Specifications,, Baronti et al., 2007, Guo et
    al., 2012); technology defines the network and application layer protocols based
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006)
    physical and MAC layer definitions required for designing a wireless personal
    area network (WPAN) using low power radio-enabled devices. Being energy-efficient,
    low cost, and reliable, the ZigBee technology is preferred for WSN-based applications
    in the agricultural and farming domains. ZigBee also supports short-distance (10–20
    m) data communication over multi-tier, decentralized, ad-hoc and mesh networks.
    The ZigBee-enabled devices have a low-duty cycle, and thus, are suitable for agricultural
    applications such as irrigation management, pesticide and fertilizer control,
    water quality management, where periodic information update is required. However,
    ZigBee applications yield low data rates of only 20–40 kbps and 250 kbps at 868/915
    MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies of ISM band, respectively. Typically, this standard
    requires low specification hardware (such as microprocessor with 50–60 kb memory)
    and includes security encryption techniques. • WiFi: WiFi is a wireless local
    area network (WLAN) standard for information exchange or connecting to the Internet
    wirelessly based on the IEEE 802.11 standards family (IEEE 802.11, 802.11a/b/g/n)
    (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2005, IEEE Standard for Information
    technology, 2012a). Currently, it is the most widely used wireless technology
    found in devices ranging from smart phones and tablets to desktops and laptops.
    WiFi provides a decent communication range in the order of 20 m (indoor) to 100
    m (outdoor) with data transmission rate in the order of 2–54 Mbps at 2.4 GHz frequency
    of ISM band. In agricultural applications, WiFi broadens the use of heterogeneous
    architectures connecting multiple type of devices over an ad-hoc network. • Bluetooth:
    Bluetooth (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2012b, Bluetooth Technology
    Special Interest Group,), which is based on the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, is a low
    power, low cost wireless technology used for communication between portable devices
    and desktops over a short range (8–10 m). The Bluetooth standard defines a personal
    area network (PAN) communication using the 2.4 GHz frequency of the ISM band.
    The data rate achieved in various versions of the Bluetooth ranges from 1 to 24
    Mbps. The advantages of this technology are its ubiquitous nature, and therefore,
    it is suitable for use in multi-tier agricultural applications. The ultra low
    power, low cost version of this standard is named as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    (Xhafa and Ho, 2013, Xhafa and Ho, 2015, Linde and Tucker, 2013), which was initially
    introduced by Nokia in 2006 as Wibree (Nokia, 2006). However, in 2010, BLE was
    merged with main Bluetooth standard version 4.0. BLE also uses the 2.4 GHz ISM
    frequency band with adaptive frequency hopping to reduce interference. Also, BLE
    includes 24 bit CRC and AES 128 bit encryption technique on all packets to guarantee
    robustness and authentication. BLE topology supports one-to-one as well as one-to-many
    connections between devices. • GPRS/3G/4G: GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
    is a packet data service for GSM based cellular phones. A data rate of 50–100
    kbps is achieved in the 2G systems. However, in GPRS, throughput and delay are
    variable, and they depend on the number of other users sharing the same resource.
    Although the biggest advantage that GPRS brings is in relieving the range limitation
    of wireless devices. Any two devices can communicate provided they both are in
    the GSM service area. However, it is better suited for the periodic monitoring
    applications than to the real-time tracking-type applications. The advanced version
    of GPRS is Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), which offers increased
    data rate with no hardware/software changes in the GSM core networks. 3G (Goodman
    and Myers, 2005) and 4G (Parkvall et al., 2008) are the third and fourth generations
    of mobile communication technology. The corresponding data transfer rate achieved
    in these technologies are 200 kbps and 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps in 3G and 4G, respectively.
    • WiMAX: WiMAX is the acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access,
    a wireless communication standard referring to the inter-operable implementations
    of the IEEE 802.16 standards (IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks,
    2011) family. WiMAX is targeted to achieve 0.4–1 Gbps data rate on fixed stations,
    and the maximum transmission range using this technology is 50 km. The Mobile
    WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e standard) provides data rates in the order of 50–100 Mbps.
    Also, WiMAX is stated to be energy-efficient over the pre-4G Long-Term Evaluation
    (LTE) and Evolved High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) (Deruyck et al., 2010, Louta
    et al., 2014). The long range support together with high speed communication features
    place WiMAX as the best suitable technology for agricultural applications involving
    asset monitoring such as farming system monitoring, crop-area border monitoring,
    and real-time diagnostics such as remote controlling of water pumps, lights, gates,
    remote diagnosis of farming systems. In Table 3, we compare the different communication
    technologies with respect to various parameters. We also mention the suitable
    agricultural applications of each technology. Table 3. Comparison of different
    communication technologies. Parameter ZigBee WiFi Bluetooth GPRS/3G/4G WiMAX Standard

    sensor platforms for use in the agricultural domain (ur Rehman et al., 2014).
    In Table 4, we analyze the existing wireless sensor nodes by classifying them
    according to different features and parameters. Table 4. Comparison of the existing

    the various application specific sensors which empower the wireless sensing platforms.
    For better classification, we divide these sensors in three main categories—soil,
    environment, and plant related. 4.3.1. Soil related In Table 5, we compare the
    sensors along with different soil-related measurement parameters—suitable for
    different potential agricultural applications. Table 5. Comparison of different

    placement ensures intelligent and improved decision making. Table 6 lists the
    sensors specific to the measurement of environmental parameters. Table 6. Comparison

    part of modern farming applications. The potential applications include controlled
    use of fertilizer, crop quality monitoring, pest control, and cattle movement
    monitoring. The plant related agricultural sensors are listed in Table 7. Table

    real-world applications In Section 5.1, we discuss the different categories of
    agricultural applications in detail, and also, bring on the real-world counterpart
    of the same application deployment as a case study. These applications are designed
    with both the TWSNs and the WUSNs. Also, we mention the developments in the Indian
    scenarios in Section 5.2. Although, the number of such developments is very small
    compared to the global scenario. In Section 5.3, we analyze the challenges, problems,
    and prospects of the existing solutions both in the global as well as the Indian
    scenarios. 5.1. Global scenario 5.1.1. Irrigation management The recent years
    have witnessed an upsurge in the deployment of WSNs, specifically in the irrigation
    management applications (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2011, Kim et al.,
    2009, Kim et al., 2008, Moghaddam et al., 2010, Erdem et al., 2010, Kim and Evans,
    2009, Pierce and Elliott, 2008, Vellidis et al., 2008, Nemali and Iersel, 2006).
    This is mainly because of the importance of water in crop production (Postel,
    1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000, Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts,
    2010, Mueller et al., 2012). In the following, we survey two such deployments
    as case studies. Case Study—San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico:
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) described the development and deployment of an automated
    irrigation system comprising of a distributed WSN, a gateway, and remote server.
    The project was dedicated to implement a WSN system capable of reducing water
    use. The WSN consists of soil moisture and temperature sensors buried in ground
    for taking measurement in different depths. The gateway node has on-board facilities
    supporting both ZigBee (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006, Baronti
    et al., 2007, Guo et al., 2012) and GPRS communications. It is also empowered
    with intelligent decision making such as automated irrigation activation based
    on soil moisture and temperature values exceeding a certain predefined threshold
    value. The remote server is used for storing all the information, and displaying
    the information in a graphical user interface (GUI). The advantage of this application
    design is its real-time data analysis feature. The system components are explained
    in the following: • Wireless Sensor Units (WSUs): Each WSU, deployed on-field,
    has four different type of components—application specific sensors, processing
    unit, radio transceiver, and battery power. Table 8 lists the details of each
    of the components (sensors and actuator devices) used in reference (Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014). For energy saving, the micro-controller often remains in the sleep
    mode. A solar panel is attached with each of the WSUs to recharge their batteries.

    • Wireless Information Unit (WIU): The WIU acts as the master node, and collects
    information from the WSUs using the ZigBee technology. All the information received
    about soil moisture and temperature are compared with a predefined threshold values,
    and consequently, the pumps are activated for an estimated period. The received
    information and irrigation related data are saved in the attached solid state
    memory, and are transmitted to the remote server via GPRS using the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The pumps are driven by two electronic relays of 40-A,
    12 V DC. The WIU can be commanded to changed the irrigation scheduling from the
    remote server, and is also equipped with a button to perform manual irrigation.
    Four different irrigation actions (IAs) are considered—manual irrigation, predefined
    irrigation, and automated irrigation with soil moisture of at least one sensor
    dropping below threshold, and automated irrigation with soil temperature of at
    least one sensor exceeding past the threshold. • Remote web server: The server
    shows a specific GUI, which visualizes the data from each WSU, total water consumption,
    and IA type. The web application also enables the user with direct programming
    facility of the scheduled irrigation schemes, and changing the threshold values
    based on the crop type and season. Case Study—Smart Sensor Web: The Smart Sensor
    Web (SSW) system proposed by Moghaddam et al. (2010) introduces a new technology
    for smart sensor web system measuring the surface-to-depth soil moisture profile
    of on-field sensors. The University of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Gardens in
    Ann Arbor, Michigan was chosen as the deployment region of the on-field sensors.
    The in situ sensors were deployed to model the spatio-temporal variations in soil
    moisture serving the future goal of enabling satellite observation of soil moisture.
    To minimize the overall cost and energy conservation, the authors plan to sparsely
    sample the sensor data. The Sensor Web, is guided by the intelligence of a control
    system envisioned to determine an optimal sensor selection strategy to decide
    sensor configurations over time, and an estimation strategy based on the information
    of 3-dimensional soil moisture values. The problem of finding an optimal strategy
    and estimating a parameter are modelled using Partially Observed Markov Decision
    Process (POMDP) (Lovejoy, 1991). In a real deployment, multiple actuator nodes
    are placed with multiple sensors placed at different depths. One central coordinator
    node is deployed to schedule the data transmission events of the actuators. Upon
    receiving the readings from the in situ actuators, the central coordinator estimates
    the spatial variation of soil moisture. Then, the coordinator decides the time
    schedule of future measurements. In this manner, the coordinator node leverages
    the spatio-temporal correlation of soil moisture, and optimally estimates with
    reduced number of measurements. The system description is presented in the following.
    • Ripple 1 system: The on-field sensor nodes, deployed at fixed locations, are
    equipped with 3–5 soil moisture probes. Communication between the nodes is done
    using the ZigBee technology built on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The nodes are
    classified into three categories—coordinator, router, and end devices. The specific
    node level parameters and sensors are listed in Table 9. The sensor nodes are
    powered with on-board batteries, and solar panels are also installed to recharge
    them. The coordinate node is attached to the base station computer. Table 9. Deployment

    The 3G network card is installed on the base station. The server saves all the
    information, and any home/mobile user is able to visualize the information in
    real-time, thereby integrating the whole system from the in situ sensors to the
    remote user. Case Study—Alfalfa Crop Irrigation Cut-off System: Saha et al. (2011)
    presented a automatic irrigation cut-off system targeted for eliminating tail
    water drainage in alfalfa crop. The work is based on Yolo silt loam soil on the
    UC Davis campus, California, USA, where alfalfa is the largest water consuming
    crop. Earlier, the flood-irrigation method was used for this crop. However, the
    water runoff reduces the efficiency of this method. Motivated by this problem,
    Saha et al. designed a wireless sensor based system which provides the irrigation
    information from the tail-end of the field. The realization of the system is done
    by applying a water advance model to the field deployment of wetting-front sensors
    couple with cellular communication. The irrigator farmer receives a SMS notifying
    the time to shutdown the irrigation system. Fig. 6 depicts the application scenario
    showing the deployment. In the deployment area, 4 out of 48 alfalfa checks are
    selected for the experiment. Each check is of dimensions 220 m × 15 m with a slope
    of 0.01%. Wetting-front sensing system was placed at the tail-end of the field.

    field with vast area for irrigation. Case Study—AMI Turf Irrigation System (Aqua
    Management): This turf irrigation controller system designed by Aqua Management,
    Inc. is targeted for the turf irrigation industry to solve the problem of providing
    efficient water management solutions at an affordable price. It is a cloud-based
    control system, which considers various on-field parameters such as Evapotranspiration
    (ET), weather condition, water flow and leak. The application control can be accessed
    from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. The features of this system are cataloged
    in Table 10. The automated decision making framework relies on the following components
    – local weather value, local ET values from public/private systems, and soil moisture
    sensors. Alternatively, the AMI data logger (AMI LoggerTM) can also be used to
    automate irrigation. The AMI Q collects all data from the on-field sensors and
    flow meters, and upload the information to the cloud. Table 10. Features: AMI

    detection Can detect leak Alert notification Automatic Reaction to faults due
    to leak and weather related events Automatic shut down Overall, irrigation management
    is based on the actual volume of water, rather than time. Based on the weather
    condition, irrigation can be stopped or started. The water management facility
    includes reporting of various analytics such as water budgeting on a daily, weekly,
    monthly, or annual basis. 5.1.2. Vineyard monitoring Applying pervasive and mobile
    computing technologies in vineyard monitoring to increase the quality of production
    and reduce the production cost and the effect of crop related diseases. We review
    one of the existing works (Burrell et al., 2004) as a case study. Case Study—Vineyard
    Production Monitoring (Díaz et al., 2011): Díaz et al. (2011) presented a design
    of a precision agricultural system for vineyard production monitoring. The deployment
    of WSNs help in estimate the variability in agricultural parameters throughout
    the field. Initially, in the first phase, the authors divide the subject terrain
    into few different zones (zone A, B, C) based on geographic, weather, and soil
    maps. In the network planning phase, the most suitable architecture is chosen
    based on the application requirement. The subject area dimension was 600 m × 450
    m, and different sensors were placed in different zones. For example, the authors
    assumed that zone C has temperature, humidity, soil moisture, luminosity, and
    pH level sensors deployed. In zones A and B, the environmental temperature, humidity
    and temperature, and luminosity sensors were deployed, respectively. The sensor
    nodes are assumed to have an transmission range of 75–100 m. The nodes in different
    zones form a virtual tree structure among themselves, and the sensed information
    reaches the gateway following a multi-hop path. The detailed deployment parameters
    are presented in Table 11. Table 11. Deployment parameters: Díaz et al. (2011).

    in the design—sensor, actuator, redundant nodes, and a gateway. The sensors can
    only collect data samples, and information is routed to gateway. The actuator
    nodes have provision for driving irrigation systems. The actuators can also respond
    to the given commands about scheduling irrigation. The redundant nodes, as the
    name suggests, help in information routing, and imitate the functionalities of
    faulty nodes. The gateway acts as the bridge between the in situ network and the
    base station. Information routing is done to select the best neighbor node. The
    routing scheme can also be executed in an energy conserving manner, and in such
    a condition, the diagonally placed nodes are not selected for the next hop. 5.1.3.
    Precision farming Precision farming is targeted to generate greater productivity
    with reduced costs. Wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks are utilized in precision
    farming to gather field data which can then be analyzed to find the best farming
    conditions. Case Study—Video Sensing in Precision Agriculture (Cambra et al.,
    2015): Cambra et al. proposed video sensing for controlling fertilizer use in
    agricultural field. Their work is motivated by the objective of maintaining energy-efficiency
    with reduction of fertilizers in productions as defined Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) 2014/2020.1 In this work, the AR drones are utilized to capture the video
    of the field. Based on the video input, a system identifies and geopositions the
    weeds present in the field. Finally, the fertilizer sprayer system is actuated
    based on the processed localized information of weeds in fields. In Fig. 7, we
    depict the system overview showing the interaction between the AR drones, the
    central system, and the fertilizer sprays. The AR drones maps the field area in
    2D/3D drag and drop waypoint maps. Here, the monitored field area was 17 m by
    15 m. These drones form ad-hoc network among themselves and the central system.
    In this work, Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is applied to route
    the information from the field drones to the central system in real-time. Also,
    the drones and other devices are attached with on-board GPS, which enables updating
    the flight map and calculating the distance between the devices. Download : Download

    frames received from the flying drones are processed and geo-referenced in the
    central system. OpenCV2 based platform is used to recognize the weeds in the field.
    In the image processing framework, the authors consider Multilayer Perceptron
    learning algorithm (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008) with the green and brown color
    lines which are seen in maize crops. Finally, the locations of the weeds in the
    field are transmitted to the fertilizer sprayers, which precisely apply fertilizers
    to the weeds. Thus, using this framework, the overall production efficiency enhances
    while keeping the fertilizer use at lower levels. 5.2. Indian scenario 5.2.1.
    Water management Case Study—Project COMMON-Sense Net (Project Common Sense Net
    2.0,, Panchard et al., 2007): The COMMON-Sense Net project was a collaboration
    project with partners EPFL, Zurich (http://www.epfl.ch/) and the Centre for Electronic
    Design and Technology (CEDT) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) (http://www.cedt.iisc.ernet.in/).
    The goal of this project was to develop emerging technologies suitable for developing
    countries. The region of interest was chosen at Chennakeshavapura (CKPura) in
    the Tumkur district, Karnataka, India. To focus on the specific problems of the
    chosen region, the targeted goal was to predict and mitigate the effect of adverse
    environmental changes (Panchard, 2008). The actual deployment consists of 9 on-field
    and 3 backward nodes measuring soil moisture at two different depths of 150 cm
    and 30 cm. These nodes transmit their data to the base station every 15 min. The
    base station then transmits the data to the remote server over a GPRS link. In
    addition to soil moisture, environmental data such as ambient temperature and
    relative humidity, were also collected. The design of a water management system
    for deficit irrigation includes the following (Panchard et al., 2006, Prabhakar
    et al., 2007): • Calibration: First, the soil moisture probes are calibrated using
    the standard gravimetric method (Reynolds, 1970, Schmugge et al., 1980, Dobriyal
    et al., 2012, Lekshmi et al., 2014). In the next normal mode, calibration is continued
    using a feedback loop based on the difference in measured and predicted values.
    • Alert: Nodes are programmed to issue an alert whenever soil moisture reaches
    a certain value. The sensed data and historical climate data, together, help in
    predicting the change of rain in future. • Soil moisture prediction: Real-time
    prediction of soil moisture is done using a learning method over the predicted
    and measured data. • Water requirements assessment: The system is also able to
    estimate the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.

    at IIT Kharagpur, India: Recently, IIT Kharapur started working on development
    of low-cost irrigation management system targeted for India. The lab-scale deployment
    of sensor network was carried out inside IIT Kharagpur campus, a place in the
    Kangsabati basin. In this project, four Ko Pro wireless sensor nodes were deployed
    over an area of 1440 m2. Fig. 8 shows the real deployment in the lab-scale facility.
    Each on-field node embeds four EC-5 soil moisture sensors. In addition to the
    on-field nodes, another gateway node was placed in the vicinity of the field to
    receive all the on-field soil moisture data at an interval of 15 min. The gateway
    node is programmed to run Crossbow’s XServe network management operations, and
    provides web services for remote viewing of data and network health. The gateway
    node also estimates the irrigation requirement of the field, and sends a SMS to
    the farmer informing this. The system has provision to control the number and
    recipient of SMS. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download

    nodes in IIT Kharagpur lab facility. The different procedural components are described

    standard gravimetric method. • Irrigation requirements assessment: The on-field
    system calculates the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    This estimation also depends on the duration between the last SMS update and current
    time. • Update to farmer: Nodes are programmed to send SMS to the farmers with
    preprogrammed time and recipient phone number. The design parameters are listed

    Case Study—Vineyards Precision Farming: One of the widely cultivated crops in
    India is the grapes. Precision farming is applied in this field to reduce the
    production cost and reach a high turnover. Also, the use of precision farming
    is justified by the economic value of grapes. Precision farming in vineyards has
    to deal with three main issues—optimal water use, disease prediction, and controlled
    use of pesticides. In this regard, the soil and environment related parameters
    such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, leaf wetness, relative humidity are
    most important parameters for measurement. Soil moisture is the controlling factor
    for the crop production, size and quality of grapes. The quality of grapes and
    the wine produced from them depend on their size. The area of deployment, i.e.,
    the Sula vineyards, Nashik, India, is limited in terms of water resources. Another
    problem in grapes is the use of pesticides to control diseases such as Downey
    mildew, Powdery mildew, Anthracnose (NRCG, 2007). Consequently, the overall cost
    increases, and the crop quality degrades due to the use of harmful chemicals.
    However, there is another way to reduce the use of pesticides—by predicting the
    disease. For this purpose, it is needed to integrate the measurement of leaf surface
    wetness and duration with the existing system of sensors. Motivated by the above
    issues, Shah et al. (2009) designed a precision agriculture framework in the Sula
    vineyards at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. Initially, the lab-based small-scale
    setup was tested in a greenhouse at IIT Bombay, India with dimensions of 6 m   9
    m. On the other hand, the large-scale deployment at the Sula vineyards consists
    of wireless sensor nodes equipped with soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and leaf wetness sensors. Table 14 lists the various system parameters
    considered in this project. Based on the on-field sensor data, the Evapotranspiration
    (ET) and Infection Index were computed. Table 14. Deployment parameters: Sula

    5.2.3. Crop disease risk evaluation Crop diseases are the root causes of production
    and revenue losses. The prediction of crop disease, and taking countermeasures
    to help farmers ensure sustained revenue generation. Case Study—Sula vineyards
    (Das et al., 2009): Das et al. (2009) studied the forecasting of grapevine Downy
    Mildew disease (Francesca et al., 2006, Caffarra et al., 2012), one of the most
    common and important fungal diseases in grapes (Madden and Hughes, 1995, Rossi
    et al., 2010), by deploying a WSN powered with various agro-meteorological sensors.
    The Downy Mildew disease in grapes is caused by the Plasmapora Viticola virus,
    which is a weather-related disease. The prediction of such a disease benefits
    the grapevine industry tremendously—increased revenue with quality enriched food
    and beverage products. The deployed motes are equipped with ambient temperature,
    relative humidity, and leaf wetness duration (LWD) sensors. Two different existing
    models, i.e., the Logistic and Beta models, are adopted in the work (Das et al.,
    2009). The study was performed for over five months at the Sula Vineyards, Nashik,
    Maharashtra, India. Following the collected data, the “Infection Index” was computed
    in real-time using both the Logistic and Beta models. Case Study—AgriSense (Tripathy
    et al., 2013a, Tripathy et al., 2013b): The AgriSense distributed system comprises
    of wireless sensor nodes with environmental and soil-specific sensors – ambient
    temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness, and soil moisture. The actual test-bed
    was chosen as one semi-arid tropic region located at the Agriculture Research
    Institute (ARI) of the ANGR Agricultural University, Hyderabad. The target mission
    was to predict the Bud Necrosis Virus (BNV) disease of groundnut crop. Experiments
    were executed using different settings of protected and weather-based protection
    plots with different dates of sowing treatments on three different replicas. The
    on-field deployment comprises of five MICAz motes with 25 m communication range,
    transmitting at an interval of 15 min. These nodes communicate among themselves
    using the ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocol at the 2.4 GHz RF ISM band. One gateway
    node sends the collected data to a remote server using GPRS communication. The
    remote server converts the raw sensor data to a usable format and saves it in
    its database for displaying through the graphical user interface (GUI). Based
    on the data of soil and environmental parameters, various data mining models such
    as Expectation Maximization (EM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) classifier were
    used to predict the pest/disease dynamics. The schematic view of the real-time
    decision support system (DSS) is illustrated in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res

    real-time decision support system (DSS) used in AgriSense (Tripathy et al., 2013a,

    The existing solutions invent smarter applications for solving multiple challenges
    existing in the agricultural domain. We discuss the prospects of these application
    in the following. However, there remains scope to further improve the solutions.
    We list few points to improve the existing innovations. • Cost-effective solutions
    for LMICs are required: The existing research and development efforts are targeted
    at the reduction of hardware and software costs, while maximizing the system output.
    The overall system cost increases due to the use of foreign imported devices to
    build the systems. However, for applications in LMICs, we need to reduce the system
    cost further. Thus, the challenge exist in bringing down the cost further. • Scalability
    of the deployments need to be tested: For LMICs, we need planned and scaled-up
    deployment of such agricultural systems. In this way, the average system cost
    can be reduced down keeping the performance intact. Also, with increased scalability,
    we need to have design. For a large scale deployment, hierarchical architecture
    would perform better than the flat single-tier network architecture, as discussed
    in Section 3.1. For example, in Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010,
    the on-field WSN deployment in a specific area mostly follows the two-tier hierarchical
    network architecture with WSUs as end devices and WIUs as the gateway. This type
    of network architecture can be scaled up by replicating to multiple fields. In
    this setting, to increase the number of WSUs over a large deployment area, we
    have to place multiple WIU to provide connectivity to all the WSUs. • Fault tolerance:
    Fault tolerance is a necessary feature of wireless sensor networks for achieving
    precision agriculture. Different types of faults (Baljak et al., 2012) that may
    occur in a WSN based precision agriculture system are – node failure due to depleted
    battery or any other reason, sensor hardware faults generating erroneous value,
    faulty sensor calibration, communication failure. In the existing literature,
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) presented an irrigation management system which is fault
    tolerant to nodes (WSUs) and communication failure. In case of any fault, the
    system follows the default irrigation schedule. To reduce the chances of node
    failure due to energy depletion, (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah
    et al., 2009) have used solar powered nodes. Also, the topology management and
    data aggregation schemes should be fault tolerant in a large scale deployment.
    • Energy management and energy harvesting: Energy management is an important issue
    in any WSN-based system. System components and algorithms should be designed keeping
    this issue in mind. Alternatively, the potential energy harvesting solutions such
    as solar power (Everlast Simjee and Chou, 2008), wind power (AmbiMax Park and
    Chou, 2006), biomass, and vibration should also be considered while designing
    WSN based precision agriculture systems. Among the existing works, solar powered
    WSNs (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah et al., 2009) are already
    in use. Therefore, the future works have scope of working on these non-conventional
    resource based WSNs. • Simplification of the existing solutions are needed: The
    end-user of most of the targeted agricultural applications are the farmers. Thus,
    the designed platforms and solutions are envisioned to be simplified in terms
    of usability. In this regard, the human–computer interaction issues such as accessibility
    and usability are required to be taken care of. • The present works may further
    be improved for different climatic conditions, crop and soil types: Most of the
    existing developments does not takes care of the real-time climate parameters.
    However, to enable precision, integration of the environmental parameters are
    necessary. 6. Future work direction There are many potential applications of WSNs
    in the agriculture and farming area. The current state-of-the-art includes most
    works on irrigation management, vineyard production monitoring, and crop disease
    prediction. 6.1. Factors for improvement The factors associated with WSNs that
    need further attention in the future are listed as follows. • Cost: A low cost
    solution is always desirable for increasing the scope and outreach of the applications.
    • Autonomous operation: The future solutions should include the provision for
    autonomous operations surviving for long time. • Intelligence: An inherent intelligence,
    which will enable the futuristic solutions to react dynamically to multiple challenges
    – from conserving energy to real-time response. • Portability: For easy of application,
    portability of the system is essential. Recent advances in embedded systems, such
    as System in package (SiP) and System on Chip (SoC) technologies will help in
    this regard. • Low maintenance: It is essential to design a system which require
    minimum maintenance effort. This will certainly minimize the average cost in the
    long run. • Energy-efficiency: To ensure extended lifetime with autonomous operation,
    the solutions need to be more energy-efficient by incorporating intelligent algorithms.
    • Robust architecture: A robust and fault-tolerant architecture for the emerging
    applications is required to ensure sustained operation. • Ease of operation: Typically,
    the end users of these applications are non-technical persons. Therefore, these
    applications need to be simple and easy to use. • Interoperability: Interoperability
    between different components and different communication technologies will enhance
    the overall functionality of the system. In addition to the global challenges,
    there are specific problems in Indian scenarios with respect to the agricultural
    WSN systems. We list few India specific challenges in the following. • Cost: The
    high cost of the sensors and associated systems is the major deterrent for these
    applications in the LMICs. • Variable climate & soil: The most challenging part
    in designing a WSN-based system for agriculture for India is the different temperature
    and soil types throughout the country. The application parameters are required
    to be tuned such as to function properly at different locations. • Segmented land
    structure: Unlike the USA, India has partitioned farming land, a specific challenge
    which demands suitable deployment architecture for WSN-based agricultural applications
    like irrigation management. • Average farmer requirement: In India, the average
    land holding per farmer is also lower than global scenario. Due to this, smaller
    and personalized systems are in demand. • Overall plan: An overall planning, considering
    the segmented land structure and farmer requirement, is required for attaining
    success in bringing automation in agriculture and farming domain. 6.2. Futuristic
    applications In recent times, with the advent of the new technical concepts such
    as sensor-cloud technology, big-data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), new
    applications are envisioned. We briefly describe such concepts, and enlist a few
    potential futuristic applications in the following. • Sensor-cloud computing:
    sensor-cloud computing refers to the on-field WSN applications empowered with
    cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Alamri et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2014). This
    integrated framework benefits the WSNs with improved processing power and storage
    capacity. Furthermore, sensor-cloud improves the data management and access control
    while increasing the resource utilization. Few potential application for the agricultural
    domain are, – A cloud-enabled storage of spatial variation of soil and environmental
    profile with respect to different seasons is need to be developed. – Crop health
    monitoring and yield prediction using mobile sensor-cloud services. – Designing
    a sensor-cloud controlled smart irrigation system for large fields. – To design
    a sensor-cloud operated environment control system for off-season production of
    vegetables and flowers in greenhouse farming. • Big-data analytics: Big-data analytics
    techniques are applied to find meaningful insight from large volume of data with
    various data types (Kim et al., 2014, Nabrzyski et al., 2014). Big-data analytics
    based techniques are helpful for finding hidden correlations, unknown patterns,
    business trends, customer preferences, detecting crimes and disasters, etc. We
    list few big-data application for the agricultural domain as, – Building crop
    growth and disease management models based on farm data. – Designing a web-enabled
    analytics service for the farmers to provide improved information on agriculture.
    – Easy farming equipment control system for large-scale agriculture field. – Decision
    support service to improve crop productivity with optimal cost considering a large-scale
    contextual agricultural and climatic information. – Optimal policy determination
    based on data analytics for government and industries. • Internet of things: IoT
    extends the ubiquitous computing concepts with heterogeneous smart devices or
    ‘things’ integrated with interoperable communication technologies (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Gubbi et al., 2013, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013, Al-Fuqaha et al.,
    2015). The IoT paradigm defines ‘things’ which are capable of identifying, communicating
    and interacting with their surrounding. Empowered by these pillars, IoT provides
    flexible control mechanism for on-field parameters in real-time. Due to this,
    IoT is a potential solution for various agricultural applications. Few potential
    IoT-based agricultural applications are, – Cost-effective agricultural supply
    chain management using RFID tags. – Remote monitoring of animal movement in open
    pastures. – Automated pest counting and remote reporting in farms. – Remote control
    and scheduling of pesticide sprays at an user-defined rate and time. – Leak detection
    and remote water flow control in large-scale agricultural field water supply.
    7. Conclusion The inclusion of WSNs is envisioned to be useful for advancing the
    agricultural and farming industries by introducing new dimensions. In this survey,
    we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in WSN deployment for
    advanced agricultural applications. First, we introduced the variants of WSNs—the
    terrestrial WSNs and underground WSNs. Then, we highlighted various applications
    of WSNs, and their potential to solve various farming problems. The consecutive
    sections of this paper presented the network and node architectures of WSNs, the
    associated factors, and classification according to different applications. We
    review the various available wireless sensor nodes, and the different communication
    techniques followed by these nodes. Then, using case studies, we discussed the
    existing WSN deployments for different farming applications, globally and in India.
    Finally, we presented the prospects and problems associated with the existing
    applications. Finally, we listed several directions for future research with associated
    factors for improvement. The survey of the existing works directs us in concluding
    few remarks. The current state-of-the-art offers WSN-based solutions for irrigation
    management, crop disease prediction, vineyard precision farming mostly. Simplified,
    low cost, and scalable systems are in demand, specifically for the LMICs. At the
    same time, with the advent of modern technologies, there exist a lot of scope
    for innovating new and efficient systems. Specifically, low cost solution with
    features like autonomous operation, low maintenance is in demand. Overall, futuristic
    pre-planning is required for the success of these applications specifically to
    overcome the problems in global as well as LMICs. Acknowledgement This work is

    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    phenotyping (HTP) has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive field-based phenotyping.
    Autonomous, semi-autonomous, or manual platforms equipped with single or multiple
    sensors collect spatial and temporal data, resulting in massive amounts of data
    for analysis and storage. The enormous volume, variety, and velocity of HTP data
    generated by such platforms make it a ‘big data’ problem. Big data generated by
    these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived and retrieved for
    analysis. The analysis and interpretation of these large datasets is quite challenging.
    Sophisticated data collection, storage, and processing are becoming ubiquitous,
    and newer areas of application are emerging constantly. One such relatively new
    domain is plant stress analytics. ML algorithms are a very promising approach
    for faster, more efficient, and better data analytics. ML being inherently multidisciplinary
    draws inspiration and utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision
    theory, optimization, and visualization. Most current applications of ML tools
    in plant sciences have focused on using a limited set of ML tools (SVM, ANN).
    A good understanding of which, when, and how various ML tools can be applied will
    be very informative to the plant community to leverage these ML tools. Advances
    in automated and high-throughput imaging technologies have resulted in a deluge
    of high-resolution images and sensor data of plants. However, extracting patterns
    and features from this large corpus of data requires the use of machine learning
    (ML) tools to enable data assimilation and feature identification for stress phenotyping.
    Four stages of the decision cycle in plant stress phenotyping and plant breeding
    activities where different ML approaches can be deployed are (i) identification,
    (ii) classification, (iii) quantification, and (iv) prediction (ICQP). We provide
    here a comprehensive overview and user-friendly taxonomy of ML tools to enable
    the plant community to correctly and easily apply the appropriate ML tools and
    best-practice guidelines for various biotic and abiotic stress traits. Previous

    in Agriculture To meet the future demand of food, feed, fiber, and fuel, crop
    production must be doubled by 2050i Crop yields are limited inherently by plant
    stresses (biotic and abiotic), and plant breeders have protected yield from plant
    stress losses by incorporating resistance genes and developing more climatically-resilient
    cultivars. Plant breeders and researchers rely on plant phenotyping for accurate
    and precise trait collection and use of genetic tools to achieve their research
    goals. Plant phenotyping is defined as the application of methodologies and protocols
    to measure a specific trait, ranging from the cellular level to the whole plant
    or canopy level, related to plant structure and function [1]. Agriculture research
    programs phenotype large populations for several traits throughout the crop growth
    cycle. This challenge to phenotype multiple traits and large populations is exacerbated
    by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials.
    Until recently, traditional methods of phenotyping have not kept pace with the
    available high-throughput genotyping tools. The bottleneck in phenotyping has
    driven intense efforts by the scientific community of agriculture researchers
    and engineers to adapt newer technologies in field phenotyping. A classic example
    is high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), which has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive
    field-based phenotyping in plants for a large number of traits including physiological,
    biotic (includes living factors such as fungi, bacteria, virus, insects, parasites,
    and weeds, etc.) and abiotic (includes non-living factors such as drought, flood,
    nutrient deficiency, and other environmental factors) stress traits 2, 3. Both
    ground and aerial HTP platforms, equipped with multiple sensors are being used
    in agriculture to measure multiple plant traits at varying growth stages rapidly,
    precisely, and accurately (Figure 1A, Key Figure). Examples of these HTP platforms
    include deployment in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) [4], triticale (× Triticosecale
    Wittmack L.) [5], and maize (Zea mays L.) [6]. Recent advances in sensors for
    imaging plants 7, 8, ranging from remote sensing including spectroradiometry [9],
    Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) [10], visible to far-infrared [11], hyperspectral
    12, 13, 14, 15, thermal 16, 17, fluorescence 16, 18, and 3D laser scanning [19]
    to trichromatic (RGB) [20] imaging in conjunction with advanced autonomous vehicles,
    have truly opened up the possibility of high-throughput stress phenotyping (HTSP).
    Autonomous platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [21] and ground robots
    [22] equipped with multiple sensors can take pictures in near real-time of the
    entire experimental plot several times per day, or over the entire season from
    germination to maturity, resulting in massive amounts of data for analysis and
    storage. Making sense of all these collected data can be done effectively using
    ML tools (see the supplemental information online). It is important to emphasize
    that for ML tools data can be collected from complex, integrated imaging platforms
    or from simple(r) methods such as crowd-sourced cell phone images. Download :

    and prediction (ICQP); (ii) to give an overview of general issues in ML to develop
    a strategy for wider application and adaptability in agriculture; (iii) to contribute
    to a technical framework for the application of ML in plant breeding to solve
    practical problems, especially plant stress phenotyping using digital imaging;
    and (iv) to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various ML algorithms
    in stress phenotyping with the aim of enabling further exploration of these tools
    for facilitating practical use in plant breeding. Phenotyping Data and ML The
    enormous volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of imaging and remote-sensing
    data generated by such real-time platforms represent a ‘big data’ problem. The
    data generated by these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived
    and retrieved for analysis. Although the analysis and interpretation of such (image-based)
    big data are challenging, the ensuing possibilities that can impact on agricultural
    production make it a promising approach for HTP and HTSP. ML approaches present
    a scalable, modular strategy for data analysis, especially for the new application
    domain of ‘plant stress analytics’. Recent studies on HTSP using images obtained
    from UAV-based platforms to detect weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) [23],
    maize [21], and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) [24] using ML algorithms have
    paved a new path for better stress management practices on spatial and temporal
    basis. ML is an inherently multidisciplinary approach to data analysis that draws
    inspiration, and borrows heavily, from probability theory, statistics, decision
    theory, visualization, and optimization. ML approaches are typically useful in
    situations where large amounts of data are available, relating inputs (e.g., image
    data) to output quantities of interest (e.g., stress phenotypes). One of the major
    advantages of using ML approaches for plant breeders, pathologists, physiologists,
    and biologists is the opportunity to search large datasets to discover patterns
    and govern discovery by simultaneously looking at a combination of factors instead
    of analyzing each feature (trait) individually. This was previously a major bottleneck
    because the high dimensionality of individual images (coupled with the huge number
    of such images) makes them extremely difficult to analyze through classical techniques.
    Another key challenge is that the underlying processes for linking the inputs
    to the outputs are too complex to model mathematically. This is particularly the
    case for plant stress phenotyping, where it is challenging to efficiently model
    the holistic effect of genetic, agronomic, economic, meteorological, and human
    factor inputs on stress and, ultimately, yield. ML methods have been applied with
    spectacular results to similar problems [25] previously presumed to be impossible
    to model. Examples include numerous success stories in various domains ranging
    from computer vision (e.g., face recognition), speech processing (e.g., Google
    voice, Apple''s Siri) and natural language processing (e.g., IBM Watson), consumer
    predictive analytics (e.g., Netflix movie recommender system) to bioinformatics
    (e.g., personalized genomics, drug design, and genome annotation) [26], cell biology
    [27], and disease tissue classification in medicine 28, 29. The success of ML
    tools is attributed to their ability to identify a hierarchy of features and generalized
    trends from available data. These tools have also proved particularly adept at
    integrating disparate and often redundant data to draw coherent (and often non-intuitive)
    patterns for identification and quantification. Finally, current progress in ML
    has resulted in scalable, robust, and flexible software tools (R packages, Matlab
    toolboxes, and software packages such as Theano, Caffe for archetypal ML algorithms)
    30, 31, 32, 33 that make the application of ML to disparate disciplines straightforward.
    The advances have percolated into agricultural research, where there has been
    an increasing research effort to apply ML approaches in diverse species, such
    as horticultural crops and forest tree species. This has been driven in part by
    the increased investment by commercial companies and the decreasing cost of imaging/sensor
    platforms. ML-Enabled HTSP In light of these developments, it is clear that ML-enabled
    HTSP will benefit plant breeders, physiologists, entomologists, pathologists,
    extension workers, and farmers by allowing screening of different stresses in
    an accurate, precise, and speedy manner (Table 1). This will also directly enable
    the acceleration of the gene discovery process as well as the introduction of
    novel selection protocols for complex quantitative traits such as biotic and abiotic
    stresses and yield. ML-enabled HTSP will also enhance our understanding of pathogen–plant
    interactions [34] as well as the interaction of plants with other stresses. Table

    stress [60] What is ML? ML refers to a group of computerized modeling approaches
    that can learn patterns from the data so as to make automatic decisions without
    programming explicit rules. The main idea of ML is to effectively utilize experiences
    or example scenarios to discover underlying structures, similarities, or dissimilarities
    present in data to explain or classify a new experience or an example scenario
    properly. A key ability of ML tools is their ability to generalize trends and/or
    patterns from available data. There are a large number of choices of ML tools.
    It is important for an application expert to make a judicious choice on a specific
    ML method to deploy for his/her specific problem. We advocate that the practitioner
    should (carefully) down-select from the plethora of ML choices based on the type
    and amount of available data and problem formulation. In the context of plant
    stress phenotyping, we identify four distinct classes of problem formulation:
    (i) identification/detection, (ii) classification, (iii) quantification/estimation,
    and (v) prediction (Figure 1B,C). Furthermore, preprocessing steps such as dimension
    reduction, clustering, and segmentation can also be crucial for successful decision-making.
    Structure of a ML Process Typically, a large fraction of the dataset, known as
    the ‘training dataset’, that represents the entire population is used for calibrating
    the model. The remaining dataset is used to test the calibrated model, and is
    termed the ‘testing dataset’. The next step after training is to validate the
    learnt model on a new set of data (from different or same population). Once the
    accuracy and precision of the model is high enough, it can be used on a routine
    basis to identify, classify, quantify and predict particular stress features.
    We discuss this process in greater detail next, particularly focusing on clarifying
    the choice of ML tools to use based on two different points of view, namely the
    learning process (how are features learnt) and the modeling objective (what is
    being learnt). The Learning Process – Supervised versus Unsupervised The first
    point of view concerns whether or not the ML model is provided with the labels
    to the data it uses for model training. Here, a label is a trait (such as diseased
    plant or type of crop plant) that is associated with an image. For example, suppose
    the objective of a ML model is to distinguish between maize, soybean [Glycine
    max (L.) Merr.], and sunflower plants after collecting a large number of images.
    If the model is trained with a set of such images where each is labeled as soybean,
    maize or sunflower, the learning process is termed ‘supervised’. Alternatively,
    if the training images are provided without any label, the learning process is
    ‘unsupervised’. Note that although some ML tools can be trained either in a supervised
    or an unsupervised manner, some can be trained in both ways. With the supervised
    learning process, a model essentially tries to learn a map between the input dataset
    and the corresponding output labels. For the given example, it means that a model
    trained in a supervised manner learns how to map all the soybean examples to the
    soybean label, and so on. Support vector machines (SVM) and regular artificial
    neural networks (ANN) are among the prominent examples of supervised schemes.
    By contrast, an unsupervised method does not have specific output labels associated
    with input images. It identifies structures or features present in the images,
    such as the presence of tassels in maize, or the presence of trifoliate leaves
    in soybean. In many cases, the features identified in the unsupervised process
    may not be meaningful to a human user. Various clustering, mixture models, and
    dimension-reduction techniques fall under this category. Often ML models can be
    developed by using partly labeled data. This training scheme is known as ‘semi-supervised’
    learning. The Modeling Objective – Generative versus Discriminative A second point
    of view for ML method categorization is the modeling objective: whether the model
    being trained is to distinguish between two different data patterns or to be able
    to learn and generate similar patterns synthetically. In the context of the previous
    example, a maize and soybean plant can be distinguished based on the presence
    or absence of tassels or pods. A model developed with only this difference would
    be termed a ‘discriminative model’. Naturally, many supervised methods such as
    SVM and ANN fall under this category. However, such a model does not learn other
    features of the objects. Thus, a discriminative model that distinguishes a soybean
    plant from a maize plant based on the presence of tassels fails to differentiate
    between an image of a maize plant and that of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]
    plant. Therefore, a discriminative model is typically built for a predetermined
    specific task. On the other hand, a model that captures the overall data pattern
    such that it is able to generate synthetic images is known as a ‘generative model’.
    It follows that a single generative model can be useful for many decision tasks
    at the same time. Mixture models, hidden Markov models, and Boltzmann machines
    are prominent examples of generative models. Given a large volume of data, discriminative
    models usually perform better than generative models, especially for classification
    tasks, such as distinguishing images of soybean plants from a maize plant. However,
    generative models can achieve slightly better performance compared to discriminative
    ones with low training data volume. In addition, generative models tend to be
    more robust to overfitting issues (i.e., a model learns training data too well
    and performs very poorly for unseen test data). Figure 1D schematically illustrates
    the categorization of several ML methods into classes of generative versus discriminative,
    and supervised versus unsupervised. Although it seems that supervised models are
    more likely to be discriminative in nature, and generative models should not need
    output labels for training, there are examples of unsupervised discriminative
    models and supervised generative models. For example, the widely popular K-means
    clustering technique usually follows an unsupervised training scheme. Even so,
    it is not possible to generate new data examples reliably using only the cluster
    centers and groupings. Most of the unsupervised generative techniques can be learned
    in a supervised manner when the target class information is incorporated as one
    of the data features. Apart from such variations (as shown in Figure 1D), many
    of the ML tools have minor variations based on particular aspects such as underlying
    model structure (e.g., linear vs nonlinear) and training algorithm. The Role of
    Preprocessing in ML-HTSP The crucial step for the successful deployment of ML
    methods is careful preprocessing of the image data. There are multiple examples
    where a careful choice of preprocessing of the collected image datasets has resulted
    in substantial improvements in ML performance. Preprocessing can vary from very
    simple operations including image cropping, contrast enhancement, and removal
    of background to significantly more complex operations such as clustering and
    dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). However, the
    overarching principle of preprocessing the data is ‘concentration of information’.
    That is, the original datasets may contain a large quantity of unnecessary or
    conflicting information that can result in poor ML performance. By preprocessing,
    the signal-to-noise ratio (ratio of useful to useless information) is improved.
    This directly enhances the ability of the ML model to easily recognize useful
    patterns or trends and to separate the data into appropriate classes. Preprocessing
    is the stage where domain knowledge is crucial. The domain expert identifies features
    in the image that are relevant or important for training the model. For example,
    the removal of background (soil, dirt, and tags, etc.) from the foreground to
    identify the plant canopy is generally a crucial step. Following this, a variety
    of image processing tools can be used to convert these raw datasets into a more
    relevant dataset that contains the extracted features. Examples of preprocessing
    operations include: (i) segmentation of images; (ii) contrast enhancement to detect
    edges; (iii) thresholding images into binary data; (iv) converting one image format
    into other [RGB to greyscale; RGB to hue saturation value (HSV)]; (v) de-noising
    images using filters [band-pass, low-pass, fast Fourier transform (FFT)]; (vi)
    extracting features at different scales using image transforms (FFT, wavelet transforms,
    Haar transforms, Hough transforms, Radon transforms); (vii) pixel-based classification;
    (viii) clustering of images into classes; and (ix) dimensionality reduction of
    images. Several of the ML tools discussed here can in fact be applied to these
    preprocessing stages. There are several examples of the utility of such preprocessing
    steps. For early site-specific weed management (ESSWM) in wheat, a UAV-based platform
    was equipped with a visible-range camera to capture ultra-high resolution images.
    Otsu''s thresholding method was then used to differentiate wheat crop plants from
    weeds [23]. In sunflower, a quadrocopter equipped with RGB and multispectral sensors
    was used to detect weeds to optimize herbicide application. A pixel-based classification
    approach was used for weed identification. Similarly, image segmentation 21, 24,
    35 followed by automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) was used in sunflower
    and maize to identify spatial and spectrally consistent objects. ML Approaches
    to ICQP Identification of Stress Identification methods involve detection of a
    specific stress amid other potential stresses in the field. Here, preprocessing
    of image data is crucial. This is especially important for applications involving
    high-throughput imaging, where plant stressors (such as weeds, nutrient, disease,
    and insects) must be automatically identified. In the past, ML methods such as
    SVM, neural networks (NNs), kernel methods, and instance-based approaches have
    been used to detect various stresses. The SVM method has been used successfully
    in a variety of scenarios for stress identification in plants. SVM Methods SVM
    methods have been applied to a variety of plants for disease and stress identification.
    They are deployed in the citrus industry to contain citrus greening (caused by
    phloem-limiting bacteria), also known as Huanglongbing (HLB). Early identification
    is crucial for effectively controlling the spread of HLB. ML was used for the
    identification and estimation of HLB based on fluorescence imaging spectroscopy
    data of leaf samples [36]. The images were preprocessed (segmented) and the extracted
    features were used as an input to SVM. In another example, two aerial imaging
    platforms were compared for the identification of HLB diseases in an infected
    citrus orchard. An aircraft sensing platform equipped to capture hyperspectral
    images and a UAV platform equipped with a multiband imaging camera were used,
    and images obtained from both platforms were segmented and piped to a SVM classifier.
    Results showed that a (non-linear) SVM with kernel worked better than (linear)
    SVM, LDA, and QDA [37]. Similarly, in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), early identification
    of three diseases, Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew, was performed
    using SVM with a radial basis function as kernel [38]. The same idea was deployed
    in cotton to identify damage by green stink bug, bacterial angular blight, and
    Ascochyta blight using a SVM classifier [39], as well as in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) to identify viruses: tomato yellow leaf curl virus and tomato yellow leaf
    curl disease [40]. SVM (combined with a Gaussian process classifier) was used
    for the automatic identification of soil moisture stress using remote visible
    and thermal images in spinach canopies, where the efficacy of using a combination
    of methods was explored. In another study, visible and thermal imaging were combined
    with depth information to automatically identify powdery mildew of tomato plants
    at an early growth stage using a SVM classifier kernel [31]. Variants of the SVM
    method have also proven to be useful for identification. In rice (Oryza sativa
    L.], the hierarchical identification of nutrient deficiency symptoms using scanned
    images was carried out using support vector feature selection (SVFS). Hierarchical
    identification was able to detect the NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)
    stress effectively with enhanced identification accuracy [41]. Artificial Neural
    Nets (ANN) and Variants Simple image processing, followed by ANN, was used for
    detecting and identifying three orchid seedling diseases: bacterial soft rot,
    bacterial brown spot, and Phytopthora black rot [42]. Discriminant Analysis Spectral
    reflectance data were recorded from healthy and HLB-infected citrus leaves, and
    various classifier methods (discriminative and supervised methods) were used to
    identify infected leaves using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), linear discriminant
    analysis (LDA), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and soft independent modeling of
    class analogy (SIMCA) [43]. In sugar beets, hyperspectral canopy reflectance was
    used to identify stress symptoms instigated by beet cyst nematode and Rhizoctonia
    crown and root rot [44]. Gaussian Mixture Models Preprocessing followed by the
    application of Gaussian mixture models has been used to identify both biotic and
    abiotic stresses [45]. Canopy images were taken in a stressed wheat field, at
    differential levels of irrigation (abiotic stress) and inoculated with wheat streak
    mosaic virus (biotic stress). K-means Clustering and Variants Water and nutrient
    stress at the crop canopy level have been studied using hyperspectral images that
    were analyzed using simplex volume maximization (SiVM), an unsupervised clustering
    approach. The SiVM algorithm was found to be adept at detecting drought stress
    using hyperspectral images four days before the appearance of symptoms visible
    to the human eye. The unsupervised nature of SiVM also provided useful new insights
    into the data 11, 25. Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering The automatic extraction
    of hyperspectral signatures using the Bayes factor algorithm with Dirichlet-aggregation
    regression (DAR) resulted in rapid, reliable, and data-driven approach for phenotyping
    plants for both biotic and abiotic stresses [11]. In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.),
    the DAR algorithm was used for the presymptomatic prediction of drought stress
    at an early stage using hyperspectral images [46]. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and
    Bayes Classifier Both supervised (Bayesian classifier) and unsupervised (SOM)
    ML approaches were used for segmenting diseased tomato plants. Diseased regions
    on the tomato canopy were identified using the preprocessed tomato images by a
    SOM model [20]. Classification of Stress Classification is an extension of identification;
    however, instead of identifying a particular stress amid different stresses, a
    classifier is used to classify stress into labeled classes on the basis of stress
    symptoms and signatures. Classification methods often include a preprocessing
    step, usually a segmentation step followed by the extraction of features that
    feed into some type of classifier. For instance, drought stress can be classified
    into: no stress, moderate stress, and heavy stress. Examples from various crops
    are presented below illustrating the use of classification algorithms in various
    stresses. ANN A combination of K-means clustering followed by ANN, using fused
    information from RGB and multispectral camera imaging, was used to develop a 3D
    model of leaves to differentiate the two sugar beet diseases, Cercospora beticola
    and Uromyces betae [47]. In another example, thermal and hyperspectral imaging
    were analyzed to identify and classify symptoms caused by three Alternaria species
    in the oilseed brassica. The majority of the available classifiers present in
    Weka (useful data-mining software in java) were tested, and eight classifiers
    were used to make comparisons. The back-propagation neural networks (BNNs) classification
    model displayed the highest prediction accuracy for classifying Alternaria species
    [48]. SVM A SVM-based method was used to classify healthy and unhealthy Arabidopsis
    plants on the basis of symptoms instigated by colonization of the human pathogen
    Salmonella Typhimurium [49]. The SVM model was comprehensively tested on 1200
    individual Arabidopsis plants with positive results [50]. In further work, classification
    error was reduced using SVMs compared to other ML methods such as decision trees
    and ANNs. The classification accuracy of three sugar beet diseases increased with
    increasing disease severity. This is especially true when hyperspectral reflectance-based
    vegetation indices were used with SVM for the automatic classification of disease
    severity of three sugar beet diseases (Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery
    mildew). Another example of the usefulness of SVM was the identification and classification
    of stonefly larvae from images. Haar random forest feature extraction, in combination
    with SVM classifier, was able to differentiate and classify stonefly larvae from
    other insect species [51]. LDA, K-Means, and Coupled Methods ML methods were used
    to classify the presence of aflatoxins, which are toxic compounds produced by
    fungus Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus [52]. Fluorescence (UV illumination)
    and reflectance (halogen excitations) were used as input data in this case. Preprocessing
    was performed to extract features using Guyon''s SVM-RFE, classical Fisher discriminant
    power, and PCA. These extracted features were used as inputs to classifiers such
    as LDA (linear discriminant analysis) and MLP. Another paper classified the RGB
    images into ‘healthy’ and ‘injured’ classes of clover plants that were exposed
    to varying level of ozone. Various pixel-classifying methods were compared such
    as LDA, K-means clustering, FPM-T2 (fit to a pattern multivariate image analysis
    combined with T2 statistics), and FPM-RSS (FPM combined with residual sum of squares
    statistics) [53]. Quantification of Stress There are fewer reports describing
    the use of ML approaches to quantify stresses, and this provides tremendous opportunities
    for plant scientists and breeders. Quantification methods are an extension of
    classification methods where each class is quantified on the basis of stress severity.
    In case of plant diseases, disease severity [54] can be used to quantify various
    diseases. For example, rust severity in wheat can be quantified on a scale of
    0–100% [55]. Quantification algorithms are usually best preceded by a preprocessing
    stage to separate foreground from background, edge detection, and contrast enhancement.
    A good example of the benefit of preprocessing of images for quantification is
    illustrated in [56] where color mapping (converting from native RGB to other non-native
    formats such as HSV) followed by segmentation was used to quantify disease severity
    of PHYVV (pepper huasteco yellow vein virus) on chili pepper (Capsicum annuum
    L.) plants. Examples from various other crops are presented next. SVM Leaf miner
    pest causes major losses in vegetable and ornamental plants. SVM applied to near-infrared
    spectral reflectance using spectrophotometer and digital leaf images of tomato
    plants of damaged leaves was used to successfully quantify damage degree (DD)
    into five levels [57]. Automatic detection method was used to detect and quantify
    Verticillium wilt (VM) on a large scale in olive using hyperspectral sensor and
    thermal camera mounted on aircraft. The spatial distribution of VM was assessed
    at field level and severity classes (0–4 rating scale quantified into 0–100% severity
    level) predicted by LDA and non-linear SVM methods. Both ML methods showed good
    results in detecting and quantifying VM severity in olives (Olea europaea L.)
    [58]. Prediction of Stress The prediction of plant stress at an early stage before
    it is visible to the human eye has substantial implications for the timely and
    cost-effective control of stress. There are very few reported activities on using
    ML for the prediction of stresses, making this the next big frontier for research
    efforts. This has tremendous implications for prescription farming and precision
    agriculture. SVM In predicting rice blast disease, SVM was used for the development
    of a weather-based prediction model [59]. The performance of the SVM-based approach
    was compared to the ANN variants; back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized
    regression neural network (GRNN), and also to conventional multiple regression.
    The SVM-based approach outpaced all the three methods in cross-location and cross-year
    models, indicating their role in early forecasting of plant diseases. Other examples
    include the prediction of drought-induced stress in barley using hyperspectral
    images using an SVM variant, ordinal classification approach [60]. In barley for
    the presymptomatic detection of water stress, DAR algorithm was used on images
    obtained using hyperspectral camera. The DAR algorithm was efficient in predicting
    stress before symptoms were visible to human eye [46]. Strategies for the Development
    of Efficient ML Applications in Plant Breeding ML methods can play an extensive
    role in breeding for stress tolerance and for rapid phenotyping. These approaches
    can be used in decision-making for parent selection to use in hybridization schemes,
    and in generation advancement and selection. An example of an application using
    ICQP is presented below. Identification Use HTP platform [UAV, unmanned ground
    vehicle (UGV)] for taking images of breeding plots in plant stress nurseries,
    and yield tests. Perform image processing and apply ML algorithms. ML identifies
    which stress is present in each breeding plot. Classification Use ML approaches
    to classify stress in each breeding plot. For instance, determine if a genotype
    is resistant or susceptible to a particular stress. This information can be directly
    used in a breeding decision scheme to select stress resistance genotypes. Quantification
    Use ML approaches to quantify the stress. For example, quantification may be on
    a 0–100% scale of expression, such as percent infection severity. Use the information
    generated by ML approach through quantification to make selections to identify
    stress-resistant genotypes for further testing or commercialization. Prediction
    Use ML approaches on prior disease and weather data to make early stage prediction
    on the expression of stresses for breeding and selection decisions. In addition
    to plant stresses, advances have been made in analyzing other traits using ML
    to predict yield 61, 62, 63, biomass 64, 65, root traits 66, 67, and adaptation
    traits [68]. Concluding Remarks and Outlook ML tools provide a very powerful framework
    to assimilate data, and the utility of these tools is especially important considering
    current progress in HTP approaches that easily generate terabytes of data. Appropriate
    choice and usage of ML tools is crucial for obtaining the maximum possible benefits
    of these sophisticated approaches. This review provides a comprehensive overview
    of ML alongside best practices of using these ML tools to enable stress phenotyping
    (Box 1, Box 2). Using advanced ML tools for plant stress phenotyping is a very
    new area, with the plant community focusing on a small number of ML methods (such
    as SVM and ANN). As part of this review, we have identified several future avenues
    for using ML techniques that show tremendous promise but remain currently unutilized
    by the phenotyping community (see Outstanding Questions). Furthermore, the concepts
    discussed here can be applied to data collected across the spectrum of complexity
    and sophistication (from manually captured camera imaging to automated high-throughput
    imaging systems), as well as scale (from individual plant to plot to field). Box
    1 Key Take-Away Points for Practitioners Identification (i) A large variety of
    ML methods have been successfully applied to the disease identification problem.
    This is an area where preprocessing of images will be very useful. (ii) There
    are two ways to frame a disease identification problem for ML based on the amount
    of data available. (a) When statistically significant nominal (healthy) and diseased
    datasets are available, it is best to use supervised discriminative models that
    are trained to distinguish between these classes. (b) In the absence of a statistically
    significant amount of data (or unbalanced data, see next point below), the best
    approach is to learn the nominal model of the un-diseased plant (which is feasible
    due to the availability of data of the healthy plant) using unsupervised methods.
    Then simple outlier detection can be deployed to identify off-nominal (or diseased)
    cases. (iii) We strongly encourage practitioners to refrain from training disease
    identification models using very small datasets. It is especially important to
    be vigilant against unbalanced data for training where one state (usually, the
    healthy state) has much more data instances than the other diseased states.  Classification
    (i) We encourage the practitioner to ensure the statistical significance of the
    available dataset. (ii) Preprocessing of data is crucial, as is using domain knowledge.
    (iii) Current trends are to always use supervised methods, which are mostly discriminative.
    (iv) Be vigilant against the overfitting problem. A best practice is to always
    ensure that regularization option is turned on in any ML method. (v) It is important
    to note that these methods can only distinguish between known/trained classes.
    They cannot be deployed to identify unknown/untrained symptoms (so-called extrapolatory
    mode). (vi) We encourage practitioners to extract and report detection confidence
    out of the classifier.  Quantification (i) There are very few reported applications
    of ML for stress quantification, and this provides tremendous opportunities for
    plant scientists and breeders. Most current work formulates the quantification
    problem as a classification problem with finer resolution. (ii) Our recommendation
    is that unsupervised generative models can be very successful for quantification.
    This can also work with smaller datasets. The basic idea is to learn the nominal
    (healthy state) model. The severity of the diseased state is quantified as the
    distance/offset from this nominal state. (iii) We strongly recommend practitioners
    to explore the use of Bayesian networks, deep neural nets, and latent Dirichlet
    allocation for this class of problems.  Prediction (i) Most prediction applications
    of ML are limited to early detection of disease onset. (ii) Current phenotyping
    approaches can be extended to obtain time-varying traits. Here, more sophisticated
    models can be used with great utility. Examples include HMM methods, dynamic Bayesian
    networks, and recurrent neural networks. Box 2 Precision Phenotyping Using ML
    Algorithms in Agriculture: Best Practices Advances in technology have made HTSP
    feasible. Appropriate ML tools can be used for all four stages (stress identification,
    classification, quantification, and prediction). High-throughput image-based phenotyping
    of plant stress-related traits to complement high-throughput sequencing will assist
    in finding new genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using linkage mapping
    and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) together with training genome-wide
    selection models for various plant stress traits [74]. Specifically, the high-throughput
    phenotypic information on a particular stress can be used in association with
    genotypic information by means of QTL 75, 76, GWAS 77, 78, or expression studies
    to bridge the genotype–phenotype gap. Relating time-series phenotypic data with
    time-series gene expression may provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms.
    Time-series image data 79, 80 obtained in experiments using HTP platforms such
    as UAVs and autonomous rovers (ground robots), integrated into a viable ML pipeline,
    will allow the study of the time-dependent gene turn-on and turn-off mechanisms
    and provide insight into the molecular basis of disease resistance. HTP can also
    be used for phenotyping different fields for the same stress to understand the
    spatiotemporal difference in the expression of stress. The big advantage of ML
    algorithms is that plant scientists can use them proficiently in stress identification,
    classification, quantification, and prediction using tools packaged in the graphical
    user interface (GUI) without knowing the underlying mathematical and computational
    complexities. We advocate the following best practices for maximizing the effectiveness
    of ML tools: ML for Practitioners It is useful to identify which type of ML method
    is best suited by triaging the ML methods based on amount of data available as
    well as the type of data (labeled vs unlabeled). Figure 1C,D will be beneficial
    for this purpose. Discriminative methods work better for labeled and large datasets,
    while generative methods work better for smaller datasets (both labeled and unlabeled).
    It may be worthwhile for practitioners to explore the use of generative unsupervised
    models as a means to identify latent features from datasets. This is an area that
    is relatively unexplored, but holds great promise. Preprocessing is where domain
    knowledge can be leveraged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the data. For
    ML methods that are classified as discriminative and supervised, the use of preprocessing
    before deploying ML tools is essential to substantially improve ML performance.
    In cases where it is difficult to translate domain knowledge into feature crafting,
    unsupervised preprocessing methods should be explored. This may be particularly
    useful for high-dimensional data such as hyperspectral data. The outlook for ML
    tools in agriculture is very promising. A key ingredient for successful large-scale
    application of ML is the seamless integration of data analytics within the data
    collection and curation pipeline. Such a computational ecosystem (that links data
    collection, data storage, and curation with ML-based data analytics) will open
    up tremendous opportunities to accelerate breeding and to solve foundational problems
    in genomics and predictive phenomics. Promising examples of this vision include
    the Integrated Analysis Platform (IAP) [69] and the i-Plant nitiativeii A crucial
    catalyst for such advances will be to foster multidisciplinary research teams
    such that advances in engineering, plant sciences, and informatics can be leveraged
    in a rational way. This review will enable such teams by providing a common language
    of communication related to ML tools. Outstanding Questions Can causal ML models,
    deployed on time-series of images, identify visual precursors to enable early
    detection of stress response? ML methods lead to data-driven discovery of non-intuitive
    patterns. How can these hierarchical patterns be visualized and then physiologically
    interpreted by domain scientists? Advanced supervised ML methods tend to require
    labeling a large volume of training data. Can methodologies such as mechanical
    turking, crowd sourcing, and gamification be used to create a large corpus of
    community-labeled data? Future phenotyping efforts will be characterized by heterogeneous
    (visual/non-visual), multiscale (plant/plot/field), asynchronous data collected
    by a variety of sensors connected via the internet of things (IOT). How to develop
    best practices for a robust, scalable, and integrated ML pipeline that enables
    seamless assimilation? The ICQP paradigm comprehensively characterizes the spectrum
    of problems in plant stress phenotyping, thus enabling the design and deployment
    of appropriate ML tools. How can this paradigm be applied to other problems in
    plant biology, such as physiogenetic drivers of yield, and soil microbiome–plant
    root interaction studies? Acknowledgments This work was supported by Iowa State

    • The high-throughput phenotypic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana collections
    requires methodological progress and automation. Methods to impose stable and
    reproducible soil water deficits are presented and were used to analyse plant
    responses to water stress. • Several potential complications and methodological
    difficulties were identified, including the spatial and temporal variability of
    micrometeorological conditions within a growth chamber, the difference in soil
    water depletion rates between accessions and the differences in developmental
    stage of accessions the same time after sowing. Solutions were found. • Nine accessions
    were grown in four experiments in a rigorously controlled growth-chamber equipped
    with an automated system to control soil water content and take pictures of individual
    plants. One accession, An1, was unaffected by water deficit in terms of leaf number,
    leaf area, root growth and transpiration rate per unit leaf area. • Methods developed
    here will help identify quantitative trait loci and genes involved in plant tolerance
    to water deficit. Introduction The study of Arabidopsis thaliana genomics is providing
    new insights into the understanding of the processes involved in plant responses
    to environmental stimuli. The functional analysis of genes associated with these
    responses is made possible by the analyses of mutants (Nakazawa et al., 2003)
    and the natural genetic variation of this species (Koornneef et al., 2004). Methods
    of high-throughput genetic mapping (Ponce et al., 1999) and large-scale analyses
    of gene expression (Seki et al., 2002; Kawaguchi et al., 2004) are available.
    The major challenge is now the phenotypic analysis of this genetic variability,
    which requires simultaneous analysis of hundreds to thousands of plants. Phenotyping
    is relatively easy to do when plant traits are defined in a binary fashion (e.g.
    flowering/not flowering or dead/alive) and when environmental conditions are defined
    as the result of a simple action (e.g. light on/off or watered/nonwatered). However,
    phenotyping is more complex when the traits studied are quantitative (e.g. growth
    or photosynthesis) and when environmental conditions vary quantitatively or naturally
    fluctuate (e.g. light intensity or soil water status). The quantitative analysis
    of complex trait variation requires the establishment of a robust analytic framework,
    as developed in the field of quantitative genetics (Falconer & McKay, 1996). In
    this case, the phenotype is not static and better defined by a series of response
    curves to environmental stimuli (Borel et al., 2001; Reymond et al., 2003; Tardieu,
    2003; Hammer et al., 2004). The disadvantage of these ‘response curve’ analyses
    is that they are time-consuming and require accurate control of environmental
    conditions so that the only environmental variable changing is the one of interest.
    The aim of this paper was to compare response curves of changes in leaf development
    in response to soil water deficit in a collection of A. thaliana accessions as
    a ‘proof of concept’. This required methodological and technological advances
    to accurately impose and quantify the soil water deficit treatments and to establish
    a robust framework of analysis. The first problem to be overcome is related to
    the variation of A. thaliana leaf development in well-watered conditions and the
    reproducibility of its reduction by soil water deficit, both within an experiment
    and between experiments. The absolute values defining a phenotype (e.g. leaf area
    of well-watered plants) depend upon the accurate control of environmental conditions
    spatially and temporally within a growth-chamber. The effects of water deficit
    treatment (e.g. the reduction in leaf area) depend not only on the water deficit
    treatment but also on other environmental conditions affected by the water deficit
    treatment (for example, water deficit can increase leaf temperature) and this
    may complicate the analysis. The second problem to solve concerns the quantification
    of the stress, which should be defined by physical variables and similar for all
    studied genotypes. This is not straightforward, especially in the case of soil
    water deficit. Three methods have been described to impose water deficit on A.
    thaliana. A first method consists of withholding or limiting irrigation of soil-grown
    plants (Iuchi et al., 2001; Kawaguchi et al., 2004; Hausmann et al., 2005). Its
    drawback is that different genotypes do not experience the same degree of water
    deficit after a few days without irrigation if they deplete the soil water at
    different rates. An apparently more reproducible method consists of growing plants
    in a medium whose water potential is lowered with an osmoticum (van der Weele
    et al., 2000; Kreps et al., 2002). This method, suitable for studying short-term
    responses, is usually not suitable for longer-term experiments because of the
    phytotoxicity of the osmoticum and the difficulty of maintaining a constant osmotic
    potential in such systems with transpiring plants (Verslues et al., 1998). Finally,
    the method of analysing the responses of detached plants on a bench (Seki et al.,
    2002) was designed to study short-term changes in gene expression, but is obviously
    not adapted for studies of plant development. It was shown recently that expression
    of genes differ in these three systems (Bray, 2004), suggesting that the mode
    of stress imposition is of crucial importance for analysing the responses mechanisms
    and for comparing them between genotypes. The third problem is related to the
    timing of stress imposition, which should be the same for all genotypes. Sensitivity
    of leaf expansion or reproductive development to soil water deficit depends on
    the stage at which the deficit is imposed (Randall & Sinclair, 1988; Ney et al.,
    1994; Lecoeur et al., 1995; Granier & Tardieu, 1999). In sunflower, final leaf
    area could be reduced by 10–41% by the same soil water deficit (same intensity
    and duration) depending on the period of stress imposition (Granier & Tardieu,
    1999). It is therefore necessary to impose water deficit at a precise and common
    stage of development to all genotypes to compare their responses on a robust basis.
    Here we describe protocols for the reproducible phenotyping of developmental responses
    to environmental stimuli in A. thaliana. Methodological concepts were developed
    and put into practice in an automated system, PHENOPSIS, which is presented and
    tested. The comparison of response curves of leaf development to water deficit
    in nine accessions of A. thaliana in a series of independent experiments was done.
    This analysis allowed the identification of one accession, An-1, which consistently
    showed a low sensitivity of leaf growth to water deficit in a large range of soil
    water status. The automated system was also used to analyse other plant traits
    in response to soil water deficit such as root development and leaf transpiration.
    An-1 also showed an unusual behaviour in response to soil water deficit in terms
    of root growth and transpiration rate per unit leaf area. Materials and Methods
    Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. accessions
    were grown in a growth-chamber in four experiments (Tables 1 and 2). The Col-0
    accession was grown in all four experiments. Cvi-0, Oy-0, Di-M and An-1 were grown
    in experiments 2, 3 and 4. Mt-0, Ct-1, Bur-0 and Shahdara were grown during experiments
    2 and 4 (Table 2). All seeds were provided by M. Simon (Institut National de Recherches
    Agronomiques, Versailles, France). An-1 and Di-m were selected because they had
    shown interesting responses to soil water deficit in previous experiments. Other
    accessions were chosen from a core-collection described by McKhann et al. (2004).

    pots (9 cm high, 4.5 cm diameter) filled with a mixture (1 : 1, v : v) of a loamy
    soil and organic compost. For the plants subjected to a water deficit treatment,
    eight 40 × 1-mm slits were made in the sides of the pots facilitating rapid and
    homogeneous evaporation from the soil during the imposition of treatment. These
    holed pots were placed in a second intact pot when the desired soil water content
    was reached (see the Results section). Light in the growth-chamber was provided
    by a bank of cool-white fluorescent tubes and sodium lamps and day-length was
    maintained at 12 h (Table 1). In all experiments, light intensity was measured
    continuously at plant level, using a light sensor over the waveband of 400–700
    nm (LI-190SB; LI COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Daily incident light intensity was calculated
    by multiplying the daylength by the mean instantaneous light intensity. Air temperature
    and relative humidity were measured every 20 s (HMP35A; Vaisala Oy, Helsinki,
    Finland). Leaf temperature was estimated using copper-constantan thermocouples
    (0.4 mm diameter) located in the soil before leaf emergence and under the lamina
    after leaf emergence. All measurements of temperature, light intensity and relative
    humidity were averaged and stored every 600 s in a datalogger (LTD-CR10 Wiring
    Panel; Campbell Scientific, Shepshed, UK). Mean leaf-air vapour pressure deficit
    (VPDleaf-air) was calculated during the light period. Mean micrometeorological
    conditions are presented in Table 1 for each experiment. Sowing and plant homogenization
    Seeds were imbibed with water before sowing for 1 h and then sown with a pipetman
    (P1000; Gilson, Middletown, WI, USA) directly onto the soil. From sowing to plant
    germination, the soil was humidified four times a day with a spray of water. When
    the second leaf of the rosette had emerged, plants of similar sizes and developmental
    stages were selected and thinned out to one plant per pot. Control and measurement
    of soil and plant water status Soil water content at retention capacity was measured
    in a preliminary experiment. Pots were filled with soil, fully wetted and allowed
    to drain freely. Soil water content was determined by weighing the soil before
    and after drying (4 d at 180°C). Soil water content at retention capacity was
    0.78 g H2O g−1 dry soil and was common to all experiments as composition of soil
    remained exactly the same. The weight of each pot was measured before and after
    filling with soil. Soil aliquots were dried to estimate the amount of dry soil
    and of water in each pot at the time of filling. Subsequent changes in pot weight
    were attributed to a change in soil water status, after correction for the weight
    of the plants. For this correction, three plants per accessions and treatments
    were harvested and weighed weekly. Depending on the experiment soil water content
    was adjusted to different values on a daily basis (Table 1). Predawn plant water
    potential was measured on Col-0 plants at different soil water contents in experiment
    1. It was measured when rosette leaf area was fully developed, at the end of the
    night period while the plant water potential approaches equilibrium with soil
    water potential. The measurements were done on the inflorescence which was cut
    and sealed immediately in a pressure chamber (n°3000 Chamber; Soil Moisture Equipment
    Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The chamber was pressurized until the sap just
    wetted the cut surface of the inflorescence. Twenty plants with contrasting values
    of predawn water potential were selected for abscisic acid (ABA) analysis. Xylem
    sap was harvested from some of these plants by increasing pressurization in the
    chamber (at 0.8 MPa above the balancing pressure). Sap samples were stored at
    −20°C for subsequent ABA analysis. The ABA concentration was analysed in sap samples
    by radio-immunoassay as described in Quarrie et al. (1988). Measurements of leaf
    development For all accessions, in experiments 1–3, the water deficit treatments
    started when leaf 6 was initiated on the apex. The number of initiated leaves
    per plant was counted on five plants per accession, harvested each 2–3 d. The
    apex was dissected in a drop of water under a stereomicroscope (F8Z; Leica, Wetzlar,
    Germany) and the number of leaves was counted (excluding the two cotyledons).
    A leaf was considered to be initiated when it was visible with the microscope
    at ×160. From plant germination until the end of vegetative growth, a picture
    of 12 plants per accession and treatment was taken with a digital camera automatically
    and once a day. Visible stages of plant development were noted on these pictures
    according to Boyes et al. (2001). The projected leaf area was measured on the
    same pictures by an image analysis software (Optimas-Bioscan V. 6–1). The end
    of rosette leaf development was determined by the cessation of expansion of the
    last leaf of the rosette. At the end of their rosette leaf development, the 12
    plants were harvested. The leaves were isolated from the rosette, fixed to a piece
    of paper and scanned. Individual leaf area was measured using the image analysis
    software and the final rosette leaf area was calculated as the sum of the areas
    of all individual leaves. Measurement of root dry weight In experiment 3, three
    plants per accession and per water deficit treatment were harvested at the end
    of their rosette leaf development to determine root dry weight. To facilitate
    the recovery of a clean root, the root system was carefully washed in water. The
    roots were then placed in a paper bag and left to dry at 80°C for 4 d. Root dry
    weight was then measured. Measurements of transpiration In experiments 1, 2 and
    4, just after bolting, the rosettes of four plants per accession grown at the
    soil water content of 0.45 g H2O g−1 dry soil were isolated from the soil with
    a plastic sheet at the end of the dark period. Three hours after the beginning
    of the light period, pots were weighed every 30 min for 2 h from 10 : 00 h to
    12 : 00 h. Plants in the pots were photographed after this period, to measure
    the total projected leaf area by using the image analysis software. Plant transpiration
    was calculated by measuring the changes in pot weight as the plastic sheet prevented
    any changes caused by soil evaporation. Transpiration per unit leaf area (g cm−2
    h−1) was then calculated as the ratio between transpiration and projected rosette
    leaf area, assuming that projected leaf area was a good estimation of transpiring
    leaf area. In experiments 1 and 4, this was repeated over several days without
    re-irrigation of the plants, allowing the estimation of transpiration rate per
    unit leaf area at different soil water contents. Statistical analysis of data
    Each analysis was set with a significance level of P = 0.05 and all statistical
    analysis was done using the computer package SPSS 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
    Chicago, IL, USA). The differences in final rosette leaf area, final leaf area,
    final leaf number, final root dry weight between the soil water deficit treatments
    were compared using anova. PHENOPSIS The PHENOPSIS automaton is a prototype built
    by Apilogic (Fondettes, France). It is composed of a steel frame supporting 14
    trays with 36 holes (each hole could support a pot, Fig. 1a,b) and a mechanical
    arm able to move according to a program developed by Apilogic on apigraf ip software.
    Displacement sensors, a balance (CP622; Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany), a tube
    for irrigation and a camera (SSC-DC393P; Sony) were loaded onto this arm to weigh,
    irrigate and take a digital picture of each pot (Fig. 1a–h). Positions of the
    pots on the 14 trays, dates and times of cycle of irrigation, the weight to be
    reached by the pot and the necessity to take a picture or not were programmed
    into a computer on the apigraf ip software (Fig. 1i). Input files for the program
    could be created in excel or in the apigraf ip software. After each cycle of irrigation,
    an output EXCEL (Microsoft) file was automatically recorded on the computer containing
    data such as position of the pot in the chamber, its weight before supplying nutrient
    solution, the amount of nutrient solution added and the name of the picture file
    if a digital photograph was taken. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint PHENOPSIS,

    (PAR) in the PHENOPSIS growth-chamber after correction of heterogeneity with neutral
    filters. The decrease in light intensity observed on the right of the chamber
    is caused by the arm of the robot. The automaton was set up in a growth-chamber
    built by AM Froid (Montpellier, France). The climatic regulation of the growth-chamber
    was controlled by a computer with the apigraf ip software. The computer was connected
    to different sensors such as light, air temperature and air humidity and leaf
    temperature sensors. Each micrometeorological condition was measured with a 10-s
    time-lapse and when any climatic variable strayed beyond acceptable limits, as
    defined in the program, the computer acted to restore the desired environment
    by employing an air drier or a water sprayer to modify air humidity, an air-cooler
    or a heater to modify air temperature and the lights to modify day-length. The
    spatial distribution of the different micrometeorological conditions was measured
    by displacing the air temperature, light and air humidity sensors from a tray
    to another one. Gradients of light intensity, air temperature and humidity were
    corrected by adding neutral filters and by fine-tuning air circulation and orientation
    of the sprays in the chamber (shown for light intensity in Fig. 1j). Results and
    Discussion Growing plants with reproducible final leaf size at different soil
    water contents Final leaf size in Arabidopsis thaliana is affected by micrometeorological
    conditions such as incident light (Cookson et al., 2005). Temperature also affects
    the rate of leaf development (Granier et al., 2002). Heterogeneity of micrometeorological
    conditions within a growth chamber and differences in these conditions among experiments
    can cause variation in leaf development of well-watered plants but also differences
    in the response of plants to soil water deficit. For example in maize, a reduction
    in leaf expansion rate by soil water deficit is more drastic at high VPD (Ben
    Haj Salah & Tardieu, 1997). The spatial and temporal control of micrometeorological
    conditions is therefore a requirement for obtaining reproducible phenotypes. In
    the PHENOPSIS growth-chamber, light intensity, temperature and humidity were homogenized
    and could be reproduced from an experiment to another one. As a consequence, when
    Col-0 plants were grown in experiments 1, 2 and 3 in the PHENOPSIS system, their
    leaf development in well-watered conditions and their responses of leaf development
    to soil water deficit were similar (Fig. 2). Final leaf 6 area was not significantly
    affected by soil water contents between 0.50 and 0.30 g H2O g−1 dry soil but was
    consistently reduced below this threshold. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Independent experiments, experiment 1 (diamonds), experiment 2 (upward-pointing
    triangles) and experiment 3 (downward-pointing triangles) illustrating reproducibility
    of response curves. Relationship between final leaf 6 area and soil water content
    for Col-0 plants grown in three independent experiments; 95% confidence intervals
    of are presented (n = 12). Imposing rapid and well-defined soil water deficits
    to different genotypes The difficulty of analysing the responses of different
    genotypes to soil water deficit when water stress experiments are based on withholding
    irrigation from soil-grown plants is shown in Fig. 3a. Soil water depletion rate
    was measured at the same developmental stage of plant development in the nine
    A thaliana accessions. The depletion rate of An-1 plants was sixfold lower than
    that of Bur-0 plants at stage 3.90 (fully developed rosette, as described in Boyes
    et al., 2001). This was due to differences in total plant transpiration rate,
    which was associated with differences in leaf area (Fig. 3b) and to a lesser extent
    with differences in transpiration rate per unit leaf area (Fig. 3c). After 4 d
    without irrigation, An-1 and Bur-0 experienced soil water contents of 0.4 and
    0.2 g H2O g−1 dry soil, respectively (Fig. 3a, inset), thus each accession experienced
    very different water deficits. This could considerably bias the comparison of
    sensitivities of different genotypes to water stress (Ray et al., 1997; Lacape
    et al., 1998). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Joint analysis of soil
    water depletion, leaf area and transpiration per unit leaf area in the nine accessions
    of Arabidopsis thaliana grown in experiment 2 at a soil water content of 0.45
    g H2O g−1 dry soil. (a) Soil water depletion rate estimated during the transpiration
    assay in experiment 2 (see the Materials and Methods section). Inset, Changes
    with time in soil water content (SWC) after withholding irrigation at stage 5.10
    (first flower buds visible) for four accessions (An-1, downward-pointing triangles;
    Col-0, upward-pointing triangles; Shahdara, circles; Bur-0, squares) during experiment
    2. (b,c) Projected leaf area and transpiration rate per unit leaf area. For each
    accession, all measurements were done at stage 5.10 (first flower buds visible,
    according to Boyes et al., 2001). Data are given as means with 95% confidence
    intervals (n = 4). The PHENOPSIS system allows the imposition of water deficits
    over the whole cycle of soil-grown plant development and the production of stable
    and reproducible water potentials to roots. The principle is to control and stabilize
    the soil water status in a large number of transpiring plants of different genotypes
    (see also the Material and Methods section for details). As in other studies,
    individual pots were weighed at regular intervals and pots were watered with the
    amount necessary to reach a given soil water content (Granier & Tardieu, 1999;
    Yu & Setter, 2003). The daily water delivery was managed independently for each
    pot so plants with high transpiration rate received more water than those with
    a low transpiration rate. This protocol could be performed manually on a small
    scale but has been automated in the PHENOPSIS system with the aim of simultaneously
    studying more than 500 plants. It took approx. 1.5 h for the automaton to weigh,
    water and take a digital image of 500 pots (vs 7 h for 200 plants using a manual
    procedure). Nine accessions with contrasting leaf development and stomatal conductances
    (the same accessions as those presented in Fig. 3) were grown in this system.
    Despite differences in leaf area and transpiration rates, rigorously identical
    and stable soil water contents (0.45, 0.25 and 0.20 g H2O g−1 dry soil) were imposed
    on the different accessions over a long period (i.e. for 30–50 d, Fig. 4). The
    daily oscillation in soil water content was less than 0.05 g H2O g−1 dry soil
    in all accessions at the beginning of the experiment but increased towards the
    end of the experiment. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Nine accessions
    were grown at three different and stable soil water contents identically imposed
    on each accession. Changes with time in soil water content imposed on the nine
    accessions in experiment 2. Plants were grown in well-watered conditions (soil
    water content adjusted daily to 0.45 g H2O g−1 dry soil) and two water deficit
    treatments (soil water content adjusted daily to 0.25 or 0.20 g H2O g−1 dry soil).
    Periods of stress started at leaf 6 initiation for all accessions. Data are given
    as means with 95% confidence intervals (n = 12). As explained in the Material
    and Methods section, the protocol used to impose soil water deficit required that
    some plants were killed during the experiments to take into account plant weight
    in the calculation of the amount of nutrient solution to add to a given pot. In
    the different experiments presented here, this was done weekly on three plants
    per accession and per treatment. At the end of each experiment, the calculated
    soil water content was verified in each pot by weighing wet and dry soil after
    the plant was removed (Fig. 5). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison
    of estimated and measured soil water contents. Physiological indicators of water
    stress A methodological alternative to quantify soil water deficit could have
    been to measure physiological indicators of stress rather than the soil water
    content, and to drive watering requirements by these indicators. For example,
    measurement of leaf temperature could be considered as a surrogate of measurements
    of stomatal conductance (Merlot et al., 2002). The rapid progress of in situ imaging
    will probably allow one to noninvasively evaluate other physiological characteristics
    of a large number of plants in the future. However, there is a theoretical problem,
    namely that physiological measurements themselves depend on the whole-plant controlling
    systems. For example, stomatal conductance may or may not be an indicator of water
    deficit depending on the species or genotype considered (Tardieu & Simonneau,
    1998). Similarly, a high concentration of ABA in the xylem sap ([ABA]xyl) can
    indicate that the studied genotype is currently under stress or that it has a
    high constitutive biosynthesis of ABA (Tardieu, 2003). Each physiological variable
    has its own response to soil water status (e.g. stomatal conductance, photosynthesis,
    plant water potential, osmotic adjustment (Hsiao, 1973) and organs of the same
    plant may display different responses for the same physiological variable (e.g.
    osmotic adjustment, Westgate & Boyer, 1985). This casts doubt on the value of
    choosing one particular physiological variable as a stress indicator with a solid
    theoretical base. We therefore propose that the driving variables for stress imposition
    should be the conditions imposed at the boundary of the plant (such as soil water
    potential or evaporative demand) and therefore that they should be similar in
    all genotypes studied, as is the case in the PHENOPSIS system. In this way, physiological
    variables would be evaluated together with the phenotypic variables of interest.
    For example, the concentration of ABA in the xylem sap and leaf transpiration
    were estimated in Col-0 plants grown at different soil water contents and were
    related to the soil water potential (Fig. 6). Soil water content, which is the
    controlled variable in the PHENOPSIS protocol can be transformed into soil water
    potential afterwards by the water-release curve obtained for the given substrate
    (Fig. 6a). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Interpretation of soil water
    content. (a) Water release curve: relationship between predawn water potential
    and soil water content. Each point is the value measured on an individual plant
    at the end of experiment 1. Soil water content was measured by weighing the soil
    before and after drying immediately after the plant was removed. (b) Relationship
    between concentration of abscisic acid (ABA) in the xylem sap and soil water content.
    Each point represents the value measured on an individual plant at the end of
    experiment 1. (c) Relationship between transpiration rate per unit leaf area and
    soil water content. Data are given as mean values with 95% confidence intervals
    (n = 4). Timing of stimuli imposition and phenological stage of genotypes The
    nine accessions presented in Fig. 3 had different developmental rates (Fig. 7).
    The time taken to reach leaf 6 initiation (Fig. 7a), leaf 6 emergence (stage 1.06,
    as defined by Boyes et al., 2001, Fig. 7b) or emergence of the first flower buds
    (stage 5.10, as defined by Boyes et al., 2001, Fig. 7c) differed among them and
    their developmental rates between each of these stages also differed. In a series
    of experiments on A. thaliana and sunflower, the only way to get a robust model
    of leaf growth response to soil water deficit or temperature in different experiments
    was to express the timing of stress in time after leaf initiation (Granier & Tardieu,
    1998, 1999; Granier et al., 2002). This stage of leaf development is not easy
    to identify as it needs destructive measurements. However, it is more appropriate
    than the visible stages defined by Boyes et al. (2001) which do not necessarily
    correspond to a common leaf age in all accessions. For example, it is clear from
    Fig. 7 than when leaf 6 emerges in Cvi-0, this leaf has spent more time hidden
    than in other accessions (Fig. 7a,b). To avoid this problem, water deficit treatments
    were imposed at leaf 6 initiation in all experiments and for all accessions. It
    corresponded to different calendar dates depending on the accession. For example,
    it occurred 9 d after plant emergence for Cvi-0 and 12 d after plant emergence
    in Bur-0 in Experiment 2 (Fig. 7a). Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Nine accessions grown in well-watered conditions have different developmental
    rates and reached common stages of development (according to Boyes et al., 2001)
    at different dates. (a) Time to initiate leaf 6. (b) Time to reach stage 1.06,
    corresponding to ‘6th leaf < 1mm’. (c) Time to reach stage 5.10 corresponding
    to ‘first flower buds visible’. In (b) and (c), data are given as mean values
    with 95% intervals of confidence (n = 12). An example of the analysis of the genetic
    variability of responses to soil water deficit: identification of An-1 as a potentially
    drought-tolerant accession. In Experiment 2, nine accessions were grown at a constant
    soil water content of 0.45 g H2O g−1 dry soil from plant emergence to leaf 6 initiation.
    When leaf 6 was initiated, plants were subjected to three different soil water
    contents: 0.20, 0.25 and 0.45 g H2O g−1 dry soil until the end of rosette development
    (Fig. 4). Rosette leaf area was reduced with declining soil water status in eight
    of the nine accessions (Fig. 8). It was slightly but not significantly reduced
    by the moderate water deficit treatment in Sha and Ct-1 and was significantly
    increased in An-1. For the most severe water deficit treatment, rosette leaf area
    was significantly reduced in eight accessions with considerable variability in
    this response. It was reduced by a factor of 10 in Bur-0 and only by a factor
    of 2 in Oy-0 and Col-0. Conversely, the final leaf area of An-1 was unaffected
    or even increased for the same water deficit treatment (Fig. 8). Figure 8 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Final leaf area of the rosette in the nine accessions
    subjected to three soil water contents (experiment 2). (a) Pictures of the accessions
    grown in the PHENOPSIS system subjected to soil water contents of 0.45 (left),
    0.25 (middle) and 0.20 (right) g H2O g−1 dry soil. Three plants are shown for
    each accession in each treatment at the end of their rosette development. The
    inflorescence was removed to clearly see the rosette. (b) Final leaf area (sum
    of all individual leaf areas) of the accessions grown in experiment 2 at three
    soil water contents. Data are given as mean values with 95% confidence intervals
    (n = 12). An additional experiment (experiment 3) was performed to check the robustness
    of the method, to enlarge the range of soil water deficits and to enlarge the
    number of plant traits measured in response to water deficit. In Experiment 3,
    plants of five accessions were subjected to six stable soil water contents when
    leaf 6 was initiated. As shown for Col-0 (Fig. 2), final rosette leaf area was
    not affected in the range of soil water contents from 0.45 to 0.30 g H2O g−1 dry
    soil in all five accessions. For An-1, leaf area was actually increased for soil
    water contents of 0.25 g and 0.20 g H2O g−1 dry soil as in experiment 2 (9, 8).
    It was reduced by a factor of 2 in the most severe water deficit (0.15 g g−1 g
    H2O g−1 dry soil, corresponding to −1.0 MPa), while leaf area of other accessions
    was reduced by a factor of 8 at the same soil water status. A two-way anova was
    done with the factors ‘accession’ and ‘soil moisture’ on the data from experiments
    2 and 3. Because An-1 was significantly different from the others the main effects
    of the accession (F4,145 = 187.4, P > 0.0005) and soil moisture (F2,147 = 73.4,
    P > 0.0005) were significant as was the interaction between them (F8,135 = 13.0,
    P > 0.0005). These values are reported for experiment 2 but were similar for experiment
    3. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Plant responses to soil water deficit
    differed among five accessions and allowed the identification of an accession
    with unusual phenotype (An-1). (a) Relationship between final rosette leaf area

    between final leaf number per rosette and soil water content (experiment 3). (c)
    Relationship between root dry weight and soil water content (experiment 3). (d)
    Relationship between transpiration rate per unit leaf area and soil water content
    (experiment 4). For each accession, transpiration rate per unit leaf area is expressed
    in percentage of its value at a soil water content of 0.45 g H2O g−1 dry soil
    (TRmax). The values of TRmax are given in the inset. In the four plots, each symbol
    represents an accession: downward-pointing triangles, An-1; circles, Col-0; diamonds,
    Oy-0, squares, Cvi-0; upward-pointing triangles, Di-m. In (a), (b) and (c), data
    are means with 95% confidence intervals (n = 12 in a and b; n = 3 in c); in (d),
    each point represents an individual plant. The leaf number per plant was not affected
    in a range of soil water contents from 0.45 to 0.25 g H2O g−1 dry soil in all
    five accessions. It was significantly reduced in four of the five accessions when
    they were grown at grown at 0.15 g H2O g−1 dry soil. At this very low soil water
    content, it was reduced by a factor 1.3 (Di-m) to 1.7 (Oy-0). An-1 did not reduced
    its total leaf number even in very severe water deficit conditions. The total
    root dry weight was significantly increased by moderate soil water deficit in
    Oy-0, Di-m and An-1 but was not significantly affected in Col-0 and Cvi-0. Stimulation
    of primary root elongation and total root dry weight by low water potential in
    nutrient-agar medium has also been reported by van der Weele et al. (2000) in
    A. thaliana. In our case, maximal root dry weight was reached at different soil
    water contents depending on the accession. It was close to 0.45 g H2O g−1 dry
    soil for Col-0 but close to 0.30 for Oy-0 and 0.20 for An-1. Root development
    in An-1 was therefore stimulated by very low soil water contents compared with
    the other accessions. Finally, the behaviour of An-1 also differed from the other
    accessions in terms of transpiration per unit leaf area under water deficit (Experiment
    4, Fig. 9d). For all accessions studied the transpiration rate per unit leaf area
    was maximal when plants were grown at 0.45 g H2O g−1 dry soil. These maximal values
    differed among accessions (Fig. 9d, inset). Transpiration rate per unit leaf area
    was significantly decreased in Oy-0, Col-0, Cvi-0 and Di-m for soil water contents
    below 0.35 g H2O g−1 dry soil. By contrast, it remained at its maximal value in
    An-1 plants for soil water contents between 0.45 and 0.25 g H2O g−1 dry soil.
    Had the experiments done here been based upon the addition of constant amounts
    of water to impose soil water deficit to the different genotypes, the low transpiration
    rate of An-1 would have resulted in wetter soils for this accession than the others
    (Fig. 3). Thus, its lack of response to soil water deficit could have been an
    artefact of the low rate of water use of this accession. However, this is not
    the case here, as in the PHENOPSIS system conditions were maintained equivalent
    for the different genotypes at the plant boundary. The response of An-1 is not
    only a result of its low constitutive leaf area; another accession with low constitutive
    leaf area, Ct-1, reduced its final leaf area by a factor of 2 for a soil water
    deficit treatment that increased leaf area by a factor 2 in An-1 (Fig. 8). Conclusions
    PHENOPSIS was used to dissect plant responses to soil water deficit in a collection
    of natural accessions of A. thaliana. Stability of soil water content and micrometeorological
    conditions during the experiments combined with the imposition of the water deficit
    periods at a precise stage of plant development was necessary for reproducibility
    of the response curves. For all the traits measured in our analysis, namely leaf
    growth, leaf number, transpiration rate per unit leaf area and root growth, An-1
    had a particular behaviour. It cannot be stated at this stage whether the low
    sensitivities of An-1 to water deficit for the four traits are caused by a cascade
    of physiological events (all responses having causal relationships between them),
    an evolutionary process (natural selection in this accession for alleles of tolerance
    to water deficit in these four traits) or by a common genetic determinism of the
    four traits by the fixation of pleiotropic alleles (as suggested by McKay et al.,
    2003 for the correlated evolution of δ13C and flowering time). An analysis involving
    mapping populations and detection of quantitative trait loci could test each of
    these three hypotheses. Recent papers suggest that quantitative genetics is feasible
    for analysing growth-related traits in A. thaliana (El-Lithy et al. 2004), and
    their interaction with irrigation treatment (Hausmann et al., 2005). An obvious
    drawback of the method presented here is that, to ensure reproducibility of phenotype
    measurements, all environmental conditions except soil water status were kept
    to a standard value. The results obtained in this way may therefore seem difficult
    to extrapolate to other, more complex, situations. A solution of this problem
    may be to combine several response curves in order to predict the combined effect
    of several environmental stimuli in a modelling approach. This was done for maize
    leaf growth in which the effects of temperature, VPD, light intensity and soil
    water status were dissected and then combined in a model (Tardieu et al., 2000;
    Reymond et al., 2003). After wide-ranging response curve characterization, such
    predictive models could be tested with the PHENOPSIS system by comparing the performance
    of different genotypes under programmed fluctuating scenarios simulating those
    in natural conditions. Acknowledgements This research was supported by grants

    Get rights and content Abstract Improved and up-to-date land use/land cover (LULC)
    data sets that classify specific crop types and associated land use practices
    are needed over intensively cropped regions such as the U.S. Central Great Plains,
    to support science and policy applications focused on understanding the role and
    response of the agricultural sector to environmental change issues. The Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) holds considerable promise for detailed,
    large-area crop-related LULC mapping in this region given its global coverage,
    unique combination of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, and the cost-free
    status of its data. The objective of this research was to evaluate the applicability
    of time-series MODIS 250 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data
    for large-area crop-related LULC mapping over the U.S. Central Great Plains. A
    hierarchical crop mapping protocol, which applied a decision tree classifier to
    multi-temporal NDVI data collected over the growing season, was tested for the
    state of Kansas. The hierarchical classification approach produced a series of
    four crop-related LULC maps that progressively classified: 1) crop/non-crop, 2)
    general crop types (alfalfa, summer crops, winter wheat, and fallow), 3) specific
    summer crop types (corn, sorghum, and soybeans), and 4) irrigated/non-irrigated
    crops. A series of quantitative and qualitative assessments were made at the state
    and sub-state levels to evaluate the overall map quality and highlight areas of
    misclassification for each map. The series of MODIS NDVI-derived crop maps generally
    had classification accuracies greater than 80%. Overall accuracies ranged from
    94% for the general crop map to 84% for the summer crop map. The state-level crop
    patterns classified in the maps were consistent with the general cropping patterns
    across Kansas. The classified crop areas were usually within 1–5% of the USDA
    reported crop area for most classes. Sub-state comparisons found the areal discrepancies
    for most classes to be relatively minor throughout the state. In eastern Kansas,
    some small cropland areas could not be resolved at MODIS'' 250 m resolution and
    led to an underclassification of cropland in the crop/non-crop map, which was
    propagated to the subsequent crop classifications. Notable regional areal differences
    in crop area were also found for a few selected crop classes and locations that
    were related to climate factors (i.e., omission of marginal, dryland cropped areas
    and the underclassification of irrigated crops in western Kansas), localized precipitation
    patterns (overclassification of irrigated crops in northeast Kansas), and specific
    cropping practices (double cropping in southeast Kansas). Previous article in

    Plains 1. Introduction Georeferenced land use/land cover (LULC) data sets are
    primary inputs for environmental modeling and monitoring, natural resource management,
    and policy development. A variety of LULC data sets are needed to support the
    growing and diverse demands of the global environmental change research community
    (Cihlar, 2000, DeFries and Belward, 2000). Several major research programs and
    documents (NASA, 2002, NRC, 2001, Sarmiento and Wofsy, 1999, Turner et al., 1995)
    have identified the development of improved and up-to-date regional- to global-scale
    LULC products as a research priority. These products should characterize current
    LULC patterns, document major LULC changes, and place more emphasis on land use
    in the thematic classification schemes of the maps. Over the past decade, the
    science of large-area LULC mapping has made considerable strides as remotely sensed
    data and computing resources have improved and advanced classification techniques
    have emerged (DeFries & Belward, 2000). During this period, large-area LULC mapping
    has evolved through numerous efforts at state (Craig, 2001, Eve and Merchant,
    1998), regional (Bosard et al., 2000, Homer et al., 2004, Vogelmann et al., 2001),
    and global (Bartholome and Belward, 2005, DeFries et al., 1998, DeFries and Townshend,
    1994, Friedl et al., 2002, Hansen et al., 2000, Loveland et al., 2000) scales.
    In addition, considerable effort has been made to advance large-area LULC characterization
    beyond the traditional thematic classification of specific LULC types by mapping
    continuous land cover fields (Hansen et al., 2002), land cover change (Justice
    et al., 2002, Zhan et al., 2002), and biophysical land cover characteristics such
    as leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation
    (FPAR) (Myneni et al., 2002). Despite this progress, little emphasis has been
    placed on large-area crop mapping and monitoring. Most of the mapping efforts
    highlighted above have focused on the classification of land cover types associated
    with natural systems (e.g., forest, grassland, and shrubland) and have tended
    to generalize cropland areas into a single or limited number of thematic classes.
    Few large-area mapping efforts have attempted to map specific crop types and associated
    land use practices (Craig, 2001), particularly on the short time-step that is
    required to reflect the rapid land cover changes that commonly occur from year
    to year in crop rotations. Timely crop-related LULC information is currently limited
    over major agricultural regions such as the U.S. Central Great Plains, which face
    a number of environmental issues (e.g., climate change and groundwater depletion)
    that threaten the area''s long-term sustainability (Ojima & Lackett, 2002). Cropland
    areas are intensively managed and modified through a variety of human activities,
    which can have a wide range of impacts on biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles,
    climate, ecosystem functions, the economy, and human health. As a result, new
    mapping protocols are needed to characterize the regional-scale cropping patterns
    on a repetitive basis and provide improved LULC information to scientists and
    policy makers. The objective of this study was to investigate the applicability
    of time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for regional-scale crop mapping in the
    U.S. Central Great Plains. A crop mapping methodology, which applied a decision
    tree classification technique to a time series of MODIS 250 m VI data spanning
    one growing season, was tested over the state of Kansas. A four-level hierarchical
    classification scheme was implemented, which produced a series of four crop-related
    LULC maps that progressively classified cropland areas into more thematically-detailed
    classes (Fig. 1). Three primary research questions were addressed in this study.
    First, what thematic accuracy can be achieved for classifying crop/non-cropland,
    general crop types (alfalfa, summer crops, winter wheat, and fallow), specific
    summer crop types (corn, sorghum, and soybeans), and irrigated/non-irrigated crops
    using a time series of MODIS 250 m NDVI data collected across the growing season?
    Second, are the general cropping patterns depicted in the series of 250 m maps
    consistent with the patterns reported across Kansas? Third, do the maps exhibit
    any regional trends or major areal deviations from the general cropping patterns
    reported for Kansas? Major regional differences may signal a limitation of the
    classification methodology in certain parts of the state or for specific crop-related
    LULC classes. Download : Download high-res image (109KB) Download : Download full-size

    Central Great Plains region. 1.1. Large-area LULC mapping activities and crop
    classification The development of a regional-scale crop mapping methodology is
    challenging because it requires remotely sensed data that have large geographic
    coverage, high temporal resolution, adequate spatial resolution relative to the
    typical field size, and minimal cost. Remotely sensed data from traditional sources
    such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM and ETM+) and the Advanced Very High Resolution
    Radiometer (AVHRR) have proved useful for LULC characterization, but are limited
    for such an approach because of resolution limitations, data availability/quality
    issues, and/or data costs. Most crop mapping using high resolution, multi-spectral
    data from Landsat TM/ETM+ (and similar sensors such as SPOT) has been conducted
    at a local scale (Mosiman, 2003, Price et al., 1997). The exception is the cropland
    data layer (CDL), which is a state-level classification of specific crop types
    produced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural
    Statistics Service (NASS) that is annually updated (Craig, 2001). However, the
    CDL is only available for a limited number of states (10 states in 2005) (NASS,
    2006). Other large-area Landsat-based LULC mapping efforts such as the National
    Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) (Homer et al., 2004, Vogelmann et al., 2001) and Gap
    Analysis Program (GAP) state-level LULC maps (Eve & Merchant, 1998) have typically
    classified cropland into a limited number of generalized classes and have updated
    the maps infrequently. Large-area mapping using Landsat data has been limited
    by the considerable costs of acquiring and processing the large data volumes that
    are required (DeFries & Belward, 2000). A multi-seasonal Landsat classification
    approach is typically adopted and has consistently produced higher accuracies
    than a single-date approach for both general LULC (Wardlow & Egbert, 2003) and
    crop type (Price et al., 1997) mapping. As a result, a large number of Landsat
    scene-date combinations have to be processed to provide adequate spatial and temporal
    coverage, which is costly and time and labor intensive. The acquisition of relatively
    cloud-free imagery at optimal times during the growing season is also an issue
    because of the long revisit time of the Landsat instrument (DeFries & Belward,
    2000). Coarse resolution (1 km and 8 km), time-series AVHRR NDVI data have been
    widely used to classify continental- to global-scale land cover patterns (DeFries
    et al., 1998, DeFries and Townshend, 1994, Hansen et al., 2000, Loveland et al.,
    1995, Loveland and Belward, 1997). The high temporal resolution (10- to 14-day
    composites generated from near-daily image acquisitions) of the AVHRR time-series
    data in combination with the NDVI''s strong relationship with biophysical vegetation
    characteristics such as LAI and green biomass (Asrar et al., 1989, Baret and Guyot,
    1991) enables land cover types to be discriminated based on their unique phenological
    responses. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR data limits both the
    thematic and spatial detail of the LULC types that can be mapped. Most AVHRR pixels
    have an integrated spectral–temporal signal from multiple LULC types contained
    within the 1-km footprint (Townshend and Justice, 1988, Zhan et al., 2002). As
    a result, coarse resolution imagery is suitable for classifying the general, broad-scale
    patterns of natural systems, but the high spatial variability and complexity of
    agricultural systems requires higher resolution data (Turner et al., 1995). The
    use of 1-km AVHRR data for LULC classification in agricultural regions is difficult
    (Loveland et al., 2000) and has produced inconsistent results (Loveland et al.,
    1995). Most AVHRR-related mapping efforts have characterized broad-scale land
    cover patterns, classified general vegetation types (e.g., deciduous, broadleaf
    forest) and/or aggregated land cover classes (e.g., crop/grassland mosaic), and
    assigned cropland areas to either a single or mixed crop/natural vegetation class.
    1.2. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) The MODIS instrument
    offers new possibilities for large-area crop mapping by providing a near-daily
    global coverage of science-quality, intermediate resolution (250 m) data since
    February 2000 at no cost to the end user (Justice & Townshend, 2002). MODIS 250
    m VI data, in particular, are well suited for this type of application in the
    U.S. Central Great Plains. The calibration, atmospheric correction (water vapor
    and aerosols) (Vermote et al., 2002), and relatively high sub-pixel geolocational
    accuracy (∼ 50 m (1σ) at nadir) (Wolfe et al., 2002) of MODIS data enable distinct
    multi-temporal VI signals of specific crops to be detected at the 250 m pixel
    level (Wardlow et al., 2006, Wardlow et al., 2007). In an analysis of 16-day composited
    MODIS 250 m VI data for 2000+ fields in Kansas, Wardlow et al. (2007) found the
    data to have sufficient spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolutions
    to detect unique multi-temporal VI signatures for the state''s major crop types
    (Fig. 2) and land use practices (Fig. 3). Alfalfa, summer crops (corn, sorghum,
    and soybeans), winter wheat, and fallow (unplanted, idle fields) were highly separable
    in the VI data at some point during the growing season because of their very distinct
    crop calendars. Specific summer crops such as corn, sorghum, and soybeans were
    less separable, but subtle differences in their specific planting times and general
    growth patterns were captured in the VI data, which can be used to discriminate
    these crop types. Irrigated and non-irrigated fields of the same crop type also
    exhibited different VI responses, with irrigated crops maintaining higher VI values
    across most of the growing season as demonstrated by corn and winter wheat in

    Irrigated crops maintained higher NDVI values than non-irrigated crops throughout
    most of the growing season in Kansas as shown for corn (irrigated n = 330 and
    non-irrigated n = 279) and winter wheat (irrigated n = 90 and non-irrigated n
    = 356). The moderate 250 m spatial resolution of MODIS is appropriate for classifying
    cropping patterns in the U.S. Central Great Plains given the region''s relatively
    large field sizes, which are frequently 32.4 ha or larger and would spatially
    correspond to five or more 250 m pixels. The two 250 m spectral bands (620–670
    nm and 841–876 nm) on MODIS used to calculate the VI data were intended to be
    used to detect anthropogenic-driven land cover changes (Townshend & Justice, 1988),
    and the value of data at this spatial scale has already been demonstrated for
    LULC change detection (Lunetta et al., 2006, Morton et al., 2006, Zhan et al.,
    2002), continuous fields land cover mapping (Hansen et al., 2002, Lobell and Asner,
    2004), general land cover mapping (Wessels et al., 2004), and vegetation phenology
    characterization (Wardlow et al., 2006). Wardlow et al. (2007) noted that similar
    landscape-level cropping patterns could be visually discerned in MODIS 250 m and
    Landsat ETM+ 30 m imagery throughout most of Kansas. Hansen et al. (2002) also
    reported that other landscape features associated with human activity (e.g., deforestation)
    were visible at MODIS'' 250 m spatial resolution. The utility of the MODIS 250
    m VI data sets for several cropland characterization activities has been demonstrated
    (Lobell and Asner, 2004, Morton et al., 2006, Wardlow et al., 2006), but their
    suitability for mapping specific crop types and crop-related land use practices
    has yet to be fully explored. 1.3. Decision trees and large-area LULC classification
    Large-area LULC mapping has improved with the application of advanced classification
    techniques such as decision tree (DT) classifiers, which have several advantages
    over traditional supervised classifiers (Hansen et al., 1996) and have consistently
    produced higher classification accuracies for this task (Friedl and Brodley, 1997,
    Hansen et al., 1996). DTs are non-parametric and can handle multi-modal distributions
    in the input data because they operate on thresholds in multi-spectral space rather
    than measures of central tendency (Hansen et al., 2000). This is critical for
    regional-scale crop mapping because of the considerable intra-class variability
    exhibited in the time-series MODIS NDVI data for a given crop due to regional
    variations in climate and management practices (Wardlow et al., 2007, Wardlow
    et al., 2006). DTs can also handle non-linear and hierarchical relationships between
    the input variables and the classes, as well as a variety of data types. They
    are also efficient at processing the large data volumes that are required for
    large-area applications. As a result, DT techniques are increasingly being used
    for large-area LULC mapping with success (Friedl et al., 2002, Homer et al., 2004,
    Wessels et al., 2004). The use of other techniques from the machine learning community
    such as boosting (Freund, 1995, Shapire, 1990) and bagging (Bauer and Kohavi,
    1999, Breiman, 1996) in combination with DTs has also further improved LULC classification
    capabilities (Friedl et al., 1999, Lawrence et al., 2004). 2. Study area Kansas
    is an agriculturally-dominated state located in the U.S. Central Great Plains
    (Fig. 4) with 46.9% (10.0 million ha) of its total area dedicated to crop production.
    The state''s major crops include alfalfa (Medicago sativa), corn (Zea mays), sorghum
    (Sorghum bicolor), soybeans (Glycine max), and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum).
    Over the past decade, Kansas has ranked among the top 10 states in both acreage
    and production for most of these crops and has, on average, $3.3 billion in total
    annual crop production, which ranks fifth nationally in the U.S. (USDA, 2002).
    The crops are grown under a wide range of environmental conditions, and a variety
    of farming practices are used across the state to maintain high crop production
    levels. Download : Download high-res image (449KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. The state of Kansas study area map (a) and USDA NASS Agricultural
    Statistics District (ASD) boundary map (b). The dark lines in (b) correspond to
    ASD boundaries and the lighter lines to county boundaries. A pronounced east–west
    precipitation gradient strongly influences the specific cropping patterns and
    management practices implemented across Kansas. On average, precipitation totals
    range from ∼ 500 mm/year in western Kansas to ∼ 1000 mm/year in eastern Kansas
    (annual average totals from 1961 to 1990). Semi-arid western Kansas has a highly
    variable, limited precipitation regime and commonly experiences severe drought
    events. As a result, cropland in this area is extensively irrigated from aquifers
    to support the production of crops such as alfalfa, corn, and soybeans. The use
    of dryland farming techniques (e.g., conservation tillage) and the planting of
    more drought-tolerant crops such as winter wheat and sorghum are also common in
    western Kansas. In eastern Kansas, adequate precipitation is usually received
    to support high crop production levels without irrigation. Corn and soybeans are
    the two primary crops grown in this part of the state. The use of irrigation is
    very limited, primarily in lowland floodplain areas, and fallowing is rare. The
    general grain size of the landscape, which is defined as the size of individual
    landscape elements (i.e., fields) (Forman & Godron, 1986), also changes from east
    to west. Western and central Kansas has a relatively coarse-grained landscape
    comprised of large individual fields (sizes commonly range from 65 to 245 ha)
    and large contiguous tracts of both cropland and rangeland. In eastern Kansas,
    field sizes are smaller (typically 65 ha or less) and the cropland areas are smaller,
    more fragmented, and interspersed with grassland and deciduous forest. No official
    statistics are recorded regarding actual field sizes in Kansas, but the average
    farm size reported by USDA illustrates the transition in the scale of farming
    operations (and indirectly, of typical field sizes) across Kansas. In 2001, the
    average farm size in western Kansas was 575 ha compared to 312 ha and 188 ha in
    central and eastern Kansas, respectively (USDA, 2002). The majority of fields
    in Kansas would be depicted in the MODIS 250 m imagery by 6–12 pixels at the lower
    end of the field size range and 28–30 pixels at the upper end of the range. Regional
    differences in field size, climate, and management practice were collectively
    considered when evaluating the classification results because they could affect
    the performance of the MODIS NDVI-based crop mapping protocol in certain parts
    of the state. 3. Data 3.1. MODIS 250 m NDVI data A 15-date time series of MODIS
    250 m NDVI data (MOD13Q1, Collection 4) spanning from the March 22 to November
    1 composite periods was created for Kansas. Data were required from three MODIS
    tiles (h09v05, h10v05, and h10v04) for statewide coverage. The tiled NDVI data
    were mosaicked, reprojected from the Sinusoidal to Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area
    (LAEA) projection, and subset over Kansas for each composite period and then sequentially
    stacked to produce the time-series data set. 3.2. Field site training and validation
    database A database of 2179 field sites of specific crop types and management
    practices in 2001 was created using information from annotated aerial photos provided
    by the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA). FSA annotations included geographic location
    (i.e., Public Land Survey System (PLSS) description), crop type, acreage, and
    irrigated/non-irrigated status. Fields were selected from 48 counties (of a total
    of 105 counties) distributed across the state''s nine Agricultural Statistics
    Districts (ASDs) to ensure that each class had a representative geographic sample
    that reflected the diverse environmental conditions and management practices under
    which crops are grown across Kansas. Ideally, a probability-based sampling design
    (e.g., random or systematic) for field site selection would have been preferred
    because it is the only way to acquire objective, scientifically defensible accuracy
    statistics (Stehman, 1999, Stehman and Czaplewski, 1998). However, as other large-area
    LULC mapping efforts have encountered (Friedl et al., 2002, Loveland et al., 2000),
    this type of design was not practically feasible given the costs and logistical
    challenges that would be required to collect such a sample across Kansas. As a
    result, some class(es) and area(s) could be underrepresented in the training and
    validation sets. However, great care was taken to select counties that were geographically
    distributed across each ASD and FSA officials, when possible, selected ∼ 10 fields
    per class located throughout each sampled county in an attempt to acquire both
    a thematically- and geographically representative sample for training and test
    purposes. A 32 ha field size minimum (i.e., ∼ five 250 m pixels) was established
    to ensure that the selected fields were sufficiently large to collect a representative
    spectral–temporal signal. Fields were geo-located on the MODIS imagery using a
    georeferenced PLSS vector coverage and multi-seasonal Landsat ETM+ imagery. A
    single 250 m pixel located completely within each field''s boundaries was selected
    to represent each site. A single pixel was used rather than a pixel window (e.g.,
    2 × 2 pixels) to eliminate mixed edge pixels composed of multiple LULC types from
    being included in the training and validation data. The pixel''s NDVI time series
    was extracted and visually assessed to verify its spectral–temporal characteristics
    were consistent with the crop type being reported by the FSA. Upon verification,
    the NDVI time series and annotated FSA crop information for the field was entered
    into the database. Individual field locations are shown in Fig. 5 and total number
    of sites by crop type are summarized in Table 1. Readers are referred to Fig.
    2 in Wardlow et al. (2007) for the locations of the fields by specific crop type.

    2001 were acquired from the USDA NASS agricultural statistics database (http://www.nass.usda.gov/Data_and_Statistics/Quick_Stats/)
    (NASS, 2002). The planted crop acreage is a statistical estimate calculated from
    information provided by farmers and field enumerators from a probability-based
    sample survey (USDA, 1999). Some areal differences will inevitably exist between
    the classified and NASS crop areas, given that different data sources (i.e., remotely
    sensed data vs. sample surveys) and methods were used. As a result, the acreage
    data were only used as a relative measure to determine if the crop areas classified
    in the MODIS-derived maps were representative of the general crop distributions
    reported by the USDA across Kansas and to highlight any major regional areal discrepancies
    within the state. NASS planted acreage data were reported by crop type and sub-divided
    into irrigated and non-irrigated categories. However, the alfalfa acreage was
    not sub-divided and areal estimates for irrigated and non-irrigated sub-classes
    were obtained from county-level acreage estimates calculated by the Department
    of Agricultural Economics at Kansas State University. Fallow acreage also was
    not reported by NASS and was estimated from the ‘winter wheat planted on summer
    fallow’ category in the 2002 NASS data. This acreage estimate is conservative
    because it only reflects fallow cropland in 2001 that was planted to winter wheat
    in 2002 and does not include areas planted to other crops. However, this estimate
    was still considered appropriate for general comparative purposes because winter
    wheat is the primary crop planted following a summer fallow period in Kansas and
    only a small percentage of fallow fields are planted to other crops (O''Brien
    et al., 1998). 3.4. Kansas GAP 250 m crop/non-crop map A 250 m crop/non-crop map
    was generated from the 30 m Kansas GAP LULC classification to compare to the MODIS-derived
    250 m crop/non-crop map. The Kansas GAP map, which was derived from early-1990s
    Landsat TM data, serves as an appropriate benchmark given the map''s relatively
    high overall (88%) and cropland class (> 90%) accuracies (Egbert et al., 2001)
    and high areal agreement with USDA NASS'' reported crop acreage (Wardlow & Egbert,
    2003). The 250 m Kansas GAP crop/non-crop map was produced by calculating the
    percentage of cropland in the 30 m map contained within each 250 m MODIS pixel
    footprint and assigning 250 m pixels with > 50% cropland to the crop class and
    < 50% cropland to the non-crop class. 3.5. Landsat ETM+ imagery Statewide spring
    and summer mosaics of Landsat ETM+ imagery were assembled to visually verify FSA
    field locations and evaluate the crop patterns classified in the MODIS-derived
    maps. A total of 32 scenes from 16 Landsat path/rows for 2001 were acquired from
    the Kansas Satellite Imagery Database (KSID) (http://www.kars.ku.edu/products/ksid/landsat/landsat-imagery.shtml)
    and processed to provide complete, multi-seasonal coverage over Kansas. For path/rows
    that did not have a 2001 image available, scenes from 2000 were substituted. 4.
    Methods 4.1. Hierarchical classification scheme A four-level, hierarchical classification
    scheme (Fig. 1) was implemented in this study. At the initial stage (Level 1),
    the entire study area was mapped into crop and non-crop classes. The cropland
    areas were then mapped into four general crop types (Level 2). The summer crop
    areas classified in the general crop map were then further classified into three
    specific summer crop types (Level 3). The final step was to classify the cropland
    area into irrigated and non-irrigated classes (Level 4). This hierarchical structure
    was selected because it allowed the landscape to be progressively segmented into
    relatively homogeneous LULC units within which more detailed thematic classes
    could be discriminated. This also allowed the applicability of the mapping methodology
    to be assessed at varying thematic levels. Furthermore, it gives users the flexibility
    to use a map from a single level (e.g., general crops) or combine maps from multiple
    levels (e.g., irrigated/non-irrigated general crop map) to meet their specific
    needs. 4.2. Crop/non-crop classification and assessment An unsupervised classification
    method (ISODATA) was applied to the 15-date NDVI time series to produce the crop/non-crop
    map because suitable training data were not available for the non-crop class,
    which is comprised of a complex, heterogeneous mix of numerous and often unrelated
    LULC types. It also provided insight into the specific spectral–temporal clusters
    in the multi-temporal NDVI data and their relative landscape positions (e.g.,
    interior vs. edge pixels). An ecoregion-based mapping zone approach was adopted
    based on the rationale that the crop and non-crop classes would exhibit less spectral–temporal
    diversity within each zone than at the state level, which would result in more
    thematically homogenous clusters. Kansas was sub-divided into six eco-mapping
    zones based on the Omernik Level II ecoregion delineations (Omernik, 1987). For
    each zone, 100 spectral–temporal clusters were generated and each cluster was
    assigned to one of three classes (crop, non-crop, or confused) by evaluating the
    spatial distribution of the cluster''s pixels and visually interpreting the corresponding
    cover type(s) associated with those locations on Landsat ETM+ imagery. The cluster''s
    mean multi-temporal NDVI signature was also evaluated for class determination.
    Clusters labeled as crop or non-crop were recoded to their respective classes.
    A clusterbusting technique (Jensen et al., 1987) was applied to the confused clusters
    (294 of 600 total clusters), where ISODATA was re-applied to break each confused
    cluster into 10 additional clusters. These clusters were then re-evaluated using
    the previous process and assigned to the crop or non-crop class. Minimal post-classification
    manual recoding was performed using the Landsat ETM+ imagery as a visual reference.
    Once the six eco-mapping zones had been classified, they were mosaicked to produce
    the final, state-level crop/non-crop map. A statistical accuracy assessment was
    conducted using a stratified, random sample of 858 MODIS pixels (465 crop and
    393 non-crop) selected throughout Kansas. The validation pixels were selected
    by stratifying the state by both cover type and eco-mapping zone and weighting
    the number of random samples collected for each class to be proportional with
    the relative crop and non-crop areas within each zone based on the 250 m Kansas
    GAP crop/non-crop map. An independent analyst classified each pixel as crop or
    non-crop based on a visual interpretation of the pixel''s corresponding location
    on Landsat ETM+ imagery and the multi-temporal characteristics of its NDVI profile.
    A pixel-level comparison was also made between the MODIS and Kansas GAP 250 m
    crop/non-crop maps at the state and ASD levels to assess their level of thematic
    agreement. An areal comparison of the classified and USDA reported crop areas
    was also conducted at both the state and ASD levels. 4.3. Crop-related LULC classification
    and assessment A commercially available, supervised DT algorithm called See5 (Quinlan,
    1993, Rulequest, 2007) was applied to the NDVI time series to produce the three
    crop maps. Pruning (certainty factor = 25% and minimum cases = 2) and boosting
    (10 iterations) techniques were also used in combination with the See5 base DT
    classification algorithm. The specific NDVI time series window for each crop classification
    was defined by the crop calendars of target classes. A 15-period growing season
    window (March 22 to November 1) was defined for the general crop and irrigated/non-irrigated
    crop classifications. A shorter 13-period window (April 7 to October 16) was defined
    for the summer crop classification. The crop classification methodology implemented
    a bagging approach (Bauer and Kohavi, 1999, Breiman, 1996) where the field site
    data (2179 sites) were divided into a series of 10 independent training (80%)
    and validation (20%) sets using a stratified, random sampling scheme. The sites
    were stratified by ASD and the number of samples randomly drawn for the training
    and validation sets was weighted according to the relative proportion of class
    sites within each district. Class weighting was employed to ensure adequate thematic
    and geographic representation in the training and validation sets. A separate
    classification run was performed using each training set and 10 maps were produced.
    A pixel-level majority vote was then taken across the 10 maps to select the thematic
    class in the final map. This bagging approach was adopted to avoid a potential
    spurious classification result (e.g., extremely high or low accuracy) that might
    occur from a single draw if an unusual sample is drawn for a specific class(es).
    A k-fold cross validation approach (Kohavi, 1995) was used to perform a statistical
    accuracy assessment for each crop map. A separate assessment was performed for
    each of the 10 independently classified maps (i.e., 10 folds) using the validation
    set (k) that had been withheld for that specific classification run, and the accuracy
    reported for the final map was the mean accuracy (± 1σ) across this series of
    maps. ASD- and state-level areal comparisons were also conducted between the classified
    crop areas in the final maps and the USDA planted crop area estimates to identify
    any major areal discrepancies or regional trends. Finally, the classified crop
    patterns were visually assessed and compared to the state''s reported cropping
    patterns, as well as those that could be interpreted from Landsat ETM+ imagery.
    5. Results/discussion 5.1. Crop/non-crop classification 5.1.1. Visual assessment
    The major crop/non-crop patterns in the MODIS-derived map (Fig. 6a) were consistent
    with Kansas'' general land cover patterns. Major crop areas such as the Western
    Corn Belt (northern ASD 70), the Winter Wheat Belt (southeast ASD 60), and the
    large cropland expanses throughout the central and western ASDs were depicted.
    The cropped floodplain areas and smaller, fragmented crop patches throughout the
    eastern ASDs (80 and 90) were classified. Major non-crop features such as the
    Flint Hills tallgrass prairie (western ASD 70, 80, and 90), the grass/shrub-dominated
    Red Hills (southeast ASD 30 and southwest ASD 60), the deciduous forest/grassland
    areas of eastern Kansas (eastern ASD 80 and 90), and the numerous large tracts
    of rangeland throughout the central and western ASDs were also mapped. Download

    to ASD boundaries and light lines to county boundaries. The red circle on the
    irrigated/non-irrigated crop map (d) highlights a large area of non-irrigated
    cropland that was misclassified as irrigated. 5.1.2. Statistical accuracy assessment
    The crop/non-crop map had an overall accuracy of 90.9% (Table 2a). Producer''s
    and user''s accuracies were 87.3% and 96.5% for the crop class and 97.4% and 83.2%
    for the non-crop class. The crop class had considerably higher errors of omission
    (i.e., 66 crop sites classified as non-crop), which suggested some difficulty
    in discriminating cropped areas from non-crop vegetation. Most misclassified crop
    sites were located in the dryland crop areas of western Kansas or their landscape
    position was often at the edge of cropped areas. These sites would likely be more
    difficult to accurately classify given the highly variable spectral response from
    marginal dryland crops and the often indistinct multi-temporal VI signatures of
    edge pixels, which typically have an integrated spectral response from multiple
    cover types. Table 2. Accuracy assessment results for the crop/non-crop (a), general

    MODIS/Kansas GAP pixel-level comparison The pixel-level thematic agreement between
    the MODIS and Kansas GAP 250 m crop/non-crop maps was 78.0% at the state level.
    All the ASDs had 75% or greater agreement between the two maps, with the exception
    of district 40 (72.5%) (Table 3). No major regional trends or differences in the
    level of thematic agreement were found among the ASDs. The majority of thematic
    disagreement resulted from crop pixels in the Kansas GAP map being classified
    as non-crop in the MODIS map (63.3% at state level). The lowest percentages of
    this type of thematic disagreement occurred in western (ASD 10–30) and south-central
    (ASD 60) districts that contained large expansive tracts of cropland. Table 3.

    similar general land cover patterns and depicted the major crop and non-crop features
    across the state as shown in the examples for eastern (ASD 80) and western (ASD
    30) Kansas in Fig. 7. Most classification disagreement was relatively localized
    as illustrated in ASD 80, where many small cropland patches classified in the
    Kansas GAP map were omitted from the MODIS map (Fig. 7b). This type of omission
    was common throughout the three eastern districts, as well as the central (ASD
    50) and north-central (ASD 40) districts. Many of the small non-crop patches in
    the MODIS map in disagreement with the Kansas GAP map were visually confirmed
    to be cropland using Landsat ETM+ imagery. This indicates that some smaller cropland
    features in central and eastern Kansas were spatially and/or spectrally inseparable
    from the surrounding non-crop areas in the MODIS 250 m NDVI data. Download : Download

    of pixel-level thematic agreement and disagreement between the MODIS and Kansas
    GAP crop/non-crop maps for southwest (ASD 30) (a) and east-central (ASD 80) (b)
    Kansas. Land cover conversion associated with the Conservation Reserve Program
    (CRP) also contributed to the classification disagreement between the maps. There
    was a 10-year difference between the acquisition times of the Landsat TM (early
    1990s) and MODIS (2001) source data used to produce the maps. Extensive land cover
    change (1.1 million ha) took place during this period, primarily in western Kansas,
    in the form of crop-to-grass and grass-to-crop conversions as lands entered or
    were removed from CRP (USDA, 1995). Many large blocks of thematic disagreement
    in the ASD 30 example (Fig. 7a) were due to CRP-related land cover changes rather
    than classification error in either of the maps. A visual assessment of Landsat
    imagery from the early 1990s and 2001 confirmed the land cover changes within
    many of these blocks. Another major source of disagreement occurred in the transitional
    areas between crop and non-cropland, where the pixels were often assigned to different
    classes in the two maps. Some disagreement might be expected in these locations
    because many edge pixels at the 250 m resolution are comprised of both crop and
    non-crop cover types, which leads to indistinct multi-temporal NDVI signals. This
    was confirmed during the cluster labeling stage of the unsupervised classification
    process, where most edge pixels were grouped into clusters that had relatively
    indistinguishable multi-temporal NDVI responses. The pixels in these clusters
    were labeled as non-crop in order to minimize the potential classification errors
    they would likely introduce into the subsequent crop classifications if assigned
    to the crop class. As a result, many edge pixels classified as crop in the Kansas
    GAP map disagreed with the MODIS map results. In general, edge pixel disagreement
    was restricted to a single pixel or small clumps of pixels and had a minimal influence
    on the crop/non-crop patterns classified in both maps, but its widespread occurrence
    across Kansas accounted for a large proportion of the total pixel-level thematic
    disagreement between the maps. 5.1.4. Areal comparison The MODIS map classified
    0.93 million (or 4.4%) fewer ha of cropland than the USDA reported. Less cropland
    area in the MODIS map relative to the USDA estimate is not surprising given the
    large number of pixels at the cropland edges that were assigned to the non-crop
    class and the omission of small crop patches that could not be resolved at 250
    m. The state-level areal results for the MODIS map are reasonable when compared
    to those from Landsat-derived LULC maps for Kansas. The classified crop area in
    the MODIS-derived map (9.24 million ha) was well within the range of the cropland
    area classified in the 30 m USGS NLCD (7.91 million ha) and Kansas GAP (10.30
    million ha) maps (Wardlow & Egbert, 2003). The classified and USDA reported crop
    areas had a high correlation (r = 0.98) across the nine ASDs, although the MODIS
    map consistently classified less crop area for each ASD (Fig. 8a). The best areal
    agreement (< 0.6 million ha or < 3.7% difference) occurred in districts that had
    large contiguous areas of cropland (ASDs 10, 30, 60, and 70). As expected, the
    remaining central (ASD 40 and 50) and eastern (80 and 90) districts had larger
    areal differences (ranging from 0.12 million ha (5.0%) in ASD 40 to 0.22 million
    ha (8.3%) in ASD 90) because of the omission of many small cropped areas. ASD
    20 also had a slightly higher areal difference (0.10 million ha or 5.0%) than
    the adjacent western ASDs, which reflects the difficulty encountered in classifying
    the extensive area of marginal non-irrigated cropland contained within this district
    ASD 20 has a larger proportion of non-irrigated cropland (92.4%) than the other
    western districts (84.1% in ASD 10 and 67.4% in ASD 30) (NASS, 2002) and during
    the unsupervised classification process, many of these areas exhibited a highly
    variable, indistinct multi-temporal NDVI signal because of increased drought stress
    on the vegetation. The NDVI signal was often similar to the surrounding sparse
    grassland, which resulted in some marginal cropland being classified as non-crop
    in ASD 20. Download : Download high-res image (913KB) Download : Download full-size

    cropland was classified for all ASDs in the crop/non-crop map(a). 5.2. General
    crop classification 5.2.1. Visual assessment The state-level patterns in the general
    crop map (Fig. 6b) were consistent with the cropping patterns reported for Kansas.
    The summer crop class was dominant throughout the eastern ASDs, where corn and
    soybeans are the major crops. In central Kansas, the winter wheat area clearly
    defined the Winter Wheat Belt in ASD 60, along with several other major wheat
    areas in ASDs 40 and 50. Summer crops in eastern ASD 40 corresponded to corn and
    soybeans planted at the edge of the Western Corn Belt and along the Republican
    River. In the western ASDs, the primary dryland crop classes of winter wheat and
    fallow were appropriately mapped in non-irrigated areas. Alfalfa and summer crops,
    which are primarily irrigated in western Kansas, were classified in the large
    areas of irrigated cropland, particularly in ASDs 10 and 30. Some summer crops
    were mapped in non-irrigated areas that corresponded to sorghum, which is commonly
    planted in dryland areas due to its higher drought tolerance (O''Brien et al.,
    1998). The classified crop patterns in the 250 m general crop map had a strong
    spatial correspondence to the cropping patterns that could be visually interpreted
    in the 30 m Landsat ETM+ imagery. Fig. 9 illustrates the local-scale cropping
    patterns that were classified with the MODIS 250 m NDVI data in southwest Kansas.
    The boundaries of many individual fields (ranging in size from 25 to 240 ha) and
    blocks of fields planted to the same crop were retained in the 250 m map. The
    level of spatial detail in the 250 m general crop map is further illustrated by
    an area of strip cropping where the narrow, alternating strips of fallow, summer
    crop, and winter wheat are clearly visible in both the map and image. Similar
    local-scale field patterns were found in the series of MODIS-derived 250 m crop
    maps throughout Kansas. Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download : Download

    Statistical accuracy assessment The general crop map had a high average overall
    accuracy (98.7%) and high class-specific user''s and producer''s accuracies (>
    97%) with minor differences across the 10 classification runs (< 3.5% within 1σ)
    (Table 2b). A relatively high classification accuracy might be expected given
    the unique crop calendars and multi-temporal NDVI responses of the general crop
    types as shown in Fig. 2. However, the extremely high accuracies calculated from
    the 20% of FSA field sites withheld for validation was unexpected. The use of
    a single pixel (from the field''s center) rather than an n × n pixel window to
    represent each site may have slightly inflated the classification accuracy for
    the map. The single pixel approach was utilized to minimize the potential of ‘mixed’
    pixels being included in the database and provide the highest quality data for
    training purposes. However, in doing so, a slight bias to overestimate classification
    accuracy may be introduced because the selected pixels generally had the most
    idealized time-series NDVI signatures for each class and would be the mostly likely
    to be correctly classified. A second accuracy assessment was performed using the
    445 crop validation pixels from the earlier crop/non-crop map assessment to determine
    the degree of possible accuracy inflation. An independent analyst assigned a general
    crop label to each pixel based on a visual assessment of each pixel''s multi-temporal
    NDVI behavior. The distinct spectral–temporal behavior of the general crop types
    allowed class labels to be assigned with a high level of confidence. The second
    accuracy assessment found an overall accuracy of 95.3%, and most class-specific
    accuracies ranged from 93% to 96% (Table 4). Accuracies using the randomly selected
    validation sites were generally 3–5% lower than those obtained using the FSA sites,
    which indicates that the accuracy inflation factor introduced in the FSA validation
    data was minimal. A second accuracy assessment was not conducted for the other
    crop maps because of the less distinctive multi-temporal NDVI signatures of their
    classes, but the accuracy inflation factor for them would be expected to be of
    a similar magnitude. Table 4. Accuracy assessment resultsa for the general crop

    the percent accuracy variability within 1 standard deviation of the average overall
    and class-specific accuracies across the 10 classification runs. The row and column
    totals in the error matrix may not equal the number of sites in the rows and columns
    because the values represent averages across the 10 runs that were rounded to
    the nearest whole number in the error matrix. Most of the classification error
    in the error matrix was associated with the fallow class, which was confused with
    both summer crops (6 of 7 misclassified sites were sorghum) and winter wheat.
    Most of the misclassified sites were located in the non-irrigated areas of semi-arid
    Kansas, where fields planted to these crops or in fallow can have highly variable
    multi-temporal NDVI signals that can result in reduced inter-class separability.
    Unplanted fallow fields have a broad range of cover types (bare soil, crop residue,
    and weed cover) and their spectral signal is dependent on the relative proportions
    of each cover. The NDVI signal from fallow fields can reflect cover conditions
    that range from non-vegetated to nearly fully vegetated. Winter wheat and sorghum,
    which are common dryland crops, can have a similar multi-temporal NDVI response
    to partially vegetated fallow fields when the crops are under severe to extreme
    drought stress, which can lead to the classification confusion observed between
    these classes. 5.2.3. Areal comparison The classified and USDA reported general
    crop areas had a high level of areal agreement at the state level (< 0.80 million
    ha (or < 6%) areal difference for each class). High overall (r = 0.93) and class-specific
    correlations (r > 0.90) were also found between the MODIS map and USDA area statistics
    across the nine ASDs (Fig. 8b). Less fallow and winter wheat were classified across
    all nine ASDs. The apparent underclassification of both classes was most pronounced
    in the western ASDs (10, 20, and 30), which reflects the omission of many marginal,
    non-irrigated cropland areas for this area in the initial crop/non-crop map that
    was discussed earlier. Summer crops had the lowest correlation (r = 0.72) and
    exhibited a clear east–west division in terms of specific areal differences. In
    eastern Kansas (ASDs 80 and 90), considerably less summer crop area was mapped
    (0.12 million ha) than the USDA reported (0.20 million ha). Most of this underclassification
    was attributed to the omission of many small cropland areas in these districts
    from the initial crop/non-crop map. Most of these fields would have been planted
    to summer crops and collectively, their omissions would result in considerably
    less summer crop area being mapped. In contrast, more summer crop area was classified
    (ranged from 0.07 to 0.19 million ha) in three western (ASDs 10, 20, and 30) districts,
    as well as the north-central district (ASD 40). The general crop map also classified
    more alfalfa in several eastern and central ASDs, with the greatest areal difference
    (0.06 million additional ha (> 16.0%)) in southeast Kansas (ASD 90). Alfalfa is
    a minor crop in this part of the state and comprises considerably less cropland
    area than was classified. A visual assessment of the time-series NDVI profiles
    for many areas classified as alfalfa in ASD 90 revealed that many were not alfalfa,
    but were rather double cropped, with winter wheat followed by a summer crop. A
    distinct bi-modal NDVI signature was detected for the double cropped fields (Fig.
    10). The assignment of double cropped fields to the alfalfa class is not surprising
    considering that both maintain relatively high NDVI values throughout most of
    the growing season unlike the other general crop types. Double cropping is also
    regularly implemented in other eastern and central ASDs because of favorable climate
    conditions, which would account for the consistent overclassification of alfalfa
    in these districts. Download : Download high-res image (276KB) Download : Download

    summer crop planted immediately after the late-June wheat harvest. A preliminary
    investigation of the time-series MODIS 250 m NDVI data to classify single vs.
    double cropped areas was undertaken using a limited number of double crop sites
    provided by the FSA. The same classification procedure used to generate the other
    crop maps was employed. Fig. 11 presents an example of the double/single crop
    classification results for ASD 90. The widespread use of double cropping in this
    district is apparent and clear block-shaped landscape features that correspond
    to individual fields (verified with Landsat ETM+ imagery) are depicted in the
    map. No statistical accuracy assessment could be performed given the lack of validation
    data, but this preliminary result illustrates the considerable potential that
    multi-temporal MODIS 250 m NDVI data hold for crop rotation mapping, as was recently
    demonstrated by the work of Morton et al. (2006) and Brown et al. (2007) in Brazil.

    Fig. 11. Double/single crop map derived from time-series MODIS 250 m NDVI data
    for southeast Kansas (ASD 90). 5.3. Summer crop classification 5.3.1. Visual assessment
    The summer crop patterns classified in Fig. 6c were in agreement with the known
    cropping patterns across Kansas. The dominance of corn and soybeans throughout
    eastern Kansas was represented. In central Kansas, the corn and soybeans planted
    along the Republican River (eastern ASD 40) and on irrigated cropland in northwest
    ASD 60 were depicted. Core areas of irrigated crops in the western ASDs, which
    are typically planted to corn (Rogers, 1994) and soybeans (Rogers, 1997), were
    classified. The east-to-west transition from corn and soybeans to sorghum in non-irrigated
    areas was mapped across central Kansas (ASDs 40 and 50). Sorghum, which is the
    primary dryland summer crop in western Kansas because of its drought-tolerant
    reputation (Rogers & Alam, 1998), was consistently classified in the non-irrigated
    areas of the western ASDs. 5.3.2. Statistical accuracy assessment The summer crop
    map had an average overall accuracy of 84.0% with class-specific accuracies generally
    greater than 80.0% (Table 2c). The error matrix showed that a similar level of
    classification confusion occurred among the three summer crop classes. 5.3.3.
    Areal comparison The classified and USDA reported summer crop areas were similar
    for each class at the state level with less than 0.25 million ha (< 2.0%) difference.
    An overall correlation of 0.76 was found for the summer crops across the nine
    ASDs (Fig. 8c). Class-specific comparisons revealed relatively high correlations
    for corn (r = 0.92) and sorghum (r = 0.86), but a much lower correlation for soybeans
    (r = 0.42). The lower correlation was primarily attributed to the considerable
    underclassification of soybeans in ASDs 80 (13.0% or 0.15 million fewer ha) and
    90 (32.5% or 0.18 million fewer ha). The higher soybean omissions were primarily
    due to the propagation of the cropland omission errors from the initial crop/non-crop
    map in these two districts. Most of these omitted cropland areas would have been
    planted to soybeans, which is the dominant summer crop in both ASDs. When the
    soybean areas for ASDs 80 and 90 were excluded from the correlation analysis,
    the overall and class correlations increased to 0.88 and 0.93, respectively. Other
    notable regional trends included the consistent overclassification of corn and
    soybeans in western Kansas (ASDs 10, 20, and 30) and the underclassification of
    sorghum in several west/central ASDs (10, 20, and 40). However, these ASD-level
    areal differences were still relatively minor (< 0.10 million ha difference).
    5.4. Irrigated/non-irrigated crop classification 5.4.1. Visual assessment Kansas''
    major irrigated crop areas were depicted in the irrigated/non-irrigated crop map
    (Fig. 6d). In western Kansas, the broad expanses of irrigated cropland in southern
    ASD 10, west-central ASD 20, and throughout ASD 30 were classified. In south-central
    Kansas, the large area of irrigated cropland in northwest ASD 60 was depicted.
    Irrigated corn and soybeans along both the Republican (northeast ASD 40) and Kansas
    (boundary between ASDs 70 and 80) Rivers were mapped. Numerous, isolated irrigated
    crops along many rivers and streams throughout central and eastern Kansas were
    also classified. The only major area of misclassification was the irrigated cropland
    classified in two counties (Brown and Doniphan) in extreme northeast Kansas (ASD
    70). This area primarily supports non-irrigated corn and soybeans and irrigation
    is very limited. USDA FSA officials reported that only 1–2% of cropland in these
    two counties was irrigated, whereas the MODIS-derived map classified 26.7% and
    34.9% of cropland in Brown and Doniphan Counties as irrigated. Higher than normal
    precipitation received during early to mid-summer in this area likely led to this
    major overclassification of irrigated crops. In 2001, Brown and Doniphan Counties
    received 206 and 218 mm of precipitation above the 10-year average, respectively
    (USDA, 2002). The precipitation totals for the remainder of Kansas'' counties
    were much closer to their 10-year averages. The majority of this additional rainfall
    was received during June and July, which corresponds to the greenup and peak growing
    season phases of both corn and soybeans. This optimally-timed additional rainfall
    resulted in better than normal crop conditions (e.g., larger plants/higher green
    biomass) and a multi-temporal NDVI response similar to that of an irrigated crop
    as illustrated in Fig. 12. The multi-temporal NDVI trajectory of non-irrigated
    corn in the two counties was similar to that of irrigated corn in the same ASD
    (80) with only minimal NDVI differences (0.03–0.07 NDVI units) at the peak of
    the growing season. Irrigated and non-irrigated crops are typically more separable
    in the NDVI data (> 0.10 NDVI difference) during the summer because of increased
    drought stress on non-irrigated crops as demonstrated for corn in Fig. 3. High
    corn and soybean yields for both counties in 2001 confirm the excellent crop conditions.
    Brown and Doniphan Counties had 23% and 14% higher corn yields and 23% and 17%
    higher soybean yields, respectively, than the previous 10-year average. In comparison,
    corn (state average of − 8%) and soybeans (state average of − 4%) yields were
    similar or slightly lower than the previous 10-year average for most of the other
    Kansas counties in 2001. Download : Download high-res image (313KB) Download :

    in Brown and Doniphan Counties (2-county average). 5.4.2. Statistical accuracy
    assessment The irrigated/non-irrigated crop map had an overall accuracy of 85.0%
    and class-specific accuracies generally greater than 80% (Table 2d). From the
    producer''s perspective, the majority of misclassification (65% or 42 sites) was
    the result of irrigated crops being classified as non-irrigated, which suggests
    that irrigated crops may have been underclassified in the map. 5.4.3. Areal comparison
    The state-level areal comparison confirmed that slightly less irrigated cropland
    (0.57 million ha or 5.0% less) was classified than the USDA reported. The mapped
    and reported irrigated crop areas had strong agreement (r = 0.95) across the nine
    ASDs. However, a clear east–west division in the areal differences appeared among
    the ASDs (Fig. 8d). The MODIS map contained more irrigated cropland than USDA
    reported for all three eastern ASDs. ASD 70 had a much larger areal discrepancy
    (0.13 million additional ha) than the other eastern districts (< 0.05 million
    additional ha) because of the major overclassification of irrigated lands in extreme
    northeastern Kansas, as previously noted. In central and western Kansas, the MODIS
    map consistently classified less irrigated cropland than USDA estimates. The largest
    areal discrepancies occurred in the three most extensively irrigated districts
    (ASD 10, 30, and 60) in Kansas (80.4% of state''s total irrigated land). The rate
    of underclassification increased as the percentage of irrigated land increased
    among the three districts. A visual comparison of the map and Landsat imagery
    for the three heavily irrigated ASDs revealed that some irrigated fields had been
    classified as non-irrigated, which would account for some of the underclassification.
    The majority of these fields were planted to either alfalfa or winter wheat, which
    suggests that it is more difficult to discriminate irrigated and non-irrigated
    fields planted to a crop with an early season, spring growth cycle using the NDVI
    data. Fig. 3 shows reduced separability between irrigated and non-irrigated winter
    wheat in the spring in the MODIS NDVI data compared to irrigated and non-irrigated
    corn in mid-summer. The consistent assignment of mixed edge pixels in transitional
    areas between irrigated and non-irrigated lands to the non-irrigated class also
    contributed to this underclassification. Perimeter pixels of irrigated areas usually
    maintained the general seasonal NDVI characteristics of the crop type being irrigated,
    but the NDVI values were considerably lower than those of the adjacent, interior
    pixels due to the lower NDVI contribution of the non-irrigated component of the
    mixed pixels as shown for alfalfa in Fig. 13. The lowered NDVI response from the
    edge pixels was similar to a non-irrigated crop and they were classified accordingly.
    Collectively, the assignment of these mixed pixels to the non-irrigated class
    resulted in less irrigated area being mapped, with the greatest reductions in
    the ASDs with extensive irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (363KB)

    m NDVI data provide a viable option for regional-scale crop mapping in the U.S.
    Central Great Plains. Relatively high classification accuracies (generally > 84%)
    were attained across the series of crop-related LULC maps produced for Kansas,
    and the classified crop patterns were consistent with the reported cropping patterns
    and crop distributions for the state. The classification accuracies were comparable
    to those of previous Landsat-based crop mapping studies conducted in Kansas (Mosiman,
    2003, Price et al., 1997). The general, landscape-level cropping patterns depicted
    in the maps were similar to those that could be visually interpreted from high
    resolution imagery and the boundaries of many individual fields were retained
    at 250 m spatial resolution. The MODIS-based mapping methodology proved to be
    extendable across Kansas. The state''s diverse environmental conditions, general
    landscape patterns, and cropping practices had only a minimal influence on the
    classification results. Some small, fragmented cropland areas in eastern Kansas
    could not be resolved at MODIS'' 250 m spatial resolution in the crop/non-crop
    map, but detailed cropping patterns within the larger cropland tracts were still
    depicted in the subsequent crop-related LULC maps. Mixed edge pixels at the 250
    m spatial scale led to a slight contraction of cropland (eastern Kansas) and irrigated
    areas (western Kansas) in the crop/non-crop and irrigated/non-irrigated crop maps
    in some parts of the state. Sub-pixel unmixing methods, which have been applied
    to MODIS 250 m data for LULC characterization (Hansen et al., 2002, Lobell and
    Asner, 2004), should be investigated to improve the classification results for
    these transitional areas in both maps. Large deviations in annual precipitation
    patterns also led to localized classification errors in the irrigated/non-irrigated
    crop map. However, the impact of Kansas'' climatic variations and specific weather
    patterns in 2001 on the classified patterns was negligible across the series of
    maps. Further work is needed to evaluate the performance of this MODIS NDVI-base
    mapping approach over multiple years and determine the sensitivity of the classification
    results to inter-annual variability for each crop-related LULC map. The classification
    of specific crop types was unaffected by their underlying management practice
    (e.g., irrigated vs. non-irrigated) with the exception of double cropping, which
    was not included in the classification scheme implemented in this study. The sensitivity
    of the time-series MODIS 250 m NDVI data to such a land use practice illustrates
    the potential for using a similar approach to characterize specific crop rotation
    sequences. This potential is beginning to be realized through the work of Morton
    et al. (2006) and Brown et al. (2007), but the identification of specific crop
    types in rotation sequences (e.g., corn–soybean or winter wheat–fallow–summer
    crop) has yet to be explored. The MODIS-based approach proved to be a cost- and
    time-efficient means for large-area crop mapping, which is critical for timely
    map updates and LULC monitoring activities. All data sources (MODIS, FSA, and
    NASS) used in the methodology are publicly available in the U.S. at little or
    no cost. Minimal preprocessing time was required to generate a statewide coverage
    of time-series NDVI data and the use of a decision tree classification approach
    resulted in rapid map production. The majority of time (∼ 6 months) required to
    implement this approach centered on the collection of training/validation data
    from the FSA aerial photos. The acquisition time for ground-truthed data could
    be greatly reduced in the near future with the development of statewide, field-level
    GIS databases, which would allow site selection to be automated and more stringent
    sampling schemes to be used. This study should be viewed as an initial step in
    the development of a MODIS-based mapping and monitoring protocol for large-area
    crop characterization. The classification results from this work represent a ‘baseline’
    that can be achieved using a time series of the standard, 16-day MODIS 250 m NDVI
    data. Numerous other variables that might improve the classification results of
    a particular thematic class(es) can be derived directly from MODIS 250 m spectral
    and VI data, such as vegetation phenology metrics (VPMs) (Reed et al., 1994),
    spectral metrics (DeFries et al., 1998), and harmonic analysis variables (Jakubauskas
    et al., 2001). The use of shorter, 8-day composite periods in the time-series
    NDVI data (derived from MODIS'' 250 m surface reflectance product (MOD09Q1)) should
    be explored for the discrimination of crops with a similar phenology (e.g., corn
    and soybeans). The higher temporal resolution may allow more subtle spectral–temporal
    differences to be detected between crop types, which could improve the classification
    results. The mapping protocol should also be tested for additional crop types
    (e.g., cotton and sunflowers) and in other major agricultural regions to determine
    the range of its applicability. The crop-related LULC maps produced in this study
    represent a valuable source of information for many applications. Maps depicting
    spatial distributions of specific crop types and associated land use practices
    can be used by the environmental modeling community to better parameterize biogeochemical
    (Burke et al., 1991, Parton et al., 1998), land–atmosphere interaction (Dickinson
    et al., 1993), water quality (Young et al., 1989), and crop yield (Kastens et
    al., 2005) models. In addition, these types of maps when updated on an annual
    basis can be used by scientists and policy makers to better understand the role
    and response of regional-scale agricultural management practices in a variety
    of environmental issues. The MODIS VI-based mapping methodology presented in this
    paper offers the potential to acquire information about rapid LULC changes such
    as crop rotations and the conversion of CRP grasslands back to crop production,
    as well as more gradual changes such as a shift to more drought-tolerant crop
    types or the expanded use of conservation tillage methods in locations facing
    rapid depletion of groundwater resources and/or drier climate conditions. It is
    also hoped that the MODIS crop mapping results presented in this paper stimulate
    the use of MODIS 250 m VI data and similar classification methods for other types
    of LULC mapping and characterization activities. Acknowledgements This research

    requirements of a fully connected world and provide ubiquitous wireless connectivity
    for all. Transformative solutions are expected to drive the surge for accommodating
    a rapidly growing number of intelligent devices and services. Major technological
    breakthroughs to achieve connectivity goals within 6G include: (i) a network operating
    at the THz band with much wider spectrum resources, (ii) intelligent communication
    environments that enable a wireless propagation environment with active signal
    transmission and reception, (iii) pervasive artificial intelligence, (iv) large-scale
    network automation, (v) an all-spectrum reconfigurable front-end for dynamic spectrum
    access, (vi) ambient backscatter communications for energy savings, (vii) the
    Internet of Space Things enabled by CubeSats and UAVs, and (viii) cell-free massive
    MIMO communication networks. In this roadmap paper, use cases for these enabling
    techniques as well as recent advancements on related topics are highlighted, and
    open problems with possible solutions are discussed, followed by a development
    timeline outlining the worldwide efforts in the realization of 6G. Going beyond
    6G, promising early-stage technologies such as the Internet of NanoThings, the
    Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications, which are expected to have
    a far-reaching impact on wireless communications, have also been discussed at
    length in this paper. The envisioned key enabling technologies for 6G and beyond

    I. Introduction Wireless communication systems have experienced substantial revolutionary
    progress over the past few years. Various stakeholders, including commercial solutions
    providers, academic research groups, standards bodies, and end-users, have all
    greatly benefited from the radical changes led by the most recent 5G developments,
    which include paradigm-defining techniques such as network softwarization and
    virtualization, massive MIMO, ultra-densification, and the introduction of new
    frequency bands. Numerous burgeoning applications and verticals, including virtual
    and augmented reality (VAR), e-commerce, contactless payment, machine-to-machine
    communications, and enhanced mobile broadband, among others, have demonstrated
    the vast potential of 5G, which continues to evolve and adapt to a wide variety
    of emerging use cases. However, as societal needs continue to evolve, there has
    been a marked rise in a plethora of emerging use cases that cannot be served satisfactorily
    with 5G. For example, the next generation of VAR, i.e., holographic teleportation,
    requires Tbps-level data rates and microsecond-level latency, which cannot be
    achieved with even the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands within 5G. Further,
    increasing industrial automation and the move from Industry 4.0 to the upcoming
    Industry X.0 paradigm will push connectivity density well beyond the 10 6 k m
    2 metric that 5G is designed for, in addition to requiring an overhaul of existing
    network management practices. Further, an increase in the connection density will
    also result in demands for improved energy efficiency, which 5G is not designed
    for. Consequently, the research community has gravitated towards addressing the
    aforementioned major challenges, and we posit that ongoing research in the domains
    of terahertz band communications, intelligent surfaces and environments, and network
    automation, for example, may very well hold the key to the future of wireless.
    To this end, an amalgamation of societal needs and technological breakthroughs
    that serve to enable those needs are the key drivers for a generational leap beyond
    existing wireless systems. Together, these factors make a strong case for a focused
    discourse on the next frontier in wireless communications, i.e., 6G systems. We
    envision that 6G will not only enable a pervasively intelligent, reliable, scalable,
    and secure terrestrial wireless network, but will also incorporate space communications
    to form an omnipresent wireless network, in keeping with the need for true wireless
    ubiquity. This paper details our vision for the future of wireless communications,
    highlighting emerging use cases and detailing the key enabling technologies that
    are essential to the realization of 6G. We begin our discussion on 6G by formally
    introducing the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are expected to guide the
    design of 6G systems. While the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
    is working on a set of official recommendations for the KPI metrics, the tentative
    values have appeared in the public domain recently [1]. Table 1 presents these
    values and contrasts them against the metrics associated with 5G. These KPIs serve
    as the fundamental metrics to evaluate system performance. In particular, from
    the table, we note the following classes of KPIs: System Capacity: This class
    of KPIs primarily deals with metrics that are associated with system throughput.
    These include peak data rate, experienced data rate, peak spectral efficiency,
    experienced spectral efficiency, maximum channel bandwidth, area traffic capacity,
    and connection density. Within this context, the experienced data rate and spectral
    efficiency metrics refer to the values that should be guaranteed to 95% of all
    user locations [1]. System Latency: This class of KPIs includes the end-to-end
    latency metric, along with delay jitter. We note that jitter is a new KPI for
    6G that quantifies the latency variations in the system, and is absent from 5G.
    System Management: This class of KPIs primarily deals with metrics related to
    the management and orchestration of networks such as energy efficiency, reliability,
    and mobility. Here too we note that while 5G does not specify a target KPI for
    the energy efficiency metric, 6G introduces a target energy efficiency of 1 Tb/J.
    Achieving the KPIs highlighted in Table 1 will require revolutionary breakthroughs
    across all domains of wireless communications. In particular, we identify the
    following major thrusts: New Spectrum Usage and Radio Design Paradigms: While
    5G ensured the mainstream adoption of mmWave spectrum, the need for higher data
    rates and consequently larger channel bandwidths will necessitate the incorporation
    of terahertz (THz) and sub-THz spectrum within 6G. At the same time, the opening
    up of new spectrum bands will also require novel radio designs that can simultaneously
    sense and communicate over the entire EM spectrum. Novel Network Architectures:
    The classical cell-based architecture of wireless networks cannot scale to meet
    the area traffic capacity and connection density requirements put forth by 6G.
    Instead, 6G will need to incorporate communications infrastructure into the very
    fabric of the environment. Increasing Intelligence and Automation: The strict
    spectral efficiency, reliability, and latency requirements associated with 6G
    imply that manual configuration of the network will no longer be possible. Rather,
    network intelligence and automation will occupy centre stage, helping build an
    increasingly autonomous network. Enhancing Network Coverage Beyond the Terrestrial
    Domain: In order to achieve true wireless ubiquity, 6G will need to expand beyond
    terrestrial networks, incorporating both near-Earth as well as deep-space connectivity.
    TABLE 1 The Evolution From 5G to 6G Wireless Systems [1] Towards the fulfillment
    of this grand vision, we note that several enabling solutions have been conceived
    and are being actively studied. As shown in Figure 1, these technologies include:
    (i) a network operating at the THz band with abundant spectrum resources, (ii)
    intelligent communication environments that enable a wireless propagation environment
    with active signal transmission and reception, (iii) pervasive artificial intelligence,
    (iv) large-scale network automation, (v) an all-spectrum reconfigurable front-end
    for dynamic spectrum access, (vi) ambient backscatter communications for energy
    savings, (vii) the Internet of Space Things enabled by CubeSats and UAVs, and
    (viii) cell-free massive MIMO communication networks. We also make note of three
    very promising technologies that are expected to shape the future of communications,
    yet will not be sufficiently mature for 6G. These include: (i) the Internet of
    NanoThings, (ii) the Internet of BioNanoThings, and (iii) quantum communications.
    Further, in addition to the aforementioned key technologies, holistic security
    solutions will also be vital to the success of 6G. However, these fall outside
    the purview of this paper. FIGURE 1. The envisioned key enabling technologies
    for 6G and beyond wireless communications systems. Show All Further, we posit
    that while prior art concerning 6G wireless systems has been become increasingly
    commonplace over the past year [2]–[7], a majority of the past publications in
    this domain focus on a select few topics, potentially hampering a comprehensive
    overview in terms of key aspects that are expected to shape the future of wireless
    communications. In addition, discussion concerning beyond 6G systems such as the
    Internet of NanoThings, the Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications
    is equally critical but largely absent from existing publications. As research
    on 6G wireless systems continues to evolve and break new ground, this paper is
    intended to equip readers with a targeted insight into the next generation of
    wireless communications. More specifically, through this paper, we aim to deliver
    a holistic roadmap for 6G and beyond wireless systems, replete with a detailed
    discussion surrounding the use cases and key enabling technologies. The larger
    goal here is to encourage the scientific community to work together towards tackling
    the critical research challenges associated with the realization of the 6G systems.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present a wide
    variety of use cases that will be enabled by 6G. Further, Sections III–VI present
    details concerning key technologies that are critical to the success of 6G, along
    with a discussion on the major challenges faced by each. Then, in Section XI,
    we discuss promising enablers for beyond 6G systems, followed by a timeline for
    the evolution of 6G in Section XII. Finally, in Section XIII, we conclude this
    paper. SECTION II. Use Cases The lessons learned from the continued evolution
    of 5G systems will serve as the backdrop for use cases that will be best served
    by 6G. 5G first introduced the targeted use cases of enhanced mobile broadband
    (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine
    type communications (mMTC), intended to serve a wide variety of applications.
    However, as noted in Section I, there exist a plethora of applications for which
    the 5G KPIs are not strict enough. As we come to realize the performance trade-offs
    in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, energy efficiency, and reliability,
    associated with 5G systems, we can better posit the applications that would benefit
    the most from 6G. As shown in Figure 2, in the following, we present a variety
    of critical use cases that will be enabled by 6G. FIGURE 2. Use cases best served
    by 6G systems. Show All A. Multi-Sensory Holographic Teleportation While virtual
    reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have immensely benefited from eMBB and
    URLLC introduced as part of 5G, there are many applications such as advanced healthcare
    including remote diagnosis and surgery, high-resolution sensing for remote exploration,
    and near-real person video conferencing that cannot be adequately served by a
    combination of AR and VR. To this end, holographic teleportation has been recognized
    as the natural successor to AR and VR-based solutions. Unlike existing solutions,
    holographic teleportation operates in a true three-dimensional space and leverages
    all five senses– sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, to provide a truly immersive
    experience. At the same time, we note that holographic teleportation requires
    data rates close to 5 Tbps and an end-to-end latency of less than 1 ms [8], both
    of which are impossible to achieve with 5G systems. Thus, 6G, with its expected
    Tbps-level throughput and sub-millisecond latencies, will play a vital role in
    building upon the groundwork established by eMBB and URLLC. B. Real-Time Remote
    Healthcare The success of remote healthcare solutions primarily depends on both
    the quality as well as the availability of connectivity [9]. Concerning the former,
    we note that through its use of key enabling technologies such as THz band communications
    and network automation solutions, 6G will usher in the highest possible wireless
    communications quality focusing on very-high throughput augmented with ultra-low
    latency. Concerning the latter, the Internet of Space Things will play a vital
    role in providing pervasive connectivity, thus enhancing the availability of rural
    healthcare solutions. Further, we expect that within the domain of healthcare,
    advances in 6G and beyond will not only serve as a connectivity solution, but
    will also play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases as detailed
    in Section XI-B. C. Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems Autonomous vehicles and
    UAVs are some of the most promising cyber-physical systems in existence today
    [10], [11]. The operation of these autonomous systems is characterized by the
    exchange of large amounts of data between the constituent nodes, i.e., both vehicles
    and UAVs, relating to high-resolution real-time mapping of the terrain, route
    optimization, and traffic and safety information. While the resulting large volumes
    of data must be delivered within strict deadlines in an error-free manner, it
    also imperative to note that these nodes typically operate at speeds in excess
    of 100 km/h. Therefore in addition to providing sub-millisecond latency and very
    high reliability, the connectivity solution that enables autonomous cyber-physical
    systems must also offer robust operation at very high speeds, which is not possible
    with existing 5G systems [12]. D. Intelligent Industrial Automation Over the past
    few years, Industry 4.0 [13] has been the driving force behind industrial automation
    based on the concepts of supply chain optimization, autonomous equipment, additive
    manufacturing, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Yet, these concepts
    are treated as silos working in isolation, limiting the true potential of industrial
    automation. On the other hand, the upcoming Industry X.0 paradigm [14] seeks to
    realize synergies between the various nuances of industrial automation through
    its use of artificial intelligence. Vital to this vision are networked factories
    that serve as critical sources of big data that helps inform decision making.
    To this end, the modern industrial floor is expected to require reliable high-throughput
    connectivity across thousands of devices often with sub-millisecond response times,
    making it the perfect use case for the next frontier in wireless communications.
    E. High-Performance Precision Agriculture Within the broader domain of precision
    agriculture, soil moisture measurements have been a mainstay in irrigation decisions
    for decades now. However, real-time measurements and irrigation automation solutions
    still face challenges stemming from a lack of robust wireless coverage. Going
    beyond simple automated irrigation solutions, high-performance precision agriculture
    is largely centered around delivering data-driven insights to address the specific
    needs of customers, farms, crop, and soil. At the same time, scalable and timely
    access to such data is a major challenge owing to gaps in rural connectivity.
    Therefore, we expect that 6G, with its focus on ubiquitous wireless access, will
    play a major role in enhancing the adoption of technology in agricultural production.
    F. Space Connectivity While near-Earth and deep-space connectivity are still nascent
    within 5G, there are a wide variety of use cases ranging from radio astronomy
    and remote sensing to navigation and backhauling that would stand to benefit from
    the pervasive connectivity offered by 6G. More specifically, such applications
    include freight tracking, terrestrial cellular offloading, environmental monitoring,
    and long-range UAV coordination, to name a few. To this end, the Internet of Space
    Things as described in Section IX, will serve as the key enabling technology for
    beyond-Earth connectivity, furthering the reach of 6G systems. G. Smart Infrastructure
    and Environments The use cases discussed thus far primarily deal with the use
    of third-party systems that seek to leverage advanced telecommunications infrastructure.
    Simultaneously, the evolution of such infrastructure itself is an important use
    case. Going beyond network optimization strategies, there is also a need for exercising
    control over the propagation of wireless signals. To this end, we note that in
    5G and its predecessor systems, the wireless communication environment has always
    played a passive role. However, with the ever increasing demand for data, as evidenced
    by the applications presented herein, control over the manner in which electromagnetic
    waves interact with the indoor and outdoor environment will be critical to the
    success of 6G. In this direction, we posit that the intelligent communication
    environments described in Section IV will play a leading role in the ubiquity
    and pervasiveness of the next generation of wireless systems. SECTION III. Terahertz
    Band Communications Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in wireless data
    traffic brought forth by numerous exciting technologies in wireless communications.
    This exponential growth has been accompanied by the demand for higher data rates
    and better coverage [15]. Among emerging research and development trends in wireless
    communications, terahertz band (0.1-10 THz) communications has been envisioned
    as one of the key enabling technologies for the next decade. Buoyed by the availability
    of ultra-wide spectrum resources, the THz band can provide terabits per second
    (Tbps) links for a plethora of applications, ranging from ultra-fast massive data
    transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks
    to high-definition videoconferencing among mobile devices in small cells. Recently,
    the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released the frequency bands above
    95 GHz for research purposes [16]. While a handful of cellular operators have
    adopted low millimeter wave frequencies for their 5G services with the intention
    of achieving a maximum data rate of 100 Gbps, the test results thus far leave
    much to be desired, showing a peak data rate of around 1 Gbps.1 This gap between
    the targeted and practically achievable data rates is influenced by multiple factors,
    including a high complexity in realistic communication channels, imperfections
    in circuitry design, and interference from other systems operating in adjacent
    frequency bands, among others. Nevertheless, even though the THz bands have been
    applied in imaging and object detection, as well as for THz radiation spectroscopy
    in astronomical research, their use cases in wireless communications are still
    under investigation. Lying between the mmWave spectrum and infrared light spectrum,
    as shown in Figure 3, THz bands, with their abundant spectrum resources, have
    been previously deemed as a “no-man’s land”. However, major progress in the domains
    of transceiver and antenna design has seen THz links become a promising option
    for realizing indoor communications networks. More recently, there has been significant
    progress on realizing wireless network on chip (WNoC) using THz bands [17]. FIGURE
    3. The THz band offers hundreds of GHz usable spectrum resources for wireless
    communication links in long, medium, short, indoor, and near-field range. Show
    All A. Use Cases of THz Band Communications Different from wireless networks at
    lower frequencies, THz-band wireless communications has several unconventional
    application scenarios, owing to the distinct electromagnetic and photonics characteristics
    of this tremendously high frequency band. In addition to the promised Tbps-level
    links for cellular systems, THz-band spectrum can also be leveraged for the following
    scenarios: Local Area Networks: Several spectrum windows are feasible for short-range
    links within ten meters, including 625-725 GHz and 780-910 GHz [18]. THz band
    communications is expected to form the THz-optics bridge to enable seamless transition
    between fiber-optics and THz-band links with zero latency. Personal Area Networks:
    THz band communications can provide “fiber-like” data rate without the need of
    wires, between multiple devices at a distance of a few meters. Such communication
    scenarios can be found in indoor offices and multimedia kiosks. Data Center Networks:
    Conventional data centers manage and maintain connectivity in wired networks using
    cables, resulting in high costs in terms of both installation and reconfiguration.
    On the other hand, THz links provide promising prospects for seamless connectivity
    at ultra-high-speeds in fixed networks and adaptability for hardware reconfiguration.
    Wireless Network on Chip: As the trend in transceiver hardware development motivates
    a higher level of integration and miniaturization as well as weight reduction,
    the THz band links can serve as a promising candidate to establish wireless connections
    among different modules within the transceiver chassis, in order to replace the
    wired connections commonly found in existing transceiver hardware products. Nano-networks:
    With its wavelength falling into the nanometer (10−9 m) range, the THz band can
    operate better than any other frequencies in nano-networks. Within this context,
    a nano-network is a set of interconnected nano-devices or nano-machines for information
    exchange, storage, and computation. A more detailed overview can be found in Section
    XI-A. Inter-satellite Communications: Lying largely outside the Earth’s atmosphere,
    inter-satellite links are not constrained by atmospheric attenuation, which makes
    the THz band a favorable candidate for such communication links. Compared to existing
    spectrum resources allocated for inter-satellite links, the THz band has a much
    wider bandwidth which can accommodate more satellites and achieve higher link
    performance. Unlike the widely used optical links, the THz band does not impose
    stringent requirements on beam alignment, which can help maintain a high level
    of link stability as satellites drift out of their orbits. B. Devices in the THz
    Band The need for higher output power, lower phase noise, and better receiving
    sensitivity in THz band transceivers has driven advances in corresponding device
    development. Currently, three main directions are deployed in THz band signal
    generation: photonics-based, electronic-based, and emerging material-based, respectively.
    In the photonics-based approach, many III-V semiconductors, including gallium
    arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP), which provide high electron mobility,
    are excellent candidates especially for high frequency (i.e., above 100 GHz) applications.
    Such photonics-based techniques generate time-domain pulses with lengths of femto-seconds
    (10−15 s) and experimental works have demonstrated 50 Gbps data links in an indoor
    scenario at 300 GHz using the uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) technique
    [19]. The UTC-PDs and modified UTC-PD structures, an effective photomixing solution
    which allows wider spectrum tuning and simpler construction compared to laser
    pulse generators, has pushed the output signal range from 300 GHz to 2.5 THz,
    with output powers of 10 μW at 300 GHz and 1 μW at 1 THz [20]. Additionally, a
    design based on slot-antenna-integrated UTC-PDs has shown superior performance
    in generated THz band signal strengths at 350-850 GHz and 900 GHz-1.6 THz, compared
    to that of the bowtie-antenna integrated UTC-PD [21]. Similar photonics-based
    THz signal generation at above 1 THz can be realized using quantum cascade lasers
    (QCLs) and other solid state lasers [22]. However, the operations of such devices
    are limited at room temperatures, requiring liquid helium cooling, which affects
    their deployment in local area networks with space restrictions. Furthermore,
    photoconductive antennas (PCAs) have been utilized widely for both pulse and continuous-wave
    signal generation at THz band [23], demonstrating a wide spectrum (up to 4.5 THz)
    with a remarkable dynamic range of up to 100 dB [24]. In parallel to the photonics-based
    approach for THz band device design which down-converts the optical frequencies,
    the electronic-based THz band signal generation relies on frequency up-conversion
    using multipliers [25], including frequency doublers and triplers, as well as
    backward wave oscillators [26]. A recent experiment has demonstrated an all-electronics-based
    wireless link at 240 GHz with a throughput of 50 Gbps and a maximum 29% error
    vector magnitude using QPSK modulation [27]. The backward wave oscillator, which
    is a compact design to generate THz band signals based on the mechanism of energy
    transfer from an electron beam to an electromagnetic wave through a vacuum tube,
    has been used to generate signals at 300 GHz with an output power of 1 W in plasma
    diagnostics [26]. Among the two commonly used approaches, the photonics-based
    design benefits from a relatively simpler transceiver architecture based on the
    photomixing technique, while the electronics-based solution relies on cascaded
    frequency up-conversion of RF signals, which sets stringent requirements on linear-range
    operation and potentially limits the terahertz bandwidth. On the other hand, the
    electronics-based approach is less sensitive to environmental conditions, such
    as temperature, humidity, among others, which makes it more favorable for outdoor
    operations, whereas the link reliability from its photonics-based counterpart
    is affected by scattered particles in the channel, making the THz band link less
    robust. Besides these classical approaches for THz band device development, new
    materials, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanoribbons, are
    gaining more attention due to their extremely high electron mobility in the order
    of 8,000−10,000c m 2 /(V⋅s) at room temperature, as compared to 1,400 c m 2 /(V⋅s)
    of silicon, and 8,500 c m 2 /(V⋅s) of GaAs, which means that the link throughput
    can be potentially up to ten times higher than is currently achievable with most
    semiconductors [28]. The graphene-based devices, offering outstanding mechanical,
    electrical, and optical properties, have been utilized in the development of power
    detectors at 600 GHz [29] and 200 GHz [30], as well as plasmonic antenna arrays
    and transceivers [31], [32]. Graphene-based devices have the potential to break
    new ground in reaching the desired level of performance at much higher frequencies
    above 1 THz. C. Physical Layer Modeling at the THz Band The realization of wireless
    communications at THz frequencies requires the development of accurate channel
    models to capture the impact of both channel peculiarities including the high
    atmospheric attenuation and molecular absorption rates at various transmission
    windows, as well as the propagation effects including reflection, scattering,
    and diffraction, with respect to different materials. Current research has reported
    several efforts to provide fundamental understanding of such channels. For example,
    an early work in [33] demonstrates the remarkable capacity the THz band channel
    can support for short transmission distances. The model provides a detail analysis
    on the effect of attenuation caused by the molecular absorption and spreading
    loss, on which the performance of channel throughput is heavily dependent. One
    step further, in order to extend the transmission distance at THz bands, an idea
    dubbed as the ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM MIMO) communications,
    enabled by an element array size of 1024×1024 with plasmonic nano-antennas, can
    drastically boost the signal strength by steering and focusing the transmitted
    beams in both space and frequency [34]. Correspondingly, a UM MIMO channel model
    has been developed in [35] which takes into account the role of such arrays. Additionally,
    a stochastic channel model for indoor THz band communications at 300 GHz has been
    reported in [36] which characterizes both spatial and temporal domain channel
    information. More recently, based on the aforementioned applicable scenarios in
    the THz band, a stochastic channel model for kiosk applications has been reported
    in [37] which ranges from 200-340 GHz. The main takeaway from current models validated
    using either measurements or the ray-tracing technique is that the direct path
    between the transmitter and the receiver and the single-bounce reflected paths
    dominate the received power, while other channel effects, including diffraction
    and scattering, attenuate power significantly along propagation. On the basis
    of the ultra-wideband channel characterization, THz band communications faces
    a critical and challenging task of synchronization in the receiver design. Existing
    pulse-based modulation schemes permit the use of low-complexity non-coherent analogue
    detectors, e.g., energy detector and auto-correlation receiver, which involve
    the multiplication of the received signal with itself, followed by an integrator.
    However, a more advanced non-coherent receiver architecture in [38] based on a
    continuous time moving average symbol detection scheme demonstrates better performance
    compared to previous detection schemes for pulse-based modulations in terms of
    the symbol error rate. In addition, robust frequency and timing synchronization
    for multi-carrier communication in the THz band is desirable to decode multiple
    incoming signal streams. The work presented in [39] realizes both a low-rate sampling
    scheme for channels with high SNR values and a maximum likelihood-based algorithm
    for low SNR channels with satisfying bit-error-rate performance. More recently,
    a synchronization scheme based on medium access control protocols is reported
    in [40], which shows good performance in both a macro-scale scenario to overcome
    the distance limitation at the THz band and a nano-scale scenario for nano-devices
    for energy harvesting. Similarly, given the peculiar ultra-wideband nature and
    frequency selectivity of THz band communications, equalization solutions pose
    another relevant challenge [15], [41]. In [42], three equalization solutions,
    including the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding, a waveform with interference management
    for time-reversal systems, and an iterative algorithm with adaptive soft feedback,
    are reviewed and compared for an indoor channel. Results show that the iterative
    algorithm with adaptive soft feedback yields the most promising BER performance
    [42]. D. Medium Access Control in THz Band Communications On top of physical layer
    channel models, the medium access control (MAC) schemes in THz band communications
    should adopt certain spatial and spectral features in order to provide solutions
    in resolving issues such as the deafness problem and LoS blockage, among others
    [43], [44]. Different from commonly used MAC solutions in RF systems that utilize
    omnidirectional antennas, such as carrier sense multiple access with collision
    avoidance (CSMA/CA), the MAC protocols designed for THz band rely on handshakes
    between transceivers with highly directional beams. These razor-sharp beams can
    provide higher power radiation gain and prolong the transmission distance, but
    when misalignment happens, the deafness problem arises. As such, the deafness
    avoidance approach is required in MAC scheme design. Existing solutions utilized
    in IEEE 802.15.3c [45] and others employ a beam-training phase to estimate and
    steer beams towards destined devices. Recent works also propose methods based
    on angular division multiplexing [46] and a priori aided channel tracking schemes
    [47]. The results in such proposed solutions suggest that with good beam alignment
    strategies the channel throughput can be improved significantly. Moreover, the
    MAC protocols can also resolve the issue of LoS blockage where the received power
    of a user device may undergo deep fading due to the device being held in a manner
    that blocks the LoS path. Studies have shown that such attenuation by the human
    body can be as high as 20 dB at 60 GHz and up [49], [50]. To mitigate the blockage
    problem, researchers have proposed a multi-hop scheme at the mmWave and THz bands
    to form alternative routes [51], [52]. A careful link-level scheduling and neighbor
    discovery process is necessary to achieve high throughput while maintaining low
    interference. E. Open Problems in THz Band Communications Currently, the fabrication
    and testing of THz band antenna arrays remains a relevant challenge. Some techniques
    based on photolithography, electro-beam lithography, among others, are able to
    produce the front-end with hundreds of plasmonic antenna elements. The utilization
    of large antenna arrays can extend the signal coverage by forming array radiation
    patterns with main lobes of high directivity, thus focusing energy towards desired
    directions. However, such highly directional beams limit coverage in the angular
    domain, causing low energy efficiency at the transmitter to serve each user. A
    recent solution named “THzPrism” has been proposed to form multiple beams with
    slight frequency shifts towards different directions while maintaining good distance
    coverage [53] in addition to other proposed solutions discussed in Section III-C
    to solve the transmission distance problem. This design employs true time delays
    for RF chains before phase-shifters to obtain a prism-like effect, which spreads
    the original beam into several beams, each with a slight frequency shift with
    respect to the center frequency. In parallel to the quest for more novel solutions
    in antenna design, other remaining challenges reside in the control and signal
    processing schemes associated with transceiver designs in the THz band. On the
    one hand, real-time control algorithms are needed. On the other hand, communication
    protocols for coordination between the transmitter, receiver, and reflectarrays
    are needed. Among others, in [54], researchers reported a smart reflectarray-assisted
    mmWave system compatible with IEEE 802.11ad. Besides the design of the reflectarray
    and a study on deployment strategies, a three-way beam-searching protocol is developed,
    in which the reflectarray coordinates with the transmitter through a 2.4 GHz control
    channel in order to discover the best joint transmit and reflect sectors for which
    the signal at the receiver is maximized. However, this work does not capture the
    extended functionalities of plasmonic reflectarrays. Furthermore, when highly
    directional beams are utilized at mobile transceivers, a relevant challenge arises
    from the limited field-of-view of antenna arrays for each transceiver to locate
    the next hop to forward its data; thus, new routing solutions are necessary for
    THz band communications to efficiently discover and establish links. A study in
    [55] reports a solution in link discovery at THz band using a leaky-wave antenna
    to sense the angular information of a user. SECTION IV. Intelligent Communication
    Environments Along with the rapid growth in the number of wireless devices, services,
    and applications, a corresponding demand for higher speed wireless communications
    has burgeoned in recent years. Nevertheless, the major challenge at mmWave and
    THz-band frequencies is the limited communication distance because of the remarkably
    high path loss inherent to small wavelengths and the limited transmission power
    of mmWave and THz-band transceivers [56]. Current solutions primarily focus on
    the advancement of wireless transceiver hardware and software, as well as network
    optimization strategies. However, the wireless propagation medium has been largely
    neglected. The wireless communication environments, for both indoor and outdoor
    scenarios, can be actively utilized in order to become controllable for signal
    propagation. To control signal propagation in environments is essentially to control
    how electromagnetic waves interact with scatterers, which include indoor furniture
    and outdoor buildings as well as other infrastructure. Typically, the controllable
    behaviors of electromagnetic waves include controlled reflection, absorption,
    wave collimation, signal waveguiding, and polarization tuning, as illustrated
    in Figure 4. The notion of “Intelligent Communication Environments” resides in
    the control algorithms where deep learning and reinforcement learning are to be
    exploited to dynamically configure the environments. In the following subsections,
    we elaborate on these controllable wave behaviors, current research efforts, as
    well as corresponding open issues. FIGURE 4. Conceptual design of a plasmonic
    reflectarray able to unconventionally manipulate EM waves [48]. Show All A. Basics
    of Intelligent Communication Environments The intelligent environments can be
    seen as a three-dimensional structure with several layers, each with different
    functionalities. Recent research under the EU Research Project “VisorSurf” has
    demonstrated a structure with five main layers, which are (from top to bottom)
    the EM behavior layer, the actuation and sensing layer, the shielding layer, the
    computing layer, and the communication layer, respectively [57]. Specifically,
    the EM behavior layer is composed of metasurfaces, a two-dimensional representation
    of metamaterials, and has a tunable impedance to control directions of reflection
    of the EM waves. Some other works use reflectarray antennas as the top surface
    [58], [59]. The actuation and sensing layer consists of circuits for phase shifting
    and sensors for impinging signal sensing. Some options for actuation include PIN
    diodes with controllable biasing voltage as switches in reflectarray antennas,
    and complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) transistors as well as micro-electro-mechanical
    (MEMS) switches for metasurfaces. The shielding layer isolates the upper and lower
    parts of the layered structure so as to minimize the possible interference. The
    computing layer serves to control the phase shifts and process sensed impinging
    waves. To this end, another reported solution makes use of field-programmable
    gated arrays (FPGAs) to fulfill such functions on metasurfaces [60]. Finally,
    the communication layer connects all upper layers and serves as the gateway towards
    the central controller which processes all connection requests, forwards and receives
    signals, and conducts the aforementioned controlled wave functions. Compared to
    existing relays with multiple antennas which are widely deployed in wireless networks,
    Intelligent Communication Environments offer the following advantages: (i) a higher
    spatial diversity due to the wide coverage of the intelligent surface with controllable
    antenna arrays, (ii) a reduced processing time given that the computing and communication
    layers are directly underneath the surface layer, and (iii) a higher flexibility
    in network routing when impinging signals come from different directions and the
    intelligent surfaces are able to collimate waves and reflect them towards desired
    directions. B. Functionalities of Intelligent Environments Bolstered by the layered
    structure, intelligent surfaces can enable controlled EM wave operations. At micro-
    and mmWave frequencies, metasurfaces are considered as a good candidate. While
    at THz bands, graphene-based plasmonic antenna arrays are desirable. In metasurfaces,
    a meta-atom is the smallest unit, which is a conductor with a size smaller than
    half the wavelength of the signal. Metasurfaces can thus control the impinging
    EM waves with a very fine granularity. The meta-atoms are interconnected by a
    set of miniaturized controllers that connect the switches of the metasurfaces
    in the computing layer, while a gateway serves as the connectivity unit in the
    communication layer to provide inter-element and external control. At THz bands,
    when the metasurfaces do not yield optimal performance, the graphene-based plasmonic
    antenna arrays serve as a promising alternative. Compared to metallic antenna
    arrays, the plasmonic antenna arrays can have much denser element layout and go
    beyond the conventional λ/2 sampling of space towards more precise space and frequency
    beamforming, owing to the physics of plasmonics. In our previous work, we have
    demonstrated that, graphene can be used to build nano-transceivers and nano-antennas
    with a maximum dimension of λ/20 at THz frequencies, allowing them to be densely
    integrated in very small footprints (1024 elements in less than 1 mm2), as shown
    in Figure 4 [34]. Therefore, by incorporating the graphene-based plasmonic antenna
    arrays at THz bands and metasurfaces operating at mmWave bands, we can expand
    the operational spectrum of intelligent environments and utilize them in transmission
    and reception in a controllable manner. C. Layered Structure of Intelligent Communication
    Environments Based on the operating principles of the aforementioned Intelligent
    Communication Environments, in this subsection, we anatomize the layered structure
    and detail each layer’s functionality. 1) Metamaterial Plane The metamaterial
    plane is also the surface plane, as shown in Figure 4. In designs based on reflectarrays,
    phase shifts are applied to each element to improve useful signals while canceling
    interference [58], [61]. The metasurface element proposed in [62] with millimeter-scale
    dimensions is connected to a PIN diode with a bias voltage to control operation
    modes, such as altering polarizations. In general, this layer comprises the supported
    EM function of the tile as well as its operation principle. In particular, reflectarray
    employ modifiable phase shifts applied over their surface. In the far field of
    radiation, reflected rays can be considered co-directional, and their superposition–constructive
    or destructive–is controlled by the applied phase shifts [63]. Hence, wave scattering
    or controlled reflecting functions can be attained. Metamaterial tiles, however,
    operate as surfaces with tunable local impedance [64]. Impinging waves create
    inductive surface currents over the tile, which can be routed by tuning the local
    impedance across the tile. Notice that the Huygens Principle dictates that any
    EM wavefront can be traced back to a current distribution over a surface [65].
    As a result, in principle, metamaterials can produce any custom EM function as
    a response to an impinging wave. Common functions include wave steering, focusing,
    collimating (i.e., producing a planar wavefront as a response to an impinging
    wave), polarizing, phase altering, full or partial absorption, frequency selective
    filtering and even modulation [60], [64]. 2) Sensing and Actuation Plane In order
    to control the EM waves per actual channel conditions, the programmable surfaces
    are expected to sense the propagation environment and actuate the upper surface
    plane accordingly. Such layer contains hardware elements that can be controlled
    to achieve a phase shift or impedance distribution across a tile. Commonly, the
    layer comprises arrays of planar antennas–such as copper patches–and multi-state
    switches between them. Reflectarray tiles usually employ PIN diodes with controllable
    biasing voltage as switches [62]. Metamaterials have employed a wider range of
    choices, both in the shape and geometry of the planar antennas and in the nature
    of switches. CMOS transistors, PIN diodes, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Switches (MEMS),
    micro-fluidic switches, magnetic and thermal switches are but a few of the considered
    options in the literature [66]. Notably, some options–such as micro-fluid switches–are
    state-preserving in the sense that they require power only to change state but
    not to maintain it (i.e., contrary to biased PIN diodes). Sensing impinging waves
    are also necessary for exerting efficient control over them. While this information
    can be provided by external systems [67], with dynamic channels and mobile end-users,
    tiles capable of incorporating sensing capabilities can be immune from the channel
    aging problem [68]. The sensing can be direct, employing specialized sensors,
    or indirect, e.g., via deducing some impinging wave attributes from currents or
    voltages between tile elements. 3) Computing Plane The computing functionality
    serves the processing functionality in the controllable surface system. In the
    metasurface designs in [60] and [62], FPGA-based controllers are connected to
    the metasurfaces to implement the computing functions. This layer comprises the
    computing hardware that controls the actuation and sensing elements. Its minimum
    computing duties include the mapping of local phase or impedance values to corresponding
    actuator states. Reflectarray tiles commonly implement this layer using FPGAs
    and shift registers [62]. Metasurfaces, and specifically HyperSurfaces, can alternatively
    employ standard IoT devices for the same purpose. Moreover, they can optionally
    include computing hardware elements (ASICs) distributed over the tile meta-atoms
    [69], [70]. This can enable autonomous and cognitive tiles, where meta-atoms detect
    the presence and state of one another, and take local actuation decisions to meet
    a general functionality objective. Nonetheless, these advanced capabilities are
    not required for programmable wireless environments. 4) Communication Plane The
    communication plane passes the signals from the processing layer to corresponding
    metasurface layer and collects signals from the sensing and actuation plane. In
    complicated programmable surface systems, communication occurs among planes to
    realize various EM wave control functions. The command signals normally operate
    at much lower frequencies compared to the ones emitted from programmable surfaces;
    such signals prove to be more efficient in tuning the bias voltage of the PIN
    diodes [60]. This layer comprises the communication stack and connects actuation
    and sensing layer as well as computing layer with tile-external devices such as
    controllers. In the simplest case, this layer is implemented within the computing
    hardware, acting as a gateway to the external world using any common protocol
    such as the Ethernet. HyperSurface tiles with embedded distributed computing elements
    additionally require inter-tile communication schemes, to handle the information
    exchange between smart meta-atoms. Both wired and wireless intra-tile communication
    is possible [69], [70]. In both cases, the ASIC hardware employs custom and nonstandard
    protocols. D. Use Cases of Intelligent Environments With the utilization of well-coordinated
    tiles in the Intelligent Environments, the wireless system can be greatly improved
    in terms of communication efficacy. 1) On Signal Propagation Enhancements From
    the perspective of multiple users and moving users, the Intelligent Environments
    system is envisioned to serve a large number of users with more realistic user
    patterns, including mobile users and users in a cluster. Additionally, the Intelligent
    Environments system should ensure physical layer security against jamming and
    eavesdropping, an increasingly important problem that remains to be solved. Transmission
    Distance: For users in the NLoS areas relative to the transmitter, the Intelligent
    Environments system is expected to extend the transmission distance and reach
    previously uncovered areas through waveguiding or reflection. Simulation results
    in [67] demonstrate that at 60 GHz the coverage can be extended to an entire NLoS
    area. Interference Mitigation: Due to the scenario with multiple users, there
    is inevitably concern of interference. As in the envisioned scheme, each Intelligent
    Environment unit is dedicated to an individual user, thus the majority of interference
    will reside in the wireless section of the end-to-end link. Reliability: The primary
    efforts in terms of physical layer reliability include using highly directional
    antennas to nullify jamming, forming exclusion areas, assigning secret keys to
    legitimate users, and so on. From the perspective of fundamental propagation channels
    with Intelligent Environments, good reliability is achieved when the eavesdroppers
    do not have the knowledge of the frequencies where packages are transmitted, or
    the eavesdroppers are in the same frequency channel but with much higher noise
    which makes the intercepted data impossible to decode [71]. Therefore, the dedicated
    links in Intelligent Environments are inherently secure. 2) On the Physical Layer
    Security The more frequent data exchange between users and service providers exposes
    a higher risk of personal and private data leakage. The 6G wireless network should
    not only inherit existing network secrecy measures, but also provide enhanced
    physical layer security associated with new enabling techniques. In current 5G
    networks, highly directional beams are used for mmWave communications in spatial
    domain to prevent signals from being intercepted. However, a recent study has
    shown that such pencil-sharp beams are still vulnerable to agile eavesdropping
    [72]. Other physical layer encryption algorithms, including source coding approaches
    such as the low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, are demonstrated with optimal
    performance under specific conditions [73]. Furthermore, existing solutions in
    the reconfigurable intelligence surface apply reflectarrays, which do not have
    the capability to effectively distinguish target users from malicious attackers.
    Hence, a solution based on the Intelligent Environments serves the purpose of
    identifying unintended recipients, creating null areas, and improving link secrecy
    rate. Essentially, the envisioned Intelligent Environments have the capability
    to sense user locations and exchange such information with a system controller
    to verify the user’s authenticity. Only affirmative users shall be served with
    signal streams from the sender. On the other hand, connection requests from unauthorized
    users (i.e., eavesdroppers) will be nullified from attempting to access secure
    information or even trying to establish links with the sender. In practice, the
    Intelligent Environments can be configured to tune the phases of multipath components
    in the channel, such that those arrived at intended users can be coherently combined
    with boosted received signal strengths, whereas those intercepted by eavesdroppers
    will be scrambled or even cancelled due to non-coherent combining [74]. Simulation
    results demonstrate a 6-dB attenuation observed at the received signal strength
    from the eavesdropper, validating the proposed physical layer security solution
    [74]. Hence, the good channel secrecy is achieved when such unintended users do
    not own the knowledge of equalizer to recover the transmitted signals from noise.
    E. Open Problems in Intelligent Environments A number of open problems need to
    be addressed in order to facilitate the Intelligent Environments in becoming a
    market-ready solution. Trade-off Between Dimensions and Energy Consumption: In
    terms of real-world applications, the Intelligent Environments are expected to
    be coated onto surfaces of interior walls and/or ceilings, and building facades,
    which require dimensions that can both fit specific installation areas and satisfy
    link requirements. Meanwhile, with more reflectarray elements and RF chains built
    into the system, the energy consumption will also increase, due to the advanced
    signal processing circuitry. Therefore, how to achieve an economic solution to
    balance the overall dimension and energy consumption while serving users to its
    desired performance is a nontrivial issue. Compatibility With Existing Solutions:
    Current Wi-Fi access points have a mature protocol stack to sense the channel
    and establish links with users. In order for the Intelligent Environments to assist
    with improving indoor signal coverage, it needs to be compatible with the IEEE
    802.11 series standard. For now this is still under research and serves as a worthy
    problem for novel solutions. Standardization: With many candidate approaches being
    investigated in reflectarrays, metasurfaces, frequency selective surfaces, among
    others, there has not been a consensus on how to standardize the device architecture,
    maximum emitted power, and communication protocols. As more ideas evolve, a standardization
    effort within a work group is necessary towards a solidary framework. Inclusion
    of advanced application scenarios: as a promising solution for future generation
    of wireless systems, the Intelligent Communication Environments should be designed
    to fit to more advanced scenarios, for example, in use cases with a very large
    quantity of devices as in the Internet of Things, under high demands of real-time
    video streaming, with devices of high mobility, among others. Smart resource allocation
    solutions: resources in the spatial, temporal, and spectral domains should be
    allocated in an optimal manner to satisfy per-user demand. AI-driven design and
    optimization: in complicated scenarios under which no closed-form solutions can
    be found using conventional optimization approaches, advanced algorithms in artificial
    intelligence can assist in the deployment of Intelligent Communication Environments,
    especially when complex surface layout or structures are in presence. SECTION
    V. Pervasive Artificial Intelligence In the past few years, the field of artificial
    intelligence (AI) has witnessed immense growth, leading to its application in
    a wide variety of fields across both academia and industry. In the realm of communications
    and signal processing, AI can be readily applied to cognitive radios, remote sensing,
    computer vision, and network management. More specifically, in the domain of wireless
    communications, AI and its associated algorithms are also gradually proving their
    utility in various emerging techniques such as massive MIMO communications which
    requires efficient channel estimation and symbol detection. Such tasks often do
    not yield low complexity optimal solutions in complex channels [75], and thus
    parallel processing inherent in machine learning can be favorably leveraged to
    enhance computational capacity. Admittedly, even though current wireless communication
    networks follow a layered structure, in which each layer primarily serves several
    functions, applications of AI and relevant algorithms are gradually bridging the
    gap across layers in a way that can globally optimize the performance in the entire
    wireless network. However, in order to provide a marked trail to navigate through
    a plethora of pervasive AI applications, this section is organized based on the
    existing layers. It is worth noting that AI is a broad concept, under which reside
    several branches covering interleaved research topics, such as robotics, natural
    language processing, machine learning (ML), computer vision, among others. In
    this section, we focus specifically on the ML algorithms and their applications
    in wireless communications under the AI umbrella. These two terms are thus used
    interchangeably in this section. As shown in Figure 5, artificial intelligence
    can be applied to each layer of the wireless network. At the network layer, machine
    learning (ML) algorithms can be used for traffic clustering to further adapt the
    network resources to various scenarios [76]. At the physical and MAC layers, deep
    learning can optimize resource allocation strategies for power distribution, and
    modulation and coding schemes, among others. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms
    can also assist with channel estimation and multi-user detection. FIGURE 5. Applications
    of artificial intelligence at different layers of wireless systems. Show All A.
    AI in the Physical Layer Traditionally, physical layer modeling has been model-oriented—a
    practice in which mathematical models following a certain framework are proposed
    and optimized under constraints to satisfy a series of pre-determined performance
    requirements. For example, in order to conduct channel estimation, a channel model
    is assumed along with other parametric configurations. These model-based solutions
    usually perform well if the derivation of mathematical models is relatively straightforward
    or there exists a closed-form solution. The models can then be validated by field
    measurements or numerical simulations. However, in real-world scenarios, the applicability
    of such model-based solutions falls short in complicated environments, due to
    factors such as non-linearity inside systems and uncontrollable interference,
    among others. On the other hand, another approach, which is based on statistics,
    or data sets, builds the model through learning from the data. This method is
    particularly useful when theoretical analysis is intractable or when a closed-form
    solution is difficult to obtain. For example, in diffusion-based channels commonly
    found in molecular communication, the channel characteristics depend largely on
    the environment, making them challenging to model theoretically [77]. In such
    cases, some data is used for training, which can help establish a model, while
    other data is used for testing in order to validate the model. To date, artificial
    intelligence has demonstrated its usefulness in various physical layer techniques.
    For example, in channel estimation and symbol detection, deep learning approaches
    reported in [78], [79] have shown that the proposed deep learning-based symbol
    detection algorithms can provide robust and accurate results with reduced complexity.
    Furthermore, a deep learning method based on the deep neural network architecture
    also demonstrates an improved channel estimation accuracy under the effects of
    non-linearities of power amplifiers, I/Q imbalance, and quantization errors induced
    by hardware impairments [80]. An autoencoder-based communication system is proposed
    to reconstruct the transmitted signals from channel impairment based on trained
    deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner [81]. Furthermore, self-supervised
    learning is becoming a trend for user localization since it has been demonstrated
    that relevant methods can significantly reduce the size of labeled dataset for
    efficient processing [82] B. AI in Wireless Networks In other essential layers
    of a wireless network, the existence of rich datasets lends itself to the applicability
    of machine learning-based solutions. In routing protocol design for wireless sensor
    networks, researchers have successfully utilized reinforcement learning methods
    to achieve a more energy-efficient routing scheme for underwater sensor networks
    [83]. In the vehicular industry, autonomous driving has already been studied and
    become a reality in some cities in Arizona, US.2 With respect to vehicular communication
    networks, due to the constant movement of vehicles, a predictive model based on
    real-time data has superiority over traditional theoretical models in terms of
    accuracy. Artificial intelligence and its plethora of algorithms can be applied
    in varied ways in such networks: autoencoders for predicting traffic flow [84],
    k -means clustering for traffic congestion control [85], and Q -learning for intelligent
    resource management [86], among others [87]. In the Internet of Space Things,
    with our envisioned multi-band communication capabilities in both inter-satellite
    and ground-to-satellite links, we have proposed a deep neural network-based resource
    allocation strategy to enable a flexible scheme for CubeSats to stay connected
    without human intervention from the ground [88]. Apart from advancements in algorithm
    development, a potential issue dwells on the location of data storage and processing,
    which has largely happened in central data centers in the cloud. For devices distributed
    in a wide geographic range, this undoubtedly adds significant delays in performing
    tasks which require real-time operation. Moreover, a centralized computing manner
    is not desired from perspectives of data security and constraint in processing
    capacity [89]. In order to relieve such challenges, edge AI pushes local devices
    to fulfil operation and management tasks. Admittedly, this could lead to possible
    overburden in local devices, since they are not equipped with as powerful processing
    units as the cloud processing center, however, research efforts in this direction
    are dedicated to: (i) acceleration in boosting the hardware’s processing capability,
    and (ii) leveraging the coordination between local and central processing units
    to optimization task distribution. C. AI in Network Management and Orchestration
    AI, or more specifically ML, has an integral role to play in the management of
    networks [90]–[92]. In fact, Clark et al. introduced the concept of the Knowledge
    Plane [93] back in 2003, describing it as a pervasive ML-based system within the
    network that is geared towards providing services and advice to other elements
    of the network. More recently, with sofware-defined networking (SDN) and network
    function virtualization (NFV) becoming mainstream, large-scale data acquisition
    has become easier than ever before, making a strong case for ML-based management
    and orchestration primitives within 6G, ultimately leading to full network automation
    as discussed in the next section. In particular, the domain of network management
    presents a wide variety of problems that can be broadly categorized into: [91]
    Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is typically applied to problems relating
    to traffic prediction [94] and classification [95], as well as slice resource
    prediction [96]. While the former primarily involves preemptively determining
    the network traffic load, as well as determining the applications, protocols and
    QoS classes the traffic belongs to, for fine-grained traffic engineering, the
    latter involves predicting the resource requirements associated with different
    network slices based on the anticipated traffic load. Reinforcement Learning:
    Reinforcement learning typically finds use in problems associated with resource
    management [97], [98]. For example, the popular virtual network embedding problem
    wherein the network orchestrator performs optimal placement of virtual network
    functions onto the underlying physical substrate, is highly amenable to reinforcement
    learning [99]. Other applications include elastic scaling of network infrastructure
    [100], failure prevention, and configuration rollback [101]. Unsupervised Learning:
    While both supervised learning and reinforcement learning have shown significant
    promise in the network management domain, we note that there exist certain use
    cases such as those relating to optimizing the end-users’ Quality of Experience
    (QoE) [102] and network security [103] where: (i) labeled data for training is
    simply not present and (ii) the real-time nature of the application makes it impractical
    to wait for feedback. In such cases, unsupervised learning can prove to be an
    indispensable tool. For example, intrusion detection systems based on autoencoders
    have been shown to outperform supervised learning-based systems [104]. D. Open
    Problems for Pervasive AI During early years of 5G standardization, researchers
    have discussed potentials of AI in achieving high time and spectrum efficiency
    once incorporated in 5G. Specifically, AI algorithms can help facilitate the following
    tasks which would yield low efficiency with conventional solutions: identify network
    anomalies, allocate network resources, perform network management, among others
    [106]. However, so far these solutions have not been officially adopted in 5G
    standards worldwide. In June 2020, the ITU has initiated an AI/ML in 5G challenge
    to motivate researchers to identify and solve real-world problems using AI/ML
    solutions in relevant 5G directions.3 As such, it is envisioned that such efforts
    would be factored in later 5G development but will be materialized in a more concrete
    and pervasive manner in 6G. While pervasive artificial intelligence in wireless
    communication networks will undoubtedly bring a paradigm shift towards data-oriented
    approaches, there are still open problems to be resolved. First, thus far no agreement
    has ever been reached on which algorithms work the best to solve a generalized
    problem in wireless networks, such as modulation and coding scheme design, channel
    estimation, and resource allocation, among others. Almost all published works
    claim significant accuracy or reduced complexity with either analytical theories
    or practical data sets [107]. Additionally, we note the absence of an effective
    method to draw a fair comparison among all proposed solutions, due to variations
    in selected data sets, assumptions, evaluation criteria, and so on. However, when
    it comes to realistic deployments, a careful gleaning process should be performed
    in order to identify algorithms without loss of general applicability. Second,
    the limited availability of quality datasets is detrimental to the testing and
    validation of proposed classification or regression algorithms. SECTION VI. Network
    Automation SDN and NFV have been widely recognized as the major paradigm shifts
    that occurred with the advent of 5G [108]. In particular, SDN has paved the way
    for the separation of the data and control planes, while NFV has been instrumental
    in decoupling the software from the hardware. Consequently, both wired and wireless
    networks have witnessed significant benefits from the adoption of SDN and NFV,
    including but not limited to simplified network management and service deployment,
    availability of advanced traffic engineering solutions and fine-grained network
    slicing techniques, and reduced CAPEX and OPEX. A major contribution of network
    softwarization has also been the commoditization of key network components such
    as switches [109] and base stations [110], [111], allowing for their implementation
    on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. In addition, the large open-source
    community supporting these projects has played a pivotal role in engaging a wider
    set of stakeholders than was previously possible. As networks evolve further,
    the traditional network operations routine, rooted in manual configuration and
    static script-based primitives, cannot keep up with the increasing complexity.
    Instead, we posit that automation will serve as the major driving force behind
    building upon the improvements brought forth by SDN and NFV. More specifically,
    network automation is defined as the process of automating the configuration,
    management, testing, deployment, and operations of physical and virtual devices
    within a network [112]. Network automation is intended to speed up the delivery
    of network services while adhering to dynamic and robust service-level agreements
    (SLAs), and reducing the potential for errors through minimization of manual intervention.
    Standardization efforts in this domain have led to the introduction of the Network
    Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in the control plane and the Management Data Analytics
    Service (MDAS) in the management plane, for enhanced data collection and analytics
    functionalities within 3GPP Releases 15 and 16 [113], [114]. Both these functions
    form a critical segment of the Service-Based Architecture (SBA) within 5G, highlighting
    the growing importance of network automation. To this end, we explore three key
    tenets of network automation in this section– software-defined programmable data
    planes, automated service decomposition and orchestration, and self-driving networks.
    While the first two are primarily concerned with automating specific aspects of
    the network, i.e., the data plane and the network slicing procedure, self-driving
    networks are the holy grail of network automation, requiring absolutely no manual
    intervention. A. Software-Defined Programmable Data Planes Being the most popular
    Southbound API, OpenFlow [115] is synonymous with SDN and has been featured widely
    in 5G networks. Yet, the stateless match-action abstraction implemented by OpenFlow
    precludes true data plane programmability since it relies largely on static header
    field matching. Within the context of this paper, we define data plane programmability
    as a feature that allows data plane devices, such as switches, to expose their
    packet-processing logic to the control plane in order for it be completely reconfigured
    if required. For example, the controller should be seamlessly able to modify the
    packet parsing and processing pipeline as required, add support for new protocols,
    and modify existing ones. To this end, P4 [116] is being increasingly recognized
    as “the programming language for the data plane”. P4 supports a wide variety of
    hardware ranging from ASICs to commodity CPUs, and allows the controller to specify:
    (i) a packet parser for extracting header fields, and (ii) a collection of match-action
    tables that process these headers. Further, we note that the operation of many
    applications depends upon the real-time state of the system, and relying on the
    controller to update the forwarding state each time introduces a significant latency
    burden. Consequently, there has been a growing body of research that seeks to
    develop stateful data planes, wherein some of the stateful packet processing and
    control tasks are offloaded to the data plane switches [117]–[119]. For example,
    a stateful data plane device may store some form of packet metadata, using it
    to process new packets belonging to the same flow. The general packet forwarding
    rules are still set by the controller, however, the presence of state information
    provides context for rule selection at the switch level. Programmable stateful
    data planes present a variety of inter-related research challenges. First, there
    is a need for a generic broad-based definition of state, along with abstractions
    that expose this state. Second, since packet-level state maintenance will be done
    by distributed switching devices, there is a need for a state consistency mechanism.
    A mechanism of this kind could potentially be enforced through the controller,
    to prevent conflicting forwarding actions. Third, security considerations present
    another important challenge. If the data plane switches are going to perform actions
    based on packet metadata, a malicious actor could easily use malformed packets
    to trigger state transitions for example. In this case, ultra-lightweight mechanisms
    will be needed to verify packet integrity. B. Automated Service Decomposition
    and Orchestration Network slicing allows for the provisioning of differentiated
    services over the same physical infrastructure [120], and has been a major research
    focus in the cellular domain [121]–[124]. However, the slice instantiation and
    deployment process is largely template-driven and requires manual configuration.
    For example, current 3GPP network slicing specification [120] is primarily based
    on the concept of network slice templates (NSTs). An NST explicitly defines the
    virtual network functions (VNFs) and associated service function chain that comprise
    a network service. Consequently, such network slicing primitives allow for the
    deployment of a limited set of network services, i.e., only those services for
    which a template has already been defined. Clearly, an approach of this kind is
    not scalable because: (i) it does not provide a mechanism to deal with new kinds
    of network services, and (ii) as network services increase in complexity, the
    effort required to create and maintain templates will become an operational burden.
    Going beyond the traditional template-driven model, we propose the concept of
    automated service decomposition and orchestration for network slice automation,
    as shown in Figure 6. To this end, and in line with 3GPP terminology, we identify
    three major stakeholders– the communication service customers (CSCs), the communication
    service providers (CSPs), and the virtual infrastructure service providers (VISPs).
    The CSCs request communications services from CSPs, who instantiate network slices
    and deploy them over infrastructure owned by VISPs to deliver the requested services.
    As part of the slice automation workflow, the CSCs provide high-level requirements
    such as those relating to latency, throughput, reliability, etc., along the lines
    of the emerging intent-based networking paradigm [125]. Next, the CSC automatically
    decomposes the request into a constituent VNF-forwarding graph (VNF-FG). It is
    important to note here that the service to VNF-FG mapping is not a based on a
    template, but instead makes use of deep learning models to extract service requirements
    and construct the corresponding VNF-FG. The resulting service-specific VNF-FG
    also contains the resource requirements for the constituent VNFs, allowing for
    seamless deployment onto the underlying infrastructure. Once the service has been
    deployed, continuous monitoring and real-time telemetry are used to ensure operational
    optimality. FIGURE 6. Automated network slicing framework. Show All C. Self-Driving
    Networks For decades, the network operator has served as the centerpiece of network
    operations. However, the increasing complexity of communications networks coupled
    with the constant state of flux brought forth by an ever-increasing number of
    connected devices has made the task of real-time network management nearly impossible
    for human operators. Therefore, there is a strong case for transitioning from
    operator-driven networks to self-driving networks. More specifically, self-driving
    networks are expected to allow for elastic utilization of resources, error-free
    operation, prompt and targeted responses to security incidents, and proactive
    rather than reactive service handling [126, §2]. Seeking complete automation of
    network management, a self-driving network is defined as a network where: (i)
    network measurements are task-driven and tightly integrated with the control of
    the network, and (ii) large-scale data analytics and machine learning models are
    used for network control, as opposed to closed-form models of individual protocols
    [127]. In a nutshell, self-driving networks should be capable of measuring, analyzing,
    and controlling themselves in an automated manner [128]. At the outset, a self-driving
    network should take a high-level goal or intent as input. Expanding upon the concept
    of intents, we note that there are broadly two types of intents– imperative and
    declarative. While the former describes in explicit detail how a particular procedure
    should be carried out, the latter just describes the end-goal without specifying
    how the stated goal should be achieved. For example, “reduce network congestion
    by shifting incoming traffic originating at ingress node 1 from load balancer
    2 to load balancer 3” is an imperative intent since it explicitly defines the
    steps that network must undertake in order to relieve congestion. On the other
    hand, “optimize network operations” is a declarative intent. However, a truly
    declarative intent of the kind described here would be extremely difficult to
    implement in the near future. Instead, semi-declarative intents that define more
    concrete goals would be far more helpful. “Minimize network congestion”, is one
    example of such an intent since it tasks the network with optimizing its operation
    by focusing on a specific objective, i.e., minimizing congestion. Based on the
    intent, the network is expected to determine: (i) the measurements that need to
    be performed, (ii) the corresponding inferences and learning that is required,
    and (iii) the actions that must be undertaken in response to the input intent.
    While a formal representation for self-driving networks is yet to be realized,
    a high-level architecture has been presented in Figure 7, highlighting the importance
    of large-scale data acquisition, real-time analytics and inference, and programmable
    data planes. FIGURE 7. High-level architecture for self-driving networks. Show
    All However, the realization of self-driving networks brings forth several research
    challenges as described next. Accurate Intent Definitions: As discussed previously,
    good intent definitions must toe the line between imperative and declarative.
    If the intent is primarily imperative, it defeats the point of automation. On
    the other hand, if the intent is purely declarative, the automation procedure
    becomes unnecessarily complex. Therefore, there is a pressing need for formal
    guidelines that put forward a clear framework for intent definitions. For example,
    a framework of this kind could take into account customer expectations in terms
    of throughput and latency, network-wide resource optimization goals, along with
    other application-specific functions and services that are required from the network.
    Automated Real-time Inference: Machine learning is vital to the automated decision
    making process in self-driving networks. However, previous work in this domain
    has largely focused on applying pre-existing learning techniques for network control,
    which are not well-suited for network data, given its high-volume, distributed
    nature, and rapid evolution. The major challenge here is the native integration
    of inference and control algorithms with the network’s decision and control fabric.
    In addition, network design needs to evolve to improve the quality of data that
    is input to the designed control algorithms [127]. Within the domain of self-driving
    networks, it is widely accepted that quality of data (QoD) is a pre-requisite
    for quality of service (QoS) [127]. In-band Telemetry: Research into in-band telemetry
    (INT) has been largely driven by the need for high quality network monitoring
    data, without introducing additional overhead. The INT approach makes use of programmable
    data planes to encapsulate additional metadata within the data packets themselves
    [129]. Examples of such metadata include switch processing times, buffer occupancy
    levels, and even specific policy rules. As packets traverses the network, they
    keep accumulating additional metadata, which can be extracted as desired, thus
    providing highly-detailed accurate sets of network data. To this end, there is
    a need to quantify the impact of INT on network performance [130]. In particular,
    metrics such as the relationship between the amount of metadata and packet size,
    the additional processing burden introduced, and the accuracy of the measurements
    obtained are all important parameters that merit careful consideration. SECTION
    VII. 6G Radio: Reconfigurable Transceiver Front-Ends The massive increase in the
    number of wirelessly interconnected devices, combined with the ever-growing demand
    for higher wireless data rates, is leading to an overcrowded electromagnetic (EM)
    spectrum. To overcome the spectrum scarcity problem and increase the capacity
    of wireless networks, communication at frequencies beyond RF (i.e., from the mmWave
    to the THz bands) is required. To meet the data-rate, reliability, and scalability
    requirements from RF to THz, transformative solutions are needed which include
    the design, implementation, and optimization of frequency-agile, ultra-broadband
    reconfigurable systems. A system of this kind is able to simultaneously sense
    and communicate over the full EM spectrum (1 GHz to 10 THz), and serves as a major
    contributor towards the infrastructure needed for the next generation of wireless
    communications. To realize this vision, pioneering contributions are required
    in terms of: (i) new devices that surpass the limits of CMOS technology by leveraging
    the state-of-the-art in materials science and nanoscale physics, (ii) heterogeneous
    integration of such devices which is compatible with the electrical, thermal,
    and EMI requirements for reconfigurability and manufacturing scalability, and
    (iii) novel all-spectrum dynamic sensing and communication algorithms, which maximize
    the achievable network capacity. The primary goal for 6G radio is to establish
    dynamic all-spectrum sensing and communication from RF to THz bands, therefore,
    transforming the way in which wireless devices sense, access, and share the EM
    spectrum. To achieve such a goal, key steps include: (i) intelligent all-spectrum
    sensing solutions, (ii) transceiver hardware design and implementation, and (iii)
    spectral and energy efficiency optimization as well as resource management. It
    is worth noting that currently reported works are fulfilling part of this grand
    goal by achieving dynamic spectrum sensing or multi-band communications over several
    frequency bands. It is our hope to motivate advanced solutions to realize all-spectrum
    communications through this section. A. Dynamic All-Spectrum Sensing and Access
    In recent times, a concentrated research effort at the physical and link layers
    has driven exciting progress at RF frequencies for individual cognitive radios
    (CRs). For example, a recently awarded research project by the Research and Innovation
    Program in the United Kingdom named “6G Mitola Radio” aims to establish self-regulating
    societies for wireless communications with fairness and high efficiency.4 This
    research will facilitate seamless convergence across heterogeneous wireless networks
    with intelligent decisions made by radios to maximize the quality of experience
    for end-users. One step further, a major challenge is to develop innovative spectrum
    sensing and sensing-informed communication and network optimization techniques
    for dynamic access to all-spectral resources. Within this context, the targeted
    breakthrough would be the development of wireless network-aware state inference
    using all-spectrum cartography for cognition over the swath of frequencies from
    RF to the THz bands, along with cartography-constrained algorithms for the physical
    and cross-layer control protocols. Artificial intelligence and associated learning
    algorithms should be investigated for dynamic spectrum sharing with a minimum
    cost in interference. The techniques developed should wholly exploit the capabilities
    of the hybrid front-ends, which include a multi-band transceiver design and solutions
    for resource management. B. Multi-Band Transceiver Design The optimal selection
    of materials and devices needed to enable all-spectrum communications is vital
    to the success of any multi-band transceiver design. Existing solutions mostly
    rely on CMOS for multi-band operations, but such an approach only works well in
    narrowbands. Moreover, solutions based on software-defined radios (SDRs) have
    high energy consumption and carbon footprint, consuming several Watts in operation
    [131], [132]. Instead, novel approaches based on metamaterials, MEMS switches,
    and even nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) switches should be sought to implement
    hybrid front-ends (Figure 8), which are able to simultaneously sense the EM spectrum,
    identify the best available band, and communicate over it, at frequencies anywhere
    from 1 GHz to 10 THz. Furthermore, fast-evolving deep learning algorithms serve
    as an efficient solution for identifying available spectrum, tuning channels,
    and adjusting RF power levels. FIGURE 8. Conceptual design of a hybrid front-end
    for dynamic all-spectrum sensing and communication in 6G. Show All To realize
    this vision, new techniques in materials and devices, integration and packaging,
    and spectrum sensing and communication are necessary. At the RF and microwave
    frequency bands, a combination of low-risk mature CMOS technology, with less-mature,
    potentially transformative technologies, including quantum cascade lasers (QCLs)
    and new plasmonic technologies based on graphene and other 2D materials will be
    able to provide optimal tunabilities as well as a high quality factor (i.e., the
    Q-factor). The heterogeneous integration of discrete devices into a fully functional
    front-end will require innovation to satisfy material compatibility, EMI shielding,
    thermal dissipation, and scalability requirements. On the other hand, metamaterial
    and nano-materials will be deployed at sub-THz and THz bands, based on recent
    advances in nano-tubes and graphene, as well as other single-atom-thin semiconductors.
    Space-time-frequency coding in metasurfaces will also allow programmable and fine-tunable
    radio access at mmWaves. Optimal control of the front-ends requires innovative
    all-spectrum sensing, utilization and sharing techniques, new waveform and hierarchical
    modulation designs to maximize the capacity and distance in ultra-broadband systems,
    and scalable networking solutions which are able to support the envisioned node
    density in future cyber-physical systems. The combination of several cutting-edge
    techniques can help maximize: (i) spectrum utilization (toward all-spectrum utilization),
    (ii) data-rates (toward terabit-per-second links) and, (iii) network user capacity
    (billions of interconnected wireless devices). The proposed technology will enable
    a plethora of applications in the consumer, military, industrial and medical fields,
    including transformative networking architectures designed to meet the scalability
    demands in future cyber-physical systems. C. Reconfigurable Front-End Scheme Accompanying
    the dynamic all-spectrum sensing and multi-band operation, agile front-ends should
    also be equipped with reconfigurability. In terms of hardware design, the plasmonic
    reflectarrays can be deployed in the 3D environment, with a size ranging from
    1 mm2 to 100 mm2 depending on the operating frequency (mmWave/THz-band). Owing
    to the sub-wavelength size of their elements, the plasmonic reflectarrays are
    able to reflect signals in non-conventional ways, which include controlled reflections
    in non-specular directions as well as reflections with polarization conversion
    [133]. In order to adapt to dynamic frequency operation, achieve various levels
    of directivity, and allocate multiple beams, the aperture of plasmonic reflectarray
    antenna can be controlled mechanically through folding, splitting, or combining
    in a 3D space. Existing prior art using origami antennas works well in systems
    using a single metal antenna, as reported in [134], [135]. However, to achieve
    reconfigurable continuous aperture antenna arrays, plasmonic reflectarrays offer
    a higher degree of freedom with the compactness of unit element distribution.
    On the other hand, electronically-controlled reconfigurable antenna arrays are
    envisioned by leveraging the tunability of plasmonic antennas. In particular,
    one of the relevant properties of graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas is the
    possibility to change their resonant frequency by utilizing a small voltage to
    modify their Fermi energy [136]. The possibility to tune an antenna (or group
    of antennas) at different frequencies without any mechanical modification (as
    opposed to other multi-band antenna arrays that utilize MEMS or NEMS to create
    origami type structures [137]) enables beamforming not only across space but also
    across frequencies. D. Open Problems The biggest hurdle to be overcome lies in
    the implementation of an integrated ultra-broadband hybrid front-end that is capable
    of sensing and communication from the RF to the THz bands, over a target distance
    of a few hundred meters. Meeting this multidisciplinary challenge requires us
    to: (i) close the THz gap by developing new device technologies, (ii) design and
    integrate re-programmable circuitry, interconnects and antennas that can support
    all-spectrum operation, (iii) develop new material integration and packaging techniques
    to satisfy the electrical, thermal and EMI requirements of disparate bands, and,
    (iv) develop scalable all-spectrum communication using the front-ends. SECTION
    VIII. Ambient Backscatter Communications In the realm of IoT, sensors are expected
    to function in various environments with long-lasting battery life. Solutions
    such as radio frequency identification (RFID) utilize the backscatter technique
    to modulate and reflect RF signals instead of generating them, which can achieve
    a significant degree of energy saving. However, existing modulated backscatter
    solutions have stringent requirements in terms of the proximity between the backscatter
    transmitter and the RF source, due to the attenuation of the signal over long
    distances. Besides, the modulated backscatter transmitters are passive, which
    means that they cannot transmit data without requests initiated by backscatter
    receivers [138]. Furthermore, the issue of self-interference may arise when the
    backscatter receiver and RF sources are co-located. Hence, in order to achieve
    better energy efficiency with a higher degree of flexibility and scalability,
    new solutions are required in the 6G IoT network. Currently, with more small cells
    being deployed in outdoor and more access points in indoor environments, the RF
    signals are covering a wide range of surroundings, and can be considered as a
    resource to be utilized by secondary radio links without requiring extra power.
    The system that employs such a technique is called an “ambient backscatter communication
    system”. In an ambient backscatter communication system, transmitters can harvest
    the surrounding and continuous electromagnetic waves radiated by TV towers, base
    stations, as well as access points, use simple circuits for modulation, and reflect
    them towards receivers. There is no need for dedicated spectrum bands for such
    ambient backscatter transceivers to operate, nor complex electronic components
    (e.g., analog-to-digital converters) to process signals. A. Operation Principles
    of Backscatter Communications In general, as the name suggests, backscatter communication
    systems reflect signals impinged on a backscatter transmitter in the direction
    of the signals’ origin, and since it is not a perfect specular reflection, the
    signals are scattered within a certain angular range of the environment. A backscatter
    communication receiver within the range can thus pick up the signals. In particular,
    backscatter communications have three variations in terms of architecture, which
    are monostatic, bistatic, and ambient backscatter communications, respectively.
    Here we briefly explain the first two types and then focus on the last one. As
    the most commonly adopted backscatter communication approach with widely-used
    RFID applications, monostatic backscatter communication systems have the simplest
    setup, which consists of a backscatter transmitter and a reader. The reader has
    both an RF signal source and a backscatter receiver embedded with a switch to
    change the operation mode. Once the receiver sends out a request, the RF source
    activates the backscatter transmitter, which then modulates and reflects the EM
    waves impinged on it back to the receiver, as shown in Figure 9. Such a design
    is mainly used for short-range RFID applications [138]. Nonetheless, two drawbacks
    of the monostatic backscatter communication architecture are (i) the reader cannot
    perform full duplex communication due to the switch mechanism, and (ii) the signals
    experience round-trip path loss being sent from the reader to the transmitter
    and then reflected back to the reader. FIGURE 9. Illustration of backscatter communication
    systems. Show All On the contrary, in the bistatic backscatter communication architecture,
    the RF source and receiver are separated, as shown in Figure 9, which provides
    higher flexibility in the spatial domain. With multiple RF sources and backscatter
    transmitters well placed, the serving range can be remarkably extended compared
    to the monostatic backscatter scenario. Despite this improvement, it is more costly
    for bistatic backscatter communication systems to operate in real networks, since
    they require RF sources and transmitters to be well-placed so as to achieve desired
    performance, and most of the times this condition can be difficult to satisfy,
    especially in a sophisticated network environment, such as an indoor office or
    dense urban scenarios. B. Mechanism of Ambient Backscatter Communications Different
    from the monostatic backscatter device where the transmitting and receiving components
    are separately located and the RF source is co-located with the receiver, devices
    of ambient backscatter communication systems consist of both the transmitter and
    receiver. Additionally, distinct from bistatic backscatter communications, ambient
    backscatter communications do not require dedicated RF sources to provide exclusive
    services, which can reduce infrastructure and maintenance expenditure significantly.
    Therefore, the ambient backscatter communications provide the most energy-efficient
    solution for sensors in the IoT network in 6G. Specifically, in one proof-of-concept
    study for utilizing the always-on radio signals for ambient backscatter communications
    reported in [139], TV signals serve as the RF source, which can be amplitude and
    sometimes frequency-division modulated. In the ambient backscatter transmitter
    design, a simple switch consisting of a transistor and connected to the antenna
    can be used to modulate the impedance of the antenna: a mismatch of impedance
    indicates a reflection mode of the impinging signals, whereas a matched impedance
    allows for the signal being absorbed by the antenna [139]. The power consumption
    of such 1-bit modulation of signals is minimal. At the receiver side, by demodulating
    the received sequence of “1” and “0”, signals can be successfully recovered. However,
    it is worth noting that since the reflected signals from the ambient environment
    already contain encoded information from the RF source system (e.g., cellular
    or TV networks), the receiver design should take into consideration how to extract
    the backscattered signals from the mixture. Besides the simplicity in transceiver
    implementation, ambient backscatter communications are not restricted to a single-band
    operation. In fact, the ambient backscatter transceivers can operate in the wide
    range of super high frequency (SHF) bands, covering Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other
    bands [138]. C. Open Problems in Ambient Backscatter Communications Spectral and
    Energy Efficiency: Currently, the research and development of ambient backscatter
    communications is still in its infancy. As mentioned before, careful planning
    of backscatter devices is crucial for achieving good performance. Due to the randomness
    in IoT device deployment, current solutions fall behind in terms of the targeted
    spectral efficiency. Specifically, the randomly-located IoT devices should utilize
    ambient backscatter links to achieve a satisfying throughput while maintaining
    an extended transmission distance. Additionally, even though individual backscatter
    communication devices demonstrate good energy performance, an IoT network comprising
    hundreds or even thousands of such devices might still require optimization of
    energy efficiency on a system level. Protocol Design: Existing ambient backscatter
    communication systems are mostly used for dedicated application-specific purposes,
    and thus lack good compatibility with other wireless communication systems. Standardization
    and protocol design are necessary to formalize the key operation and management
    aspects of ambient backscatter communications, such as packet size, routing protocols,
    among others. SECTION IX. Internet of Space Things With CubeSats and UAVs The
    Internet of Space Things (IoST) is a spatial expansion of the Internet of Things
    which primarily focuses on terrestrial use cases. For future communication networks,
    this expansion is necessary for the following reasons: (i) the IoT relies heavily
    on existing infrastructure and hence lacks flexibility as well as scalability,
    (ii) global coverage is impossible using traditional IoT solutions, especially
    in remote areas including the North and South Poles, due to the imbalance of construction
    expenditure and service revenue, and (iii) limited heterogeneity and spectrum
    resources in the IoT network. To this end, IoST is envisioned as a ubiquitous
    cyber-physical system spanning ground, air, and space, with applications in monitoring
    and reconnaissance, in-space backhauling, and holistic data integration [140].
    More specifically, as shown in Figure 10, IoST consists of the ground station,
    customer premises, and on-Earth sensing devices which form the ground segment,
    and the CubeSats, UAVs, and near-Earth sensing devices that form the space segment.
    The ground-to-satellite links (GSLs) connect the IoST Hubs with CubeSats to exchange
    requests and data, and the inter-satellite links (ISLs) relay information to neighboring
    CubeSats, in both the same orbit as well as adjacent orbits. Further, the UAVs
    establish links with each other, as well as sensors and CubeSats to form a localized
    data aggregation layer. To this end, we note that UAVs are expected to feature
    heavily in the upcoming 3GPP Releases 16 and 17 [142]. Further, since the space
    segment forms a vital component of the system, research relating to the development
    of small satellites, or CubeSats [143], for use within IoST is of critical importance
    [140]. FIGURE 10. Illustration of the IoST [140]. Show All CubeSats are a set
    of miniaturized satellites with sizes ranging from 1U to 6U (a “U” is 10×10×10c
    m 3 ). Currently, CubeSats are being deployed for a variety of applications including
    Earth sensing [144], positioning, and IoT and machine-to-machine communications.
    Compared to traditional LEO satellites, CubeSats present a number of advantages
    relating to (i) lower costs and shorter development cycles and (ii) higher flexibility
    and scalability [141]. Normally the development cycles range from three to seven
    years for traditional LEO and GEO satellites and the costs are extremely high.
    Also, since the payloads are pre-determined in the LEO and GEO satellites from
    the period of development until deployment, it is difficult to reconfigure any
    component in the middle of the process. However, CubeSats’ development can be
    done in a remarkably shorter time using COTS components with much lower costs.
    This also guarantees that CubeSats are easily reconfigurable. To this end, we
    have recently proposed a new next-generation CubeSat hardware concept as shown
    in Figure 11 [141]. The proposed CubeSat design includes an all-new communications
    subsystem for seamless operation in a wide variety of frequency bands. More specifically,
    the novelty of our design concept is characterized by the presence of multi-band
    transceivers and antennas that are able to support wireless communications at
    microwave, mmWave, and THz frequencies as detailed in the following section. Through
    this unique CubeSat design, we can potentially achieve data rates in excess of
    100 Gbps [141]. FIGURE 11. Conceptual design of a next-generation CubeSat [141].
    Show All A. Multi-Band Communications Subsystem The primary motivation for a multi-band
    communications subsystem comes from the fact that existing CubeSats have limited
    communications capabilities, largely relying on spectrum ranging from the L- (1–2
    GHz) till the Ka- (26.5–40 GHz) band. There are two major drawbacks associated
    with this approach. First, the traditional frequency bands are becoming increasingly
    prone to congestion [145]. Second, the Tbps-level throughput required by IoST
    cannot be achieved with existing frequency bands. To overcome the spectrum scarcity
    and capacity limitations in current satellite networks, we have proposed the use
    of multiple frequency bands from RF to THz spectrum, in IoST [141]. The use of
    such frequencies has been made possible by advances in high-frequency device development
    [26], [146]. More specifically, as part of the multi-band communications subsystem,
    we have developed both multi-frequency transceivers as well as antenna systems,
    as described next. As shown in Figure 12, in our proposed multi-band transceiver,
    we use two complementary approaches, namely, an electronic frequency up-converting
    chain and an optical frequency down-converting chain, to generate signals at different
    frequencies. With regard to the electronics-based approach, the primary idea is
    to use frequency splitters in order to extract the intermediate frequencies for
    outputs. For example, as shown in Figure 12, the signal at frequency f 1 is considered
    as the intermediate output when producing signals at a higher frequency f 2 .
    FIGURE 12. The proposed all-spectrum signal front-end designs [141]. Show All
    On the other hand, the photonics-based approach involves the down-conversion of
    optical signals. As shown in Figure 12, multi-band signals are generated by heterodyning
    two input signals with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. The resulting RF signal has a
    frequency equal to the difference between the two inputs. The generated signal,
    along with the two input signals, serves as the final output. Distinct from the
    commonly used up-conversion and down-conversion techniques where intermediate
    frequency products are abandoned, our approach harvests them and utilizes them
    as part of the multi-band communication system. These multi-band frequencies can
    be assigned to the GSLs and ISLs dynamically to accommodate various service requirements.
    To this end, within IoST, the GSLs make use of the more robust microwave and mmWave
    frequencies, while high-capacity THz links form the ISLs. In addition to multi-band
    transceivers, CubeSats in the IoST are also equipped with multi-frequency antenna
    systems. In particular, as discussed in Section III, the use of THz links allows
    for very large antenna arrays that serve as the basis for massive MIMO and UM
    MIMO communication schemes. More specifically, we note that there exist multiple
    options when it comes to the design of multi-band antenna arrays. The first approach
    involves the use of NEMS, MEMS, and origami structures to create physically re-configurable
    antennas, wherein the size of the radiating elements can be changed physically
    with a view to adjust their resonant frequency. On the other hand, the second
    approach proposes the use of materials such as graphene to create electronically
    tunable nano-antenna arrays [147], [148]. In this case, the resonant frequency
    can be controlled by modulating the graphene Fermi energy or chemical potential.
    This allows for tuning of the antenna to resonate at different frequencies without
    physically changing its size, in contrast to the MEMS-based approach. B. System
    Constellation Design Within the context of IoST, an ideal constellation design
    is crucial to achieve true global coverage and satisfactory link performance.
    However, conventional LEO constellations are typically characterized by the presence
    of fewer than a hundred satellites, for example, the CubeSat-based IoT system,
    Astrocast, has a maximum of 64 satellites [149]. At the outset, the coverage and
    connectivity offered by such systems leaves much to be desired. Motivated by the
    need for improved coverage, reliable connectivity, and increased redundancy, mega-constellations
    of several hundred satellites have gained significant traction over the past year
    [150]. Mega-constellations provide several advantages over traditional constellations
    including but not limited to increased coverage density, improved connectivity,
    and higher redundancy. More specifically, constellation design typically involves
    solving for several inter-related parameters such as: (i) the apogee and perigee
    radii, (ii) the orbital eccentricity, (iii) the number of CubeSats per orbital
    plane, (iv) the number of orbital planes, and (v) the initial longitude of the
    ascending node, argument of perigee, and true anomaly of the CubeSats. While a
    fairly challenging problem in itself, the presence of an extremely large number
    of satellites further serves to complicate the system design. Consequently, the
    existing state-of-the-art constellation design frameworks are largely geared towards
    the design of systems with a few dozen satellites at best. To this end, we have
    proposed a highly-scalable and customizable constellation design framework that
    takes into consideration both coverage and connectivity parameters [151]. Through
    the use of novel metrics such as spherical Voronoi tessellation based coverage
    characterization and ISL feasibility-based connectivity parameters, we are able
    to demonstrate that the resulting IoST constellation achieves a performance level
    that is similar to existing state-of-the-art mega-constellations such as Starlink,
    while requiring only a quarter, i.e., less than 500, of the satellites [151].
    C. Network Management IoST encompasses a vast infrastructure spanning both the
    Earth as well as space. A complex network of this kind has much to benefit from
    fine-grained real-time control that is well suited for tackling the peculiarities
    of the space environment, namely temporal topological variation and long delays.
    Going beyond the traditional bent pipe nature of satellite communications systems,
    IoST makes extensive use of SDN and NFV to significantly improve network resource
    utilization, simplify network management, and reduce operating costs [140]. In
    a manner similar to the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) paradigm, IoST intends
    to deliver CubeSats-as-a-service, with promising results as shown in [140]. In
    particular, we have demonstrated that through the use of SDN, it is possible to
    achieve sub-second end-to-end latencies. More specifically with the domain of
    network management, IoST introduces the novel concepts of virtual CSI (vCSI) for
    joint optimal physical-link layer resource allocation, and stateful segment routing
    (SSR) for overcoming challenges associated with the high latency space segment.
    In particular, concerning the latter, IoST extends the traditional SDN paradigm
    by including support for state-based packet forwarding that takes into account
    the topological configuration of the network at any given instance of time, while
    the use of segment routing helps in the minimization of control traffic, in addition
    to a higher level of demand satisfaction and load balancing as demonstrated in
    [152]. Further, IoST also employs predictive algorithms to preemptively detect
    GSL outage events, which when coupled with gateway diversity result in the realization
    of proactive handovers that minimize handover interruption time. In addition,
    IoST proposes the use of containzeration [153] in CubeSats for achieving lightweight
    hardware virtualization without significant overhead. Going forward, we note that
    the aforementioned techniques will play a vital role in the realization of pervasive
    cyber-physical systems of this kind. SECTION X. Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications
    In 5G wireless networks, massive MIMO communications have been tested and deployed
    at base stations (BSs) which are equipped with more than one hundred antenna elements
    to increase the antenna array gain and take advantage of the diversity gain. A
    related concept is network MIMO, which, instead of packing more than one hundred
    antenna elements at a single BS, forms a coordinated framework consisting of multiple
    BSs, each with multiple antennas. A coordination scheme of this kind can achieve
    spatial diversity by allowing a single user to be served by more than one BS at
    the same time, overcoming the disadvantage of bad channel conditions if only one
    BS is connected to the user, and eliminates inter-cell interference [154]. However,
    a detailed comparative study has shown that massive MIMO communication schemes
    outperform network MIMO with respect to end-user received signal strength and
    overall costs in configuration [155]. Going one step further, in order to effectively
    eliminate inter-cell interference caused by users located at cell boundaries,
    based on the ideas of distributed MIMO communications and coordinated multi-point
    (CoMP) communications, researchers have proposed the concept of cell-free massive
    MIMO communication. In a scheme of this kind, the originally densely-packed antenna
    array set with a few hundred elements at the BS is distributed in a fairly large
    area in the form of smaller sets with fewer than 10 antenna elements, while still
    serving a similar number of users in the same area [156]. As shown in Figure 13,
    the main difference between cell-free and classic massive MIMO communication systems
    is that instead of associating each user terminal to a cell with a BS equipped
    with a large number of antenna elements, it relaxes the restriction of cell boundaries,
    which can significantly reduce or even eliminate the inter-cell interference.
    Without cell boundaries, all BSs, or a subset of BSs, can serve users simultaneously
    in a coordinated manner. In coordination, the cell-free massive MIMO BSs can share
    with each other the data to be sent to users through fronthaul links. FIGURE 13.
    Cell-free massive MIMO in comparison with classic massive MIMO. Show All It has
    been shown that the BSs can use their local channel state information (CSI) to
    achieve satisfactory performance and avoid the excessive computation complexity
    associated with sharing global channel conditions with all BSs [157]. The local
    CSI can be estimated in the uplink channel in a time division duplex (TDD) mode.
    Then, precoding is performed based on the obtained channel information at the
    BSs, before data transmission in the downlink channel. The transmit power and
    precoding vector can be determined based on the geographic proximity of users
    to the BSs. Compared to the small-cell architecture in 5G, which consists of non-cooperative
    base stations that can serve up to 100 users per cell with a smaller area (e.g.,
    up to a 200-meter cell radius) and reduced power in signal transmission (e.g.,
    up to 10 Watts), a cell-free massive MIMO communication system achieves significantly
    better performance, since each user can be served by a dedicated access point.
    A reported study in [158] has demonstrated that the cell-free massive MIMO scheme
    improves 95%-likely per-user throughput by five times and by ten times under correlated
    shadow fading, with respect to the small-cell solution. More specifically, the
    same study has reported that when considering realistic channel conditions, including
    pilot contamination and imperfect CSI, cell-free massive MIMO systems demonstrate
    much higher throughput compared to small cells and, more importantly, are more
    robust to impacts such as shadow fading, non-coherence interference, as well as
    noise [158]. However, we also note the following challenges: (i) due to the issue
    of aliasing, channel estimation for signals received by different antenna elements
    is more complicated compared to that of ordinary massive MIMO communications,
    (ii) with the significantly increased synthesized aperture size, the range of
    near-field propagation grows larger, hence requiring a different channel model
    for characterizing the large- and small-scale channel parameters. A. Channel Characteristics
    of Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communication Systems It has been theoretically proven
    that as the number of antenna elements approaches infinity, adversarial channel
    effects, including inter-cell interference, small-scale fading, and others, will
    disappear [159]. In cell-free massive MIMO communications, such effects will also
    have a negligible impact on propagation channels. Specifically, channels under
    a coordinated scheme of this kind will satisfy the conditions of favorable propagation
    [160]. Favorable propagation conditions imply that the channel vectors between
    the BSs and UEs are orthogonal, so that the sum-rate can be maximized. This characteristic
    is most prominent in classic massive MIMO communications [161]. In cell-free massive
    MIMO systems, it has been shown that favorable propagation conditions can be achieved
    given that the number of APs is fairly large (with an approximate density of 1000/km2).
    B. Open Problems in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications As the domain of cell-free
    massive MIMO communications is relatively new, there are several open problems
    that merit further investigation. Among them, we posit that coordination and optimization
    challenges will critically affect the entire system performance and future deployments.
    User Scheduling: Extensive studies have been conducted on channel characterization
    and capacity analysis. However, the prior art does not take into consideration
    scenarios involving networks with a large number of users to serve. In such cases,
    there might be an upper bound for the number of APs to serve a user in order to
    maintain an acceptable-level of average throughput. Current works assume that
    all users will be served simultaneously under the same frequency resource block.
    However, when the number of users grows to a threshold where they can no longer
    be served at the same time, a scheduling scheme that achieves fairness should
    be considered. Location Optimization of APs: Existing works in cellular networks
    draw heavily upon stochastic geometry where cell structures follow 2D Voronoi
    tessellation and geographically separated BSs that serve cell-edge users under
    the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) scheme to improve overall system efficiency
    and overcome inter-cell interference through scheduling [162], [163]. It is therefore
    crucial to optimize the placement of BSs under practical link-level constraints
    such as signal-to-interference ratio as well as success probability for individual
    links to enhance network fairness [164]. In cell-free massive MIMO, since no cell
    boundaries are assumed, system-level performance pertaining to locations of APs,
    random scatterers, as well as users should be thoroughly investigated and optimized.
    SECTION XI. Technologies for Beyond 6G Thus far, we have presented in great detail
    the key drivers that are expected to play an integral role in the next-generation
    of wireless networks. However, in addition to these, we also note the presence
    of several promising early-stage technologies that are tipped to revolutionize
    how we perceive data communications in the near future. To this end, in this section,
    we discuss three such promising paradigms, namely, the Internet of NanoThings,
    Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications. A. Internet of NanoThings
    In addition to the need for more spectrum resources to accommodate a plethora
    of wireless devices and services, a variety of transformative wireless communications
    scenarios are also envisioned to become a reality in the near future. In particular,
    with the advent of wireless ubiquity, we note the existence of situations where
    electromagnetic waves do not yield acceptable performance or lack reachability
    due to hardware limitations, such as in high-salinity water or intravascular channels
    where the transmission range can be extremely short. In the aforementioned application
    scenarios for THz band communications, as the frequencies of operation increase,
    the wavelengths of signals fall into the nanometer range (i.e., 10−9 to 10−7 meter
    in size), thereby motivating studies on nano-network communications [165], [166].
    Different from those operating at lower frequencies in the microwave range, the
    devices and transceivers used in the Internet of NanoThings (IoNT) are in the
    scale of nanometers, and thus behave differently from classical wireless communication
    systems. Given the much smaller size, each nano-thing consumes much less energy
    and is envisioned to be self-powered (e.g., via vibrational energy harvesting
    using piezoelectric nano-generators [167]). Besides conducting signal transmission
    tasks, the nano-things can also perform basic processing and data storage, as
    well as enabling new nano-sensing capabilities with higher sensitivity. Current
    advancements in nanotechnologies provide several promising candidate materials
    with various dimensions for creating such nano-machines, including a thin strip
    of graphene named graphene nanoribbons, graphene in form of a three-dimensional
    (3D) roll named carbon nanotubes, and graphene spheres. Communications in the
    paradigm of nano-networks mainly falls under two categories, which are (i) encoded
    signal bits being carried with molecules, which follows a diffusion-based mechanism
    elaborated in Section XI-B1 and (ii) plasmonic radiation on metamaterial-based
    antennas including graphene and carbon nano-tubes operating in the THz band. These
    plasmonic antennas [136], [168]–[170] leverage the physics of Surface Plasmon
    Polariton (SPP) waves, i.e., confined EM waves resulting from the global oscillations
    of electrons at the interface of a conductor material and a dielectric material,
    to efficiently radiate at the target resonant frequency while being much smaller
    than the corresponding wavelength. This property allows them to be integrated
    in very dense arrays, beyond traditional antenna arrays. The ratio between the
    free-space wavelength λ and the SPP wavelength λ SPP is known as the plasmonic
    confinement factor, and depends on the plasmonic material properties and the operation
    frequency. The higher the confinement factor, the smaller the antennas and the
    higher the density in which they can be integrated. 1) Essential Components in
    the IoNT Similar to traditional communication networks, several key components
    are seen in IoNT [171]: Nano-nodes are the basic functional units in the nano-network,
    and have sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers, and can form a cluster to forward
    and receive signals. A typical nano-node with full transceiving capability contains
    the following elements: a nano-antenna and a plasmonic nano-tranceiver based on
    graphene advancements to propagate SPP waves, a nano-processer with operating
    frequency close to 1 THz, nano-actuators, nano-sensors which can sense external
    force, gas molecules, and biological objects such as antigens and antibodies,
    a nano-memory which allows storage of a bit signal in a single atom, a nano-battery,
    and an energy nano-harvester which transfers energy to power other elements [172].
    Limited by the computation capabilities and battery life, the signals are mostly
    pulse-based for the easiness of detection and transmission. Nano-routers control
    the behavioral patterns of the nano-nodes, aggregate information, and determine
    the optimal paths for signals to be forwarded. The nano-routers are equipped with
    higher energy and computational resources. When a specific query is created from
    the command center, nano-routers need to select the optimal routes that can reach
    the nano-nodes to collect their data and report back. Due to the limited transmission
    range, a pulse-based signaling is preferred to assess the reachable range of nano-nodes
    in order to minimize outage probability and establish the desired routes. Gateways
    serve as the remote controller of the IoNT and connect over the internet to service
    providers. The gateways can be common smart devices such as smartphones and tablets,
    among others. In order to achieve a manageable network with hundred or even thousands
    of nano-nodes dissipated in sophisticated communication environments, gateways
    should devise a holistic approach in disseminating commands and queries, coordinating
    between possible collisions, and processing noisy data, which requires a drastically
    different network framework than the conventional network architecture. Based
    on the arbitrary pattern of the nano-nodes, potential solutions can be found with
    the assistance of artificial intelligence, which does not require pre-established
    model for prediction. It is worth noting that major device technology in the IoNT
    is still under design and development. Although a few types of individual components,
    such as nano-sensors, have been made available, it is estimated that a major paradigm
    shift for the IoNT is expected to occur in the second half of the 2020s. 2) Applications
    of the IoNT In the realm of IoNT, applications can be primarily found in body
    area networks and short-distance local environments. Three typical application
    scenarios are described as follows (also illustrated in Figure 14): Nano-Cameras:
    The nano-cameras are based on nano-photosensing and nanotechnology to sense, combine,
    and process light signals before transforming them into electric signals. This
    system includes nano-photodectors, nano-lens, nano-batteries, and nano-memories
    in order to achieve fine-resolution imaging and signal processing. The nano-cameras
    can be applied to a wide range of scenarios including but not limited to intravascular
    imaging and fracture detection in oil pipelines [171]. On-Chip Networks: With
    microchips getting more compact in dimension while the complexity of functionality
    grows, on-chip signal transmission has become significantly more challenging.
    Currently, issues relating to CPU scalability and efficient memory synchronization
    have driven research trends towards wireless network-on-chip (WNoC) solutions,
    which can replace wired connections on conventional chips and take advantage of
    short-range communication in the nano-network at THz-band frequencies [173]. Nano-robots
    for IoNT: The nano-robots in nano-networks can be deployed in environments such
    as nuclear power plants and oil pipelines which might be hazardous for humans
    to perform tasks but require high precision and do not allow massive drilling
    or digging over existing infrastructure. Under these circumstances, nano-robots
    can be dissipated to sense and collect data relating to chemical concentration,
    and fluid speed, among others. By forming ad-hoc networks, the nano-robots can
    aggregate and forward data packets to gateways in the IoNT. Nano-robots are also
    being widely researched in biomedical engineering fields. To this end, Section
    XI-B will delve into nano-robots for healthcare applications. FIGURE 14. Application
    scenarios of molecular communications in IoNT and IoBNT. Show All 3) Open Problems
    in the IoNT The significant size shrinkage brings three major challenges. The
    first one is power efficiency optimization. Even though nano-devices consume power
    at the level of microwatts when transmitting femtosecond long pulses, in order
    to cover an area of a few square meters such as an office or a meeting room, the
    energy consumption factors in as a major constraint in maintaining a satisfying
    overall network performance. New designs on duty cycles for nano-transceivers
    should be proposed and evaluated, as well as new clustering algorithms in order
    to group nano-transceivers in close proximity for adaptive operations. The second
    open issue is interference control, which has been extensively studied in classic
    wireless network scenarios. However, the conventional approaches cannot be directly
    applied to the IoNT realm, due to the higher density of nano-transceivers in space
    and pulse-based signal transmission schemes. Self-interference becomes the most
    prominent issue for nano-transceivers when full duplex mode is deployed and hence
    requires novel scheduling algorithms to mitigate this adversarial effect. Additionally,
    new modulation and coding schemes should be developed to fit the need of nano-devices
    on spectral and power efficiency while maintaining a low probability of crosstalk
    among links. The third challenge resides in the network protocols. Since the IoNT
    will foreseeably function in a manner that is drastically different from the IoT
    due to differences in channel conditions, limited scale of operation, as well
    as miniaturized devices, the protocol stack design still remains an open field
    for exploration. B. Internet of BioNanoThings for Health Applications Highly relevant
    to IoNT, with its unique characteristics and applications, is the concept of the
    Internet of BioNanoThings (IoBNT). First introduced in 2015, the IoBNT has garnered
    significant traction in its efforts to synergistically combine telecommunications
    with healthcare solutions [174]. The IoBNT is a network of molecules which can
    communicate with each other. The types of molecular communications include artificial
    cells which act as gateways to translate between different molecule types, or
    a bio-cyber interface which can convert molecular signals to electrical ones and
    transmit to external devices for further processing [175]. In applications relating
    to human healthcare, the IoBNT harbors many unique challenges and opportunities.
    First, the interdisciplinary research on both communications and data analytics
    can greatly facilitate the modeling of biological processes, including cancer
    cell formations and Alzheimer’s disease, and further design effective control
    measures for such diseases. Second, even though expressions of genetic codes at
    the cell- and organ-level can vary remarkably, in a manner analogous to various
    types of data applications in wireless networks, communication models can be developed
    and exploited to conceive a generally applicable health information framework.
    Third, the holistic network architecture envisioned in the IoBNT will integrate
    components at heterogeneous levels including within cells and among tissues, organs,
    as well as systems, before eventually connecting to the outside Internet for physicians
    to perform metric evaluations and propose treatment plans accordingly. However,
    healthcare solutions that are to be realized in such complicated biological and
    molecular environments should be built upon a solid understanding of the physics
    behind molecular communication and advanced statistical analysis tools in order
    to unveil the principles behind the seemingly random molecular movement. 1) Essential
    Communication Models in IoBNT Different from classic wireless communication channels
    based on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, molecular communication (MC)
    channels rely on the mechanism of molecular movement to transmit information.
    The main difference between an MC channel and the classical wireless channel is
    that the transmission medium presents different forms, such as fluids of several
    chemical compositions in blood vessels, plasma membranes of neurons, and so on.
    Based on the motion of molecules in such diverse mediums, end-to-end channel models
    have been developed to characterize the capacity, noise, and interference in various
    communication scenarios [176]–[178]. Particularly, in the diffusion-based MC model,
    information is encoded in various forms, for example, based on different concentration
    intensities and distinct release times of molecules. The nano-device acting as
    a transmitter emits such encoded molecules to the wireless molecular channel.
    At the receiver side, another nano-device decodes the signals based on the quantified
    received intensities or times of arrival, given that the channel remains stationary
    for the duration of transmission. In such transmissions, some molecules will get
    dispersed in the channel and will not be received by the target nano-devices,
    they are hence treated as noise, and channels with such residual molecules are
    characterized as channels with memory. For such channels, the theories of Fick’s
    diffusion and particle location displacement are used to characterize the channel
    capacity as a function of a collection of parameters, including the diffusion
    coefficient of the channel, the temperature, the distance between end-transceivers,
    and the bandwidth of the transmitted signal [178]. 2) IoBNT in Public Health Applications
    Late 2019 and 2020 have seen the novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19 spread
    worldwide, causing high fatalities and a plethora of other public health issues.
    More generally, such outbreaks, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome
    (SARS) in 2002, the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, the Ebola
    virus disease in 2014, and the seasonal influenza, raise questions about the manner
    in which public health systems should react to such epidemics and pandemics. The
    widespread havoc caused by pandemics calls for effective means to identify new
    viruses, understand their mechanisms of viral infection, and devise efficient
    tools for treatment and vaccination. In order to facilitate the development of
    antiviral and preventive solutions, researchers have looked into creating biosensors
    that can monitor the cleavage of proteases within infected cells [179]. Proteases
    are generated as a result of the cell being infected by the genome of coronavirus,
    which is a type of RNA virus. Other byproducts include synthesized polyproteins
    which can replicate and transcript to generate more RNAs, and structural proteins
    that can construct new virions [180]. Two types of proteases found in the coronaviruses
    that cause SARS and MERS (i.e., SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov) are papain-like protease
    and 3C-like protease. The biosensor, which is based on luciferase, is used to
    identify potential broad-spectrum coronavirus papain-like or 3C-like protease
    inhibitors. The SARS-CoV-2 virions that cause the COVID-19 disease have a diameter
    of 50–200 nanometers approximately [181], and infect the human respiratory system
    via human-to-human spread, in the form of droplets discharged when an infected
    person coughs or sneezes [182]. COVID-19 has thus far posed unprecedented challenges
    worldwide in testing, treatment, and vaccine development. The IoBNT is envisioned
    to have immense potential in the molecular diagnosis of emerging viruses of this
    kind. The nanosensors, which can be firefly luciferase-based or other reporter
    genes, can be used to examine the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
    in collected samples. Other tests include using bio-nano-sensors to identify antibodies
    from blood samples to examine if the person is infected. In terms of treatment,
    although no antiviral drugs are available for COVID-19 yet, studies on influenza
    treatment can shed light on how the IoBNT could assist in future solution development.
    A critical step for treatment is the antiviral intervention, which blocks the
    intracellular signaling pathways to prevent influenza viruses from replication.
    A reported solution preventing the virus from replication is to use engineered
    bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) to trap the Ebola virus [183]. In the reported
    work, the blood of a patient with the Ebola virus infection is transmitted to
    a microfluidic chamber tube outside the body which contains the engineered bacteria.
    The scattered bacteria can then achieve protein binding with the Ebola virus using
    chemical bind force and synthetic protein binding receptors [183]. More importantly,
    the IoBNT serves a unique role as a holistic solution to not only monitor limited
    types of cells (e.g., squamous epithelial cells from nasopharyngeal swabs for
    COVID-19 tests), but also across different tissues and systems. It is found that
    such coronaviruses can also cause damage to digestive and neurological systems
    [181], [184]. Hence, a series of connected bio-nano-things consisting of various
    types of engineered bacteria can operate simultaneously to improve test reliability
    and treatment efficiency. 3) Artificial Intelligence in IoBNT for Health Applications
    In the IoBNT network, different systems demonstrate a wide variation in characteristics,
    thereby requiring varied analytical approaches. For example, in cardiovascular
    systems, the speed of molecular transmission is determined by the speed of blood
    flow and heart rate, among other factors, which may vary per person; whereas in
    the nervous system, the time required to propagate information-carrying electro-chemical
    stimuli through neurons depends on the connectivity of synapses. In order to estimate
    the error rate and capacity, the existing diffusion-based MC model normally requires
    several channel parameters to formulate the model for computation. The generic
    modeling approach provides initial insights into the behavior of molecular signal
    transmission, however, recent advances in statistical learning, that utilize artificial
    intelligence, provide increasingly refined solutions for modeling sophisticated
    molecular information exchange processes. For example, in [77], a signal detection
    algorithm based on neural networks has been shown to achieve good performance
    without prior knowledge of the molecular channel, thus lending support to the
    use of statistical inference for characterizing molecular communication channels.
    Furthermore, a neural network-based nano-receiver design has been proposed in
    [185] which shows good bit error rate performance under the effect of inter-symbol
    interference. 4) Open Problems for IoBNT Currently, IoBNT primarily focuses on
    studies in the domains of physical layer channel modeling, capacity analysis,
    modulation and coding schemes, and nano-transceiver design. However, research
    gaps relating to the following aspects need to be overcome: Experimental Validation:
    The theoretical models of molecular communications should be validated under realistic
    channel environments, which include experimental testing. Traditionally, these
    experimental tests have posed high requirements on lab equipment and the nurturing
    process of cells and bacteria. While the procedures for such experiments should
    be strictly followed and executed, at times the cost for testing can be remarkably
    high. In such situations, simulations based on realistic assumptions serve as
    an alternative means, which have been commonly adopted in research. The convergence
    between analytical and experimental approaches should be a joint effors by researchers
    across fields in telecommunications, biomedical engineering, and signal processing.
    Data Storage and Management: The large data sets obtained from experiments or
    simulations can have many control variables which require efforts to manage and
    update. Open databases have become a popular trend for sharing raw data to benefit
    the entire research community for collaboration, and can be a foreseeable direction
    for research in the IoBNT. C. Quantum Communications As networks continue to evolve
    beyond 6G, they are expected to incorporate more spectrum, a larger variety of
    transceiver front-ends, higher complexity in processed signals, and stricter requirement
    on reliability, and therefore, it is expected that the computational requirements
    of wireless systems will also increase [186]. To this end, quantum computing has
    been widely recognized as a key enabling technology for realizing computationally
    complex systems [187]. Quantum systems are particularly useful for solving complex
    optimization problems. For example, in the optimal routing problem with multiple
    objectives, traditional methods, including the geographic routing algorithm, demonstrate
    significant complexities to yield optimal solutions, and less complex ones often
    sacrifice optimality [188]. It has been demonstrated that using quantum computing
    for such problems can efficiently reduce complexity while achieving optimality
    [189]. However, such computationally intensive tasks often require several hundreds
    of thousands or millions of interconnected quantum bits, and therefore cannot
    be performed on a single quantum chip. The need for interconnecting several chips
    of this kind has given rise to the concept of quantum communications. Quantum
    communications is thus indispensable for operating quantum systems at scale [190].
    More specifically, quantum communications is defined as the exchange of information
    that adheres to the laws of quantum mechanics, and offers several key advantages:
    (i) the capability of large-scale parallel computation, (ii) the ability to transfer
    data in a tamper-proof manner, and (iii) the potential to encode and transmit
    a large number of multiple data streams simultaneously. We begin our discussion
    of quantum communications by describing the following four postulates or rules
    that govern the operation of such systems [191]: Postulate 1 - The Quantum Bit:
    Within the context of classical communications, a binary value of either 0 or
    1 per bit is used to represent data. On the other hand, in quantum communications,
    the quantum bit, or qubit, contains the superposition of both logical values at
    the same time, of the form |Φ⟩= a 0 |0⟩+ a 1 |1⟩, (1) View Source where |Φ⟩ represents
    a two-dimensional vector, with the coefficients a 0 and a 1 being complex numbers,
    and 0 and 1 being the two logical values. Postulate 2 - The Quantum Register:
    Just like computing registers that are used to store multiple bits, quantum registers
    are used for storing qubits. However, unlike classical registers that are deterministic,
    the output of a quantum register is probabilistic, i.e., when reading or measuring
    the quantum register, a different value may be returned each time, thus presenting
    a major challenge in the implementation of quantum information exchange systems.
    Postulate 3 - Exponential Speed-up: Exponential speed-up is a key property of
    quantum information processing systems. We know that classical systems employ
    parallelization wherein multiple computing units process parallel streams of data
    simultaneously. On the other hand, in quantum systems, the entire input information
    is placed in a single quantum register, and a single quantum computing unit can
    process multiple register states simultaneously, thus achieving a significant
    reduction in the time required for computation. Postulate 4 - The Q/C Conversion:
    Since it is far easier to perceive information in terms of 0s and 1s, i.e., classical
    information, it becomes imperative to interpret the results of any quantum operation
    in the classical domain. To this end, the classical interpretation of (1) implies
    that, if we were to measure such a qubit, we would receive value 0 with probability
    p 0 =| a 0 | 2 and value 1 with p 1 =| a 1 | 2 . Closely related to the four postulates
    is the concept of entanglement [191]. Entanglement is a phenomenon in which the
    quantum states of two or more particles are described with reference to each other.
    Within this context, these particles exist in a shared state, and are referred
    to as entangled pairs. Any action on a particle within the entangled pair immediately
    affects all other particles within that pair, irrespective of the physical separation
    between them. For example, if a photon traveling through an optical fiber is entangled
    with another photon outside the fiber, the photon inside the fiber will experience
    the same effects as those experienced by the photon on the outside. In this case,
    entanglement serves as a source of noise in the quantum channel. Continuing our
    discussion of quantum channels, we note that classical information theory does
    not apply to these channels. Unlike traditional wireless communication channels
    where the large- and small-scale parameters are deterministic or can be stochastically
    characterized, the capacity of qubit carrying quantum channels is defined as the
    rate at which classical or quantum information increases with each use of the
    quantum channel [192]. Moreover, there exist several different types of capacities
    for quantum channels, including but not limited to the classical capacity, the
    quantum capacity, the private capacity, the entanglement assisted capacity, and
    the zero-error capacity. The classical and quantum capacities are the two most
    commonly used definitions. In particular, while the classical capacity measures
    classical information transmission over a noisy quantum channel, the quantum capacity
    represents the amount of quantum information, i.e., qubits, that can be transmitted
    through a noisy quantum channel. We refer the interested reader to [192] for additional
    insight into each of these channel capacity types. In the following, we discuss
    the different types of channels, data routing, and open problems within the domain
    of quantum communications. 1) Types of Channels Within the broader domain of quantum
    communications, we take into consideration the following types of channel, the
    dephasing channel and the depolarizing channel [193], [194]. The Dephasing Channel:
    The dephasing channel, also known as the phase damping or phase flip channel,
    applies a bit flip in the conjugate basis. The impact of the dephasing channel
    can be best described as equivalent to measuring the qubit in the computational
    basis and then forgetting the result of the measurement. A more detailed treatment
    of the nuances of the dephasing channel can be found in [193, §4]. The Depolarizing
    Channel: The depolarizing channel is often referred to the “worst-case scenario”
    and describes the fact that the qubit may be left unchanged with a probability
    1−p , with p ∈[0,1] , or that an error may occur with probability p . In this
    case, the error could be one of three types, with each being equally likely– the
    bit flip error, the phase flip error, or both. In the event of an error, it is
    assumed that the channel replaces the lost qubit with a maximally mixed state
    [194, §2], i.e, all states become equally likely. For example, the maximally mixed
    state with reference to (1) implies that a 0 = a 1 . 2) Quantum Communications
    Networks Quantum networks are key to the success of distributed quantum computing,
    and in turn rely on the ability to share quantum states between different quantum
    devices. However, unlike conventional networks that are based on the store-and-forward
    paradigm, quantum networks must adhere to the no-cloning theorem which prohibits
    making copies of an arbitrary quantum state [195]. In order to overcome this restriction,
    quantum networks rely on the concept of entanglement [196] described earlier,
    along with quantum teleportation. The process of quantum teleportation [197] leverages
    entanglement to transmit unknown quantum states between remote quantum devices,
    through remote entanglement distribution [198]. Further, as shown in Figure 15,
    we note the following physical entities that constitute quantum networks [190]:
    Quantum Nodes: These are the quantum devices that are interconnected to each other.
    Communication Links: These include both classical as well quantum links that interconnect
    the quantum nodes in the network. Entanglement Generator: This device is responsible
    for generating the entangled pairs that are distributed between the quantum nodes.
    Quantum Memories: These are primarily used for storing quantum states for the
    purpose of communication. Quantum Measurement Devices: Their primary function
    is the assessment of the generated entangled states. FIGURE 15. Physical entities
    associated with quantum networks [190]. Show All While the aforementioned entities
    play a vital role in enabling quantum networks, the process of quantum teleportation
    is affected by the exponential decay of communication rate with distance, which
    in turn is offset by the use of quantum repeaters. The routing problem then involves
    the selection of the optimal path from the source to the destination traversing
    one or more quantum repeaters resulting in a high-quality entanglement distribution.
    Further, the routing framework must also take cognizance of the fact that the
    physical mechanisms underlying quantum entanglement are stochastic, and that the
    passage of time leads to loss of entanglement between the entangled pair [198].
    Expanding upon this, in the following section, we delve into some of the major
    challenges faced by quantum networks today. 3) Open Problems and Major Challenges
    Given the vast differences between the classical and quantum domains, there are
    several fundamental research challenges, that are vital to the success of quantum
    networks, as detailed next. Quantum Error Correction: There are three major challenges
    faced by error correction techniques for qubits [199]. First, while classical
    error correction codes assume that data can be duplicated freely, the no-cloning
    theorem precludes the arbitrary duplication of quantum states. Second, since qubits
    are susceptible to both bit-flip and phase-flip errors, quantum error correction
    techniques need to be able to detect both error types simultaneously, unlike classical
    techniques that take only bit-flips into consideration. Third, there exists the
    possibility of wavefunction collapse [200] due to measurements on the qubits performed
    as part of the error correction procedure. Entanglement Distribution: Long distance
    entanglement distribution is a key challenge in the realization of quantum networks,
    impacting the physical, link, and network layers [196]. More specifically, at
    the physical layer, there is a need for quantum error correction techniques, while
    the no-cloning theorem necessitates a re-design of the link layer. At the network
    layer, novel quantum routing metrics are required to ensure optimal path selection.
    Deployment Challenges: Quantum computing devices require highly specialized data
    centers equipped with ultra-high vacuum systems and ultra-low temperature cryostats.
    Further, while quantum teleportation has been proposed as a means to realize quantum
    networks, it requires the integration of classical and quantum communication resources,
    which is a fairly complex problem in itself. SECTION XII. Tentative Timeline for
    6G Thus far, we have described the manner in which the evolution of societal needs
    will guide the transition from 5G to 6G, along with a plethora of new and upcoming
    use cases that will be best served by 6G. We have also discussed the tentative
    KPIs associated with 6G and the key enabling technologies that will play a vital
    role in achieving these next-generation KPIs, as summarized in Table 2. As shown
    in Figure 16, the increasing technological readiness and worldwide deployments
    of 5G systems have set the stage for a thoughtful discussion on the future of
    wireless communications. TABLE 2 A Brief Summary of the KPI Impacts and Open Problems
    Associated With Each Key Enabling Technology for 6G and Beyond FIGURE 16. Projected
    timeline for 6G and beyond systems. Show All While 3GPP standards over the next
    few years, up to and including Release 18 in 2024, are expected to primarily deal
    with 5G, the ITU has recently convened the Focus Group on Technologies for Network
    2030 (FG NET-2030) [201], to study the capabilities of networks for the year 2030
    and beyond. More generally, as we have seen in the preceding sections, each of
    the presented key technologies has witnessed significant traction in terms of
    research and development, laying the groundwork for the next generation of wireless
    communications. Both the National Science Foundation (NSF) through its Platforms
    for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) initiative [202] and the European Commission
    [203] are expected to play a major role in the development of 6G. At the same
    time, going beyond academia, we expect a significant rise in industry involvement
    in the development of these technologies over the next few years, culminating
    in key hardware and software technology demos by 2025, followed by full-scale
    6G testbeds in 2026 and beyond. We envision that these testbeds will serve as
    the perfect backdrop for showcasing the potential of 6G and demonstrating its
    suitability for use cases such as multi-sensory holographic teleportation, real-time
    remote healthcare, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure and environments,
    to name a few. SECTION XIII. Conclusion This paper surveys the key enabling techniques
    for the next generation of wireless communication networks, outlines their essential
    use cases, and provides a perspective on current as well as future research and
    development efforts. We envision that 6G and beyond wireless systems will be largely
    driven by a focus on wireless ubiquity, i.e., the unrestricted availability of
    high quality wireless access. To this end, we have highlighted the key enabling
    technologies that are vital to the success of 6G and beyond systems. By detailing
    both the operational nuances and open challenges associated with each, we not
    only hope to provide a detailed insight into the next frontier in wireless communications,
    but also encourage readers to play their part in the realization of the envisioned
    ubiquitous wireless future. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank B.

    Media Tables Share SUMMARY Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a highly troublesome
    pathogen for many institutions globally. As a consequence of its immense ability
    to acquire or upregulate antibiotic drug resistance determinants, it has justifiably
    been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention. Apart from its predilection
    for the seriously ill within intensive care units, A. baumannii has more recently
    caused a range of infectious syndromes in military personnel injured in the Iraq
    and Afghanistan conflicts. This review details the significant advances that have
    been made in our understanding of this remarkable organism over the last 10 years,
    including current taxonomy and species identification, issues with susceptibility
    testing, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, global epidemiology, clinical impact
    of infection, host-pathogen interactions, and infection control and therapeutic
    considerations. INTRODUCTION The genus known as Acinetobacter has undergone significant
    taxonomic modification over the last 30 years. Its most important representative,
    Acinetobacter baumannii, has emerged as one of the most troublesome pathogens
    for health care institutions globally. Its clinical significance, especially over
    the last 15 years, has been propelled by its remarkable ability to upregulate
    or acquire resistance determinants, making it one of the organisms threatening
    the current antibiotic era. A. baumannii strains resistant to all known antibiotics
    have now been reported, signifying a sentinel event that should be acted on promptly
    by the international health care community. Acting in synergy with this emerging
    resistance profile is the uncanny ability of A. baumannii to survive for prolonged
    periods throughout a hospital environment, thus potentiating its ability for nosocomial
    spread. The organism commonly targets the most vulnerable hospitalized patients,
    those who are critically ill with breaches in skin integrity and airway protection.
    As reported from reviews dating back to the 1970s (199), hospital-acquired pneumonia
    is still the most common infection caused by this organism. However, in more recent
    times, infections involving the central nervous system, skin and soft tissue,
    and bone have emerged as highly problematic for certain institutions. Interest
    in Acinetobacter, from both the scientific and public community, has risen sharply
    over recent years. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of
    this fascinating organism since it was last reviewed in this journal in 1996 (28).
    In the present review, we describe these advances and also provide a comprehensive
    appraisal of the relevant microbiological, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics
    of A. baumannii, the most clinically relevant species. The epidemiology, clinical
    impact, and resistance mechanisms of Acinetobacter species outside the A. baumannii
    group are not covered in this review. MICROBIOLOGY Historical Perspective of the
    Genus Acinetobacter The history of the genus Acinetobacter dates back to the early
    20th century, in 1911, when Beijerinck, a Dutch microbiologist, described an organism
    named Micrococcus calco-aceticus that was isolated from soil by enrichment in
    a calcium-acetate-containing minimal medium (24). Over the following decades,
    similar organisms were described and assigned to at least 15 different genera
    and species, including Diplococcus mucosus (587), Micrococcus calcoaceticus (24),
    Alcaligenes haemolysans (228), Mima polymorpha (117), Moraxella lwoffi (14), Herellea
    vaginicola (116), Bacterium anitratum (485), Moraxella lwoffi var. glucidolytica
    (434), Neisseria winogradskyi (323), Achromobacter anitratus (60), and Achromobacter
    mucosus (352). For a comprehensive review of the history of the genus, the reader
    is referred to the work of Henriksen (228). The current genus designation, Acinetobacter
    (from the Greek ακινετοσ [akinetos], i.e., nonmotile), was initially proposed
    by Brisou and Prévot in 1954 to separate the nonmotile from the motile microorganisms
    within the genus Achromobacter (61). It was not until 1968 that this genus designation
    became more widely accepted (21). Baumann et al. published a comprehensive survey
    and concluded that the different species listed above belonged to a single genus,
    for which the name Acinetobacter was proposed, and that further subclassification
    into different species based on phenotypic characteristics was not possible (21).
    These findings resulted in the official acknowledgment of the genus Acinetobacter
    by the Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of Moraxella and Allied Bacteria in 1971 (324).
    In the 1974 edition of Bergey''s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (312), the
    genus Acinetobacter was listed, with the description of a single species, Acinetobacter
    calcoaceticus (the type strain for both the genus and the species is A. calcoaceticus
    ATCC 23055) (24). In the “Approved List of Bacterial Names,” in contrast, two
    different species, A. calcoaceticus and A. lwoffii, were included, based on the
    observation that some acinetobacters were able to acidify glucose whereas others
    were not (512). In the literature, based on the same properties, the species A.
    calcoaceticus was subdivided into two subspecies or biovars, A. calcoaceticus
    bv. anitratus (formerly called Herellea vaginicola) and A. calcoaceticus bv. lwoffii
    (formerly called Mima polymorpha). These designations, however, were never officially
    approved by taxonomists. Current Taxonomy The genus Acinetobacter, as currently
    defined, comprises gram-negative, strictly aerobic, nonfermenting, nonfastidious,
    nonmotile, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative bacteria with a DNA G+C content
    of 39% to 47%. Based on more recent taxonomic data, it was proposed that members
    of the genus Acinetobacter should be classified in the new family Moraxellaceae
    within the order Gammaproteobacteria, which includes the genera Moraxella, Acinetobacter,
    Psychrobacter, and related organisms (466). A major breakthrough in the long and
    complicated history of the genus was achieved in 1986 by Bouvet and Grimont, who—based
    on DNA-DNA hybridization studies—distinguished 12 DNA (hybridization) groups or
    genospecies, some of which were given formal species names, including A. baumannii,
    A. calcoaceticus, A. haemolyticus, A. johnsonii, A. junii, and A. lwoffii (51).
    Work done by Bouvet and Jeanjean, Tjernberg and Ursing, and Nishimura et al. (53,
    401, 542) resulted in the description of further Acinetobacter genomic species,
    including the named species A. radioresistens, which corresponds to Acinetobacter
    genomic species 12 described previously by Bouvet and Grimont (51). Some of the
    independently described (genomic) species turned out to be synonyms, e.g., A.
    lwoffii and Acinetobacter genomic species 9 or Acinetobacter genomic species 14,
    described by Bouvet and Jeanjean (14BJ), and Acinetobacter genomic species 13,
    described by Tjernberg and Ursing (13TU). More recently, 10 additional Acinetobacter
    species were described, including 3 species of human origin, A. parvus, A. schindleri,
    and A. ursingii (392, 393), and 7 species isolated from activated sludge (recovered
    from sewage plants), namely, A. baylyi, A. bouvetii, A. grimontii, A. tjernbergiae,
    A. towneri, A. tandoii, and A. gerneri (72), increasing the actual number of validly
    described (genomic) species to 31, of which 17 have been given valid species names
    (Table 1). It has to be noted, however, that some of the recently described environmental
    Acinetobacter species included only one or a few strains at the time of publication
    (72). Four of the above listed species, i.e., A. calcoaceticus, A. baumannii,
    Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU, are very
    closely related and difficult to distinguish from each other by phenotypic properties.
    It has therefore been proposed to refer to these species as the A. calcoaceticus-A.
    baumannii complex (189, 191). However, this group of organisms comprises not only
    the three most clinically relevant species that have been implicated in the vast
    majority of both community-acquired and nosocomial infections, i.e., A. baumannii,
    Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU (see below),
    but also an environmental species, A. calcoaceticus, that has frequently been
    recovered from soil and water but has, to our knowledge, never been implicated
    in serious clinical disease. Therefore, since it is the environmental species
    that has given its name to the complex, the designation A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii
    complex may be misleading and not appropriate if used in a clinical context. Species
    Identification Acinetobacters may be identified presumptively to the genus level
    as gram-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, nonmotile, nonfermenting
    coccobacilli. They are short, plump, gram-negative rods that are difficult to
    destain and may therefore be misidentified as either gram-negative or gram-positive
    cocci (hence the former designation Mimae). Acinetobacter species of human origin
    grow well on solid media that are routinely used in clinical microbiology laboratories,
    such as sheep blood agar or tryptic soy agar, at a 37°C incubation temperature.
    These organisms form smooth, sometimes mucoid, grayish white colonies; colonies
    of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex resemble those of Enterobacteriaceae,
    with a colony diameter of 1.5 to 3 mm after overnight culture, while most of the
    other Acinetobacter species produce smaller and more translucent colonies. Unlike
    the Enterobacteriaceae, some Acinetobacter species outside the A. calcoaceticus-A.
    baumannii complex may not grow on McConkey agar. Isolates of the species A. haemolyticus
    and several other currently not-well-defined species, such as Acinetobacter genomic
    species 6, 13BJ, 14BJ, 15BJ, 16, and 17, may show hemolysis on sheep blood agar,
    a property that is never present in Acinetobacter isolates belonging to the A.
    calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex. Unfortunately, no single metabolic test distinguishes
    acinetobacters from other similar nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria. A reliable
    method for unambiguous identification of acinetobacters to the genus level is
    the transformation assay of Juni, which is based on the unique property of mutant
    Acinetobacter strain BD413 trpE27, a naturally transformable tryptophan auxotroph
    recently identified as A. baylyi (574), to be transformed by crude DNA of any
    Acinetobacter species to a wild-type phenotype (281). For the recovery of acinetobacters
    from environmental and clinical specimens (e.g., skin swabs to detect skin colonization),
    enrichment culture at low pH in a vigorously aerated liquid mineral medium supplemented
    with acetate or another suitable carbon source and with nitrate as the nitrogen
    source has proven useful (20). To facilitate the isolation of acinetobacters from
    mixed bacterial populations, Leeds Acinetobacter medium was proposed (260). Of
    the few methods that have been validated for identification of Acinetobacter species,
    DNA-DNA hybridization remains the reference standard (51). The phenotypic identification
    scheme proposed by Bouvet and Grimont in 1986 is based on 28 phenotypic tests
    (51). This identification scheme was refined in 1987 by the same authors and includes
    growth at 37°C, 41°C, and 44°C; production of acid from glucose; gelatin hydrolysis;
    and assimilation of 14 different carbon sources (52). While this simplified identification
    scheme allows discrimination between 11 of the 12 genomic species initially described
    (51) and correctly identified to the species level 95.6% of 136 Acinetobacter
    isolates recovered from human skin samples (495), it does not permit identification
    of the more recently described (genomic) species. In particular, the closely related
    and clinically most relevant species A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species
    13TU cannot be distinguished, while A. calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic
    species 3 can only be separated by their growth properties at different temperatures
    (191). Unfortunately, simple phenotypic tests that are commonly used in routine
    diagnostic laboratories for identification of other bacterial genera to the species
    level are unsuitable for unambiguous identification of even the most common Acinetobacter
    species. Both DNA-DNA hybridization and the phenotypic identification system of
    Bouvet and Grimont are laborious and far from being suitable for routine microbiology
    laboratories. In fact, these methods are available in only a few reference laboratories
    worldwide. Molecular methods that have been developed and validated for identification
    of acinetobacters include amplified 16S rRNA gene restriction analysis (ARDRA)
    (572; for an evaluation of ARDRA, see reference 127), high-resolution fingerprint
    analysis by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) (258, 392), ribotyping
    (189), tRNA spacer fingerprinting (146), restriction analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA
    intergenic spacer sequences (131), sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA gene
    spacer region (79), and sequencing of the rpoB (RNA polymerase β-subunit) gene
    and its flanking spacers (310). ARDRA and AFLP analysis are currently the most
    widely accepted and validated reference methods for species identification of
    acinetobacters, with a large library of profiles available for both reference
    and clinical strains, while tRNA fingerprinting, though generally also suitable
    for species identification, does not discriminate between A. baumannii and Acinetobacter
    genomic species 13TU. Both ribotyping and sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA
    gene spacer region were found to discriminate between species of the A. calcoaceticus-A.
    baumannii complex but have not been applied to other Acinetobacter species, and
    sequencing of the rpoB gene, although very promising, awaits further validation.
    All of these methods have contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology
    and clinical significance of Acinetobacter species during recent years, but they
    are too laborious to be applied in day-to-day diagnostic microbiology, and their
    use for the time being is also confined mainly to reference laboratories. More
    recent developments include the identification of A. baumannii by detection of
    the blaOXA-51-like carbapenemase gene intrinsic to this species (559), PCR-electrospray
    ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI-MS) (145), and a simple PCR-based method
    described by Higgins et al. (234) that exploits differences in their respective
    gyrB genes to rapidly differentiate between A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic
    species 13TU. Promising results with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight
    MS have been obtained for species identification of 552 well-characterized Acinetobacter
    strains representing 15 different species (496). Matrix-assisted laser desorption
    ionization-time-of-flight MS allows for species identification in less than 1
    hour, but it requires expensive equipment and needs further evaluation. Species
    identification with manual and semiautomated commercial identification systems
    that are currently used in diagnostic microbiology, such as the API 20NE, Vitek
    2, Phoenix, and MicroScan WalkAway systems, remains problematic (33, 35, 244).
    This can be explained in part by their limited database content but also because
    the substrates used for bacterial species identification have not been tailored
    specifically to identify acinetobacters. In particular, the three clinically relevant
    members of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex cannot be separated by currently
    available commercial identification systems; in fact, A. baumannii, Acinetobacter
    genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU are uniformly identified
    as A. baumannii by the most widely used identification systems. In referring to
    these species, it therefore seems appropriate to use the term A. baumannii group
    instead of A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex. This reflects the fact that
    A. baumannii, Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species
    13TU share important clinical and epidemiological characteristics (124, 335, 498)
    and also eliminates the confusion resulting from inclusion of an environmental
    species, A. calcoaceticus (see above). However, since the vast majority of studies
    that have addressed epidemiological and clinical issues related to Acinetobacter
    have not employed identification methods that allow for unambiguous species identification
    within the A. baumannii group, the designation A. baumannii in this review, if
    not stated otherwise, is used in a broader sense to also accommodate Acinetobacter
    genomic species 3 and 13TU. The need for species identification of acinetobacters
    in routine clinical laboratories has been questioned by some researchers (191).
    From a clinical and infection control point of view, however, it is necessary
    to distinguish between the A. baumannii group and acinetobacters outside the A.
    baumannii group since the latter organisms rarely have infection control implications.
    In addition, these organisms are usually susceptible to a range of antimicrobials,
    and infections caused by these organisms are most often benign. From a research
    perspective, in contrast, clinical studies using proper methods for species identification
    of acinetobacters, including those within the A. baumannii group, are mandatory
    to increase our knowledge of the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and clinical impact
    of the various species of this diverse genus. Natural Habitats Members of the
    genus Acinetobacter are considered ubiquitous organisms. This holds true for the
    genus Acinetobacter, since acinetobacters can be recovered after enrichment culture
    from virtually all samples obtained from soil or surface water (20). These earlier
    findings have contributed to the common misconception that A. baumannii is also
    ubiquitous in nature (171). In fact, not all species of the genus Acinetobacter
    have their natural habitat in the environment. However, a systematic study to
    investigate the natural occurrence of the various Acinetobacter species in the
    environment has never been performed. Most Acinetobacter species that have been
    recovered from human clinical specimens have at least some significance as human
    pathogens (493, 502). Acinetobacters are part of the human skin flora. In an epidemiological
    survey performed to investigate the colonization of human skin and mucous membranes
    with Acinetobacter species, up to 43% of nonhospitalized individuals were found
    to be colonized with these organisms (495). The most frequently isolated species
    were A. lwoffii (58%), A. johnsonii (20%), A. junii (10%), and Acinetobacter genomic
    species 3 (6%). In a similar study, a carrier rate of 44% was found for healthy
    volunteers, with A. lwoffii (61%), Acinetobacter genomic species 15BJ (12%), A.
    radioresistens (8%), and Acinetobacter genomic species 3 (5%) being the most prevalent
    species (31). In patients hospitalized on a regular ward, the carriage rate of
    Acinetobacter species was even higher, at 75% (495). Dijkshoorn et al. studied
    fecal carriage of Acinetobacter and found a carrier rate of 25% among healthy
    individuals, with A. johnsonii and Acinetobacter genomic species 11 predominating
    (126). In contrast, A. baumannii, the most important nosocomial Acinetobacter
    species, was found only rarely on human skin (0.5% and 3% in references 31 and
    495, respectively) and in human feces (0.8%) (126), and Acinetobacter genomic
    species 13TU was not found at all (31, 126, 495). More recently, Griffith et al.
    investigated the nares of healthy U.S. soldiers and did not find acinetobacters
    at all, but they did not use enrichment culture to increase the recovery rate
    (211). In a subsequent study, Griffith et al. did not detect skin carriage of
    the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex among a representative sample of 102
    U.S. Army soldiers deployed in Iraq, but again, they performed cultures without
    enrichment and with an extremely long transport time that may have contributed
    to this finding (212). Notably, in tropical climates, the situation may be different.
    In Hong Kong, Chu et al. found 53% of medical students and new nurses to be colonized
    with acinetobacters in summer versus 32% in winter (91). Such a seasonal variability
    in skin colonization may contribute to the seasonal variation seen in the prevalence
    of A. baumannii in clinical samples (360). Acinetobacter genomic species 3 (36%),
    Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU (15%), Acinetobacter genomic species 15TU (6%),
    and A. baumannii (4%) were the most frequently recovered species, while A. lwoffii,
    A. johnsonii, and A. junii were only rarely found. Although various Acinetobacter
    species have been isolated from animals and A. baumannii was occasionally found
    as an etiologic agent in infected animals (173, 571), the normal flora of animals
    has never been studied systematically for the presence of acinetobacters. Of note,
    A. baumannii was recovered from 22% of body lice sampled from homeless people
    (311). It has been speculated that this finding might result from clinically silent
    bacteremia in these people; the clinical significance of this observation, however,
    is not yet clear. The inanimate environment has also been studied for the presence
    of acinetobacters. Berlau et al. investigated vegetables in the United Kingdom
    and found that 30 of 177 vegetables (17%) were culture positive for Acinetobacter
    (32). Interestingly, A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 11 (each at
    27%) were the predominant species, followed by A. calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter
    genomic species 3 (each at 13%), while Acinetobacter genomic species 13 was found
    only once. In Hong Kong, 51% of local vegetables were culture positive for Acinetobacter
    species, the majority of which were Acinetobacter genomic species 3 (75%), but
    one sample grew A. baumannii (245). Houang et al. found acinetobacters in 22 of
    60 soil samples in Hong Kong, and the most frequent species were Acinetobacter
    genomic species 3 (27%) and A. baumannii (23%), with only one sample yielding
    A. calcoaceticus (245). In an unpublished study from Germany, 92 of 163 samples
    (56%) from soil and surface water yielded acinetobacters, and A. calcoaceticus,
    A. johnsonii, A. haemolyticus, and Acinetobacter genomic species 11 were found
    most frequently. Only a single sample yielded A. baumannii, three samples were
    positive with Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species
    13TU was not found at all in soil and water (H. Seifert, personal communication).
    Some recently described Acinetobacter species, i.e., A. baylyi, A. bouvetii, A.
    grimontii, A. tjernbergiae, A. towneri, and A. tandoii, that were isolated from
    activated sludge are obviously environmental species and have, as yet, never been
    found in humans (72). In contrast, two other recently described species, A. schindleri
    and A. ursingii, have been recovered only from human specimens, while A. parvus
    was found in humans and was also cultured from a dog (138, 392, 393). In conclusion,
    although available data derive from only a few studies, some Acinetobacter species
    indeed seem to be distributed widely in nature, i.e., A. calcoaceticus is found
    in water and soil and on vegetables; Acinetobacter genomic species 3 is found
    in water and soil, on vegetables, and on human skin; A. johnsonii is found in
    water and soil, on human skin, and in human feces; A. lwoffii and A. radioresistens
    are found on human skin; and Acinetobacter genomic species 11 is found in water
    and soil, on vegetables, and in the human intestinal tract. At least in Europe,
    the carrier rate of A. baumannii in the community is rather low. Also, although
    it has been found in soil samples in Hong Kong and on vegetables in the United
    Kingdom, A. baumannii does not appear to be a typical environmental organism.
    Existing data are not sufficient to determine if the occurrence of severe community-acquired
    A. baumannii infections that have been observed in tropical climates (8, 325,
    591) may be associated with an environmental source. Acinetobacter genomic species
    13TU was found on human skin in Hong Kong but not in Europe. Also, it has not
    been identified in the inanimate environment. Thus, the natural habitats of both
    A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU still remain to be defined.
    MECHANISMS OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE The wide array of antimicrobial resistance
    mechanisms that have been described for A. baumannii is impressive and rivals
    those of other nonfermentative gram-negative pathogens (Table 2) (426, 443). The
    rapid global emergence of A. baumannii strains resistant to all β-lactams, including
    carbapenems, illustrates the potential of this organism to respond swiftly to
    changes in selective environmental pressure. Upregulation of innate resistance
    mechanisms and acquisition of foreign determinants are critical skills that have
    brought A. baumannii great respect. Despite the absence of data on the genetic
    competence of A. baumannii, other Acinetobacter spp., in particular A. baylyi,
    are highly competent and recombinogenic (16, 574). A recent study by Fournier
    et al. typifies the genetic agility and broad resistance armamentarium of A. baumannii
    (172). After performing whole-genome sequencing of a clinical epidemic A. baumannii
    strain found in France (AYE), an 86-kb resistance island, one of the largest to
    be described thus far, was identified (AbaR1). Of the 88 predicted open reading
    frames (ORFs) within this genomic region, 82 were predicted to have originated
    from other gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., and
    Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the G+C content of this region was 52.8%, compared
    to 38.8% for the remaining chromosome, indicating a likely foreign source. Overall,
    52 resistance genes were identified, and surprisingly, 45 (86.5%) were localized
    to the AbaR1 resistance island (172). The genetic surroundings of these resistance
    determinants provided more evidence for genetic promiscuity, with an array of
    broad-host-range mobile genetic elements identified, including three class 1 integrons,
    transposons, and insertion sequence (IS) elements. Interestingly, no plasmid markers
    were identified in this resistance hot spot, and of the three plasmids found within
    the AYE strain, none contained any known resistance marker (172). Compared to
    a susceptible A. baumannii strain from the same geographic region (SDF), a similar
    structure was identified (AbaG1) in the homologous ATPase-like ORF, but it was
    devoid of resistance determinants (172). To assess whether this hot spot is conserved
    among A. baumannii strains, a further 22 clinical strains were screened. Seventy-seven
    percent had an intact ATPase ORF yet also had a multidrug resistance phenotype
    (172), indicating that resistance determinants can be inserted into other areas
    of the genome. Similarly, the recently published genome sequence of A. baumannii
    ATCC 17978 demonstrated a wide array of resistance markers but only one within
    the homologous location to that described by Fournier et al. (514), again illustrating
    the genetic flexibility of this pathogen. β-Lactams Enzymatic mechanisms. The
    most prevalent mechanism of β-lactam resistance in A. baumannii is enzymatic degradation
    by β-lactamases. However, in keeping with the complex nature of this organism,
    multiple mechanisms often work in concert to produce the same phenotype (47, 165,
    446). Inherent to all A. baumannii strains are chromosomally encoded AmpC cephalosporinases
    (49, 249, 250, 427, 468), also known as Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases
    (ADCs) (249). Unlike that of AmpC enzymes found in other gram-negative organisms,
    inducible AmpC expression does not occur in A. baumannii (49, 233). The key determinant
    regulating overexpression of this enzyme in A. baumannii is the presence of an
    upstream IS element known as ISAba1 (described below) (106, 233, 468, 492). The
    presence of this element highly correlates with increased AmpC gene expression
    and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (106, 468). Cefepime and carbapenems
    appear to be stable in response to these enzymes (249). Extended-spectrum β-lactamases
    (ESBLs) from the Ambler class A group have also been described for A. baumannii,
    but assessment of their true prevalence is hindered by difficulties with laboratory
    detection, especially in the presence of an AmpC. More recent focus has been on
    VEB-1, which disseminated throughout hospitals in France (clonal dissemination)
    and was also recently reported from Belgium and Argentina (VEB-1a) (71, 381, 382,
    417, 442); PER-1, from France, Turkey, Belgium, Romania, Korea, and the United
    States (250, 381, 385, 439, 565, 611); and PER-2, from Argentina (417). Interestingly,
    blaVEB-1 was found to be integron borne (class 1) yet encoded on the chromosome
    (442). This integron was identical to that identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
    in Thailand (197) and was also associated with an upstream IS element (IS26),
    indicating the possible origin and mechanism of spread to A. baumannii (442).
    blaPER-1 is either plasmid or chromosomally encoded and also has an upstream IS
    element (ISPa12) that may enhance its expression (438). Other ESBLs identified
    in A. baumannii include TEM-92 and -116 (148, 387), from Italy and The Netherlands,
    respectively, and SHV-12 from China and The Netherlands (248, 387). Also, CTX-M-2
    and CTX-M-43 have been described from Japan and Bolivia, respectively (76, 386).
    Narrow-spectrum β-lactamases, such as TEM-1 and TEM-2, are also prevalent in A.
    baumannii (111, 250, 579), but their current clinical significance is limited
    given the potency of other resistance determinants. Of the β-lactamases, those
    with carbapenemase activity are most concerning and include the serine oxacillinases
    (Ambler class D OXA type) and the metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) (Ambler class B)
    (443, 447, 589). Thus far, the Ambler class A carbapenemases (KPC, GES, SME, NMC,
    and IMI) have not been described for A. baumannii (447). For a detailed review
    of carbapenemases in A. baumannii, readers are referred to an excellent review
    by Poirel and Nordmann (443), and for carbapenemases in general, see the work
    of Queenan and Bush (447). A summary of OXA-type enzymes in A. baumannii is shown
    in Fig. 1. The first identified OXA-type enzyme with carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity
    was from a clinical A. baumannii strain isolated in 1985 from Edinburgh, Scotland
    (418). This plasmid-encoded resistance determinant (initially named ARI-1) was
    found to be transferable, and the gene was later sequenced and named blaOXA-23
    (132, 482). This enzyme type now contributes to carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii
    globally (46, 99, 107, 110, 250, 264, 265, 298, 358, 384, 556, 566, 585, 619).
    OXA-27 and OXA-49 are closely related enzymes that make up the blaOXA-23 gene
    cluster in A. baumannii (3, 65) (Fig. 1). Two other acquired OXA-type gene clusters
    with carbapenemase activity have been described, including the blaOXA-24-like
    (encoding OXA-24, -25, -26, and -40) (3, 50, 70, 114, 230, 342, 344) and the blaOXA-58-like
    (36, 42, 98, 196, 421, 440, 441, 445, 550, 564, 617) carbapenemase genes. The
    crystal structure of OXA-24 was recently described and provides important insights
    for future drug development toward this emerging class of carbapenemases (477).
    blaOXA-58 was identified more recently and, similar to blaOXA-23, is often plasmid
    mediated (441), which may explain its widespread distribution (98, 358, 421).
    blaOXA-58 has also been identified in A. junii from Romania and Australia (358,
    423). The final gene cluster, blaOXA-51-like genes (encoding OXA-51, -64, -65,
    -66, -68, -69, -70, -71, -78, -79, -80, and -82), is unique in that it is naturally
    occurring in A. baumannii, hence its chromosomal location and prevalence (66,
    98, 231, 250, 559, 564, 606, 619). Similar to other class D enzymes, its product
    has a greater affinity for imipenem than for meropenem (66, 230). Its role in
    carbapenem resistance appears to be related to the presence of ISAba1 (558). In
    the absence of this element, cloning studies suggest a minimal effect on carbapenem
    susceptibility, even in the presence of an overexpressed multidrug efflux pump
    (AdeABC) (231). Given the multiplicity of β-lactam resistance mechanisms in A.
    baumannii (443), the contributions of the acquired carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases
    to carbapenem resistance are often difficult to determine. This issue has been
    addressed by Heritier et al., who studied the changes in susceptibility profiles
    of both natural and recombinant plasmids containing blaOXA-23, blaOXA-40 (only
    a recombinant plasmid, as no natural plasmid was identified), and blaOXA-58 in
    different host backgrounds (232). blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-40 appeared to produce
    higher MICs of imipenem than did blaOXA-58, and all blaOXA genes produced higher
    MICs of imipenem in the presence of an overexpressed AdeABC efflux pump. Inactivation
    of the blaOXA-40 gene led to susceptibility to carbapenems, and resistance was
    restored with complementation. Interestingly, the natural plasmids containing
    blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-58, extracted from clinical isolates, produced significantly
    greater levels of resistance to carbapenems than did their respective recombinant
    plasmids in similar host backgrounds (232). This discrepancy is most likely due
    to the presence of IS elements in the natural plasmids. The importance of IS elements
    for carbapenem resistance due to oxacillinases in A. baumannii has only recently
    been appreciated (107, 441, 558). These elements provide two main functions (www-is.biotoul.fr/is.html
    ). First, they encode a transposase and therefore are mobile. Second, they can
    contain promoter regions that lead to overexpression of downstream resistance
    determinants. Most commonly, these elements have been described in association
    with blaOXA-23 (107, 250, 384, 558, 566, 619) and blaOXA-58 (196, 440, 441, 444,
    550), but they may also promote carbapenem resistance in association with blaOXA-51
    (558) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, certain IS elements, especially ISAba1, appear
    relatively unique to A. baumannii (491). As described in this section, IS elements
    are also important for the expression of resistance to other antibiotics in A.
    baumannii (438, 442, 455, 468, 469). Despite MBLs being less commonly identified
    in A. baumannii than the OXA-type carbapenemases, their hydrolytic activities
    toward carbapenems are significantly more potent (100- to 1,000-fold) (443). These
    enzymes have the capability of hydrolyzing all β-lactams (including carbapenems)
    except the monobactam aztreonam, which may assist in laboratory detection. Of
    the five MBL groups described to date (589), only three have been identified in
    A. baumannii, including IMP (89, 104, 113, 179, 246, 265, 298, 316, 402, 471,
    506, 530, 544, 618), VIM (316, 335, 551, 606, 615), and SIM (320) types. Several
    geographic regions, such as Spain, Singapore, Greece, and Australia, have shown
    the presence of both OXA- and MBL-type enzymes in the same strains (70, 298, 423,
    551). Unlike the OXA-type enzymes, MBLs are most commonly found within integrons,
    which are specialized genetic structures that facilitate the acquisition and expression
    (via a common promoter) of resistance determinants. Most acquired MBL genes in
    A. baumannii have been found within class 1 integrons, often containing an array
    of resistance gene cassettes, especially those encoding aminoglycoside-modifying
    enzymes (246, 320, 458, 551, 618). Not surprisingly, A. baumannii strains carrying
    integrons have been found to be significantly more drug resistant than strains
    without integrons (216). The clinical significance of this unique genetic structure
    is that overuse of one antimicrobial may lead to overexpression of multiple resistance
    determinants as a consequence of a common promoter. In isolation, integrons are
    not mobile and therefore are embedded within plasmids or transposons that act
    as the genetic vehicles for resistance dissemination. For a detailed review of
    MBLs, readers are referred to the work of Walsh et al. (589). Nonenzymatic mechanisms.
    β-Lactam resistance, including carbapenem resistance, has also been ascribed to
    nonenzymatic mechanisms, including changes in outer membrane proteins (OMPs) (47,
    108, 119, 165, 209, 336, 380, 446, 510, 511), multidrug efflux pumps (232, 236,
    347), and alterations in the affinity or expression of penicillin-binding proteins
    (165, 188, 406, 510). Relative to other gram-negative pathogens, very little is
    known about the outer membrane porins of A. baumannii. Recently, the loss of a
    29-kDa protein, also known as CarO, was shown to be associated with imipenem and
    meropenem resistance (336, 380, 511). This protein belongs to a novel family of
    OMPs found only in members of the Moraxellaceae family of the class Gammaproteobacteria
    (380). No specific imipenem-binding site was found in CarO (511), indicating that
    this porin forms nonspecific channels. A second protein, known as Omp25, was identified
    in association with CarO, but it lacked pore-forming capabilities (511). The loss
    of the CarO porin in imipenem-resistant A. baumannii appears secondary to carO
    gene disruption by distinct insertion elements (380). Clinical outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant
    A. baumannii due to porin loss, including reduced expression of 47-, 44-, and
    37-kDa OMPs in A. baumannii strains endemic to New York City (446) and reduced
    expression of 22- and 33-kDa OMPs in association with OXA-24 in Spain (47), have
    been described. Other identified OMPs relevant to β-lactam resistance include
    the heat-modifiable protein HMP-AB (209), which is homologous to OmpA of Enterobacteriaceae
    and OmpF of P. aeruginosa (580); a 33- to 36-kDa protein (94, 119); a 43-kDa protein
    which shows significant homology to OprD from P. aeruginosa (141); and OmpW, which
    is homologous to OmpW proteins found in E. coli and P. aeruginosa (510, 580).
    Interestingly, when comparative proteomic studies were performed between a multidrug-resistant
    A. baumannii strain and a reference strain, no difference in expression was identified
    for Omp33/36 or OprD, but CarO expression and the structural isoforms of OmpW
    were different (510). Further studies are still required to elucidate the significance
    of these porins and their overall prevalence in multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.
    As represented by Fournier et al., the genome of a multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    strain encodes a wide array of multidrug efflux systems (172). The resistance-nodulation-division
    (RND) family-type pump AdeABC is the best studied thus far and has a substrate
    profile that includes β-lactams (including carbapenems) (232, 236), aminoglycosides,
    erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim,
    and ethidium bromide (232, 236, 347, 356, 397, 420, 469). Similar to other RND-type
    pumps, AdeABC has a three-component structure: AdeB forms the transmembrane component,
    AdeA forms the inner membrane fusion protein, and AdeC forms the OMP. AdeABC is
    chromosomally encoded and is normally regulated by a two-component system with
    a sensor kinase (AdeS) and its associated response regulator (AdeR) (356). Point
    mutations within this regulatory system have been associated with pump overexpression
    (356), but such mutations are not necessary (420, 469). Most recently, disruption
    of the adeS gene by the IS element ISAba1 was identified (469). Insertional inactivation
    of the transmembrane component of the pump, encoded by adeB, led to loss of pump
    function and multidrug resistance (347). However, this was not the case with inactivation
    of the gene encoding the OMP, adeC, suggesting that AdeAB may be able to recruit
    other OMPs to form a functional tripartite complex (356). Other RND-type pumps
    have been described for different Acinetobacter genomic species (82, 90). Aminoglycosides
    As mentioned above, the presence of genes coding for aminoglycoside-modifying
    enzymes within class 1 integrons is highly prevalent in multidrug-resistant A.
    baumannii strains (246, 320, 395, 458, 503, 551, 556, 618). All of the major enzyme
    classes have been described, including acetyltransferases, nucleotidyltransferases,
    and phosphotransferases (250, 395). More recently, 16S rRNA methylation has been
    described for A. baumannii (armA) strains from Japan, Korea, and the United States
    (129, 314, 608). This emerging resistance mechanism impairs aminoglycoside binding
    to its target site and confers high-level resistance to all clinically useful
    aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin (130). Interestingly,
    the genetic surroundings of armA appear very similar across gram-negative organisms,
    as it is plasmid borne and within a transposon (Tn1548) (129). Apart from the
    AdeABC efflux pump, which less effectively transports amikacin and kanamycin due
    to their more hydrophilic nature (347), aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin)
    are also substrates of the recently described AbeM pump, a member of the multidrug
    and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family (525). Quinolones Modifications to
    DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV through mutations in the gyrA and parC genes have
    been well described for A. baumannii (220, 236, 504, 581, 582). These mutations
    interfere with target site binding. Similar to aminoglycosides, many quinolones
    are also substrates for multidrug efflux pumps (456), including the RND-type pump
    AdeABC (236, 347) and the MATE pump AdeM (525). Thus far, plasmid-mediated quinolone
    resistance, mediated by qnr genes, has not been reported for A. baumannii. Tetracyclines
    and Glycylcyclines Resistance to tetracyclines and their derivatives can be mediated
    by efflux or ribosomal protection (169). Tetracycline-specific efflux pumps include
    those encoded by the tet(A) to tet(E) determinants, most often found within gram-negative
    organisms, and the tet(K) determinant found in Staphylococcus aureus. Thus far,
    the tet(A) and tet(B) determinants have been described for A. baumannii (217,
    455, 457). tet(A) was found within a transposon similar to Tn1721, in association
    with an IS element (455). tet(A) confers resistance to tetracycline but not minocycline,
    an agent with greater activity against A. baumannii. Ribosomal protection is mediated
    by the tet(M) and tet(O) determinants, with tet(M) being described rarely for
    A. baumannii (457). Interestingly, this tet(M) determinant was identical to that
    described for S. aureus (457). Apart from tetracycline-specific efflux pumps,
    this class of antimicrobials is also susceptible to efflux by the multidrug efflux
    systems, such as the AdeABC pump (347). Importantly, tigecycline, which is the
    first of a new class of modified tetracycline antimicrobials known as glycylcyclines,
    is also a substrate for this emerging efflux system (420, 469). By performing
    real-time PCR with the adeB gene in clinical and laboratory exposed isolates with
    increased MICs of tigecycline, increased adeB gene expression was identified (420).
    It was of concern that the rise in MIC of tigecycline occurred rapidly with in
    vitro passage, suggesting that the expression of this multidrug efflux pump can
    be upregulated swiftly in response to selective pressure. The role of the AdeABC
    efflux pump in reduced susceptibility to tigecycline was confirmed by insertional
    inactivation of the adeB gene, which led to a significant drop in the MIC of tigecycline
    (4 μg/ml to 0.5 μg/ml) (469). These data suggest that caution should be used in
    considering tigecycline treatment for A. baumannii infection in sites where drug
    levels may be suboptimal, such as the bloodstream (424). Polymyxins Despite recent
    reports demonstrating increasing in vitro resistance and heteroresistance to the
    polymyxins in A. baumannii (177, 334), the mechanism of resistance remains unknown.
    It has previously been shown that reduced binding to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
    target site can lead to resistance in E. coli, Salmonella spp., and P. aeruginosa
    (100, 431). Also, changes in OMPs causing reduced susceptibility to polymyxins
    have been described for P. aeruginosa (400, 614). Other Antibiotics The prevalence
    of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance in A. baumannii is high in many geographic
    regions (216, 575). As discussed above, integrons are very common among strains
    of A. baumannii that have a multidrug resistance phenotype. The 3′-conserved region
    of an integron most commonly contains a qac gene fused to a sul gene, conferring
    resistance to antiseptics and sulfonamides, respectively (589). Consequently,
    sulfonamide resistance has been shown to be highly predictive of integron-carrying
    strains of A. baumannii (83, 216). Similarly, genes coding for trimethoprim (dhfr)
    and chloramphenicol (cat) resistance have also been reported within integron structures
    in A. baumannii (216, 246, 320, 551). Efflux may also contribute to resistance
    against these agents (525). ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING FOR THE CLINICAL
    MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY Breakpoints for Various Antibiotics and A. baumannii It
    is noteworthy that the major organizations that determine breakpoints (CLSI and
    the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [EUCAST]) have
    different breakpoints for many of the key antibiotics used in the therapy of A.
    baumannii infections (for example, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides)
    (Table 3). At the time of this writing, no EUCAST breakpoints exist for penicillins,
    cephalosporins, polymyxins, tetracyclines, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus
    A. baumannii. Breakpoints for tigecycline versus A. baumannii are not available
    via EUCAST, CLSI, or the FDA. Issues for Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of
    A. baumannii CLSI recommends that MICs for antibiotics versus Acinetobacter spp.
    be determined in broth, using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth, or on agar,
    using Mueller-Hinton agar (97). Disk diffusion should also be performed using
    Mueller-Hinton agar (97). Swenson and colleagues assessed these CLSI-recommended
    methods and identified several problems in testing β-lactam antibiotics (529).
    First, very small colonies or a star-like growth was frequently observed in wells
    containing high concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics. This apparent growth beyond
    a more obvious end point makes determining an MIC by broth microdilution methods
    quite difficult. Second, there were many discrepancies between results obtained
    by broth microdilution and those obtained by disk diffusion. Very major errors
    (susceptible according to disk diffusion but resistant according to broth microdilution)
    occurred with ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate,
    ceftazidime, and cefepime. In the absence of human or animal model data, it is
    impossible to determine which testing method is more clinically relevant. Finally,
    interlaboratory variations in susceptibility testing results were frequent, especially
    for cefepime (529). In contrast to the findings with these β-lactams, there was
    little MIC and zone diameter discrepancy for carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones,
    and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (529). The specific issue of in vitro testing
    of β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations has been assessed by Higgins et
    al. (235). CLSI guidelines for testing piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanic
    acid require fixed concentrations of 4 μg/ml (tazobactam) and 2 μg/ml (clavulanic
    acid) (97). In contrast, CLSI guidelines for testing ampicillin-sulbactam require
    a ratio of ampicillin to sulbactam of 2:1 (97). Higgins et al. showed that the
    in vitro results for β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations against A. baumannii
    are determined mainly by the activity of the inhibitors alone and therefore influenced
    by whether a fixed ratio of β-lactam to inhibitor or a fixed concentration of
    inhibitor is used (235). Therefore, it is doubtful that current testing of piperacillin-tazobactam
    or ticarcillin-clavulanic acid achieves clinically meaningful results, and we
    recommend that these drugs not be tested for susceptibility versus A. baumannii.
    The situation with disk diffusion testing is also problematic. Owing to the methodologic
    problems described above, we discourage the use of disk diffusion testing for
    all of the β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations versus A. baumannii. Semiautomated
    methods, such as those for the Vitek 2, Microscan, and BD Phoenix systems, are
    commonly used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by clinical microbiology
    laboratories. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the performance
    of these methods against A. baumannii. Studies from the 1990s with an early Vitek
    system showed that numerous isolates were reported as resistant to imipenem by
    Vitek but typically were susceptible to imipenem when tested by broth and agar
    dilution (552). In view of this report and a subsequent evaluation showing that
    carbapenem testing difficulties existed for Vitek 2 in examining the susceptibility
    of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa (523), some authors advocate confirmation
    of Vitek-determined carbapenem resistance (195). An “all-in-one plate” for this
    purpose has been described, in which susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem
    is confirmed by disk diffusion and the MIC of colistin is determined on the same
    plate by Etest (195). In general, however, the Vitek 2 system does appear to be
    reliable, in comparison to reference broth microdilution methods, for assessing
    susceptibility of A. baumannii to imipenem and other commonly used antibiotics
    (279). In evaluations of small numbers of A. baumannii group strains, the BD Phoenix
    automated microbiology system did not give very major errors in susceptibility
    testing compared to reference methods (133, 149, 176, 362, 521). Susceptibility
    testing of the polymyxins and tigecycline against A. baumannii warrants specific
    mention because these antibiotics are often utilized for serious infections with
    multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. As mentioned above, the FDA, CLSI, and EUCAST
    have established no breakpoints for interpretation of antibiotic susceptibility
    testing of tigecycline versus A. baumannii. This has resulted in immense confusion
    as to appropriate methods for performing and interpreting antibiotic susceptibility
    testing for this drug-organism combination. In the product information for tigecycline
    (http://www.wyeth.com/content/showlabeling.asp?id=474 [accessed 2 August 2007]),
    it is recommended in general for tigecycline susceptibility testing that disk
    diffusion testing (with paper disks impregnated with 15 μg/ml tigecycline) or
    broth, agar, or broth microdilution methods be used. MICs must be determined with
    testing medium that is fresh (that is, <12 h old) (54, 243, 429). When tested
    in freshly prepared media (<12 h old), tigecycline was 2 to 3 dilutions more active
    than when it was tested in “aged” media. Media stored under anaerobic conditions
    or supplemented with the biocatalytic oxygen-reducing reagent Oxyrase resulted
    in MICs similar to those obtained with fresh medium (54, 429). Tigecycline is
    stable in MIC trays that are prepared with fresh broth and then frozen. Therefore,
    the laboratory can thaw the preprepared MIC plates on the day of use and retain
    accuracy in MIC measurements (54). Questions have arisen regarding the reliability
    of disk diffusion or Etest determination of tigecycline susceptibility testing
    versus A. baumannii (278, 538). In one study, Etest MICs were typically fourfold
    higher than those determined by broth microdilution (538). However, others have
    found good correlation between tigecycline MIC determinations by Etest versus
    reference broth microdilution methods, although the numbers of Acinetobacter isolates
    in these studies were small (44, 242). The utility of the Vitek 2, Microscan,
    or BD Phoenix system for susceptibility testing of A. baumannii versus tigecycline
    has not yet been reported. With regard to disk diffusion testing, Jones and colleagues
    extrapolated FDA breakpoints for tigecycline versus Enterobacteriaceae to 103
    Acinetobacter strains and found that approximately 20% of strains would appear
    “falsely intermediate” by disk diffusion testing in comparison to broth microdilution
    testing (278). Suggestions have been made to utilize an inhibition zone diameter
    of ≥16 mm (278) or ≥13 mm (538) as an indicator of A. baumannii susceptibility
    to tigecycline. We urge caution in applying tigecycline breakpoints defined for
    the Enterobacteriaceae to A. baumannii for several reasons. Breakpoints are established
    with knowledge of the wild-type susceptibility of the organism to the antibiotic,
    the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antibiotic, and clinical data
    with respect to serious infections with the organism treated with the antibiotic
    (554). Clearly, wild-type susceptibilities and clinical responses may be organism
    specific. This has led to the situation, for example, whereby the FDA breakpoint
    for susceptibility of enterococci to tigecycline is ≤0.25 μg/ml while that for
    Enterobacteriaceae is ≤2 μg/ml (http://www.wyeth.com/content/showlabeling.asp?id=474
    [accessed 2 August 2007]). There are no data available to make such distinctions
    for tigecycline and A. baumannii. EUCAST notes that “there is insufficient evidence
    that the species in question is a good target for therapy with the drug” (http://www.srga.org/eucastwt/MICTAB/MICtigecycline.htm
    [accessed 2 August 2007]). Furthermore, there is a difference in tigecycline breakpoints
    for Enterobacteriaceae between different breakpoint setting organizations (FDA
    versus EUCAST), and no breakpoints have been set by CLSI. Finally, the mean maximum
    blood concentration of tigecycline is 0.63 μg/ml after administration of a 100-mg
    intravenous loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 h, so it would seem prudent
    not to report bloodstream isolates of A. baumannii with tigecycline MICs of >0.5
    μg/ml as susceptible (424). Indeed, it is for this reason that we suggest that
    an MIC-based method of antibiotic susceptibility testing (rather than disk diffusion
    testing) be performed for tigecycline for bloodstream isolates of A. baumannii.
    The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) has established tentative
    tigecycline breakpoints for Acinetobacter spp., as follows: MICs of ≤1 μg/ml,
    susceptible; MIC of 2 μg/ml, intermediate; and MICs of >2 μg/ml, resistant (www.bsac.org.uk/_db/_documents/version_6.1.pdf
    [accessed 2 August 2007]). Pending further information, we recommend using these
    breakpoints for infection sites other than blood. Unlike EUCAST and BSAC, the
    CLSI has established breakpoints for colistin and polymyxin B versus A. baumannii
    (97). These are as follows: MICs of ≤2 μg/ml, susceptible; and MICs of ≥4 μg/ml,
    resistant. Testing of A. baumannii susceptibility to colistin or polymyxin B should
    be performed by a method enabling determination of the MIC, such as broth dilution
    (178, 276). Using agar dilution, MICs of colistin may be 1 dilution higher than
    those of polymyxin B for some organisms (238). We recommend that institutions
    test the susceptibility of the polymyxin that is used in clinical practice at
    their institution. It is important that although colistin methanesulfonate (CMS;
    also known as colistimethate) is used in intravenous formulations of “colistin,”
    the human formulation should not be used for susceptibility testing (332). This
    is for several reasons. First, CMS is an inactive prodrug of colistin (27). Second,
    in determining MICs in broth during overnight incubation at 35°C, hydrolysis of
    CMS to colistin occurs via a series of partly methanesulfonated intermediates;
    the killing characteristics of this mixture change over time during incubation,
    leading to potentially unpredictable results (332). Thus, dilution-based testing
    should always be done with colistin sulfate (obtained, for example, from chemical
    supply companies such as Sigma-Aldrich), not with the intravenous “colistin” formulation
    obtained from a hospital pharmacy. A number of studies have assessed the performance
    of Etest for determination of colistin susceptibility (13, 346, 536). Although
    agreement between MICs within one twofold dilution obtained by Etest and broth
    microdilution is rather low, categorical concordance is 87% to ≥95% (13, 346,
    536). In one evaluation, there was 100% categoric agreement between agar dilution
    and Vitek 2 testing for colistin susceptibility, but no colistin-resistant isolates
    were tested (534). Inherent properties of the polymyxins make disk diffusion testing
    difficult, and we do not recommend it as a means of assessing susceptibility of
    A. baumannii to colistin (346, 533). The polymyxins are large polypeptides and
    diffuse poorly in agar, resulting in small zones of inhibition. Subsequently,
    this results in poor categorical differentiation of susceptible and resistant
    isolates. Use of higher concentrations of the polymyxin in the disks does not
    appear to improve the accuracy of test results (533). Clinical Laboratory Detection
    of Carbapenemases As described above, a variety of β-lactamases produced by A.
    baumannii are capable of hydrolyzing carbapenems. These “carbapenemases” were
    recently reviewed in detail in this journal by Queenan and Bush (447). Acinetobacter
    isolates that express these enzymes but which have carbapenem MICs in the susceptible
    range have been described, but these appear to be uncommon (174). Phenotypic tests
    for evaluating the presence of serine carbapenemases (OXA type) in A. baumannii
    have not yet been described. The most frequently used methods for detecting MBLs
    have been disk approximation methods comprising imipenem and imipenem plus EDTA
    (174, 290, 318). Others have used 2-mercaptopropionic acid for this purpose (12).
    An Etest MBL strip has been developed and, in published reports, has been shown
    to be reliable for detecting IMP- and VIM-type MBLs in A. baumannii (319, 589).
    Apparently, false-positive results were seen for isolates producing OXA-23 but
    lacking genes encoding IMP and VIM (490). These investigators did not seek other
    MBLs, however. It is also noteworthy that since the lowest concentrations of imipenem
    with and without EDTA on the Etest MBL strip are 1 and 4 μg/ml, respectively,
    the strip cannot be used in the evaluation of an isolate with an imipenem MIC
    of <4 μg/ml (609). Role of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory in Providing Surveillance
    for Multidrug-Resistant A. baumannii Surveillance for patients colonized with
    multidrug- or pandrug-resistant A. baumannii may be considered for infection control
    purposes. There are few data at present on which to base recommendations. Culture
    of samples from the nostrils, pharynx, skin, and rectum of patients with recent
    clinical cultures of A. baumannii was thought to have poor sensitivity (<25% for
    any one site) when samples were plated onto MacConkey agar plates containing 8
    μg/ml ceftazidime and 2 μg/ml amphotericin (355). Further studies are required
    to define the most effective methods for screening A. baumannii carriage in hospitalized
    patients and to determine the impact of such screening on infection rates and
    containment of this problematic organism. DEFINITIONS OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT ACINETOBACTER
    BAUMANNII Unfortunately, problems exist in evaluating previously published literature
    on the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. Most surveillance studies
    indicate the percentages of isolates susceptible (or resistant) to a variety of
    antibiotics. However, few assess the percentage resistant to multiple antibiotics.
    Furthermore, when such assessments have occurred, a variety of definitions of
    multidrug resistance in A. baumannii have been utilized. This has clearly hindered
    comparison of the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in different
    regions of the world, and we encourage the development of guidelines to unify
    the approach to these definitions. For the purposes of this review, the following
    definitions are used. Multidrug resistance is resistance to more than two of the
    following five drug classes: antipseudomonal cephalosporins (ceftazidime or cefepime),
    antipseudomonal carbapenems (imipenem or meropenem), ampicillin-sulbactam, fluoroquinolones
    (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin), and aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin,
    or amikacin). It needs to be acknowledged that susceptibility testing of β-lactam-β-lactamase
    inhibitor combinations is highly problematic and that laboratories may not test
    piperacillin-tazobactam or ticarcillin-clavulanate versus A. baumannii. Despite
    “pan-” meaning “all,” pandrug resistance is often defined as resistance to all
    antimicrobials that undergo first-line susceptibility testing that have therapeutic
    potential against A. baumannii. This would include all β-lactams (including carbapenems
    and sulbactam [MICs of >4 μg/ml]), fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. However,
    with the increased use of the polymyxins and possibly tigecycline, this definition
    will likely have to encompass these other agents. GLOBAL EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ACINETOBACTER
    BAUMANNII Europe A. baumannii infections have been a substantial clinical issue
    in many parts of Europe (Fig. 2) (575). Since the early 1980s, hospital outbreaks
    of A. baumannii infections in Europe, mainly in England, France, Germany, Italy,
    Spain, and The Netherlands (28, 171, 584), have been investigated using molecular
    epidemiological typing methods. In the majority of cases, one or two epidemic
    strains were detected in a given epidemiological setting. Transmission of such
    strains has been observed between hospitals, most probably via transfer of colonized
    patients (112, 557, 569). Spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is not confined
    to hospitals within a city but also occurs on a national scale. Examples are the
    spread of the so-called Southeast clone and the Oxa-23 clones 1 and 2 in Southeast
    England (99, 557), the dissemination of a multidrug-resistant A. baumannii clone
    in Portugal (112), the interhospital spread of a VEB-1 ESBL-producing A. baumannii
    clone from a total of 55 medical centers in northern and southeastern France (382),
    and the spread of an amikacin-resistant A. baumannii clone observed in nine hospitals
    in various regions in Spain (583). International transfer of colonized patients
    has led to the introduction and subsequent epidemic spread of multidrug-resistant
    A. baumannii strains from Southern into Northern European countries, such as Belgium
    and Germany (42, 488). Intercontinental spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    has also been described between Europe and other countries as a consequence of
    airline travel (383, 421). These events highlight the importance of appropriate
    screening and possible isolation of patients transferred from countries with high
    rates of drug-resistant organisms. In addition to these interinstitutional outbreaks,
    three international A. baumannii clones (the so-called European clones I, II,
    and III) have been reported from hospitals in Northern Europe (including hospitals
    in Belgium, Denmark, the Czech Republic, France, Spain, The Netherlands, and the
    United Kingdom) as well as from hospitals in southern European countries, such
    as Italy, Spain, Greece, and Turkey (123, 394, 570), and in Eastern Europe (606).
    Initially detected by AFLP clustering at a similarity level of >80%, the epidemiological
    relationship of these clones was confirmed by ribotyping (394, 570), pulsed-field
    gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (570), and most recently, multilocus sequence typing
    (MLST) (18). In contrast to the aforementioned multisite outbreaks, no epidemiological
    link in time or space could be established between the outbreaks of the European
    clones in different medical centers, and the actual contributions of these three
    widespread clones to the overall burden of epidemic A. baumannii strains remain
    to be determined. Carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii is now an issue in many
    European countries. Information on the prevalence of carbapenem resistance in
    various European countries is difficult to obtain, but it appears from the outbreak
    literature that carbapenem resistance rates are highest in Turkey, Greece, Italy,
    Spain, and England and are still rather low in Germany and The Netherlands. Carbapenem
    resistance in Eastern Europe appears to be increasing (128, 606). Rates appear
    to be lowest in Scandinavia, although sporadic isolates have been reported from
    patients transferred from elsewhere, including victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami
    (284). In an industry-supported surveillance report (MYSTIC) from 48 European
    hospitals for the period 2002-2004, just 73.1% of isolates were susceptible to
    meropenem and 69.8% were susceptible to imipenem (560). Susceptibility to other
    antibiotics was also very low, with 32.4%, 34.0%, and 47.6% being susceptible
    to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, respectively (560). A. baumannii
    isolates resistant to the polymyxins have been detected in Europe, although at
    present these remain rare (26, 74, 140, 177, 182, 229, 568). For a detailed review
    of phenotypic resistance in Acinetobacter spp. throughout Europe, readers are
    referred to an excellent review by Van Looveren and Goossens (575). North America
    There is a long history of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infections occurring
    in the United States. In 1991 and 1992, outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii
    were observed in a hospital in New York City (200). This followed an outbreak
    of infections due to ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae during which use of
    imipenem increased substantially (365, 450). The organisms in this outbreak were
    multidrug resistant, retaining susceptibility only to polymyxins and ampicillin-sulbactam
    (200). Numerous other hospitals in New York City also had clonal outbreaks of
    multidrug- or pandrug-resistant A. baumannii (143, 200, 277, 308, 309, 348, 351,
    446), and similar outbreaks have frequently been reported from many other regions
    of the United States (277, 342, 359, 522, 549, 604). National surveillance studies
    have demonstrated significant trends in the emergence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter
    strains (187). For example, data from the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance
    system collected from 1986 to 2003, involving many hospitals throughout the United
    States, showed significant increases in Acinetobacter strains resistant to amikacin
    (5% to 20%; P < 0.001), ceftazidime (25% to 68%; P < 0.001), and imipenem (0%
    to 20%; P < 0.001) (187). In a more recent industry-supported surveillance study
    including isolates of Acinetobacter spp. collected between 2004 and 2005 from
    76 centers throughout the United States, only 60.2% were susceptible to imipenem
    (218). A further industry-supported surveillance study including isolates of Acinetobacter
    spp. from 15 centers throughout the United States reported improved carbapenem
    and aminoglycoside susceptibilities in 2005 compared with those in 2004 (454).
    However, rates of nonsusceptibility were still substantial, as follows: 10% to
    15% for carbapenems, 35% to 40% for ceftazidime/cefepime, 10% to 30% for aminoglycosides,
    and 35% to 40% for ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin (454). The MIC50 and MIC90 of tigecycline
    for A. baumannii isolates collected from the United States between 2004 and 2005
    were 0.5 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml, respectively, with an MIC range of 0.03 μg/ml to 8
    μg/ml (588). The MIC90 for multidrug-resistant strains collected in the same time
    period was 2 μg/ml (237), which is more consistent with that reported from individual
    centers. Global surveillance data for susceptibility to polymyxin B have reported
    an MIC50 of ≤1 μg/ml and an MIC90 of 2 μg/ml against 2,621 Acinetobacter sp. isolates
    from four major geographic regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and North
    America) (177). The rate of polymyxin B-nonsusceptible Acinetobacter spp. in North
    America was reported to be 1.7% (177). This compares with 1.9%, 2.7%, and 1.7%
    in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and Latin America, respectively (177). Overall,
    2.8% and 3.2% of carbapenem-resistant and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp.,
    respectively, were resistant to polymyxin B (177). It is clear that more attention
    is being paid to A. baumannii infections in the United States now than at any
    time in the past. This may reflect increased recognition of pandrug-resistant
    strains. There are some data to suggest that the proportion of intensive care
    unit (ICU)-acquired pneumonia cases being found to be due to A. baumannii is actually
    increasing. In a review from the CDC, 7% of ICU-acquired pneumonias were due to
    Acinetobacter in 2003, compared to 4% in 1986 (P < 0.001) (187). The proportion
    of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and skin/soft tissue infections due to Acinetobacter
    also significantly increased during this period (187). There is some evidence
    that nosocomial Acinetobacter infections have some seasonal variation in the United
    States, with an unexplained upswing in late summer months (360). An important
    contribution to the epidemiology of infections with A. baumannii in the United
    States is the return of military personnel who have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan
    (75, 115, 376, 489, 555). An increase in infections with A. baumannii was first
    observed in U.S. military personnel in March 2003, soon after combat operations
    commenced in Iraq. Most injured military personnel were first treated at field
    hospitals before being evacuated to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (Germany)
    or the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (United States) (489). Most of these infections
    were detected at or soon after admission to these institutions. In a careful outbreak
    investigation, it was determined that neither preinjury skin colonization nor
    introduction of the organism from soil at the time of traumatic injury was the
    source of infection (376, 489). Rather, multiple A. baumannii isolates were cultured
    from a range of inanimate surfaces in field hospitals and were genotypically linked
    to patient isolates (489). Typically, these isolates were multidrug resistant,
    being resistant to fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and piperacillin-tazobactam.
    Just 10% were nonsusceptible to carbapenems (489). However, in a paper by Hawley
    et al., the rate of non-imipenem-susceptible A. baumannii was 37% for injured
    deployed military personnel (224). Such rates are more consistent with those seen
    in Europe than in the United States. The MIC90 of tigecycline for these strains
    was 8 μg/ml (224). Hujer and colleagues found that carbapenem-resistant isolates
    from patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center typically produced OXA-23 or
    OXA-58 carbapenemase (250). Interestingly, in a study comparing the clonal relatedness
    of A. baumannii strains from injured military personnel from the United States
    with that of strains from the United Kingdom, the main outbreak strains were indistinguishable
    (555). This provides further support that A. baumannii acquisition is occurring
    in the field hospitals. A comparable situation with Canadian soldiers injured
    in Afghanistan and British soldiers injured in Iraq has recently been reported
    (274, 540, 555). Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in Canadian civilian
    hospitals appear to be less common than those in comparable institutions in the
    United States but have certainly still been reported (509). Latin America Rates
    of nonsusceptibility to meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam,
    ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin in Latin America appear to be among the highest
    in the world (560). For example, just 71% of isolates were susceptible to meropenem
    or imipenem in an assessment from a surveillance program in the period 2002-2004
    (560). In a surveillance study involving Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia
    from 1997 to 2001, resistance rates were highest in Argentina, but no countries
    were spared multidrug-resistant isolates (543). As described previously, a variety
    of carbapenemases have been identified in A. baumannii isolates in Latin America,
    including IMP-1 and IMP-6 in Brazil (179, 471, 544), OXA-23 in Brazil and Colombia
    (110, 585), and OXA-58 in Argentina (98). Interestingly, the SPM- and VIM-type
    MBLs, which are widespread in Brazil (SPM) and other parts of Latin America (VIM)
    in P. aeruginosa strains, have not yet been reported for A. baumannii strains
    in these regions, to our knowledge. Africa Data on the extent of antibiotic resistance
    in A. baumannii in Africa are largely limited to South Africa at the present time,
    although there are scattered reports from other countries (255, 391, 475). Brink
    and colleagues have shown that about 30% of A. baumannii bloodstream isolates
    in South Africa are carbapenem resistant, >40% are resistant to cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam,
    and >30% are resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (59). Such resistant
    strains are endemic in some units (for example, burns and ICUs) and have been
    spread from institution to institution (354). Asia and the Middle East Numerous
    outbreaks of pandrug-resistant A. baumannii have been documented in Asian and
    Middle Eastern hospitals (Fig. 2), and a variety of carbapenemases have been described
    to originate there (2, 3, 78, 186, 264, 265, 293, 298, 317, 320, 419, 610). Rates
    of nonsusceptibility in SENTRY isolates (2001-2004) exceeded 25% for imipenem
    and meropenem, 40% for cefepime and ceftazidime, 40% for ampicillin-sulbactam,
    35% for amikacin, and 45% for ciprofloxacin (177). Unfortunately, resistance to
    tigecycline (389) and polymyxin B (177, 293) already exists in this region. Australia
    and Pacific Islands Initial reports of A. baumannii from Australia came from the
    Northern Territory, where community-acquired infections are well described (8,
    9). Such infections have a vastly different epidemiology from that seen in hospital-acquired
    infections, with male gender, age of >45 years, Aboriginal ethnic background,
    cigarette smoking, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive airway
    disease being important risk factors (9). Also, these community-acquired strains
    are significantly more susceptible to antimicrobials (9). Throat carriage and
    microaspiration may be involved in the pathogenesis of these infections (8). The
    first described Australian outbreak of hospital-acquired A. baumannii was in Western
    Australia (460). These isolates were resistant to gentamicin, cephalosporins,
    and ticarcillin, with some isolates also being resistant to ciprofloxacin. Molecular
    epidemiological analysis identified that 11% of staff hand samples were positive
    for the same strain of A. baumannii as that causing patient infection (460). More
    recently, outbreaks of A. baumannii have affected other major cities along the
    eastern seaboard of Australia, including Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne (422,
    437, 566). Unfortunately, these outbreaks have involved carbapenem-resistant strains
    of A. baumannii, with OXA-23 contributing to this phenotype (566). As seen in
    other countries, strains within institutions are often clonally related (422).
    Also, interhospital spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains has likely
    occurred in certain cities (435). Outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii
    have also occurred in French Polynesia (384). Most recently, reduced susceptibility
    to tigecycline of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains has been described
    in Australia (254). CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII INFECTIONS
    In the vast majority of publications on the clinical manifestations of Acinetobacter
    infections, the methods used for species identification were not appropriate according
    to current standards (see above). However, with an acceptable level of uncertainty,
    we can assume that what has been published on nosocomial Acinetobacter infection
    in general, or on A. baumannii infection in particular, is indeed applicable to
    A. baumannii. Case reports or small series on clinical manifestations of infections
    caused by Acinetobacter infections outside the A. baumannii group should be interpreted
    with caution if (semi)-automated methods for species identification were employed.
    Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia In most institutions, the majority of A. baumannii
    isolates are from the respiratory tracts of hospitalized patients. In many circumstances,
    it is very difficult to distinguish upper airway colonization from true pneumonia.
    There is no doubt, however, that true ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due
    to A. baumannii occurs. In large surveillance studies from the United States,
    between 5 and 10% of cases of ICU-acquired pneumonia were due to A. baumannii
    (187). However, it is highly likely that in certain institutions, the proportion
    of ICU-acquired pneumonia due to A. baumannii is much higher. Typically, patients
    with A. baumannii infections have had prolonged ICU stays (184), although in outbreak
    situations, earlier acquisition of infection may occur. Community-Acquired Pneumonia
    Community-acquired pneumonia due to A. baumannii has been described for tropical
    regions of Australia and Asia (8, 9, 39, 205, 325). The disease most typically
    occurs during the rainy season among people with a history of alcohol abuse and
    may sometimes require admission to an ICU (8). It is characterized by a fulminant
    clinical course, secondary bloodstream infection, and mortality rate of 40 to
    60% (325). The source of infection may be throat carriage, which occurs in up
    to 10% of community residents with excessive alcohol consumption (8). Bloodstream
    Infection In a large study of nosocomial bloodstream infection in the United States
    (1995-2002), A. baumannii was the 10th most common etiologic agent, being responsible
    for 1.3% of all monomicrobial nosocomial bloodstream infections (0.6 bloodstream
    infection per 10,000 admissions) (597). A. baumannii was a more common cause of
    ICU-acquired bloodstream infection than of non-ICU-ward infection (1.6% versus
    0.9% of bloodstream infections, respectively, in those locations). Crude mortality
    overall from A. baumannii bloodstream infection was 34.0% to 43.4% in the ICU
    and 16.3% outside the ICU. A. baumannii bloodstream infection had the third highest
    crude mortality rate in the ICU, exceeded only by P. aeruginosa and Candida sp.
    infections. A. baumannii infections were the latest of all bloodstream infections
    to occur during hospitalization, occurring a mean of 26 days from the time of
    hospital admission (597). It is therefore not certain if the high crude mortality
    rate represents its occurrence in patients with ongoing underlying critical illness
    or whether the organism does have significant attributable mortality (see below).
    Sources of bloodstream infection were not described in the study mentioned above
    but are typically line related or attributed to underlying pneumonia, UTI, or
    wound infection (501). It is notable that 102 patients had bloodstream infections
    at sites treating U.S. military members injured in Iraq or Afghanistan from 1
    January 2002 and 31 August 2004 (75). The sites of origin of these infections
    were not described in this report. Traumatic Battlefield and Other Wounds A. baumannii
    may occasionally cause skin/soft tissue infections outside of the military population.
    The organism caused 2.1% of ICU-acquired skin/soft tissue infections in one assessment
    (187). It is a well-known pathogen in burn units and may be difficult to eradicate
    from such patients (549). However, its contribution to poor outcome in burn patients
    is debated (5, 600). A. baumannii is commonly isolated from wounds of combat casualties
    from Iraq or Afghanistan (270, 376, 428, 489, 595, 616). It was the most commonly
    isolated organism (32.5% of cases) in one assessment of combat victims with open
    tibial fractures (270). However, it appears to be of low pathogenicity at this
    site—after initial treatment, the organism was never isolated from follow-up cultures
    in any of the patients with open tibial fractures and did not appear to contribute
    directly to persistent nonunion or need for amputation (270). UTI A. baumannii
    is an occasional cause of UTI, being responsible for just 1.6% of ICU-acquired
    UTIs in one study (187). Typically, the organism is associated with catheter-associated
    infection or colonization. It is not usual for this organism to cause uncomplicated
    UTI in healthy outpatients. Meningitis Nosocomial, postneurosurgical A. baumannii
    meningitis is an increasingly important entity. The microbial epidemiology of
    nosocomial meningitis is evolving to include more gram-negative pathogens (58,
    142, 414, 507), so it is not surprising that multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    is among the pathogens implicated (364, 399, 404, 408). Typical patients have
    undergone neurosurgery and have an external ventricular drain (363). Mortality
    may be as high as 70%, although the cause of mortality is often difficult to discern
    (363). Other Manifestations A small number of case reports of Acinetobacter endocarditis
    exist (361, 407, 461, 520, 567). Most, but not all, cases have involved prosthetic
    valves. Acinetobacter spp. may cause endophthalmitis or keratitis, sometimes related
    to contact lens use or following eye surgery (105, 287, 329, 338). A single case
    report exists of a Shiga toxin-producing A. haemolyticus strain, which was associated
    with bloody diarrhea in a 3-month-old infant (213). Note that precise species
    identification remains an issue in these reports. CLINICAL IMPACT OF ACINETOBACTER
    BAUMANNII INFECTION Given the predilection of A. baumannii to colonize and infect
    critically ill patients, who often have a poor prognosis irrespective of secondary
    infective complications, it has been challenging to determine the true clinical
    impact of this pathogen, and much debate still exists in the literature (154,
    160, 528). Unfortunately, significant methodological heterogeneity exists between
    studies (Table 4); thus, it has been difficult to formulate conclusions. Most
    studies utilize a matched cohort or case control study design, but the definitions
    used for a case and the comparative control group are clearly diverse among studies.
    For example, the definitions of a case include patients with A. baumannii infection
    only (5, 183, 528), infection and colonization (1, 341, 345, 437), infection of
    one site (40, 183, 215, 306, 600), or infection of multiple sites (1, 5, 528).
    Patients with polymicrobial infections were also allowed in some studies (40,
    600). However, it is the extreme diversity in controls that really distinguishes
    one study from another, as controls included patients with no A. baumannii infection
    or colonization but infection with other organisms allowed (183), no A. baumannii
    infection only but colonization allowed (600), no infection with drug-resistant
    A. baumannii but infection with susceptible isolates allowed (1, 437), or no specific
    infection type, such as bacteremia, with any organism allowed (40). Also, the
    rigor of matching for severity of illness and comorbid conditions varies, and
    thus important confounding factors cloud some of the literature, and the quality
    of species identification in many studies is suboptimal, which may also affect
    outcomes. At this point, despite the influx of such studies over recent times,
    we still feel that the issue of attributable mortality remains unsettled. For
    example, in a recent study performed by the CDC, which involved thorough adjustment
    of important confounding variables and used clear definitions for comparison groups,
    there was no significant increase in mortality between those infected with multidrug-resistant
    A. baumannii and those with no infection (odds ratio [OR], 6.6; 95% confidence
    interval [95% CI], 0.4 to 108.3) (528). However, hospital and ICU lengths of stay
    were significantly longer in the former group. A comparison between all those
    with infection, regardless of susceptibility profile, and those without infection
    was not performed. These results are supported by several studies (5, 40, 183,
    341) yet contrast with many others (1, 181, 215, 306, 345), including those that
    primarily assessed the clinical impact of multidrug or carbapenem resistance on
    patient outcomes (306, 437). Interestingly, when outcomes from A. baumannii bacteremia
    were compared directly to those for patients who had bacteremia with other gram-negative
    organisms, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, a significant increase in mortality
    was noted for A. baumannii (266, 462). A further study showed a significant increase
    in mortality with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii colonization or infection compared
    to that with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization or infection,
    using a Kaplan-Meier analysis (198). However, none of these studies used a formal,
    standardized method to adjust for severity of illness or comorbidities, such as
    an APACHE, McCabe, or Charlson score (81, 322). Whether the disparity between
    studies can be explained purely by methodological differences is unknown. However,
    it is important that all A. baumannii outcome studies involve a single geographic
    region, and thus the potential for a pathogen-specific variable, such as virulence,
    to cause the diversity in results is possible. This concept is further supported
    by the significantly worse outcomes observed in patients infected with A. baumannii
    from the community than those for patients infected in the hospital setting, including
    a high incidence of bacteremia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated
    intravascular coagulation, and death (325). Community-acquired A. baumannii infection
    appears to be a unique clinical entity occurring predominantly in tropical climates
    (9, 325). More recently, the clinical impact of empirical therapy on patient outcomes
    with A. baumannii bacteremia has been analyzed. Several studies report that receipt
    of inactive empirical therapy is an independent predictor of increased mortality
    (306, 337, 463), whereas others have not been able to confirm these findings (5,
    87, 159, 215, 528). Such differences may relate to the small patient numbers included
    in these studies and the resulting lack of statistical power. Finally, despite
    A. baumannii being the most common species leading to clinical infection, very
    few data exist on the comparison of outcomes between A. baumannii and other Acinetobacter
    species. In a recent study from Korea, 28 patients with bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter
    species outside the A. baumannii group, predominantly A. lwoffii, A. haemolyticus,
    and A. calcoaceticus, were compared to 112 patients with A. baumannii bacteremia
    (88). After adjusting for severity of illness, proportion of patients with polymicrobial
    bacteremia, and adequacy of antibiotic therapy, no significant difference was
    observed in mortality. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly
    longer for those with A. baumannii infection. Unfortunately, species identification
    in this study was not based on reliable methods, and therefore it is difficult
    to make definite conclusions. It now appears that the image of A. baumannii as
    a low-virulence pathogen is under extreme scrutiny. The organism is clearly evolving,
    as determined by genomic comparative studies (172), and with the acquisition of
    drug resistance determinants, which impairs our ability to use active empirical
    therapy, acquisition of virulence determinants may also be occurring. HOST-PATHOGEN
    INTERACTIONS INVOLVING ACINETOBACTER Relative to other gram-negative organisms,
    such as P. aeruginosa, very little is known about the host-pathogen interactions
    involving A. baumannii. Recent whole-genome sequencing studies involving A. baumannii
    have demonstrated not only a vast array of antibiotic drug resistance determinants
    but also many pathogenicity islands (172, 514). Of relevance, a significant number
    of identified genes encoding resistance to antibiotics, heavy metals, and antiseptics
    likely originated in other highly pathogenic organisms, including Pseudomonas
    spp., Salmonella spp., and E. coli (172). This implies that genetic transfer of
    virulence determinants may also be possible. After performing random mutagenesis
    of an A. baumannii ATCC strain (17978), Smith et al. were able to identify several
    mutants in six different pathogenicity islands with attenuated virulence, as determined
    by the nonmammalian models Caenorhabditis elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum
    (514). The relevant mutated genes encoded transcription factors, multidrug efflux
    transport systems, and a urease. Unfortunately, the virulence of these mutants
    was not assessed in a mammalian model. When the genome of A. baumannii was compared
    to that of the nonpathogenic species A. baylyi, 28 gene clusters were unique to
    A. baumannii, with 16 having a potential role in virulence (514). One of the most
    interesting of these was a 133,740-bp island that contained not only transposons
    and integrases but also genes homologous to the Legionella/Coxiella type IV virulence/secretion
    systems (514). Other relevant genes included those involved in the cell envelope,
    pilus biogenesis, and iron uptake and metabolism. An earlier study, which first
    described the applicability of transposon mutagenesis to A. baumannii, identified
    several mutants with altered metabolic and global regulatory functions, including
    a gacS-like gene encoding a sensor kinase that is important for the regulation
    of virulence determinants in other gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas
    (291, 577), as well as attachment or biofilm mutants (136). Such broad-based genetic
    approaches are critical for the future identification of novel virulence factors
    in A. baumannii. The study of more specific virulence mechanisms in A. baumannii
    has focused on siderophore-mediated iron acquisition systems (135, 137, 144, 607),
    biofilm formation (545, 578), adherence and OMP function (315, 510), and the A.
    baumannii LPS (152, 222, 292). In order for A. baumannii to thrive in the iron-deficient
    environment of a human host, it secretes low-molecular-mass ferric binding compounds,
    or siderophores (135, 137). Interestingly, the expression of these elements can
    vary greatly between clinical strains of A. baumannii (135, 607), and these elements
    have structural and functional similarities to a siderophore produced by the fish
    pathogen Vibrio anguillarum (137), a potential origin of this critical virulence
    mechanism. The ability of A. baumannii to adhere to and form biofilms on inanimate
    objects and surfaces may explain its success in the hospital environment. Tomaras
    et al. demonstrated that biofilm formation in A. baumannii is phenotypically associated
    with exopolysaccharide production and pilus formation (545). Through random mutagenesis
    and genetic complementation, a gene encoding a protein highly similar to that
    encoded by the Vibrio parahaemolyticus csuE gene was identified as a key factor
    in pilus and biofilm formation (545). Further sequence analysis identified a csu
    polycistronic operon involving five genes, some of which are homologous to genes
    that encode proteins related to chaperones and involved in pilus assembly in other
    gram-negative bacteria (545). Adherence of A. baumannii to human bronchial epithelial
    cells and erythrocytes has also been demonstrated, with similar pilus-like structures
    appearing important for adherence (204, 315). Interestingly, considerable variation
    in quantitative adherence was observed between strains, including greater adherence
    of strains from European clone II than from clone I (315). However, no difference
    between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains was observed. After adherence to human
    cells, it appears that A. baumannii can induce apoptosis via an OMP (Omp38) (84).
    This protein appears to localize to the mitochondria, leading to both caspase-dependent
    and -independent pathways of apoptosis (84). However, it is not the only factor
    involved, as an Omp38 mutant caused incomplete attenuation of cell death (84).
    Finally, quorum sensing has been shown to regulate a wide array of virulence mechanisms
    in many gram-negative organisms, particularly P. aeruginosa. Up to four different
    quorum-sensing signal molecules have been identified in Acinetobacter, indicating
    that this may be a central mechanism for autoinduction of multiple virulence factors
    (203, 271). Apart from biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide production is also
    thought to protect bacteria from host defenses (271). Several recent studies have
    described the innate immune response to A. baumannii and the importance of Toll-like
    receptor (TLR) signaling (152, 292). In a mouse pneumonia model, TLR4 gene-deficient
    mice had increased bacterial counts, increased bacteremia, impaired cytokine/chemokine
    responses, and delayed onset of lung inflammation compared to wild-type mice (292).
    A. baumannii LPS was identified as the major immunostimulatory factor (292). This
    was further illustrated by the attenuated effects of A. baumannii on mice deficient
    in CD14, an important molecule that enables LPS binding to TLR4 (292). These findings
    were recently confirmed using human cells, but in contrast to the mouse model,
    TLR2 was also identified as an important signaling pathway (152). The latter study
    also demonstrated the potent endotoxic potential of A. baumannii LPS, which stimulated
    the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha equally
    to the stimulation by E. coli LPS at similar concentrations (152). These studies
    suggest that A. baumannii endotoxin may incite a strong inflammatory response
    during infection. Humoral immune responses have also been described for Acinetobacter
    infection, with antibodies being targeted toward iron-repressable OMPs and the
    O polysaccharide component of LPS (513). Of interest, a more recent study showed
    that mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies directed at A. baumannii OMPs expressed
    in an iron-depleted environment have bactericidal and opsonizing in vitro activity
    (201). These antibodies were also able to block siderophore-mediated iron uptake
    (201). INFECTION CONTROL PERSPECTIVE Why Is A. baumannii a Persistent Hospital
    Pathogen? There are three major factors possibly contributing to the persistence
    of A. baumannii in the hospital environment, i.e., resistance to major antimicrobial
    drugs, resistance to desiccation, and resistance to disinfectants. Resistance
    to antibiotics may provide certain A. baumannii strains with a selective advantage
    in an environment, such as the modern ICU, where microorganisms are confronted
    with extensive exposure to antimicrobials. Several researchers have observed that
    resistance rates in epidemic A. baumannii strains are significantly higher than
    those in sporadic A. baumannii strains (123, 227, 262, 297). Resistance to the
    fluoroquinolones in particular was associated with epidemic behavior (227, 262).
    Villers et al. identified previous therapy with a fluoroquinolone as an independent
    risk factor for infection with epidemic A. baumannii, and it appeared that the
    selection pressure caused by the indiscriminate use of fluoroquinolones was responsible
    for the persistence and epidemic spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii clones
    for at least 5 years (586). The recently observed increase in carbapenem-resistant
    A. baumannii strains was associated almost exclusively with hospital outbreaks
    (99, 351, 354). It has been suggested that any clinical A. baumannii isolate with
    resistance to multiple antibiotics indicates a potential nosocomial outbreak strain
    (297). To assess the desiccation tolerance of A. baumannii, Jawad et al. compared
    the survival times on glass coverslips of 22 strains isolated from eight well-defined
    hospital outbreaks with the survival times of 17 sporadic strains. The overall
    mean survival time was 27 days, with a range of 21 to 33 days (262). Of note,
    there were no differences in survival times between outbreak and sporadic strains;
    all investigated A. baumannii strains had the ability of long-time survival on
    dry surfaces and therefore an increased potential for epidemic spread. It has
    also been shown that A. baumannii strains survive desiccation far better than
    do other Acinetobacter species, such as A. johnsonii, A. junii, and A. lwoffii
    (261, 377). This, together with their greater susceptibility to commonly used
    antimicrobials, may explain why Acinetobacter strains belonging to these species
    have been implicated only very rarely in hospital outbreaks. The majority of A.
    baumannii strains had survival times that were considerably longer than those
    found for Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae but similar to those observed
    for Staphylococcus aureus. These observations, as well as the previously suggested
    airborne spread of Acinetobacter spp. in hospital wards (6, 34), may explain the
    occurrence of repeated outbreaks after incomplete disinfection of contaminated
    dry surfaces. Prolonged survival of A. baumannii in a clinical setting, i.e.,
    on patients'' bed rails, has been found to be associated with an ongoing outbreak
    in an ICU and illustrates that dry vectors can be secondary reservoirs where A.
    baumannii can survive (73). Concern has been growing regarding the potential of
    antibiotic and disinfectant coresistance in clinically important bacteria. Reduced
    susceptibility of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) versus methicillin-susceptible
    S. aureus to chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium compounds was reported (527),
    and MRSA strains with low-level resistance to triclosan have emerged (57). Similar
    observations were made in gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa
    (539). It has been speculated that resistance to disinfectants may contribute
    to the epidemicity of the organism in a clinical setting, but to our knowledge,
    the association of resistance to biocides and the propensity for epidemic spread
    has never been studied systematically. Wisplinghoff et al. recently compared the
    in vitro activities of various disinfectants, such as propanol, mecetronium ethylsulfate,
    polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine, triclosan, and chlorhexidine, against sporadic and
    epidemic A. baumannii strains by using a broth macrodilution method (601). They
    concluded that resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably not a major
    factor favoring the epidemic spread of A. baumannii, since all disinfectants inhibited
    growth of all A. baumannii isolates when concentrations and contact times recommended
    by the respective manufacturer were used. However, with most of the disinfectants
    tested, a substantial number of viable bacteria remained if contact times were
    <30 s or if diluted agents were used, as may occur in day-to-day clinical practice.
    No significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic
    strains were observed under these conditions. Minor deviations from the recommended
    procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role
    in nosocomial cross-transmission, but larger studies using additional methods
    would be required to confirm these findings. Molecular Epidemiologic Techniques
    To control the spread of A. baumannii in the hospital, it is necessary to identify
    potential reservoirs of the organism and the modes of transmission. To distinguish
    the outbreak strain from epidemiologically unrelated acinetobacters, comparison
    of isolates at the subspecies level is required, and the methods used for this
    purpose are designated epidemiological typing methods. Phenotypic typing systems
    based on biochemical profiles (biotyping), antibiotic susceptibility patterns,
    serological reactions (serotyping), phage typing, and protein profiles (for a
    comprehensive review of these techniques, the reader is referred to the work of
    Bergogne-Berezin and Towner [28]) have largely been replaced by a multitude of
    molecular typing systems, including, in historical order, plasmid profiling (221,
    494); ribotyping (62, 123, 189, 498); PFGE (48, 206, 498); randomly amplified
    polymorphic DNA analysis (208, 214, 295); repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based
    (REP) PCR (252, 516); AFLP analysis, a high-resolution genomic fingerprinting
    method (123, 257, 295); integrase gene PCR (296); infrequent-restriction-site
    PCR (612); and most recently, MLST (18) and multilocus PCR-ESI-MS (145). Plasmid
    analysis. The majority of Acinetobacter species contain indigenous plasmids. Plasmid
    analysis has been used successfully for epidemiological typing of A. baumannii
    strains (221, 396, 494), and plasmid profiling is one of the few methods that
    have also been applied to study the epidemiology of Acinetobacter species outside
    the A. baumannii group (495, 499, 502). Even though the method is fairly robust,
    interpretation of results must include the consideration that many plasmids are
    easily transferable and may be gained or lost, and this contributed to the replacement
    of plasmid profiling by more robust molecular methods for epidemiological studies
    of acinetobacters. Ribotyping. Ribotyping was developed primarily to identify
    acinetobacters, in particular strains of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex,
    to the species level (189). This method—using EcoRI, ClaI, and SalI for restriction
    of purified chromosomal DNA, followed by electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization
    with a digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled cDNA probe derived from E. coli rRNA—has also
    been used to type strains in several studies investigating the epidemiology of
    acinetobacters (210, 211, 394). However, the discriminatory power of ribotyping
    is limited, and PFGE (see below) and other methods are less labor-intensive and
    more discriminatory (498, 508). More accurate typing results with a discriminatory
    power comparable to that of PFGE have been obtained using an automated ribotyping
    system (RiboPrinter; DuPont Qualicon, Wilmington, DE) (62, 453, 508). Automated
    ribotyping generates typing results more rapidly than PFGE does, but it is expensive
    and requires specialized equipment that is available in only a few laboratories
    that perform high-throughput molecular epidemiology investigations. PFGE. Even
    in the face of sequence-based methods that are now available and are challenging
    PFGE as the gold standard for typing of many bacterial species, for Acinetobacter
    PFGE still remains the reference method of choice. It is a rather laborious method
    that requires several days before generating a typing result, but the necessary
    equipment is now standard not only in most reference laboratories but also in
    hospital-based laboratories. Generally, ApaI and/or SmaI is used for restriction
    of intact chromosomal DNA (48, 206, 498). The resulting chromosomal fragments
    are separated by electrophoresis, and fingerprint profiles are compared visually
    or using specialized computer programs that also allow the storage of profiles
    in a database. As with other so-called comparative typing systems that are based
    mainly on a side-by-side comparison of molecular fingerprint patterns of a limited
    number of strains, interlaboratory comparison has always been a problem with PFGE,
    but a recent study has shown that with sufficient standardization of protocols
    interlaboratory reproducibility can be achieved (497). This approach would permit
    the recognition of epidemic strains and the early detection of multihospital or
    nationwide outbreaks, particularly if cases are geographically separated. As seen
    with other species, the discriminatory power of PFGE may be too high for large-scale
    epidemiologic and population studies, but the potentially greater value of newer
    methods, such as MLST or PCR-ESI-MS (see below), remains to be demonstrated for
    Acinetobacter. PCR-based typing methods. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR,
    involving amplification of random fragments of genomic DNA with single primers
    with an arbitrary sequence, has been used successfully to assess the strain relatedness
    of Acinetobacter isolates (208). An alternative approach, referred to as REP-PCR
    (48, 516), uses consensus primers for the highly conserved REP sequences to amplify
    intervening sequences located between these DNA motifs. Both methods do not require
    specialized equipment and are fast, easy, and low-cost methods that allow grouping
    of A. baumannii strains with various degrees of genotypic relatedness. The discriminatory
    power of these methods, however, is inferior to that of PFGE. Interlaboratory
    reproducibility of PCR-generated fingerprints was demonstrated in one study, using
    four different primers (DAF4, ERIC-2, M13, and REP1 plus REP2) and a highly standardized
    protocol (214), but these findings could not be confirmed in later studies (L.
    Dijkshoorn, L. Dolzani, and H. Seifert, unpublished data). Huys et al. (252) recently
    used REP-PCR fingerprinting with a (GTG)5 primer to distinguish members of the
    pan-European multidrug-resistant A. baumannii clone III (570) from the known clones
    I and II (123). In general, PCR-based typing methods allow for a quick estimate
    of epidemiological relatedness in a defined setting (599, 605), but they are not
    suited for large-scale comparative epidemiological studies. It remains to be shown
    if more rigorous standardization and automation of REP-PCR, such as by use of
    a DiversiLab system (bioMérieux), which includes a microfluidics-based detection
    system, will allow bacterial strain typing with an increased interlaboratory reproducibility
    (226). AFLP analysis. AFLP analysis was established in the 1990s. It is a highly
    sensitive DNA fingerprinting method by which DNA is digested with restriction
    enzymes, followed by selective amplification, electrophoretic separation of fragments,
    and visualization. It is a rather cumbersome and expensive method that is usually
    performed in a semiautomated procedure, with laser detection of fragments on a
    sequencing platform. The resulting complex profiles are digitized and usually
    analyzed with appropriate software. Apart from being a powerful tool in bacterial
    taxonomy (256, 392), this high-resolution fingerprinting method has also been
    found to be useful for the characterization of Acinetobacter strains at the subspecies
    level and for outbreak investigation (123, 128, 257, 258, 295, 570, 605). Even
    though AFLP analysis is a relatively robust method, it requires a high level of
    standardization and extensive experience in interpretation of banding patterns
    even if sophisticated computer programs are available to aid in pattern analysis.
    Therefore, this method is restricted to reference laboratories and not suited
    for routine epidemiological analyses. In addition, data are not readily transportable
    between laboratories, mainly due to a lack of reproducibility when different sequencing
    platforms are used. Although clustering obtained with AFLP analysis compared well
    to PFGE-derived clustering in small-scale studies (109, 508, 570), a detailed
    and comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these two typing methods has never
    been performed. MLST. MLST is a highly discriminative typing method that has been
    applied to a variety of bacterial pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis (349),
    Streptococcus pneumoniae (164), and S. aureus (150). The MLST scheme that was
    recently developed for A. baumannii by Bartual and coworkers is based on 305-
    to 513-bp sequences of the conserved regions of the following seven housekeeping
    genes: gltA, gyrB, gdhB, recA, cpn60, gpi, and rpoD (18). It can also be applied
    to Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU isolates (598). The currently available
    MLST data are in good concordance with typing results generated by PFGE and AFLP
    analysis (18). Thus far, the system has been used with only a limited number of
    A. baumannii strains, mainly from Spanish and German hospital outbreaks, and requires
    further evaluation. The discriminatory power of the currently proposed MLST system
    is comparable to that of both PFGE and AFLP analysis. However, MLST is expensive
    and laborious and therefore not suited for routine outbreak analysis or other
    limited-scale analysis of the epidemiology of A. baumannii. It remains to be determined
    if this typing scheme is appropriate for the study of the population structure
    of A. baumannii and perhaps other Acinetobacter species, as shown successfully
    when this method was applied to other microorganisms. To date, MLST is one of
    the few so-called library typing systems used for the epidemiological study of
    A. baumannii, i.e., a typing system where typing data are translated into a numerical
    code that can be obtained in an identical manner at different laboratories by
    using the same protocol. It provides a portable method that may be suitable for
    global epidemiologic study and allow the recognition of epidemic, multiresistant,
    and virulent A. baumannii clones and the monitoring of their national and international
    spread. PCR-ESI-MS. PCR-ESI-MS is a form of high-throughput MLST that can be used
    for species identification of A. baumannii as well as Acinetobacter genomic species
    3 and 13TU and, in addition, to determine clonality (145). The conserved regions
    of six bacterial housekeeping genes (trpE, adk, efp, mutY, fumC, and ppa) are
    amplified from each isolate, amplification products are then desalted and purified,
    and the mass spectra are determined. The system was established using 267 Acinetobacter
    isolates collected from infected and colonized soldiers and civilians involved
    in an outbreak in the military health care system associated with the war in Iraq,
    previously characterized outbreaks in European hospitals, and culture collections.
    A good correlation with PFGE typing was observed. As a major advantage, the PCR-ESI-MS
    genotyping method appears to be very fast (taking only 4 h), providing typing
    results on a time scale not achievable with most other systems. Further evaluation
    of this method is clearly warranted. Hospital Outbreaks and Control Measures The
    propensity for outbreaks of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii has been demonstrated
    clearly. Only one or two strain types were found in the majority of more than
    20 outbreaks assessed, using PFGE or PCR-based typing methods to assess clonality
    (584). In New York City, two strain types accounted for >80% of carbapenem-resistant
    isolates. Among six pandrug-resistant isolates, three separate ribotypes were
    identified (446). This clearly demonstrates the importance of infection control
    interventions in response to outbreaks of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infections.
    The following infection control interventions are appropriate with regard to A.
    baumannii outbreaks. (i) Molecular epidemiologic investigations should be conducted
    to determine if a clonal outbreak strain is present (as described above). (ii)
    Environmental cultures should be used to determine if a common environmental source
    is present. If such a source is found, it should be removed from the patient care
    setting. Numerous potential sources have been identified in prior studies, including
    ventilator tubing, suction catheters, humidifiers, containers of distilled water,
    urine collection jugs, multidose vials of medication, intravenous nutrition, moist
    bedding articles, inadequately sterilized reusable arterial pressure transducers,
    and computer keyboards (171, 390, 563, 584). A high-profile outbreak arose from
    pulsatile lavage wound treatment, a high-pressure irrigation treatment used to
    debride wounds (353). (iii) Enhanced environmental cleaning should be performed
    in order to eliminate the organism from the peripatient environment. (iv) Enhanced
    isolation procedures, aimed at optimizing contact isolation (usage of gloves and
    gowns when dealing with colonized patients or their environment) and improving
    hand hygiene, should be implemented. In some circumstances, cohorts of patients
    or staff are used, but optimally patients should be nursed in single rooms with
    a dedicated nurse. This will be impractical in many settings. (v) Antibiotic management
    processes should be used to ensure that “at-risk” antibiotics are not being used
    excessively. Optimally, a case-case control study should be performed to determine
    which antibiotics truly do increase the risk of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    strains (288). Numerous studies have assessed antibiotic risk factors for infection
    with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, although only a few have examined risk
    factors for emergence of pandrug resistance. Although exposure to any antibiotic
    active against gram-negative bacteria has been associated with the emergence of
    multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (359), three classes of antibiotics have been
    implicated most frequently, including broad-spectrum cephalosporins (71, 251,
    309, 483), carbapenems (103, 120, 321), and fluoroquinolones (586). A number of
    investigators have demonstrated that interventions such as those described above
    can be effective in the control of A. baumannii infections (78, 109, 121, 390,
    435, 594). In some cases, despite these efforts, ongoing cases of multidrug-resistant
    A. baumannii infection continue to occur. Monitoring adherence to such infection
    control interventions is also important. Although health care worker hand carriage
    with Acinetobacter is typically transient, it may be more prolonged in individuals
    with damaged skin (22, 247). In some scenarios, closure of wards to new admissions
    needs to be undertaken (435). Some authors have suggested that eradication of
    colonization be performed by techniques such as selective digestive tract decolonization
    or use of topical or aerosolized polymyxins (200, 563). However, we are hesitant
    to recommend these interventions due to the possible risks of polymyxin-resistant
    organisms. Rather, we would prefer greater assessment for colonized patients,
    greater attention to environmental decontamination, and improved hand hygiene
    as a means for prevention of patient-to-patient transfer. Further studies are
    still required to define the efficacy of these infection control interventions
    in the prevention of A. baumannii dissemination. THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES FOR ACINETOBACTER
    BAUMANNII INFECTION The wide array of intrinsic and acquired resistance determinants
    that have emerged in A. baumannii have justifiably brought it great scientific
    attention. As determined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, A. baumannii
    is one of the “red alert” pathogens that greatly threaten the utility of our current
    antibacterial armamentarium (531). Prior to the 1970s, it was possible to treat
    Acinetobacter infections with a range of antibiotics, including aminoglycosides,
    β-lactams, and tetracyclines (28). However, resistance to all known antibiotics
    has now emerged in A. baumannii (153, 309), thus leaving the majority of today''s
    clinicians in unfamiliar territory. Compounding the problem is the large number
    of pharmaceutical companies that have abandoned antibiotic drug discovery and
    development, driven primarily by the risks of poor financial returns relative
    to those for more lucrative classes of drugs (519, 593). The dearth of antibiotics,
    especially for gram-negative organisms, has recently stimulated attention from
    major research and governing bodies (388, 531). Unfortunately, at this stage,
    very little is in the therapeutic pipeline (459), and the new agents with activity
    against gram-negative organisms are all modifications of existing classes. Novel
    antibiotic targets and mechanisms of action are urgently required. Given the current
    therapeutic environment, optimizing the use of existing antimicrobials is critical.
    To achieve this goal, a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
    parameters that predict maximal drug efficacy yet minimize the evolution of drug
    resistance, as well as an evidence-based approach to therapeutic strategies for
    highly drug-resistant strains, is required. The following section concentrates
    on the available in vitro, animal, and human data to assist the reader in the
    management of infections due to highly drug-resistant A. baumannii. Existing Antimicrobial
    Agents Given the range and diversity of resistance determinants in A. baumannii,
    therapy should be based on the results of adequately performed antimicrobial susceptibility
    testing. The details and important pitfalls of such testing are described above.
    Antibiotic selection for empirical therapy is challenging and must rely on recent
    institutional-level susceptibility data. Time to effective therapy clearly impacts
    patient outcomes (253, 299), and this may include patients with A. baumannii infection
    (159, 306). Thus far, carbapenems have been thought of as the agents of choice
    for serious A. baumannii infections. However, although these drugs are still active
    against the vast majority of A. baumannii strains worldwide, the clinical utility
    of this class of antimicrobial is increasingly being jeopardized by the emergence
    of both enzymatic and membrane-based mechanisms of resistance, as described above,
    often working in concert (47, 446). This concerning phenotype, challenging one
    of our most potent last lines of defense, is unfortunately being described with
    increased frequency worldwide. What other pharmacological strategies are available?
    Sulbactam. Sulbactam is one of three commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors.
    Unlike clavulanic acid and tazobactam, it has clinically relevant intrinsic antimicrobial
    activity against certain organisms, specifically Acinetobacter (55, 102, 235,
    326, 328, 405, 464) and Bacteroides spp. (596), mediated by its binding to penicillin-binding
    protein 2 (403). Sulbactam is commercially available in a combined formulation
    with either ampicillin or cefoperazone and also as a single agent in France, Germany,
    and Spain (55, 326). Studies assessing the activity of sulbactam alone compared
    to its combination with a β-lactam clearly demonstrate the intrinsic activity
    of the agent rather than its ability to inhibit β-lactamase (55, 102, 235). In
    vitro susceptibilities of A. baumannii strains to sulbactam vary widely, depending
    on the geographic region (326). Thus, we strongly recommend susceptibility testing
    using a broth-based method, rather than disk susceptibility testing (see above),
    prior to its use as monotherapy. Despite the absence of randomized clinical trials,
    sulbactam has shown promising results against A. baumannii strains with various
    susceptibility profiles. Using time-kill studies, authors have demonstrated bactericidal
    activity against susceptible rather than intermediately resistant strains of A.
    baumannii (405, 464), whereas others have shown bacteriostatic activity (102).
    In a murine pneumonia model, using an imipenem- and sulbactam-susceptible A. baumannii
    isolate, similar efficacies were observed between these agents when the dosing
    of sulbactam reached a time above the MIC similar to that of imipenem (1.84 versus
    2.01 h, respectively), indicating the time-dependent activity of this antimicrobial
    (464). Such efficacy data are consistent with data from previous animal models
    (167, 294, 372, 405, 602) and, most importantly, are in keeping with results from
    clinical human studies (85, 93, 102, 263, 515, 561, 603). Urban et al. performed
    a small study assessing the clinical efficacy of sulbactam during an outbreak
    of A. baumannii resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and other β-lactams
    (561). Of the 10 patients who received ampicillin-sulbactam for >3 days, 9 clinically
    responded, with many achieving microbiological eradication (561). These results
    were supported by a further noncomparative study from Spain, which showed that
    29/41 (95%) patients with non-life-threatening A. baumannii infections were cured
    or clinically improved with ampicillin-sulbactam or sulbactam alone (102). All
    isolates were multidrug resistant but were susceptible to imipenem, sulbactam,
    and polymyxins. As pointed out in that study, the use of a sulbactam-containing
    regimen for milder infections may be an appropriate strategy in limiting excessive
    carbapenem use. More supportive data are now available on the efficacy of sulbactam
    in treating serious A. baumannii infections. Wood et al. performed a retrospective
    comparative trial involving patients with A. baumannii VAP and found that treatment
    successes were similar between those who received ampicillin-sulbactam (n = 14)
    and those who received imipenem-cilastatin (n = 63) (93% versus 83%, respectively;
    P > 0.05) (603). Microbiological eradication appeared to be superior in the ampicillin-sulbactam
    group; however, this was not statistically significant. Ampicillin-sulbactam was
    primarily prescribed for patients infected with sulbactam-susceptible, non-imipenem-susceptible
    organisms. Interestingly, significantly more patients in the ampicillin-sulbactam
    group received combination therapy (50% versus 14%; P = 0.01), most commonly with
    an aminoglycoside. No outcome differences were observed between these subgroups,
    but the small sample size limits this analysis. An equivalent efficacy of sulbactam
    to that of imipenem has also been shown for treatment of A. baumannii bloodstream
    infection (85, 93, 263), with one study demonstrating a reduction in pharmaceutical
    costs (263). In a further study, treatment of highly drug-resistant A. baumannii
    bacteremia (susceptible only to sulbactam and polymyxin E) with ampicillin-sulbactam
    was comparable to treatment of more susceptible strains with other therapies,
    including imipenem, aminoglycosides, and quinolones (515). These data indicate
    that when A. baumannii is susceptible to sulbactam, this agent is probably as
    efficacious as any other. Small observational series have shown encouraging results
    with ampicillin-sulbactam for the treatment of nosocomial A. baumannii meningitis
    (268, 328), a problematic entity of increasing significance. However, failures
    have been reported (268, 328). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of sulbactam
    in patients with inflamed meninges is reported to be 2 to 32% of serum levels
    (170), with peak serum levels reaching approximately 42 to 60 mg/liter after an
    intravenous (i.v.) dose of 1 g (170, 366). Thus, assuming that the susceptibility
    breakpoint for sulbactam is ≤4 μg/ml, inadequate dosing may explain the variable
    clinical response. For serious A. baumannii infections, we recommend dosing of
    at least 6 g/day of sulbactam in divided doses, assuming normal renal function.
    Recently, dosing of up to 12 g/day was reported for the treatment of hospital-acquired
    pneumonia caused by sulbactam-resistant A. baumannii, without major adverse effects;
    however, outcomes were similar in those who received 9 g/day (38). The clinical
    benefits of combination therapy with sulbactam compared with sulbactam monotherapy
    are not yet clear. Much of the data comes from in vitro studies using checkerboard
    or time-kill analyses and shows enhanced activity when sulbactam is combined with
    cefepime (472, 548), imipenem (86, 518), meropenem (289, 294), amikacin (481),
    rifampin (11), and ticarcillin-clavulanate (272). In a mouse pneumonia model,
    the combination of ticarcillin-clavulanate, sulbactam, and rifampin appeared most
    efficacious toward a carbapenem- and sulbactam-resistant A. baumannii strain (rifampin
    MIC of 4 mg/liter); however, such effects were lost when a strain that was less
    susceptible to rifampin (MIC, 8 mg/liter) was tested (602). Interestingly, combination
    therapy can prevent the emergence of rifampin resistance (412, 602). Another mouse
    model, using an A. baumannii strain with reduced susceptibility to meropenem and
    sulbactam (MICs, 8 mg/liter and 8 mg/liter, respectively), showed a statistically
    significant improvement in mouse survival with the combination compared to that
    with each agent alone (294). Human data are very limited and lack statistical
    power (303, 603). For example, a retrospective study involving 55 patients with
    A. baumannii bloodstream infection showed superior outcomes in those given a carbapenem
    and ampicillin-sulbactam compared to those given a carbapenem alone (30.8% versus
    58.3%, respectively), but no patient matching was performed (303). Such data are
    intriguing and require further clinical evaluation in humans. Despite the shortcomings
    of these studies, the results suggest that sulbactam should be considered as a
    therapeutic option for mild to severe A. baumannii infections caused by sulbactam-susceptible
    organisms. Unfortunately, sulbactam resistance is common in certain geographic
    areas, and this phenotype will no doubt increase over time. Polymyxins. The emergence
    of A. baumannii strains resistant to all routinely tested antimicrobials has led
    to the necessary revival of the polypeptide antibiotics known as the polymyxins
    (colistin or polymyxin E and polymyxin B). These positively charged antimicrobial
    peptides were discovered in 1947 (524), originating from Bacillus polymyxa (300).
    They target the anionic LPS molecules in the outer cell membranes of gram-negative
    bacteria, leading to interactions between the inner and outer cell membranes,
    with associated lipid exchange, membrane disturbance, osmotic instability, and
    eventual cell death (95, 156). There are two commercially available forms of colistin,
    namely, colistin sulfate for oral and topical use, and CMS, also known as sodium
    colistin methanesulfonate or colistin sulfomethate sodium, for parenteral use
    (332). Both forms are available for nebulization. Given that the polymyxins were
    discovered over 50 years ago, they were never subjected to the rigorous drug development
    process that we now expect of more contemporary antimicrobials. Thus, our understanding
    of the critical pharmacological parameters that govern dosing for maximal efficacy
    and minimal toxicity is poor. As a consequence, confusion exists among clinicians
    and in the literature regarding formulations, nomenclature, and dosing (157, 331,
    332). Such information is urgently required before we mistakenly jeopardize this
    valuable antimicrobial (10, 153, 334, 452). For a detailed review of the pharmacology
    of the polymyxins, readers are referred to the work of Li et al. (332). For the
    remainder of this section, colistin is used to mean all formulations of CMS. In
    vitro, colistin demonstrates concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against
    A. baumannii strains with various susceptibility profiles, as determined by time-kill
    analyses (372, 411, 465). However, significant regrowth has been observed at 24
    h for strains characterized as having heterogeneous resistance to colistin (411).
    Presumably, the subpopulations with higher MICs flourish under selection pressure.
    Whether this phenomenon is clinically relevant has yet to be determined. Conflicting
    results have been reported for the postantibiotic effect of colistin (411, 436),
    a parameter often used to assist in optimizing dosing. Thus far, animal models
    have shown mixed results for colistin efficacy (372, 415, 465) and serve to remind
    us of the potential limitations of extrapolating such data to clinical management.
    Interestingly, the efficacy of colistin at reducing the bacterial burden in the
    lungs was poor in a murine pneumonia model (direct upper airway inoculation) (372),
    in contrast to excellent activity in a rat thigh infection model that led to hematogenous
    dissemination of the lungs (415). This may be explained by varied colistin penetration
    into lung compartments or a modification of activity in the epithelial lining
    fluid. The cumulative human data on the efficacy and toxicity of colistin for
    treating A. baumannii infection in the modern era are represented in Table 5.
    Overall, the efficacy of the drug has been highly encouraging in both adult and
    pediatric populations, with favorable or curative responses ranging from 57% to
    >80% (158, 185, 207, 241, 283, 301, 327, 357, 369, 409, 451, 517). In several
    recent prospective cohort studies across a range of infection types, the outcomes
    for patients receiving definitive therapy with colistin for colistin-only-susceptible
    organisms were similar to those for patients receiving combinations of other antibiotics
    (predominantly carbapenems with or without other antibiotics) for more susceptible
    organisms (185, 451). Interestingly, despite the majority of patients in the colistin
    groups receiving inactive empirical therapy compared to the noncolistin groups,
    outcomes were similar (185, 451). Most recently, a further prospective cohort
    study reported a statistically significant improvement in outcome for patients
    receiving colistin compared with those receiving other antibiotics (301). However,
    all patients were infected with isolates susceptible only to colistin, and therefore
    many patients in the noncolistin group received definitive therapy with inactive
    antimicrobials (at least 40%) (301). Nebulized colistin is increasingly being
    used in an attempt to minimize systemic toxicity and improve drug deposition at
    the site of infection (158, 219, 305, 339, 367, 425). Much of the data on nebulized
    colistin originates from patients with cystic fibrosis who are colonized or infected
    with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29, 240). However, the literature is expanding outside
    this patient population (Table 6). Thus far, no prospective comparative study
    has been performed to assess the efficacy of nebulized colistin for A. baumannii
    infection. In a retrospective case series by Kwa et al., 18 of 21 (86%) patients
    who received nebulized colistin for hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by A. baumannii
    or P. aeruginosa (resistant to all antimicrobials except polymyxins) had favorable
    clinical and microbiological responses (305). None of these patients received
    parenteral colistin, but most were receiving other antimicrobials for concomitant
    infections. One (5%) patient developed bronchospasm, and no cases of nephro- or
    neurotoxicity were reported (305). Similar, encouraging results were reported
    by Michalopoulos et al., who compared the outcomes for 8 patients who received
    supplemental nebulized colistin combined with parenteral antibiotics with those
    for 45 patients who received parenteral colistin only (367). Rates of clinical
    cure appeared superior with supplemental nebulized colistin, but the patient numbers
    were small and limit statistical comparisons (Table 6). The largest series thus
    far, by Berlana et al., included 71 patients who received nebulized colistin for
    presumed pneumonia caused by more susceptible A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa strains
    (30). Conclusions from this study are difficult to ascertain, as the majority
    of patients received concomitant i.v. antibiotics, predominantly carbapenems,
    to which the pathogens were likely susceptible; only 69% of the treated patients
    met the criteria for pneumonia; and adverse events were not reported (30). Reassuringly,
    of the 33 patients who received nebulized colistin for A. baumannii and had follow-up
    cultures, all had microbiological eradication (30). Overall, more recent data
    suggest that nebulized colistin is well tolerated (Table 6), but a recent U.S.
    FDA health alert was issued for nebulized colistin after the death of a patient
    with cystic fibrosis (www.fda.gov ). This patient used a premixed CMS vial for
    inhalation through a nebulizer and developed respiratory distress soon after.
    Once CMS is mixed into aqueous solution, it is converted into colistin by hydrolysis.
    The bioactive colistin, specifically colistin A (polymyxin E1), can be toxic to
    lung tisssue. Thus, those prescribing nebulized colistin must be aware of this
    health alert and should advise patients to use the CMS immediately after preparation.
    CMS is not FDA approved for inhalation. Predose bronchodilators may be beneficial
    in preventing bronchospasm with nebulized colistin (425). CMS dosing for inhalation
    varies from 1 to 3 million IU/day in divided doses (diluted in sterile normal
    saline), using a conventional nebulizer (30, 305, 367, 425), but doses of up to
    6 million IU/day have been used (367). Currently, the evidence for nebulized colistin
    in patients without cystic fibrosis is still limited, and further data are required
    to determine its efficacy. In severe or refractory cases of pneumonia, and taking
    into account the recent U.S. FDA health alert, nebulized colistin in combination
    with an active systemic agent may be warranted. Apart from monitoring for acute
    respiratory toxicities, future studies should also assess for superinfection,
    whereby a shift in organism ecology toward those inherently resistant to colistin
    (Serratia, Proteus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, and Flavobacteria)
    occurs (163). As described, nosocomial meningitis is an increasingly important
    entity, with multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens being implicated as an
    etiology with greater frequency. To optimize therapy of these challenging infections,
    intrathecal or intraventricular colistin has been utilized (Table 7). This route
    of administration is not novel for the polymyxins and was implemented soon after
    its availability (96, 225, 546). Despite the majority of patients with A. baumannii
    meningitis receiving colistin both systemically and directly into the CSF, the
    latter alone may be adequate (25, 398, 576). Such a strategy avoids the unnecessary
    risks of nephrotoxicity. Thus far, intrathecal/ventricular colistin has been well
    tolerated, with rare reports of chemical meningitis that spontaneously resolved
    with either drug cessation or dose reduction (155, 398). In the absence of an
    external CSF drain, which is often the source of infection, repeated lumbar punctures
    are required, with the associated risk of introducing other pathogens. Several
    cases of A. baumannii meningitis have been cured with i.v. colistin only (267,
    269, 327, 416), with reported levels in CSF of 1.25 mg/liter (CSF/serum ratio
    of 25%) (267, 269); however, failures have also been reported that eventually
    responded only to intrathecal/ventricular administration (7, 67, 286, 398, 526).
    Dosing varies greatly between studies, but according to the Infectious Diseases
    Society of America, 5 mg of polymyxin B or 10 mg of colistin daily is recommended
    for adults (553). Given the available literature and the severity of this infection,
    we recommend the use of colistin directly into the CSF early for patients with
    carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii meningitis. Many in vitro and animal studies
    support the role of combination therapy with colistin (Table 8). In particular,
    colistin in combination with a carbapenem and/or rifampin appears most promising
    (194, 239, 351, 373, 415, 518, 537, 541, 613). Understandably, in the presence
    of significant carbapenemase activity, as opposed to membrane-based changes (porins
    and efflux pumps) that are likely disrupted by the polymyxins, synergy with carbapenems
    may be lost (592). Unfortunately, very few human data are available to support
    these in vitro studies. Much of the clinical data on colistin efficacy comes from
    uncontrolled, retrospective case series (Table 5), which often include heterogeneous
    populations. In addition to colistin, the majority of patients received a potpourri
    of other antimicrobials, most commonly carbapenems but also quinolones, aminoglycosides,
    sulbactam, rifampin, and others (30, 158, 301, 305, 357, 367, 369, 409, 517).
    In the absence of a well-matched control group (i.e., a group receiving colistin
    alone), it is difficult to make conclusions about the potential benefits of combination
    therapy (374, 432, 517). More recently, Falagas et al. performed a retrospective
    cohort study, comparing patients who received colistin only with those who received
    colistin and meropenem (161). After adjusting for severity of illness, no difference
    in outcomes was observed. Whether combination therapy will protect colistin from
    the emergence of resistance is presently unknown, but an in vitro pharmacodynamic
    model suggests that this may be possible (302). Further human studies are warranted.
    The most surprising feature of the colistin renaissance has been the low rates
    of nephrotoxicity, whose frequency is highly dependent on study definitions. Overall,
    however, the rates are significantly less than previously reported (168) and appear
    to be reversible with cessation of the drug (158, 301, 327). Prolonged administration
    of colistin (>4 weeks) without adverse effects has been reported (162). Patients
    with a history of renal impairment (301, 327, 369), those given concomitant nephrotoxins
    (301, 409, 517), and the elderly (409) are at greatest risk. Dosing should be
    adjusted in those with preexisting renal dysfunction (colymycin M parenteral package
    insert; Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Bristol, TN) and those receiving renal replacement
    therapy (333). As observed with acute renal failure in other clinical settings
    (19), this adverse outcome may be a predictor of increased mortality in patients
    receiving colistin (369, 409). Of concern, rates of resistance to the polymyxins
    have recently been reported to be as high as 3.2% for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    strains (177), with higher rates reported in Korea (293). Resistance in other
    problematic gram-negative pathogens is also emerging (10, 177, 307). Such events
    signify the importance of prudent and cautious use of this class of antimicrobial
    as well as an urgent need to further understand its complex pharmacology. New
    Antimicrobials A concerning void of new therapeutic options exists for A. baumannii
    infections. Of the recently licensed antimicrobials, tigecycline, a 9-t-butylglycylamido
    semisynthetic derivative of minocycline, has provided some hope, but clinical
    data are still limited. As with other tetracycline derivatives, tigecycline inhibits
    the 30S ribosomal subunit, but its unique feature is its ability to evade the
    major determinants of tetracycline resistance, i.e., the tet(A) to tet(E) and
    tet(K) efflux pumps and the tet(M) and tet(O) determinants that provide ribosomal
    protection (169, 430). Thus far, the in vitro activity of tigecycline against
    A. baumannii has been assessed largely by MIC testing. Most studies have reported
    an MIC50 of 1 μg/ml and an MIC90 of 2 μg/ml (229, 413, 473), but studies from
    Germany (500), Spain (37), and Israel (389) have reported MIC90s of 4 μg/ml, 8
    μg/ml, and 32 μg/ml, respectively, with the last being determined by Etest only.
    More recently, combination therapy with tigecycline has been studied using time-kill
    and Etest synergy methodology (476, 486). When it was tested against a non-carbapenem-susceptible
    A. baumannii strain, tigecycline alone allowed maximal killing at concentrations
    near the MIC, which was 1 μg/ml, with no benefit of using higher concentrations
    (486). Importantly, concentrations just below the MIC (0.5 μg/ml to 0.7 μg/ml),
    which are consistent with the mean maximum serum steady-state concentration achieved
    with standard dosing (0.63 μg/ml after a 100-mg i.v. loading dose followed by
    50 mg i.v. twice/day) (410), caused significant regrowth at 24 h (486). No difference
    was observed for all tigecycline combinations, including combinations with amikacin,
    meropenem, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ampicillin-sulbactam, rifampin,
    and polymyxin B (476, 486). These data raise concerns about the use of tigecycline
    for bloodstream infections caused by organisms with MICs of >1 μg/ml. Such concerns
    have now been illustrated in several clinical reports involving A. baumannii (424,
    484). Subinhibitory concentrations may promote the rapid emergence of resistance,
    leading to clinical failure (420, 424). At this point, we would not recommend
    using tigecycline for A. baumannii bacteremia if another option is available.
    Conversely, the drug is concentrated in tissues, including the lung parenchyma
    (101), and thus its utility for treating A. baumannii pneumonia or other tissue-based
    infections warrants further evaluation. A recent retrospective series including
    22 patients with VAP caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii showed that 18
    patients had clinical resolution (484). However, only three of these patients
    received tigecycline monotherapy, with the remainder also receiving therapy with
    imipenem and/or colistin. Further clinical data on tigecycline''s efficacy in
    pneumonia are still awaited. The most common adverse effect of tigecycline is
    nausea (15, 147), often requiring concomitant antiemetic therapy and limiting
    dose escalation. However, this is less of a problem in an ICU setting, where most
    A. baumannii infections occur. Other agents on the licensing horizon with activity
    against gram-negative organisms include doripenem, a new parenteral carbapenem,
    and the next generation of cephalosporins with activity against MRSA, ceftobiprole
    and ceftaroline. At this point, none of these agents appear to have significant
    advantages over current antimicrobials for A. baumannii, but in vitro data for
    doripenem suggest a slight advantage over meropenem (175, 275, 378, 379). Clinical
    data for doripenem against A. baumannii are still awaited. Other Combination Therapy
    The use of combination therapy to treat multidrug- or pandrug-resistant gram-negative
    organisms has become an area of great interest (449). This strategy aims to create
    an active combination out of two agents to which the organism tests nonsusceptible
    in the laboratory. Apart from trying to improve efficacy, combination therapy
    may also help to prevent the emergence of resistance when at least one agent is
    active in vitro (77, 412). Future studies assessing combination therapy for multidrug-resistant
    organisms should address this issue. The studies involving combination therapy
    with either sulbactam or the polymyxins that are described above form the major
    and most promising group. Other combinations have also been studied using in vitro
    techniques and animal models, including various combinations of quinolones, β-lactams,
    and/or amikacin (45, 80, 139, 280, 467). The results for quinolone combination
    therapy are varied, with reduced efficacy being described when ciprofloxacin was
    used for ciprofloxacin-resistant A. baumannii (151), as well as a lack of enhanced
    activity with levofloxacin combined with imipenem or amikacin in a mouse pneumonia
    model (273). Interestingly, enhanced activity was seen when aztreonam was tested
    in combination with other β-lactams against a select group of MBL-producing A.
    baumannii strains (474). Using a mouse pneumonia model, Montero et al. reported
    on the potential efficacy of imipenem and rifampin against a carbapenem- and rifampin-resistant
    A. baumannii strain (373). However, after performing a small preliminary clinical
    study, the same group suggested against such a combination for infection with
    A. baumannii isolates with a similar resistance pattern (470). Unfortunately,
    in some geographic regions, desperate therapeutic measures are required, including
    the use of multiple antibacterial agents that in isolation are predicted to have
    poor activity against the infecting A. baumannii strain, as determined by standardized
    laboratory testing. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Strategies Achieving pharmacodynamic
    target attainment with our existing antimicrobials is now, more than ever, critical
    in our therapeutic approach to drug-resistant A. baumannii infection. The use
    of Monte Carlo simulation, which is a stochastic modeling tool that combines pharmacokinetic
    parameters of antibiotics with population-based microbiological susceptibility
    data, has improved our understanding of appropriate antibiotic dosing. Apart from
    assisting in the optimization of drug efficacy (259, 304, 330, 340), this strategy
    may also help to prevent the evolution of drug resistance, as reported for P.
    aeruginosa (478, 532). The most promising data with regard to A. baumannii are
    the benefits of a prolonged infusion of meropenem (259, 330). The likelihood of
    achieving bactericidal target attainment (defined as a time above the MIC of at
    least 40% of the dosing interval) for organisms that have an MIC at the susceptibility
    breakpoint (4 μg/ml) increases from 64% to 90% as the infusion time of a 1-g dose
    is extended from 0.5 to 3 h (330). In a study involving patients with VAP, extending
    the meropenem infusion time to 3 h and increasing the dose to 2 g every 8 h provided
    concentrations in serum of >16 μg/ml for almost 60% of the time (259). Such data
    support the use of an extended meropenem infusion time for treating serious A.
    baumannii infections and highlight the benefits of an increased dose for nonsusceptible
    isolates. Thus far, the effects of such a dosing strategy on the clinical outcomes
    of patients with A. baumannii infection are unknown and should be a focus of future
    research. Future Therapeutic Considerations Despite the absence of new therapeutic
    options for A. baumannii in clinical studies, the activity in the preclinical
    arena is notable. Such agents can be divided into those that inhibit a currently
    recognized mechanism of resistance or those that have a novel mechanism of action.
    With regard to the former, attention has been directed toward new β-lactamase
    inhibitors, especially those targeting the Ambler class B MBLs (547), as well
    as toward inhibitors of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and multidrug efflux
    pumps. As mentioned above, MBLs have played an important role in the emergence
    of carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii, although they are less prevalent than
    the OXA-type enzymes. Their structure and catalytic mechanism, being zinc dependent,
    contrast with those of other serine β-lactamases, hence their stability toward
    current β-lactamase inhibitors. Agents that chelate the active Zn2+ site appear
    to be the most promising; however, several challenges exist (589). As a consequence
    of the significant differences in the active site architecture between MBL types,
    the ability to develop a pan-MBL inhibitor is problematic (589). Of most concern,
    MBLs have homologous mammalian enzymes (69, 487) and therefore increase the potential
    for significant toxicity. Despite these hurdles, the development of compounds
    that target the metalloenzymes continues (68). Thus far, inhibitors of both aminoglycoside-inactivating
    enzymes and multidrug efflux pumps have also been troubled by diverse targets,
    with bacteria often harboring multiple enzyme or pump types. More recently, cationic
    antimicrobial peptides that are capable of inhibiting both aminoglycoside phosphotransferases
    and acetyltransferases have been described (41). The importance of multidrug efflux
    pumps in A. baumannii is increasingly being recognized, with tigecycline recently
    identified as a substrate of the RND-type pump AdeABC (420, 469). Through large-scale
    in vitro screening, a range of efflux pump inhibitors have been identified, with
    the majority being plant alkaloids (433) but, more recently, also synthetic compounds
    (43). Unfortunately, progress has been slow, with agents such as phenyl-arginine-β-naphthylamide
    doing well when assessed in vitro but coming to demise due to toxicity concerns
    (433). Challenges are also anticipated as a result of the number of efflux systems
    often available in gram-negative organisms, thus leading to compensatory upregulation
    of noninhibited pumps. For a more detailed review of efflux inhibitors, readers
    are referred to references 282 and 343. With advances in genomics, proteomics,
    and chemical biology, new strategies for pathogen control are being devised. Justifiably,
    significant attention is being directed toward eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides,
    which are ubiquitous elements of the innate immune response in a variety of invertebrate,
    plant, and animal species (64). These cationic peptides act primarily by disturbing
    the cell membranes and share a similar structure and charge profile with the polymyxins,
    but the final steps in pathogen lethality have been shown to be different (479,
    480). This mechanistic difference is clinically attractive and is well illustrated
    by the susceptibility of polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii strains to such peptides
    (480, 562). Bactericidal activity against A. baumannii, using both in vitro (4,
    193, 448, 479, 480, 562) and in vivo (56, 125) models, has been reported. Combination
    studies, as determined by fractional inhibitory indexes, demonstrated that magainin
    II acted synergistically with β-lactams against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    but that four other peptides showed no synergy (192). More recently, modified
    peptides containing linear sequences of alternating acyl chains and cationic amino
    acids, known as oligo-AKs, were reported (448). In this study, the oligo-AK compound
    C12K-7α8 was compared to conventional antimicrobial peptides and standard antibiotics.
    It was found to have significant bactericidal activity, more so than imipenem
    and ciprofloxacin at 6× MIC, similar membrane binding properties to other peptides,
    no emergence of resistance after serial passages, and almost no toxicity toward
    human red blood cells (448). Furthermore, in a mouse peritoneal infection model
    using E. coli, C12K-7α8 prevented mortality similar to imipenem and ciprofloxacin,
    whereas conventional peptides did not (448). Overall, antimicrobial peptides have
    demonstrated great potential and may provide a feasible alternative for treatment
    of A. baumannii infections, including those caused by polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii
    (480, 562). Toxicity and efficacy data from human studies are awaited. Other novel
    antimicrobial strategies for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii include the use
    of bacterial conjugation, resulting in antibacterial gene transfer (505). This
    highly innovative approach uses attenuated E. coli as a vector for a conjugative
    plasmid carrying bactericidal genes that disrupt protein synthesis. While in E.
    coli the plasmid is tightly repressed, once it is transferred into the target
    pathogen, derepression occurs. In vitro, the donor E. coli cells led to killing
    of A. baumannii (505). Using a murine burn sepsis model, a significant improvement
    in survival of animals that were treated with donor cells was observed, as well
    as inhibition of A. baumannii growth in burn wounds (505). Novel topical agents
    that may be effective for environmental cleaning of A. baumannii, including highly
    charged copper-based biocides, have recently been reported (180). Such agents
    have broad-spectrum activity, including activity against Clostridium difficile
    spores; however, copper resistance was described when copper was used in animal
    feed (223). Other innovative therapeutic avenues, which have not yet been tested
    against A. baumannii but have the potential for efficacy, include the use of bacteriophage
    treatment (590), improvement in host response via passive or active immunization
    (63, 122, 134, 350), and modification of bacterial virulence by inhibition of
    quorum sensing (202, 375), other bacterial secretion systems (17), or LPS biosynthesis
    (118). More broadly, deepening our understanding of the mechanisms of antimicrobial
    resistance gene transfer and the cellular responses (such as the SOS response)
    that lead to mutagenesis and eventual resistance (23, 92, 313) will provide unique
    targets that, when inhibited, may prevent the emergence and dissemination of resistance.
    The clinical utility of these agents will be an adjunct to other antimicrobials.
    Which of these new agents will successfully progress through the gauntlet of drug
    development is unknown, but it is reassuring to see the surge in interest. CONCLUSIONS
    Significant advances have been made in our understanding of A. baumannii over
    recent years, but many unanswered questions still remain. With the advent of whole-genome
    sequencing, we have been able to gain important insights into the genetic complexity
    and agility of this fascinating organism. Its wide array of drug resistance determinants
    and its ability to effectively regulate these according to selective environmental
    pressures clearly demand respect. The global epidemiology of A. baumannii is concerning
    for widespread dissemination, most often in a clonal manner within institutions
    or cities, and sometimes between countries. The evidence suggests that hospital-acquired
    A. baumannii infections prolong the lengths of hospital stays and subsequent health
    care costs. However, the direct effects of A. baumannii on mortality appear less
    well defined. Despite the majority of A. baumannii strains still being susceptible
    to carbapenems, many institutions around the world are faced with the challenging
    issue of pandrug resistance. Concerns have been raised about the use of tigecycline
    for A. baumannii infection, particularly for bacteremia, leaving colistin as the
    only therapeutic option for some. It is imperative that future research be directed
    toward understanding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the
    polymyxins in order for clinicians to optimize patient outcomes, minimize adverse
    effects, and prevent the emergence of secondary resistance. Our understanding
    of the role of combination therapy for patients with multidrug- or pandrug-resistant
    A. baumannii infections is also critical. New therapeutics are clearly needed,
    and we as clinicians, microbiologists, and scientists must think broadly about
    our approach to antimicrobial drug development, as novel targets will no doubt
    provide the most reward for our afflicted patients. FIG. 1. FIG. 1. Summary of

    Get rights and content Highlights • A review of state-of-the-art Internet of Things
    applications for smart grid and home. • Definition of smart home holistic framework
    with key features from literature review. • General description of a smart home
    management model based on the holistic framework. • Discussion of current and
    future challenges for Internet of Things based solutions. Abstract Although Internet
    of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies
    for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very
    rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute
    towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications
    and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose
    a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks
    proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects
    in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model
    for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each
    level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data
    processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.
    We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as
    a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home
    solutions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of
    ThingsSmart homeHolistic frameworkSmart grid 1. Introduction With the expected
    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase
    for the terms Internet of Things and Smart Home. Download : Download high-res

    to Google trends since 2004 for terms Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart
    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.
    Query# Term1 Term2 Term3 Total number of results Query 1 “Wireless Sensor Network”

    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution
    Consumers Real-time generation monitoring Transmission lines controlling Underground

    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave
    Bacnet X10 EnOcean Insteon Without patents 228000 9790 5770 6700 1840 1520 720
    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave
    and Insteon. Empty Cell ZigBee Z-Wave Insteon Media wireless (radio) wireless

    2.4 GHz Gaussian, frequency-shift keying (GFSK) manchester channel encoding Frequency-shift
    keying (FSK) The price is another aspect that can be considered when choosing
    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities
    of IoT parts for smart home management system. Empty Cell Network topology Communication

    LTE/optical fiber/Wi-Fi very high very high Third party not applicable LTE/optical
    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability
    features of Insteon, X10, Z-Wave and ZigBee. Empty Cell Insteon X10 Z-Wave ZigBee
    ZigBee invisible to each other No No No Z-Wave invisible to each other No Yes
    X10 Yes Yes Insteon Yes 4.5. Security and privacy One of the most important issues
    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    Highlights • Reviews over than two hundred papers, that provide a contribution
    to knowledge by establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies
    and Agri-Food Supply Chain Challenges. • A compressive state of the art of Agri-Food
    4.0 related technologies is covered. • Reviews and contributes on the digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food. • Links to the agri-food
    supply chain challenges. • Presents new trends and models in agri-food supply
    chains. Abstract The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry
    4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial
    revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later
    the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies
    generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0
    concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest
    developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process
    across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms
    behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex
    networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies,
    especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements.
    In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses
    some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery
    incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing
    their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones,
    support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather,
    geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire
    farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing
    agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of
    Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours
    and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture
    4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to
    save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains
    open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies
    and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand
    the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. Previous article in issue Next article

    to support rural employment and to make a considerable contribution to territorial
    development. Even though they have always been considered a cornerstone of agricultural
    activity in the European Union (EU), this sector most often suffers from very
    low efficiency and effectiveness, sensitivity to weather, market disruptions and
    other external factors, such as poor agriculture supply chain stakeholders’ linkages
    and communication, especially at the food processing level. In fact, and as stablished
    by the FAO,1 under an approach from “field to fork” the agriculture supply chain
    structures can also be named Agri-Food supply chains, where main events coming
    from the agricultural production of food to the food processing events, including
    trading, are linked. Across this Agri-Food Supply Chain, in most of the cases,
    the transferred agriculture knowledge, from generation to generation, is paramount
    from a cultural point of view, but most of the time, it does not answer to the
    needs nor the requirements of the Agri-Food Supply Chains. Furthermore, such delineation
    does not exist also between farms as economic units and farmers who are producing
    food, mostly, for their own consumption. However, no formal delineation to what
    is a “small” and/or a “large” farm formally exists that is holistically accepted,
    it depends on several factors, such as countries, regions, politics, strategies,
    market shares amongst many others. Nonetheless, there are two criteria to classify
    farm size: standard output (in economic terms) and utilised agricultural area
    (UAA), as alternative measure2 . In this same line, Eurostat3 predicts that, by
    2026, an increment of 4%–6% in agriculture cost savings, as well as an increment
    of 3 % in market value, will be regarded to the use and development of smart agriculture.
    Hence, “Agriculture 4.0″ emerges to provide advanced technologies to the famers
    in order to meet agri-food production challenges, hence, to achieve more affordable
    prices for open market and the minimum cost for farmers. Thus, the expectation
    for the further coming years, is that Agri-Food 4.0 should help meeting sustainable
    challenges by increasing the agri-food supply chain stakeholders revenues as well
    as decreasing their pressure for handling complex and external factors they cannot
    control, such as weather, market behaviours and policies, but also to react on
    time by visualising current trends in needs. This paper focus principally on the
    factory farm model issued from the European and north American style. In those
    typologies of farms the Industry 4.0 elements can be introduced and merged with
    the agricultural domain to create the Agri-Food 4.0. The focus is more specialised
    on the industrial farming although the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted
    also to the organic and silvo-pasture paradigms. Thus, this paper, considering
    a review over than two hundred papers, provides a contribution to knowledge by
    establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies and Agri-Food
    Supply Chain Challenges, which opens the 4.0 research field for a multidisciplinary
    work. The choice of the literature review methodology focused firstly on key words
    related to the Agri-food technology, then the second approach was to focus on
    selected journals and at the end we looked for the data-based repository and the
    linked publications. To accomplish this, the structure in this paper is as follows:
    in the first place, a compressive state of the art of Agri-Food 4.0 related technologies
    is covered. In the second place, a review and contribution coming from digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food shows linkages with
    next trends and technologies. Next, and linked to the agri-food supply chain challenges,
    the fourth section presents new trends and models in agri-food supply chains,
    especially in the domain of risk management, collaboration, governance, cold chain
    management, globalization, information and communication technologies, Logistics,
    supply chain structures and sustainable agri-food supply chains. Finally, the
    fifth section covers the main conclusions, visions and perspectives for this novel
    research. 2. Agri-food 4.0 and technologies state-of-the-art The agricultural
    sector has been active in digital innovation for decades already. Especially the
    advances in Precision Agriculture, remote sensing, robots, farm management information
    systems, and (agronomic) decision support systems have paved the way for a broad
    digital transformation in farming and food (Pedro and Gonzalez-Andujar, 2019).
    Recent developments, such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain,
    Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, allow for the integration of so far isolated
    lines of development into smart, connected systems of systems. Those technologies
    will let the agriculture to evolve in a data-driven, intelligent, agile and autonomous
    connected system of systems. The operations of each agricultural process will
    be automatically integrated in the food chain through the semantically active
    technologies up to the end consumer. The 4th industrial revolution is now reaching
    agriculture. The digital platform (DP) concept emerged as an integration of heterogeneous
    mainly open software solutions for ecosystem building (Yablonsky, 2018). The EU
    promote the creation of digital platforms for several application domains as manufacturing
    (i.e. FoF 11 – 2016 projects, DT-ICT-07-2018-2019, etc.), construction (BIM + calls),
    etc. As a concentration of technology enablers, research on DP covers several
    issues such as software engineering (Guertin and Van Benthem, 2016; Wang et al.,
    2006), process simulation and development (Zhao and Yao, 2016; Hu et al., 2016),
    features analysis (Wang et al., 2014), resource performance (Mocnej et al., 2018),
    test algorithms (Santiago et al., 2017) or performance control (Sahota et al.,
    2011). The technological platforms allow access to the different stakeholders
    and provide deployment capabilities for IT solutions. These solutions are exposed
    by service providers or developed by software engineers. Agricultural Data management
    and exploitation is the central node between digital transformation capabilities
    and the agriculture concerns. The main research issues concern the consolidation
    of data repositories with open data (Gumaste and Kadam, 2016) (weather, maps,
    etc.), governance data (policies, local regulation, etc.) and domain specific
    data from end users. Data typology is very rich (land, location, energy, climate,
    climate impact, etc.) and data volume is continually increasing by the integration
    of sensors and IoT platforms in agriculture (Amandeep et al., 2017; Biradar and
    Shabadi, 2017). Data engineering effort covers pattern definition (Laube et al.,
    2011; Spekken et al., 2016), classification algorithms (Narvaez et al., 2018;
    Shi et al., 2015; Yalcin and Razavi, 2016), correlation analysis (Nilsson et al.,
    2016; Xavier et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2017), etc. All those technologies provide
    engineering capabilities for agricultural data. The implementation of these techniques
    will handle farmers data, will integrate new data repositories from external providers,
    will transform data to knowledge and feed decision support systems. The data transparency
    enabler with necessary sharing policies will accelerate data ingestion and ejection
    processes. 2.1. Big data technologies Research activities in Big Data provide
    relevant results in several application domains (healthcare, marketing, maritime,
    urban, manufacturing, etc.). The Big Data Value Association (BDVA)4 promote the
    application of bigdata in different domains (Belaud et al., 2019). The Big Data
    Grapes EU project5 provides data semantic, analytics, integration and exploitation
    solutions as well as a software stack for grapes agriculture. As additional ongoing
    research issues, we identified tools and technology development (Devarakonda et
    al., 2014; Hashem and Ranc, 2016), analytic methods and services (Malhotra et
    al., 2017; Deka and Walczak, 2017), clustering methods (Balan et al., 2015), transformation
    algorithms (Penar and Wilczek, 2016; Hashem and Ranc, 2016) performance and data
    processing technics (Wu and Zhao, 2009), data source and storage management (Cha
    et al., 2018; RubyDinakar and Vagdevi, 2017), etc. The integration of Big Data
    technologies in Agri-Food projects plays an important role in: the extension of
    farmers data to create new knowledge; the creation of innovative services and
    processes by IT providers and software developers as well as the extension and
    the adaptation of ICT and Factories of the Future (FoF)6 related Big Data models
    and patterns for agriculture. There are several Big Data Repositories that guarantee,
    nowadays, the access and the exploitation to Agri-Food data. As example: the “National
    Climatic Data Centre” (about 2,9 Go per day); Satellite Imagery and metrological
    information from Google and the NASA Earth Exchange; Soil, water and geospatial
    data from the National Resources Conservation Service (US); the OpenCorporates
    as the world’s largest open repository of companies (165 million companies around
    the word); etc. 2.2. Internet of things technologies The integration of IoT platforms
    in agriculture provides additional data sources describing agricultural features
    (water, soil, humans, animals, etc.) with more data. The recent research issues
    on IoT highlight the multiplication of IoT platforms. This expansion generates
    new implementation frameworks (Lee et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018) answering
    to different requirement models, new networks of heterogeneous components and
    sensors with different monitoring models (Pflanz et al., 2018; Vergara et al.,
    2017; Prathibha et al., 2017), time processing scheme and misbalanced energy consumption
    (Ruano et al., 2018; Jarolimek et al., 2016). The integration of the IoT platforms
    with the agricultural issues could add additional research challenges, specifically
    when the data are stocked or used in the cloud, in terms of interoperability (Panetto,
    2007; Mocnej et al., 2018; Zarko et al., 2017; Hefnawy et al., 2017; Martinez
    et al., 2016; Leal et al., 2019; Panetto et al., 2016) (protocols, security, etc.),
    performance monitoring (Paulraj et al., 2018; Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017), etc.
    In addition, IoT serves Robotics (Murar and Brad, 2015) and Automated Guided Vehicles
    (AGV) (Sanchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). An interesting activity might be the
    benchmarking of all the existing IoT platforms and their proposed functionalities
    and mapping them with Agri-Food stakeholders’ requirements. The integration of
    IoT capabilities will support farmers in the harvesting of new data sources to
    create new valuable services. 2.3. Knowledge model approaches The development
    of valuable knowledge models in agriculture aims to transform shared multi-sources
    data repositories to create profitable services and support the decision making
    for different stakeholders. Recent research topics address precise data collection
    and engineering to serve knowledge creation of new farming models (Abdullah et
    al., 2017; Irmak et al., 2006), technology application in farming (Chen and Jin,
    2011; Gerhards et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2013), resource allocation (Garcia
    et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2017; Musacchio and Grant, 2002), assessment frameworks
    (for risk, policies definition and quality management) (Jacxsens et al., 2016;
    Louwagie et al., 2012) as well as the qualification of decision models (Costanzo
    and Faro, 2012; Dragincic et al., 2015) and the identification of decision parameters
    (region, land, climate, plant, time, process, etc.). 2.4. Artificial intelligence
    techniques Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques propose important contributions
    to knowledge model’s identification, service creation and the decision-making
    processes as support for the different Agri-Food’s applications (Solemane et al.,
    2019). AI offers formal general algorithms for prediction (Bhatt and Buch, 2015;
    Soh et al., 2018), accuracy and performance evaluation (Jeon et al., 2017) as
    well as pattern classification (Ott et al., 2003; Pinho et al., 2011; Starr, 2005)
    that might solve knowledge issues in the agricultural domain such as the pest’s
    identifications and the correct treating methods. In addition, AI supports applications
    in farming technics development: land allocation regarding the targeted activity
    (Pokhrel et al., 2018), irrigation process analysis and control (Ait-Mouheb et
    al., 2018; Mohanraj et al., 2017), robot guidance (Tian et al., 2018; Roshanianfard
    et al., 2018; Sheridan, 2016), etc. 2.5. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture emerges
    as a main concept in Agri-Food 4.0. By integrating new technology enablers propelled
    by the Industry 4.0 paradigm (Annosi et al., 2019), smart agriculture addresses
    important farming objectives as water saving (O’Connor and Mehta, 2016), soil
    conservation (Li et al., 2002), limit carbon emission (Ochoa et al., 2014) and
    productivity increasing (Mayer et al., 2015) by doing more with less. The new
    agricultural age aims to harmonize and share better local European policies and
    rules to scale the best farming practices and applications. Smart agriculture
    offers the opportunity to farmers, technology and service providers, governance
    agencies and other impacted stakeholders (financial organization, investors, traders,
    etc.) to share their experiences and preoccupations in the optimization in the
    farming Supply Chain with the close respect of production sustainability (Swisher
    et al., 2018; Oberholster et al., 2015). 2.6. Precision farming techniques and
    robot development The Precision Farming topic is already covered by other H2020
    calls (SFS-05-2017, SFS-06-2018-2020, SFS-08-2018-2019, etc.). The analysis of
    released projects outcomes and related research issues allows to identify new
    technologies, processes and applications in agriculture. Relevant models are proposed
    for land, grain and arable related activities (Gumma et al., 2016). Relevant listed
    results cover harvesting distribution accuracy (Roshanianfard et al., 2018; Kamata
    et al., 2018; Alzahrani, 2018), cost development (Pomar et al., 2010) and distribution
    optimization (Zhou et al., 2018; Tabatabaie et al., 2013; Ruiz-Garcia et al.,
    2010; Eisele et al., 2001). Within the Agri-Food projects is planned to reuse
    available precision farming technologies and results to improve the quality of
    targeted farmers’ processes and applications. Results in the integration of robots
    in agriculture are well mature and already proposed by Agri-Food stakeholders.
    With precision farming enablers, it will be ensured the performance of impacted
    farming processes. Agriculture Robots are already investigated in the precision
    farming topic. Recent research in this area covers the adaptability of robot design
    to the agriculture sector, the improvement of navigation conditions through additional
    sensing (Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2017; Jhonattan et al., 2019) and localization
    capabilities as well as real-time image processing (Xu et al., 2017; Pilli et
    al., 2015) and camera detection (Dworak et al., 2013) to maximize the operational
    capabilities and behaviour of robots and collaborative robots (cobots). Robots
    can assist humans (Chilcanan et al., 2017; Dondeynaz et al., 2013) for difficult
    tasks or replace them for difficult ones. The cost reduction (Pomar et al., 2010)
    effectiveness is demonstrated and research in decision error reduction (Montecinos
    et al., 2018; Shin and Ko, 2017; Brigido et al., 2015) is intensive to improve
    accuracy by simulation (Xu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Latorre-Biel et al.,
    2018) and by more precise path finding (Spekken et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2017)
    and guidance algorithms (Kviz et al., 2014; Baio, 2012). The new Agri-Food projects
    fund the integration of Agriculture Robots to support the applications since the
    beginning to ensure the maximum results. Building resilient and sustainable farming
    system is the ultimate concept behind Agriculture 4.0. Recent research in this
    topic covers farming processes sustainability analysis (McGuire and Sperling,
    2013; Joly, 2005), farming activity calibration (Suryoputro et al., 2017; Hosseini
    et al., 2014; do Nascimento et al., 2012) (rotation cycles, control of accuracy),
    the development of conservation protocols (Kladivko et al., 2014; Gaspary et al.,
    2002) and the alignment of business development strategies. 3. How the new digital
    technology transforms the agri-food supply chains To achieve robust, resilient
    and sustainable agri-food supply chains is very complex because they face more
    sources of uncertainty and risks in comparison with other supply chains that give
    rise to serious questions and concerns about their economic, environmental and
    social performance. Several studies identify agricultural sources of uncertainty
    (Mundi et al., 2019; Esteso et al., 2017; Esteso et al., 2018) and how to model
    them (Grillo et al., 2019). In Esteso et al. (2018) four types of crop-based uncertainty
    are identified: Product (shelf-life, deterioration rate, lack of homogeneity,
    food quality and food safety), Process (harvesting yield, supply lead time, resource
    needs, production), Market (demand, market prices) and Environment (weather, pests
    & diseases and regulations). Poor management of these sources of uncertainty can
    have a very negative impact on safety, quality, quantity and waste of products
    as well as human, technological and natural resources. Indeed, the agri-food sector
    is one of the economic and political areas worldwide, with key implications in
    sustainability to cover not only the food needs of the population, contribute
    to their employability and economic growth, but also in the impact on the natural
    environment (Iakovou et al., 2014). Therefore, the agri-food supply chains are
    strongly pressured to manage these sources of uncertainty and risks whose precise
    evolution over time is unknown but may jeopardize the future sustainability of
    these type of supply chains. It is necessary to move away from “business as usual”
    developing new solutions and implement innovative technologies (FAO, 2018). Along
    these lines, a digitalized supply chain, allows companies to monitor material
    flows in real time making potential risks visible and develop future plans to
    face them. The main drivers for the digitalization of the processes of SC are
    usually the increase of the flexibility and the speed of reaction of the industrial/logistical
    systems (ten Hompel and Henke, 2017a, ten Hompel and Henke, 2017b) as well as
    the improvement of agri-food supply chain robustness and resilience. In this context,
    data becomes crucial. Data is the lifeblood of any business and the agricultural
    business is not an exception but rather a referent. The new technologies have
    a great impact on the reduction of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise
    data in real time, whose treatment, together with the capacities of autonomous
    and intelligent decision making will help to increase the efficiency, sustainability,
    flexibility, agility, and the resilience along the whole supply chain from the
    farmers to the final customers. In the context of data-driven supply chains, the
    new technologies listed in the previous section, provide different and complementary
    support to the sequence of activities from data chain (Wolfert et al., 2017):
    data capture, storage, transfer, transformation, analytics and marketing. The
    support of each technology to different data chain activities lets envisage that
    the true potential of the data comes from the combination and integration of these
    technologies. Indeed, each one will improve some of the following basic functions
    of agri-food supply chains: sensing, monitoring, control, analysis (descriptive
    capabilities), prediction (predictive capabilities), decision-making (prescriptive
    capabilities) and adaptive learning. Through the sensing, monitoring, control
    and analysis it is possible to the early and accurate detection of problems and
    even predicting them before occurring, making better decisions and learn of them
    improving the sustainability and resilience of agri-food supply chains. In fact,
    the integration of previous technologies allows a more intelligent management
    of the agri-food supply chains, being able to combine multiple models of independent
    data analysis, repositories of historical data and data flows in real time. Real-time
    information and data processing tools provide new opportunities for companies
    to react more quickly to changing conditions in the supply chain. Due to this
    integrated intelligence, the agri-food supply chain management goes from supporting
    decisions to delegating them and, ultimately, to predicting which decisions should
    be taken. From all the above, there is no doubt that these new technologies are
    transforming the way agricultural sector organize and make decisions. In order
    to provide a general overview about how the new digital technology transforms
    the agri-food supply chains, the tables (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) integrate
    and classify the main positive impacts of the most relevant technologies as well
    as the challenges to be faced according to recent studies in the field carried
    by different authors. Table 1. IoT: Impact and Challenges. Internet of Things

    • Cultural adoption: blockchain represents a complete shift to a decentralized
    network which requires the buy-in of its users and operators. Technological Challenges:
    • Blockchain integration with other technologies (BDA, IoT, CPS) • Strategize
    the transition: blockchain applications offer solutions that require significant
    changes to, or complete replacement of, existing systems. • Limited storage capacity
    and scalability • Control, security, and privacy: while solutions exist, including
    private or permissioned blockchains and strong encryption, there are still cyber
    security concerns that need to be addressed before the general public will entrust
    their personal data to a blockchain solution. • Throughput and latency issue:
    in the context of agri-food Supply Chain management, due to the original restriction
    of block size and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current
    processing capacity of blockchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing
    millions of transactions in real-time • Infrastructure and capacity development
    challenges: it can only be applied as long as an internet connection is available,
    which can still be a challenge in some developing countries Table 3. Big Data

    agri-food risks, benchmarking) • Predictive analytics allows gain insights about
    what will be happening or likely to happen by exploring patterns in data (forecasting
    of demand, yield, price, weather, consumer behaviour) • Prescriptive analytics

    of those problems. Technological Impact: Capability of dealing with 5 Vs: • Volume
    (magnitude of data) • Variety (data from heterogeneous sources), • Velocity (speed
    of data generation and delivery, which can be processed in batch, real-time, nearly
    real-time, or streamlines) • Veracity (data quality and level of trust) • Value
    (detecting underexploited values from big data to support decision-making) Challenges
    Organizational Challenges: • Big Data decentralization • Big Data control when
    there are multiple actors involved • Big Data trust, privacy and security among
    actors • Big Data Monetization (transfer of rights on data) Social Challenges:
    • Demonstrate value of innovations as compared its costs, to encourage companies
    and individuals to collect and exchange data • Exploring the ethical implications
    of Big Data in food and agriculture • Availability of skilled human resources
    for big data analysis Technological Challenges: Improving the capability of dealing
    with 5V’s • Volume (data exponentially increased, posing a challenge to the capacity
    of storage devices) • Variety (sustainable integrate and combine data from different
    sources: sensors, Internet of things (IoT), mobile devices, online social networks,
    in structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats) • Velocity (real-time
    data processing) • Veracity (ensure quality and reliability) • Value (provide
    more value and insights from data) • Valence (support of connectivity in data).
    The potential of connectivity between systems is being constrained by a lack of
    common data standards or easy-to-use ontologies. • Combine the three levels of
    analytics: the performance of prescriptive analytics would heavily rely on those
    of descriptive and predictive analytics since providing the value of input parameters
    in the prescriptive model • Combining different data analytic techniques to develop

    Impact and Challenges. Artificial Intelligence References (Mercy et al., 2011;

    al., 2016; Elsayed et al., 2018; Reshma and Pillai, 2018) Impact Functional impact:
    AI techniques enable: • Classification: to predict the categories of input data
    for e.g. weather attributes are sunny, windy, rainy etc. • Regression: to predict
    numeric value e.g. price of stocks. • Clustering: to organize similar items in-to
    groups. • Association Analysis: to find interesting relationships between sets
    of variables. • Graph Analysis: to use graphic structure to find connections between
    entities. • Decision Tree: To predict modelling insights of objective variables
    by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. Above capabilities
    have been applied to: • Crop Management (yield prediction, disease detection,

    that human experts may overlook. • Reduce human intervention enabling human expert
    to concentrate on more creative activities Business Impact: • Automated decision-making
    • Expert system increases the probability, frequency and consistency of making
    good decisions, additive effect of knowledge of many domain experts, facilitates
    real-time, low-cost expert-level decisions by the non-expert, enhance the utilization
    of most of the available data • Learning ability Artificial Intelligence, goes
    a step further by not simply applying pre-programmed decisions, but instead exhibiting
    some learning capabilities • Data transformation: ML and AI can help create value
    by providing enterprises with intelligent analysis of big data and capturing structured
    interpretations of the wide variety of unstructured data increasingly available.
    Technological Impact: • Advancement of ML with machine vision will make agricultural
    technologies accurate, robust and low cost. • AI can be used to identify and clean
    dirty data or use dirty data as a means of establishing context knowledge for
    the data. • AI contributes to the velocity of data, by facilitating rapid computer-based

    computers and to Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs. • Expert systems developed
    in regional languages to be more accessible Challenges Social Challenges: • Replacement
    of human intervention perceived as a threat Technological Challenges: • AI to
    further facilitate additional developments on visualization • AI algorithms designed
    for single-machine environments might have emergent subproblem structures useful
    for parallelization. • Adding speech interface to the system may be proved to
    be more beneficial for the farmers of the remote area • Expert systems will not
    be able to give the creative responses that human experts can give in unusual
    circumstances. • Lack of flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments.
    • Not being able to recognize when no answer is available. • Knowledge acquisition
    remains the major bottleneck in applying expert system technology to new domains.
    • Maintenance and extension of a rule base can be difficult for a relatively large
    rule base • Enhance IoT with machine learning techniques to analyse data captured
    by sensors in real time in agriculture. As it can be seen in the above tables,
    some challenges of these digital technologies appear as strengths of others. This
    allows intuiting the suitability of using them as complements with the others.
    Indeed, in the near future, the full potential of data will rely on the combination
    of the different technologies that enhance data-driven agri-food supply chains
    more informed, efficient, secure, sustainable and resilient. For instance, IoT
    and BDA can benefit from blockchain providing data security, anonymity, trust
    and decentralization. Since blockchain exchange information in a distributed network,
    novel IoT applications will be developed for distributed environments. On the
    other side, the valuable data generated from the IoT could enrich transaction
    details that are registered on the blockchain (Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018).
    In turn, the accurate data provided by blockchain technology can be used as input
    for AI applications and to also record their outputs (Rabah et al., 2018). Besides,
    AI can enhance IoT by developing applications to analyse data captured by sensors
    in real time using machine learning algorithms (Reshma and Pillai, 2018). Machine
    learning and other analytic methods can also improve predictive and prescriptive
    capabilities (decision making) of Big Data Analytics. There is a broad consensus
    on the need to strengthen research and innovation in the Agri-food sector, both
    in terms of practices and technologies, through the creation of new products,
    the improvement of processes, services or processes or the integration of digital
    possibilities. Indeed, one of the persisting challenges to take advantage of the
    full potential of the data is to achieve not only the integration of these technologies
    but also their interoperability. Diversity of stakeholders integrating agri-food
    supply chains with different interests and characteristics make difficult to find
    solutions that fit all those involved, so group decision-making tools should be
    developed (Zaraté et al., 2019). Moreover, when these solutions require significant
    investments and there are stakeholders, such as small farmers with a limited budget.
    For this reason, it will be key to demonstrate the value of innovations as compared
    to their companies and to collect and exchange data. Other challenges reside on
    the needs of data standards. The standardization of the fruition data would provide
    equity for all stakeholders because of the possibility to access to the same information
    that might provide financial gain. The fruition data might provide the training
    for ensuring the availability of the required technical skills and definition
    of regulatory actions by governments. Research may be co-financed with partners
    private (e.g., companies or business groups), government (many departments and
    agencies involved) or institutional (e. g. universities). This approach accentuates
    the effect leverage government support and improve the transfer of innovations
    to businesses. It enables the training of highly qualified personnel and a new
    generation of scientists for companies and centres of research. The stability
    of funding agreements with the centres promote the retention of their qualified
    staff and facilitate partnerships with industry for the realization of structuring
    projects. Access to appropriate funding and research tax credits and development
    (R&D) is also a source of funding structuring for the industry to absorb financial
    risks generated by innovation activities (Tuhin et al., 2019). This type of financing
    is particularly important when innovation takes place directly in the company,
    which is often the case in food processing. 4. The new models of the Agri-Food
    supply chains The competitiveness of food processing companies depends on their
    investment capacity, the increase in their production, the development of new
    products and the implementation of processes to stand out from the competition
    (Guoqing et al., 2020). Over the past 30 years, we have seen a significant reduction
    in biodiversity, FAO estimates that we will have a 70 % reduction in biodiversity
    on our planet by 2050 (FAO, 2018). Human activities seem to be the main cause
    of this loss. The agriculture has many cards in hand to slow this process by implementing
    environmental protection practices and reducing the chemicals that have led to
    the destruction of many animals and insects living on land, in the air and in
    the water; creating green corridors and shelters for animals and insects; the
    cultivation of old species or species with high genetic variability, leaving the
    design of hybrid plants and monocultures that lead to significant genetic depletion;
    the reduction of arable land to make way for the replanting of forests, grasslands
    and hedges. The competitiveness is addressed to a new way of thinking the Agriculture
    that will let to optimize the process and respecting the nature. The labour shortage
    in many regions of Europe requires processing companies to automate and robotize
    their processes. In addition, investment in these new technologies allows them
    to improve their productivity and provide better working conditions necessary
    to the attraction and retention of the workforce. In addition, to meet the quality
    standards requirements of large chains and food retailers, they must use recognised
    quality management and traceability systems. Investment in digital technologies
    also promotes automation of operations, data management and access to a new range
    of management tools (Industry 4.0). The industry is particularly requested, as
    shown in the previous section, for the use of digital technologies, which allows
    it to optimize production and the supply chain while ensuring traceability of
    food from more and more pointed (Panetto et al., 2019). It is not new that, nowadays,
    agricultures supply chain practices, especially regarding to food products, are
    currently under public scrutiny. As established by Van Der Vorst (2006), this
    is because several factors, which considers food contamination issues, the new
    consumer healthy requirements, requirements for more precise information about
    the farming, marketing, and distribution practices used to bring the agricultural
    products into the shelves into supermarket, to name a few. In this same context,
    and regarding to Suprem et al. (2013), agricultural industry has been solely dependent
    on human labour with limited application of mechanical equipment and machines.
    Moreover, the applications of advanced technology such as embedded computing,
    robotics, wireless technology, GPS/GIS (Geographical Positioning System/Geographical
    Information System) and DBMS (Database Management System) software are seen to
    be recent developments, where regulations are vaguely considered. Moreover, the
    increasing gap between farmer''s expectations and the ability of the government
    led extension services has created a big business opportunity for private parties
    (Kumar and Ali, 2007). In this context, the information about the geometric properties
    of crops provided by digital based techniques, such as: ultrasound, digital photographic
    techniques, light sensors, high-resolution radar images, high-resolution X-ray
    computed tomography, stereo vision and LIDAR sensors; has innumerable applications
    in agriculture. Some important agricultural tasks that can benefit from these
    plant-geometry characterization techniques are the application of pesticides,
    irrigation, fertilization and crop training, improving the environmental and economic
    impact. But there is still a need to resolve several technological and commercial
    questions (Rosell et al., 2012). In line to this, agriculture technologies are
    focused on how traceability can be performed, in fact, the food industry had developed
    efficient traceability methods for the management of logistics and warehouses,
    based on the balance of costs and benefits of the traceability system level (Dabbene
    et al., 2013). Because of this, several authors are currently reviewing main agriculture
    supply chain technology based methods, and example of this is provided by Ahumada
    and Villalobos (2008), who identified that the use of integrated planning models
    in the agriculture supply chains is still very limited, with a high potential
    to manage perishable agri-food products, especially to deal with complex environments.
    In addition, (Ali and Kumar, 2011a) study the implication of using ICT in agriculture.
    From the authors’ findings it is highly appreciated that there is still a medium
    level of dissemination of information and knowledge sharing in agricultural developments
    (Boshkoska et al., 2019), as well as there is still a need for empirical evidences
    as to how ICT interventions are enabling the farmers to take informed decisions.
    Complementary to this, S. Araba and M. Fellows (Araba and Fellows, 2009) address
    that the majority of current research have not established a clear link between
    public access to ICTs and socioeconomic change/impacts in agriculture. In fact,
    there is a need for researchers to go beyond anecdotal evidence of downstream
    public access impacts on end‐users. Nevertheless, it is also evidenced that there
    is still limited ability on information to make definitive statements about agriculture
    expected impacts, as well as to identify and attribute specific impacts to specific
    ICT usage. Table 5 presents a summary on well-known methods and approached to
    support this, in special the agriculture supply chain decision-making methods.

    Hence, and as depicted from Table 1, as studied and established by Reardon et
    al. (2019), the food system can be thought of as “dendritic,” linking R&D, finance,
    input, and output supply chains. This means (1) the first and “core” supply chain,
    is the output Supply Chain. The second and upstream “feeder” supply chains are
    the farm input supply chains. The third and downstream ‘feeder’ supply chains
    are those supplying inputs to the post-farmgate segments. The fourth “pan-system
    feeder” supply chain is that supplying finance into every segment of every chain
    in the dendritic system. The fifth ‘feeder’ supply chain is a broad set of public
    assets apart from agricultural research institutions. The sixth set of “feeders”
    is the R&D supply chains, which supply technology and product innovations. Moreover,
    the ICT challenges in Agriculture supply chains are still open. Birkel in Birkel
    and Hartmann (2019), studied most of the recent ICT developments in this field,
    and found that most of the technological challenges in agriculture mainly includes
    security issues, lack of standards and interoperability, as well as hardware and
    software limitations are the focus of current research. Hence, the main challenges
    and risks are also in relation to the methodology, where (Ben-Daya et al., 2017)
    has revealed that the design aspect is primarily identified as a technological
    issue, while neglecting social and political challenges. Food processing companies''
    projects must benefit from financial levers that the government makes available
    to all in the manufacturing sector (Hernández et al., 2020). In order to further
    stimulate the investments, particularly in the SMEs and in innovative sectors,
    from financial tools considering the needs of the processing sector are decisive
    for the development of the implementation of development projects (Hernandez et
    al., 2020). In a business environment characterized by technological innovation,
    the consolidation of industries, deregulation and demand for consumers in constant
    evolution, the approaches of the traditional managers can no longer allow for
    companies to remain profitable. They are therefore forced to find new ways to
    stay competitive in agri-food domain, as it is also the case for all other industrial
    sectors (Boehlje, 1999; Senge, 1997; Senge et al., 2006). In the value chain management
    (VCM) domain, the informed decision making to unite resources to improve the competitiveness,
    is proving to be a powerful strategic approach that allows organizations to adapt
    to an environment of business in full motion. (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011;
    Dunne, 2008; Fearne, 2007; Fernandez et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). The concept
    of a continuous observation results in continuous and significant improvement
    of the design and the system performance, this is only possible when the companies
    are able to establish a degree of coordination and integration with their suppliers
    and customers that do not allow them the usual relationships with the latter based
    on the transactional approach buyer-seller (Sparling, 2007). Closer strategic
    relationships with customers and suppliers allow companies to better learn and
    adapt (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Multiple firms that co-invent and work together
    for the same objectives using integrated processes can increase their performance
    in a much more significant way that if they had gone it alone (Bonney et al.,
    2007; Fearne, 2007). Co-innovation allows companies to improve their own practices
    as well as those of all of them, it is a process that gives companies competitive
    forces that are difficult to match by others (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011).
    Several of the cases mentioned below demonstrate the benefits sustainable and
    competitive products obtained by companies who have chosen to co-innovate with
    other members of their supply chain. 5. Conclusions, vision and perspectives For
    this scientific contribution to knowledge, more than two hundred papers support
    the analysis on scientific work on the smart agriculture technology trends, but,
    more importantly, on how they emerge as a main concept in the agriculture domain
    as Agri-Food 4.0. From this reviews and analysis, it is clearly revealed that
    integration across new technologies allows smart agriculture to address important
    farming objectives as water saving, soil conservation, limit carbon emission and
    productivity increasing by doing more with less. In fact, the new technologies
    have a positive impact and at the same time pose new challenges in the management
    of different domains of human knowledge. Hence, two main conceptual pillars impact
    and challenges, arising from the use of various technologies in the world of the
    new conception of agriculture are the fundamental aspects in Agri-Food 4.0. A
    precision is due. This paper focus principally on the factory farm model issued
    from the “western” style. In those farms, the Agri-Food 4.0 started to be applied
    and validated. The focus is more specialised on the industrial farming although
    the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted also to the organic and silvo-pasture
    paradigms. The paper pays attention particularly to four major technologies, the
    Internet of Things, the Blockchain, the Big data and the Artificial Intelligence.
    For each of those technologies is presented some type of impacts: functional,
    economic, environmental, social, related to the business and technological and
    the challenges that come with their introduction. The literature is segmented
    in relation to the functionality of the specific technology and a panoramic view
    gives the possibility to better understand the paths needed to face the new challenges.
    The future of the Agriculture domain is in the creation of a resilient and sustainable
    farming system. On the four types of crop-based uncertainty that have been identified:
    Product, Process, Market and Environment the core problem is the management. Poor
    management of these sources of uncertainty have a negative impact on safety, quality,
    quantity and waste of products as well as human, technological and natural resources.
    Today, and always more in the future, the data is the lifeblood of any business
    and the agricultural business is not an exception but rather a referent. As aforementioned
    in the discussion section, the new technologies have a great impact on the reduction
    of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise data in real time, and real-time
    information tools provide new opportunities for companies to react more quickly
    to changing conditions in the supply chain. Our interest in the next future is
    to use formal methods to extract knowledge from the interrelation of the difference
    technologies impacts and from the existing solutions to the highlighted challenges
    to increase the efficiency, sustainability, flexibility, agility, and the resilience
    along the whole supply chain from the farmers to the final customers, and the
    analysis and outcomes from this paper, will contribute to support that from the
    main research knowledge findings. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors,

    Get rights and content Highlights • Systematic literature review of IoT applications
    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:
    web, mobile and local, in four subdomains: monitoring, control, prediction, and
    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    and environmental applications. 7. Conclusions This paper presented an updated
    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

    valuable insights into agronomic management over the past 40 yr. The contributions
    of individuals to remote sensing methods have lead to understanding of how leaf
    reflectance and leaf emittance changes in response to leaf thickness, species,
    canopy shape, leaf age, nutrient status, and water status. Leaf chlorophyll and
    the preferential absorption at different wavelengths provides the basis for utilizing
    reflectance with either broad-band radiometers typical of current satellite platforms
    or hyperspectral sensors that measure reflectance at narrow wavebands. Understanding
    of leaf reflectance has lead to various vegetative indices for crop canopies to
    quantify various agronomic parameters, e.g., leaf area, crop cover, biomass, crop
    type, nutrient status, and yield. Emittance from crop canopies is a measure of
    leaf temperature and infrared thermometers have fostered crop stress indices currently
    used to quantify water requirements. These tools are being developed as we learn
    how to use the information provided in reflectance and emittance measurements
    with a range of sensors. Remote sensing continues to evolve as a valuable agronomic
    tool that provides information to scientists, consultants, and producers about
    the status of their crops. This area is still relatively new compared with other
    agronomic fields; however, the information content is providing valuable insights
    into improved management decisions. This article details the current status of
    our understanding of how reflectance and emittance have been used to quantitatively
    assess agronomic parameters and some of the challenges facing future generations
    of scientists seeking to further advance remote sensing for agronomic applications.

    when the American Society of Agronomy was formed. However, individuals at that
    time used their eyes and understanding of plants to provide qualitative assessments
    of vegetative characteristics, vigor, color, and so forth. The development of
    sensors to measure spectral reflectance or emittance created opportunities to
    quantitatively describe agronomic parameters and during the past 100 yr the application
    of remote sensing to agronomic problems created new methods for improved management
    of crops. Use of the visible and near-infrared portions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum for remote sensing have their roots in pioneering work by William Allen,
    David Gates, Harold Gausman, and Joseph Woolley, who provided much of the basic
    theory relating morphological characteristics of crop plants to their optical
    properties (Gates et al., 1965; Allen et al., 1969; Gausman et al., 1969a; Woolley,
    1971; Allen et al., 1973; Gausman, 1973, 1974; Gausman et al., 1971, 1974; Gausman,
    1977). High resolution spectral signatures of natural and cultivated species were
    presented as sources of information about normal plant growth and conditions caused
    by nutrient deficiency, pests, and abiotic stresses (Gausman and Allen, 1973;
    Gausman and Hart, 1974; Gausman et al., 1975a, 1976, 1978, 1981; Peynado et al.,
    1980). Research on the contributions of plant canopy architecture, solar illumination
    conditions and soil reflectance and emittance has further refined remote sensing
    as a tool for research and applications to agronomic problems (Suits, 1972; Tucker,
    1977; Bauer et al., 1986; Liang, 2004). A summary of the progress in remote sensing
    applied to agriculture was recently published in a collection of articles in Photogrammetric
    Engineering and Remote Sensing (volume 69). Sensor techniques were described by
    Barnes et al. (2003), hydrometeorological applications detailed by Kustas et al.
    (2003), crop management applications by Pinter et al. (2003), crop yield assessment
    by Doraiswamy et al. (2004), applications to rangeland assessment and management
    by Hunt et al. (2003), water quality assessment by Ritchie et al. (2003), and
    sensor development and correction methods was prepared by Moran et al. (2003)
    Another recent review of the application of remote sensing methods to dryland
    crops was developed by Hatfield et al. (2004) These articles provide a summary
    of efforts in more detail than is possible in this article, and the reader is
    referred to those efforts for more thorough reading. Instrumentation refinements
    and development of relationships between reflectance and plant responses have
    expanded our ability to quantify agronomic parameters. The basic principles of
    leaf and plant canopy reflectance have been incorporated into vegetative indices
    relating specific waveband combinations to various plant characteristics. Leaf
    emittance is related to leaf temperature, which has been extensively used to quantify
    plant stress and improve water management. Remote sensing uses more than visible,
    near-infrared, and thermal bands. Other portions of the electromagnetic radiation
    spectrum—for example, short-wave infrared (SWIR) and microwave—have been applied
    to agricultural problems. This article details the current status of our understanding
    of how reflectance and emittance have been used to quantitatively assess agronomic
    parameters and some of the challenges facing future generations of scientists
    seeking to further advance remote sensing for agronomic applications. Advances
    in the application of remote sensing principles to agronomy were made possible
    by first understanding the spectral responses of individual leaves and then applying
    that knowledge to canopies. Although, we tend to use vegetative indices (VIs)
    as commonplace tools for crop assessment today, it is instructive to first develop
    an understanding of the processes that occur at the leaf level and the information
    content of these signals. Throughout this article we link canopy level responses
    to reflectance and emittance as measured by passive systems. As it is not possible
    to cover every aspect of remote sensing, our focus will be on remote sensing of
    information useful for addressing agronomic applications. ASSESSMENT OF LEAF PIGMENTS
    AS THE BASIS OF REMOTE SENSING Knowledge of leaf and canopy reflectance has fostered
    development and applications of remote sensing for agriculture. Central to applications
    of remote sensing to agriculture are fundamental observations of the plant leaf
    and the extensions of these relationships to the canopy. Leaves contain chlorophyll,
    Chl a and Chl b, as essential pigments for the conversion of light energy to stored
    chemical energy. The amount of solar radiation absorbed by a leaf is a function
    of the photosynthetic pigment content. Thus, Chl content can directly determine
    photosynthetic potential and primary production (e.g., Curran et al., 1990; Filella
    et al., 1995). Additionally, Chl gives an indirect estimation of the nutrient
    status as considerable leaf N is incorporated in Chl (Filella et al., 1995; Moran
    et al., 2000). Leaf chlorophyll content is closely related to plant stress and
    senescence (Hendry et al., 1987; Merzlyak and Gitelson, 1995; Peñuelas and Filella,
    1998; Merzlyak et al., 1999; Carter and Knapp, 2001). Carotenoids as chlorophylls
    are the main pigments of green leaves. Several specific physiological functions
    have been attributed to carotenoids because of their unique physicochemical and
    photophysical properties: a structural role in the organization of photosynthetic
    membranes; participation in light harvesting, energy transfer, quenching of chlorophyll
    excited states and singlet oxygen; and interception of deleterious free oxygen
    and organic radicals. Changes of leaf carotenoid content and their proportion
    to Chl are widely used for diagnosing the physiological state of plants during
    development, senescence, acclimation, and adaptation to different environments
    and stresses (e.g., Demmig-Adams et al., 1996; Young and Britton, 1990). Anthocyanins
    are water-soluble vacuolar pigments of higher plants abundant in juvenile and
    senescing plants. Significant accumulation of anthocyanins in plant leaves is
    often induced as a result of environmental stresses, for example, strong sunlight,
    UV–B-irradiation, low temperature, drought, wounding, bacterial and fungal infections,
    N and P deficiencies, herbicides, and pollutants (e.g., Chalker-Scott, 1999).
    Since anthocyanins serve as indicators of stress for many plant species, their
    detection and quantitative assessment provides information about response and
    adaptation of plants to environmental stresses. Traditionally, pigment analysis
    is conducted using wet chemical leaf extraction methods with organic solvents
    and spectrophotometric determination in solution (e.g., Lichtenthaler, 1987).
    This extraction technique, long considered the standard method for Chl assessment,
    requires destructive sampling (thus preventing developmental studies of single
    leaves) and is time consuming. Hand-held Chl absorbance meters, of which several
    are available, measure leaf transmittance at two wavelengths in the red (∼660
    nm) and near infrared (NIR; ∼940 nm). The theoretical principles of these meters
    are described by Markwell et al. (1995) The application of reflectance spectroscopy
    to the estimation of leaf pigment content has recently received considerable attention.
    Vegetation indices that combine reflectance from a few spectral bands have been
    developed for pigment retrieval (e.g., Curran et al., 1990; Gitelson and Merzlyak,
    1994, 1996; Gitelson et al., 1996a, 1996b; Blackburn, 1998; Datt, 1998; Adams
    et al., 1999; Gamon and Surfus, 1999). The indices are based on knowledge of the
    reflectance properties of leaf biochemical components. More complete reviews of
    the practical and theoretical considerations of reflectance spectroscopy are given
    by Curran et al. (1990); Gamon and Surfus (1999); and Le Maire et al. (2004) Compared
    with hand-held Chl meters, which yield a single index value, reflectance spectroscopy
    offers a wealth of information. Besides Chl, the many wavelengths of reflectance
    spectroscopy provide the basis for calculating the content of other pigments.
    However, a key problem is selection of an appropriate index from among the vast
    array of those available. Chlorophyll Content Remote sensing tools have been constructed
    on the principal that pigment content strongly affects leaf absorption spectra
    (Fig. 1). With increased Chl content, visible wavelength absorption increases,
    reaching more than 90% in the blue (400–500 nm) region by both chlorophylls a
    and b and carotenoids and the red (∼670 nm) region where both chlorophylls absorb.
    Specific absorption coefficients of pigments are high for blue and red wavelengths,
    (e.g., Heath, 1969; Lichtenthaler, 1987) and the depth of light penetration into
    the leaf is very low (Kumar and Silva, 1973; Cui et al., 1991; Vogelmann et al.,
    1991; Vogelmann, 1993; Fukshansky et al., 1993; Merzlyak and Gitelson, 1995).
    As a result, even low amounts of pigments are sufficient to saturate absorption.
    For yellowish-green leaves when Chl exceeds 100 mg m−2, total absorption can exceed
    90%, depth of light penetration drastically decreases, and a further increase
    of pigment content does not cause increased total absorption (Fig. 1). Thus, the
    relationship of absorption vs. total Chl reaches a plateau, and absorption becomes
    virtually insensitive to further Chl increases (e.g., Thomas and Gausman, 1977;
    Gausman, 1984; Chappelle et al., 1992; Buschmann and Nagel, 1993; Gitelson and
    Merzlyak, 1994, Gamon and Surfus, 1999). The closer the wavelength is to the main
    absorption wavelength of pigments (blue or red), the lower the Chl content at
    which saturation of absorption vs. Chl relationship appears. Figure 1 Open in
    figure viewer Absorption spectra of maize leaves. For the green (∼550 nm) and
    red edge (∼700 nm) regions, the absorption coefficient of chlorophylls in extract
    is very low and seldom exceeds 6% of that for blue and red (e.g., Lichtenthaler,
    1987); however, green leaves absorb more than 80% of incident light in these spectral
    ranges (e.g., Moss and Loomis, 1952; Heath, 1969; Gausman et al., 1969b; Gausman
    and Allen, 1973; Gitelson and Merzlyak, 1994). For green and red edge wavelengths,
    depth of light penetration into the leaf was found to be four- to six-fold higher
    than for the blue and red (e.g., Fukshansky et al., 1993; Fig. 2 in Merzlyak and
    Gitelson, 1995). Therefore, sensitivity of absorption to Chl content is much higher
    in these spectral regions than for the blue and red. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer
    Reflectance spectra of maize leaves and standard deviation of reflectance. Visible
    wavelength leaf reflectance decreases with increasing leaf greenness/Chl content
    (Fig. 2). While leaf color may vary from yellow-green to dark-green, blue reflectance
    is virtually insensitive to leaf greenness, typically remaining below 7%. With
    increases of Chl from 50 to 100 mg m−2 (yellow to yellow-green leaves), red reflectance
    decreases and when Chl > 100 mg m−2, red reflectance does not change much with
    further increases of Chl (Fig. 3). Only reflectance in the green and the red edge
    ranges are sensitive to the whole range of Chl variation (Fig. 3); the standard
    deviation of reflectance (STD) has the highest values in the green between 530
    and 590 nm and in the red edge around 710 nm (Fig. 2). Reflectance varies slightly
    in the NIR mainly due to leaf internal structure and thickness changes. Figure
    3 Open in figure viewer Reflectance in the blue, green, red, red edge, and NIR
    ranges plotted vs. total Chl content in maize leaves. Thus, common spectral features
    of leaf absorption and reflectance are: (i) minimum sensitivity to pigment content
    in the blue between 400 and 500 nm and in the NIR; (ii) both absorption and reflectance
    of leaves with moderate to high Chl are essentially insensitive to Chl content
    in the red absorption band of chlorophyll a near 670 nm; (iii) the green and red
    edge reflectances are related very closely hyperbolically for a wide range of
    leaf greenness (Chappelle et al., 1992; Gitelson and Merzlyak, 1994); and (iv)
    the highest sensitivity of reflectance and absorption to pigment variation is
    in the green from 530 to 590 nm and in the red edge around 700 nm (Fig. 1, 2,
    3, and 4). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer Root mean square error of Chl estimation
    using chlorophyll index in the form CIλ = (RNIR/Rλ – 1) in maize leaves plotted
    vs. wavelength λ when leaf Chl ranged from 10 to 800 mg/m2 These fundamental spectral
    features of absorption and reflectance are widely recognized (Thomas and Gausman,
    1977; Gausman, 1984; Chappelle et al., 1992; Buschmann and Nagel, 1993; Gitelson
    and Merzlyak, 1994, 1996, Gitelson et al., 1996a, 2003a) and are why algorithms
    for nondestructive chlorophyll retrieval are not based on Chl maximum absorption
    wavelengths. Indices composed of Chl maximum absorption wavelengths would rapidly
    saturate, even with low chlorophyll concentrations. Moreover, other pigments also
    absorb in the blue region (e.g., Blackburn, 1998; Gitelson et al., 1996a, 2002a;
    Mariotti et al., 1996). These wavelengths place a severe limitation on their exclusive
    use to quantify plant response to stress. Use of green and red edge wavelengths
    avoid saturation and the accompanying loss of sensitivity to Chl, and are usually
    preferred because reflectances are more sensitive to moderate to high chlorophyll
    content. Indices based at these spectral bands were proposed and used to estimate
    Chl content in the leaves of various plant species (Chappelle et al., 1992; Gitelson
    and Merzlyak, 1994, 1996; Gitelson et al., 1996a, 1996b, 2003a; 1999; Lichtenthaler
    et al., 1996; Gamon and Surfus, 1999; Sims and Gamon, 2002; Richardson et al.,
    2002; Le Maire et al., 2004). Carotenoids and Anthocyanin Content Carotenoids
    content (Car) estimation is more difficult than Chl estimation. Chappelle et al.
    (1992) used ratio analysis of reflectance spectra to find a spectral band sensitive
    to pigment content. They recommended using a ratio R760/R500, where R760 and R500
    are the reflectances at 760 and 500 nm, respectively, as a quantitative measure
    of Car. Blackburn (1998) suggested that the optimal waveband for Car estimation
    is located at 470 nm and used so-called the pigment-specific ratio R800/R470 and
    a pigment-specific normalized difference (R800 – R470)/(R800 + R470) for Car content
    retrieval. Penuelas et al. (1995) proposed using a structure-insensitive pigment
    index (SIPI) = (R800 – R445)/(R800 – R680). Sims and Gamon (2002) tested the above
    indices and have found none provided a significant correlation across the whole
    range of carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios. Total carotenoid content was closely related
    to total Chl content and the Chl indices were the best predictors of total Car
    content (Fig. 5). However, within the general relationship between Car and Chl
    there was substantial variation of the Car/Chl ratio. They recommended the Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI) = (R570 – R531)/(R570 + R531) (Gamon et al., 1992) as
    a proxy of Car/Chl ratio. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Relationships between
    estimated and actually measured Chl content in maize leaves using chlorophyll
    Indices CIred edge = (RNIR/Rred edge) – 1 and CIgreen = (RNIR/Rgreen) – 1 where
    green band is between 540 and 560 nm and red edge band is between 705 and 725
    nm (Gitelson et al., 2003a, 2005). For anthocyanin (Anth) estimation, Gamon and
    Surfus (1999) used a ratio of red to green reflectances R600–700/R500–600 However,
    Sims and Gamon (2002) concluded, “estimation of carotenoid and anthocyanin contents
    remains more difficult than estimation of chlorophyll content.” A problem with
    estimating pigment content using two-band indices is that a two-band index is
    confounded by other factors such as absorption by other pigments and leaf scattering,
    which also influence apparent leaf reflectance at the two wavelengths. A new approach
    to estimate total Chl, Car, and Anth content in higher plant leaves was developed
    and tested for leaves from a number of crop and tree species (Gitelson et al.,
    2003a, 2006a). Conceptual model relates reflectances in three wavebands to content
    of the pigment content of interest (Cpigment). Reflectance in the first band λ1
    was maximally sensitive to pigment of interest: Chl in the red edge around 700
    nm (for Anth-containing and Anth-free leaves) and green around 550 nm for Anth
    free leaves (Gitelson et al., 2003a), Car at 510 nm (Gitelson et al., 2002a),
    and Anth at 550 nm (Gitelson et al., 2001). However, R(λ1) was also affected by
    absorption by other pigments and leaf scattering. Reflectance R(λ2) was maximally
    sensitive to absorption by other pigments; thus, the difference R(λ1)−1 – R(λ)−1
    was related closely to the pigment of interest but affected by leaf scattering.
    The third reflectance R(λ3), where λ3 was in the NIR range, was closely related
    to leaf scattering. Tuning spectral bands in accord with spectral properties of
    pigment of interest, optimal spectral bands λ1, λ2, and λ3 were found for each
    pigment estimate (Table 1). Table 1. Spectral bands for retrieving pigment content
    from leaf reflectance spectra using the model [R(λ1)−1 – R(λ2)−1] × R(λ3) ∞ Cpigment.
    For Anth-free leaves (Anth < 3 mg m−2), both the green and red edge bands can
    be used as λ1 while for Anth-containing leaves only red edge band can be used
    as λ1. For carotenoids estimation both the green and red edge bands can be used
    as λ2. Pigment λ1 λ2 λ3 Chlorophylls, Anth-free Chlorophylls, Anth-free 540–560

    been developed to relate reflectance from leaves or canopies with canopy characteristics.
    There are a range of VIs that have been developed during the past 40 yr. Hatfield
    et al. (2004) summarized the development of VIs and their application to crop
    canopies. Many of the common ones are listed in Table 2 and the application of
    these will be summarized in the next section. At the canopy level, the changes
    of canopy reflectance are the largest in the near-infrared wavelengths throughout
    the growing season due to increase of biomass and, thus, scattering, whereas the
    visible portions of the spectrum show less, but significant, seasonal variation
    that relates to absorption of light by photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments
    (Fig. 6). Development of VIs can be traced back to Jordan (1969), who related
    the ratio of NIR (800 nm) to red (675 nm) reflectance (NIR/RED) to LAI. As a refinement,
    Tucker (1979) proposed a Difference Vegetative Index (DVI) as NIR-RED as a measure
    of vegetation changes over large areas and increased the confidence that VIs could
    be effectively used for large-scale assessment of crop canopies. Many of the current
    VIs are based on broad wavebands closely associated with the four LANDSAT satellite
    multispectral scanner wavebands. Jackson and Huete (1991) stated that the purpose
    of VIs was to enhance the vegetation signal while minimizing the solar irradiance
    and soil background effects. Many current VIs have their foundation in leaf reflectance
    and understanding how these reflectance indices relate to canopy parameters will
    help strengthen our future efforts to refine and apply VIs to agronomic problems.
    The trend toward use of narrow-band hyperspectral indices is fostering a refinement
    of VIs and will increase our ability to exploit the information content of detailed
    leaf spectra. Part of this evolution is the wide use the red edge band and the
    extension beyond visible and near-infrared wavebands into the SWIR regions. The
    power of indices incorporating SWIR wavebands is yet to be realized. Table 2.

    RETRIEVING AGRONOMIC PARAMETERS FROM PLANT CANOPIES Retrieval of plant canopy
    agronomic parameters poses a different problem from that of the retrieval of plant
    leaf parameters. Plant canopy reflectance integrates the contributions of leaf
    optical properties; reflectance of underlying surfaces such as soil, plant litter,
    and weeds; and plant canopy architecture (Gausman et al., 1975b; Norman et al.,
    1985; Verhoef, 1984; Norman and Welles, 1983). Plant canopy architecture is quantified
    in radiative transfer models (RT) as LAI, percentage vegetative cover, and leaf
    angle distribution (LAD) (Goel, 1988; Liang and Strahler, 2000; Liang, 2004).
    Illumination conditions, including the amount of direct vs. diffuse incoming solar
    radiation, and solar zenith and azimuth angles are important as these govern the
    amount and intensity of shadowing within the canopy. The cumulative effect of
    these additional factors is that transfer of information from leaf reflectance
    to canopy reflectance is nonlinear. View angle considerations are important when
    viewing off-nadir, including situations where wide view angle swath widths are
    used to maximize ground area coverage. The bidirectional reflectance distribution
    function (BRDF), a fundamental quantity describing the reflectance from a surface
    from all possible viewing angles under all possible illumination conditions, has
    seen considerable study for plants and soils (Liang and Strahler, 2000; Walthall
    et al., 1985) and can be approached as a source of information as well as a source
    of noise to be removed from remotely sensed data The most widely used VI is the
    Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) proposed by Deering (1978) that
    now serves as somewhat of a benchmark for researchers developing new VIs. The
    NDVI has been shown to be strongly related to light interception (Hatfield et
    al., 1984a; Redelfs et al., 1987; Richardson et al., 1992; Sellers, 1987; Serrano
    et al., 2000; Verma et al., 1992; Wiegand and Hatfield, 1988; Wiegand et al.,
    1990, 1992; Russel et al., 1995). Interference from underlying soil reflectance,
    especially for incomplete canopy cover, has been a weakness for many VIs. The
    reflectance line for the soil (day of year 150) shown in Fig. 6 reveals a fairly
    linear relationship across the wavelengths compared with the changes as the canopy
    develops. Agronomic systems occur on many different soils and accounting for these
    differences provides confidence in being able to apply VIs to different regions.
    Minimizing the soil background effect has been accomplished by a number of methods.
    Kauth and Thomas (1976) proposed a linear combination of four wavebands using
    principal component analyses to estimate brightness, greenness, yellowness, and
    other components. The brightness term represents the magnitude of the reflected
    energy and could be considered a soil background line. The greenness term represents
    an orthogonal plane to the soil line that contained information about vegetation
    and represents yellowness—an additional plane to both soils and vegetation with
    particular sensitivity to senescent vegetation. Jackson (1983) described how spectral
    indices could be obtained from combinations of wavebands in n-space. Another attempt
    to remove soil background was the Perpendicular Vegetative Index (PVI) developed
    by Richardson and Wiegand (1977) using a statistical relationship. A review of
    the refinements of ratio-based VIs to account for soil background through a soil-adjusted
    vegetative index (SAVI) was described by Huete (1988) Many of the soil background
    adjustment approaches have been accomplished through the use of vegetative indices
    in which the coefficients were derived from empirical studies. Rondeaux et al.
    (1996) proposed an Optimized SAVI (OSAVI) in which the “l” term (an adjustment
    factor for soil reflectance), was equal to 0.16. An additional adjustment for
    soil background to the NDVI was developed by Baret et al. (1989) and expressed
    as the Transformed Soil Adjusted Vegetative Index (TSAVI). An atmospherically
    resistant VI, (ARVI), was proposed for the use of satellite data (Kaufman and
    Tanré, 1992), and further modified by Huete et al. (1997) to make the soil adjusted
    (SARVI2). Recently, a suite of algorithms was developed for accurate estimation
    of crop biophysical characteristics. The suite includes algorithms for retrieval
    of crop green vegetation fraction (VF), fraction of PAR absorbed by photosynthetically
    active vegetation (fAPARPH), green leaf area index (GLAI), green leaf biomass,
    total Chl content, and gross primary production (GPP) (Wiegand and Richardson,
    1984, Wiegand et al., 1979). Detecting changes of growth and development or yield
    across different species, growing seasons, or locations requires methods that
    utilize the same wavebands or patterns (Shanahan et al., 2001). Daughtry et al.
    (2000) combined VIs minimizing background reflectance contributions with VIs responding
    more to leaf Chl content in a simulation study to produce isolines of leaf Chl
    content. A limited test of the concept using canopy reflectance data showed that
    the slopes of the VI pairs were linearly related to leaf Chl content over a wide
    range of foliage cover and background reflectances. Leaf area index (LAI), Chl
    content, and biomass are important crop biophysical characteristics used for climate
    modeling, estimating primary production, and forecasting crop yield. Algorithms
    for green LAI and green leaf biomass estimation (Green Leaf Area Vegetation Index),
    are summarized in Gitelson et al. (2003b; 2005). These algorithms, which have
    been tested in maize (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and wheat
    (Triticum aestivum L.), allow accurate prediction of GLAI ranging from 0 to more
    than 6 m2 m−2 with RMSE of GLAI prediction of less that 0.6 m2 m−2 The same algorithms
    were parameterized for remote assessment of green leaf biomass (Gitelson et al.,
    2003b) and total Chl content in irrigated and rainfed maize and soybean (Gitelson
    et al., 2005). The algorithm accounted for more than 98% of green leaf biomass
    variation in the range from 100 to more than 3000 kg ha−1 When applied for total
    Chl estimation in crops, the algorithm accounted for more than 92% of Chlt variation
    in both soybean and maize. However, in discrete spectral bands 540 to 560 nm and
    700 to 710 nm the calibration coefficients in both algorithms remained species-specific.
    Difference between species was more pronounced in the green than the red-edge
    model (Fig. 6 in Gitelson et al., 2005). Such behavior is understandable, if one
    takes into account very contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures of
    maize and soybean. A spectral range, where the algorithm is non-species specific,
    has been found applying a procedure that tuned spectral bands in the model in
    accord with spectral characteristics of the media (Gitelson et al., 2003a, 2006a).
    The algorithm [(R840–870/R720–730) – 1] predicted total Chl in maize and soybean
    ranged from 0.03 to 4.33 g m−2 with a RMSE of less than 0.32 g m−2 for both species
    considered together. During subsequent work, Gitelson et al. (2006b) found that
    GPP relates closely to total chlorophyll content in maize and soybean. Total Chl
    accounts for more than 98% of GPP ranged from 0 to 3.1 mg CO2 m−2 s−1 The algorithm
    for GPP estimation (Gitelson et al., 2003c, 2006b) provided accurate estimates
    of midday GPP in both crops under rainfed and irrigated conditions with RMSE of
    GPP estimation of less than 0.3 mg CO2 m−2 s−1 in maize (GPP ranged from 0 to
    3.1 mg CO2 m−2 s−1) and less than 0.2 mg CO2 m−2 s−1 in soybean (GPP ranged from
    0 to 1.8 mg CO2 m−2 s−1). Validation using independent data sets for irrigated
    and rainfed maize showed robustness of the technique; RMSE of GPP prediction was
    less than 0.27 mg CO2 m−2 s−1 Quantification of vegetation stress using reflectance
    with current multispectral methods has shown limitations. Campbell et al. (2007)
    suggested that improvements could be achieved by using hyperspectral and fluorescence
    methods. They evaluated nitrogen, carbon dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation
    stresses on corn, soybean, and red maple (Acer rubra L.) and found that combinations
    of fluorescence and reflectance at specific wavebands improved the ability to
    detect these stresses. The continued advancement of the use of various wavelengths
    offers the potential to provide valuable information for agronomists to detect
    vegetation stress. APPLICATIONS TO AGRONOMIC PROBLEMS Nitrogen Nitrogen is an
    essential nutrient for modern crop production; however, N is often over-applied
    without regard to crop requirements or potential environmental risk to ensure
    that acceptable crop yields are achieved. Increased N management has been shown
    to reduce N applications while maintaining or increasing crop yields. Early methods
    for N management have used the Soil-Plant Analyses Development (SPAD) chlorophyll
    meter, color photography, or canopy reflectance factors to assess N variations
    across grower''s corn fields (Schepers et al., 1992, 1996; Blackmer et al., 1993,
    1994, 1996a, 1996b; Blackmer and Schepers, 1996; Shanahan et al., 2003). These
    techniques were based on comparisons with readings obtained from an adequately
    fertilized strip in the same field and eliminated the requirements for prior knowledge
    of the relationship between nutrient concentration and crop reflectance. An example
    of a direct method for N management was developed Bausch and Duke (1996) based
    on a N reflectance index (NRI) derived from green and NIR reflectance of an irrigated
    corn crop. The NRI was highly correlated with an N sufficiency index calculated
    from SPAD chlorophyll meter data and provided a rapid assessment of corn plant
    N status for mapping purposes a the field scale. Monitoring in-season plant N
    with the NRI reduced applied N via fertigation by 39 kg N ha−1 without reducing
    grain yield (Bausch and Diker, 2001). A more indirect approach was proposed by
    Raun et al. (2001), who found midseason estimates of potential yield winter wheat
    would help growers adjust topdress N applications. Their approach was based on
    preplant soil N tests, within season rates of mineralization, and projected N
    removal. Potential grain yields were estimated from several post-dormancy NDVI
    measurements normalized by the number of growing degree days accumulated between
    the observation dates. This adjusted for local weather and compensated for spatial
    variations in N requirements caused by soil differences and management, for example,
    stand establishment and early season growth. Phosphorus Phosphorus deficiency
    in plants can be expressed through color and biomass accumulation. Young plants
    growing in cold soils are the most likely to exhibit P deficiency symptoms, which
    are purple leaves in the case of corn. Colder soil temperatures limit root exploration,
    which is why starter fertilizer application at planting time is common for early
    seeded corn. Corn planted on the same soil after the soil has warmed up is not
    nearly as likely to show symptoms of P deficiency as that planted in colder soils.
    Plants frequently grow out of the early symptoms of a P deficiency (i.e., purplish
    leaves) but the effects may linger in terms of N and P concentration in vegetative
    tissue and yield. Osborne et al. (2004) showed that P deficiency in corn was significantly
    correlated with NIR and blue reflectance in high-resolution aircraft imagery in
    Nebraska. Imagery was frequently less likely to detect P deficiency at silking
    than it was at the 6 to 8 leaf stage of corn. The obvious difficulty encountered
    with early season imagery of crops is dilution with soil background reflectance.
    Real-time active sensors that monitor the appropriate wavebands offer an opportunity
    to use the crop as a bio-indicator of soil P availability. Such sensors mounted
    on field equipment could generate a map to guide soil sampling or would allow
    on-the-go variable-rate application of nutrients, assuming the causes of the plant
    symptoms are known. Soil Moisture Soil moisture has been a problem of critical
    importance in agronomic decisions and there have been many different attempts
    to directly measure soil moisture from remote sensing. Microwave with wavelengths
    around 21 cm has been used as the most common approach. Jackson and Schmugge (1989)
    described the use of passive microwave as a tool for measuring and mapping soil
    water content of the surface layer. Microwave wavelengths are capable of detecting
    soil moisture because of the large differences in the dielectric properties of
    water compared to other soil components. Sensing of soil moisture in the surface
    layer is a function of the wavelength and Jackson and Schmugge (1989) proposed
    that for the L band (21 cm) the effective depth of detecting soil moisture would
    be approximately 5 cm. One of the problems with passive microwave systems is the
    relatively large footprint and for the L band system the spatial resolution may
    be on the order of 100 km. This limits the ability to detect soil moisture in
    a specific field using a satellite-based approach. However, one advantage of microwave
    over all other remote sensing wavebands is the ability of these wavelengths to
    penetrate through clouds. Retrieval of soil water content from passive microwave
    systems requires the following factors be addressed: the brightness temperature
    be normalized to emissivity, the effects or interference of vegetation above the
    soil surface be removed, adjustments for the soil roughness effects on brightness
    temperature be made, a relationship exist between soil dielectric properties and
    emissivity, and a relationship exists between soil dielectric properties and soil
    water content. As an illustration of the integration of various remote sensing
    parameters, Jackson et al. (1999) proposed using the NDVI to adjust the microwave
    signals for canopy density. One of the major problems in using microwave for soil
    water is the interference of the vegetative water content, and Jackson et al.
    (2004) compared the NDVI with the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), which
    is defined as (RNIR – RSWIR)/(RNIR + RSWIR). This index uses the SWIR wavebands
    to define the water content of the vegetation and showed a more robust relationship
    to vegetative water content than NDVI. There continues to be advances in the development
    of sensors. For example, LaVine et al. (1994) demonstrated that synthetic aperature
    microwave radiometers could reduce the footprint size down to 10 km. Further advances
    in technology may provide further reductions from satellite systems and provide
    real-time measurements of surface soil water content for inclusion in agronomic
    applications. EMITTANCE FROM CANOPIES AND CROP WATER STRESS Emittance from crop
    canopies is related to the temperature of the crop through the Stefan-Boltzman
    law where emittance is a function of the fourth power of surface temperature.
    Measurement of surface temperatures with infrared thermometers has become routine
    and offer the potential for crop water stress detection and water management.
    A summary of the history of measuring crop stress using the thermal (8–4 μm) portion
    of the spectrum provides a glimpse into the potential applications of these data.
    The foundation for the current research can be traced to original observations
    by Tanner (1963), who found that plant temperature varied from air temperature
    and could be measured with thermocouples attached to the leaves. This was expanded
    to quantify the relationship among plant water stress, solar radiation, air temperature,
    and leaf temperature by Wiegand and Namken (1966) Wiegand and Namken (1966) and
    Ehler et al. (1978) provided the original observations that leaf temperature was
    related to plant moisture status. These findings prompted studies over the past
    40 yr to quantify crop stress and estimate water use based on observations of
    canopy temperature. Indices were developed for crop stress in a similar fashion
    to the VIs using terms such as stress degree day (SDD), Crop Water Stress Index,
    non-water-stressed baselines, thermal kinetic windows, crop specific temperatures,
    and Water Deficit Index appeared as quantitative measures of plant stress (Table
    3). These advances were made possible by the development of affordable and reliable
    infrared thermometers that accurately measured canopy temperature without direct
    physical contact between the leaf and the thermometer. Table 3. Summary of selected
    thermal indices, wavebands, applications, and citations. Thermal Index Application

    Development of canopy temperature stress indices can be traced to Jackson et al.
    (1977), who found that canopy temperatures in wheat were a useful measure of crop
    water status. Variation of canopy–air temperature differences (Tc – Ta) difference
    across crops and climates invoked a team of researchers led by Idso et al. (1981)
    to derive an empirical model for canopy stress, whereas Jackson et al. (1981)
    derived the more theoretical relationship between canopy temperature and crop
    stress. The critical relationship to define CWSI is the nonstressed lower baseline
    and is derived from the curves as per Table 3 (Jackson et al., 1981). The Crop
    Water Stress Index (CWSI) has become one of the more widely used methods for quantifying
    crop stress. This approach has prompted a number of studies to evaluate the potential
    measurement problems in obtaining accurate values for all of the parameters needed
    to estimate CWSI (Gardner et al., 1992a, 1992b). Wanjura et al. (1990) found CWSI
    values were negatively correlated with grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]
    and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yields with grain sorghum yields showing a
    higher sensitivity to CWSI than cotton lint yields. Variation among years was
    accounted for by normalizing each year relative to maximum yield for the location.
    Feldhake and Edwards (1992) used the CWSI concept to quantify water stress on
    orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) in the humid pasture areas of the United
    States. Wanjura and Upchurch (2000) compared the empirical (Idso et al., 1981)
    and theoretical CWSI (Jackson et al., 1981) for corn and cotton on the High Plains
    of Texas and found the empirical approach was slightly more accurate than the
    theoretical approach because of the bounds of 0 to 1.0 placed by the empirical
    method. Studies have shown that the simple SDD (midday air temperature–canopy
    temperature) were related to crop yield, for example, kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris
    L., Walker and Hatfield, 1979) and pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp., Patel
    et al., 2001]. These are only a few of the number of studies that have been conducted
    using this simple model. Fundamental differences in the empirical approach must
    be recognized before these approaches can be used. As an example, comparison of
    the non-water-stressed baseline for 50 cotton strains revealed significant differences
    among strains (Hatfield et al., 1987). The genetic variation that exists in the
    relationship between water deficits and canopy temperature responses suggested
    that this approach could be used as a screening tool for genetic response to water
    stress. Genetic variations may create problems when applying this method to different
    canopies and care should be exercised in universally extending these relationships
    without first verifying the Tc response for a range of canopy water deficits.
    For areas with significant crop stress, such as those found in dryland environments,
    there has been the continuing problem of measuring canopy temperature under conditions
    of incomplete or partial ground cover (Hall et al., 1992; Vining and Blad, 1992).
    Heilman et al. (1981) demonstrated that incomplete groundcover provided a significant
    bias when estimating the true canopy temperature. This has been one of the major
    limitations of applying thermal infrared measurements to dryland canopies. Carlson
    et al. (1994) developed a method that incorporated thermal infrared measurements
    with NDVI to estimate soil water content and vegetation cover. Moran et al. (1994)
    developed a relationship referred to as the Water Deficit Index (WDI) that extended
    the CWSI theory to partially covered fields by using SAVI as a measure of canopy
    cover. Development of the trapezoid that covers the range of well-watered to completely
    stressed vegetation across the range of canopy sizes is based on the ratio of
    actual to potential evaporation, the same foundation as the CWSI. This approach
    offers potential as a method for quantifying water stress under conditions of
    partial cover. A recent study by DeTar et al. (2006) coupled CWSI with NDVI to
    measure water stress in full canopy cotton and found a good relationship using
    NDVI values derived using 686 and 850 nm wavebands. These approaches are different
    than the integration of VIs and thermal radiance into a yield prediction model
    developed by Hatfield (1983) Hatfield (1983) derived an estimate of biomass at
    the onset of the reproductive stage by VI and then a Tc–derived measure of stress
    used to determine whether the plant was able to maintain optimal growing conditions
    during grain-filling by measuring the thermal stress of the crop. The premise
    of this approach is based on the observation that the faster the rate of decline
    of VIs during grain-filling, the lower the yield caused by hastened phenological
    development. Confounding the observations of canopy temperature in wheat during
    grain-filling was caused by the presence of the panicles because the nontranspiring
    panicle at the top of the canopy artificially increased the canopy temperature
    (Hatfield et al., 1984d). In nonwater stressed canopy, the presence of the panicles
    increased the observed canopy temperature by 2°C when viewed at an oblique angle.
    Increasing the angle of measurement from nadir provided a solution for this bias;
    however, users of this technology need to be aware of the potential biases due
    to canopy morphology. Many crops have morphological features present at the top
    of the canopy and a bias may be introduced into canopy temperature based methods.
    A further complication may occur due to the anisotropy of canopy temperatures
    when the canopy is viewed from different angles. These differences can be as large
    as 3 to 5°C, introducing another source of variation into canopy temperature observations
    particularly when measurements are taken at acute angles (Paw U et al., 1989).
    Onset of water stress has been detected through observations of the variation
    of canopy temperatures within a field. Heermann and Duke (1978) found that when
    the foliage temperature was 1.5°C above air temperature irrigation of maize was
    needed, which formed a reliable index to determine irrigation timing. Hatfield
    et al. (1984c) evaluated canopy temperature variability patterns in grain sorghum
    and found that when the standard deviation of canopy temperature was less than
    0.7°C, less than 50% of available soil water was removed from the upper 1.5-m
    profile. The variance of canopy temperature increased linearly when soil water
    extraction increased above 50% of the available soil water. Bryant and Moran (1999)
    adopted a slightly different method based on the histogram of canopy temperatures
    using the mean and standard deviation. They found that recently irrigated fields
    had histograms with a normal distribution whereas stressed fields deviate from
    this pattern. The variability techniques have potential for aircraft and high
    resolution satellite data as management tools. One valuable application of canopy
    or surface temperature is the direct inclusion of these temperatures into energy
    balance models to estimate evapotranspiration (ET). Evapotranspiration estimates
    provide a sound approach for measuring crop water requirements (Hatfield et al.,
    1984b). Zhang et al. (1995) showed the remote sensing model closely compared to
    area ET averages obtained from ground-based stations. Evapotranspiration is one
    of the critical energy balance components utilized in crop growth models and estimation
    of ET over large areas would help in crop yield estimation. In crop water use
    models, crop coefficients are required inputs that can be obtained from remotely
    sensed observations of reflectance related to canopy development (Bausch and Neale,
    1989). This application uses a VI to derive a crop coefficient; however, this
    method couples standard meteorological data with more infrequent observations
    of the canopy to complement the remote sensing observations. One of the major
    problems encountered when using single-source models occurs when there is a partial
    canopy-covered surface (Kustas et al., 1989; Hall et al., 1992; Vining and Blad,
    1992). Single-source approaches treat the soil–canopy system as a single layer
    or source of energy exchange. A single-source model cannot accommodate the differences
    in atmospheric coupling associated with the soil or canopy components of the scene
    (Norman and Becker, 1995). Two-source approaches, which consider separately the
    flux contributions from the soil and canopy components, improve the ability to
    estimate fluxes over a wide range of vegetation cover conditions (e.g., Norman
    et al., 1995, 2000; Kustas and Norman, 1999). Use of canopy or surface temperatures
    as direct inputs into large-scale ET models provides a spatial representation
    of water use that is not possible with single energy balance systems. Refinement
    of regional scale models using remote sensing requires an integration of several
    remote sensing and ground-based observations. Anderson et al. (2004) showed that
    canopy biophysical properties, for example, LAI, canopy height, and vegetation
    water content, could be obtained from NDWI and OSAVI indices over regional scale
    studies with an accuracy in LAI of 0.6 and canopy height of 0.2 m. One of the
    problems of these observations is that the vegetation is not distributed uniformly
    and the nonrandom effects of vegetative cover on the regional scale energy exchanges
    have been addressed through an approach using a scaling method called DisALEXI
    (Disaggregation Atmosphere–Land Exchange Inverse) that disaggregates 5-km regional
    output to the Landsat TM resolution (Anderson et al., 2005). Anderson et al. (2007)
    developed a multiscale approach that uses thermal, visible, and near-infrared
    imagery from multiple satellites to partition the fluxes between the soil and
    canopy. They developed an approach with the ability to map fluxes at a range of
    scales from 1 m to 10 km that has the potential of being able to assess the representativeness
    of sensor placement across complex landscapes. The evolution of this type of method
    shows the further refinement in the ability to use remote sensing as an assessment
    tool for ground-based observations as well as a method for regional scale measurements.
    METHODS FOR EMPLOYING REMOTE SENSING Methods for remote sensing of agronomic parameters
    include: (i) empirical (parametric statistic) correlations between surface-measured
    parameters and VIs, (ii) inversion of the agronomic parameter from physically
    based canopy reflectance models, and (iii) estimation using a neural network (NN).
    The results from these methods vary by scale of observation, type of vegetation,
    spectral bands, and the sophistication of the models. Each procedure requires
    optimization for a specific geographic location, the vegetation type, and the
    illumination conditions for the time of data acquisition. The simplest approach
    uses a regression equation between the VI and the parameter of interest calibrated
    with in situ measurements of the parameter. The number and location of the calibration
    samples can affect the performance of the procedure. Each approach has its disadvantages.
    Parameter retrieval using empirical approaches tend to be time and space-specific.
    Empirical relationships are valid only under conditions similar to those at the
    time the correlation was established. The relationship may break down if the solar
    and viewing geometries, soil background, Chl concentrations, canopy architecture,
    or moisture conditions are different, and in situ calibration measurements over
    large areas are impractical (Jacquemoud et al., 1995). Retrieval of parameters
    through numerical inversion of physically based canopy reflectance models is computationally
    intensive when applied to each sensor reading (typically a pixel). There is no
    universally applicable canopy reflectance model for all vegetation types, and
    thus model selection is often a compromise between model complexity, invertability,
    and computational efficiency (Goel, 1989; Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990; Jacquemoud
    et al., 1995). One-dimensional radiative transfer models have been shown to work
    well for inversion despite the tendency to oversimplify. The Scattering by Arbitrarily
    Inclined Leaves (SAIL; Verhoef, 1984) model has been used for inversion of LAI
    (a user-friendly version can be found at http://ars.usda.gov/services/software/download.htm?softwareid=12&modecode=12-65-06-00;
    verified 22 Jan. 2008). Problems with inversions include lack of convergence,
    sensitivity of results to initializing values, and difficulty estimating model
    input parameters that are challenging to obtain or cannot be directly measured.
    Neural network approaches have not been generalized to handle all wavelength and
    viewing condition combinations (Fang and Liang, 2003; Kimes et al., 1998). Observations
    that are used to train the NN must encompass the expected range of values for
    the area of interest. The availability of a large, surface-measured, high quality,
    vegetation data set is therefore necessary for the validation of the NN approach
    over large areas. An advantage of the NN approach is that it allows the use of
    complex, detailed models otherwise cumbersome for traditional inversion because
    of slow computational times (Jacquemoud et al., 1995). Further, NN approaches
    are not as affected by initial choices as traditional model inversion approaches
    are, nor are they as computationally intensive as traditional techniques. Forward
    runs of the NN are fast once NN training is completed. Other variations of these
    approaches include within-scene scaling of an SVI that yields LAI directly as
    a function of the fraction of vegetation cover (Choudhury et al., 1994; Campbell
    and Norman, 1998) and a hybrid radiative transfer-neural network (RT-NN) approach
    (Fang and Liang, 2003). Both the scaled NDVI and the hybrid method offer the advantages
    of requiring little or no in situ calibration measurements. Plots of estimated
    vs. measured LAI appear to suggest that the calibrated methods, such as regression,
    better estimate the full range of LAI values while the uncalibrated methods such
    as the scaled NDVI and the hybrid RT-NN method perform reasonably well for midrange
    LAI values and show less consistent estimation of higher and lower LAI values.
    While not performing as well as the SVI approaches, the hybrid RT-NN results are
    still impressive, given that site-specific data for calibration are not required
    (Walthall et al., 2004). An application of remote sensing for current agronomic
    problems is the use of VIs simulated from plant growth models and then compared
    with remotely sensed observations as detailed by Ko et al. (2006) This type of
    approach provides a framework for using remotes sensing as either a calibration
    tool for plant growth models or as a direct input. CHALLENGES The major challenge
    for remote sensing researchers is to fully realize the potential of remote sensing
    as a source of useful information that can be used for agronomic management decisions.
    This requires an expansion of our knowledge base of the agronomic information
    content of remote sensing data, and algorithmic innovations for exploiting such
    data. We offer the following suggestions and perspectives for future research
    directions: There is a need to expand our understanding of the information content
    of remotely sensed data. As previously stated, SWIR, TIR, and microwave regions
    are especially attractive as topics for new investigations. The requirement that
    both leaf-level information and canopy-level information content be addressed
    is paramount to developing a more complete realization of the potential of these
    wavelengths. There is a need to refine agronomic information retrieval algorithms
    so that they can be extended through space (within fields, across landscapes and
    regions, at different geographic locales, under differing climates, etc.) and
    time (at different times within a growing season, among growing seasons, at different
    times of the day, etc.). Currently, when conducting agronomic parameter retrieval,
    stratification of the landscape by crop type is often used, thus suggesting that
    some algorithms may require optimization of spectral bands for specific crops.
    There is a need to quantify the error bars associated with agronomic parameter
    retrieval using remote sensing. An understanding of the error associated with
    remote sensing-based retrieval of agronomic information will better define optimal
    conditions for its use. Part of this challenge is the need to better understand
    what is needed for extension of remote sensing methods beyond the structured environment
    of research studies to the unstructured environment of field-scale operations.
    The uncertainty of remote sensing relationships must be quantified in a way so
    that the information can be used with confidence at a scale and location beyond
    that of the original study. There is a need to simplify algorithms used for remote
    sensing of agronomic parameter retrieval using remote sensing. Turn-key solutions
    with an appropriate degree of automated calibration and processing to compensate
    for different crops, and the variability imposed by time and space, suitable for
    use by specialists and nonspecialists, are needed. Paths to addressing these challenges
    vary. The past 40 yr of VI development illustrated by Table 2 is evidence of a
    highly successful evolutionary approach. Expansion of the types of agronomic information
    that can be retrieved from remote sensing, and refinement of the spectral bands
    required for retrieving specific information have evolved into hyperspectral remote
    sensing. For many applications, VIs have been developed as surrogates for agronomic
    properties that are closely aligned with what we observe with the human eye. As
    research progressed, VIs has gone far beyond just extending what is possible with
    the human eye, suggesting that retrieval of “nonvisual” agronomic information
    is possible given the right combination of spectral bands and analysis methods.
    Attention to unwanted signals (i.e., “noise”) from variations of underlying soil
    reflectance, plant canopy architecture, illumination conditions, viewing conditions,
    and contributions from the sensor systems and platforms have also refined VIs
    and fostered insights to the limitations of using remote sensing. Observed reflectance
    or emittance signals from a canopy are a function of the leaf spectral and morphological
    properties, the variation of leaf cover over the soil, the architectural arrangement
    of the leaves, branches and stems, percentage vegetative cover, and the atmospheric
    signals between the surface and the sensor. For the VIs of Table 2, topography,
    soil roughness, canopy architecture, and row have been treated as unwanted noise
    in the observations. A revolutionary path of remote sensing research is also needed
    that will exploit the potentially useful information available from these sources
    of noise. One approach is to investigate pattern recognition technologies that
    will enable quantification of row structure, leaf angle, or foliage distribution,
    which can be related to stress, genotype identification, weed identification,
    disease presence, or insect damage. Multiple view angle (i.e., BRDF) approaches
    are an example of how exploitation of a traditional source of noise in imagery
    have been investigated as a new source of information. It may thus be possible
    to provide new and perhaps better information about crop canopies when information
    from these traditional sources of noise can be added to spectral VI analysis.
    Most of the emerging technologies being developed place remote sensing tools directly
    into the hands of producers use active sensors rather than passive systems. There
    are a growing number of sensors that can be mounted directly onto implements for
    sensing the crop or soil for the detection of N or weeds in fields and linked
    to control units for directing fertilizer or pesticide applications. This approach
    helps overcome limitations of timeliness, reliability, turn-around time, weather
    uncertainties, and cost. New inexpensive sensors using specific wavelengths have
    been shown to be sensitive to desired plant attributes and functions (i.e., color,
    biomass, water stress, fluorescence, etc.). As noted by Holland et al. (2006),
    scientists have been developing ingenious ways to study plants and automate management
    practices for many years. The uncertainty facing producers is knowing which input
    or plant growth factor(s) is limiting biomass production and the risk that a slight
    or modest temporary stress or deficiency might have on yield and profitability.
    Using remote sensing data to help make agronomic decisions provides a tool to
    improve field-scale management. Improving our understanding of the variation in
    remote sensing observations will help quantify the uncertainty and improve our
    confidence in this information source. References Citing Literature Volume100,

    Today the Internet has become ubiquitous, has touched\nalmost every corner of\
    \ the globe, and is affecting human life in\nunimaginable ways. However, the journey\
    \ is far from over. We\nare now entering an era of even more pervasive connectivity\n\
    where a very wide variety of appliances will be connected to\nthe web. We are\
    \ entering an era of the “Internet of Things”\n(abbreviated as IoT). This term\
    \ has been defined by different\nauthors in many different ways. Let us look at\
    \ two of the most\npopular definitions. Vermesan et al. [1] define the Internet\n\
    of Things as simply an interaction between the physical and\ndigital worlds. The\
    \ digital world interacts with the physical\nworld using a plethora of sensors\
    \ and actuators. Another\ndefinition by Pe˜na-L´opez et al. [2] defines the Internet\
    \ of\nThings as a paradigm in which computing and networking\ncapabilities are\
    \ embedded in any kind of conceivable object.\nWe use these capabilities to query\
    \ the state of the object and to\nchange its state if possible. In common parlance,\
    \ the Internet\nof Things refers to a new kind of world where almost all\nthe\
    \ devices and appliances that we use are connected to a\nnetwork. We can use them\
    \ collaboratively to achieve complex\ntasks that require a high degree of intelligence.\n\
    For this intelligence and interconnection, IoT devices are\nequipped with embedded\
    \ sensors, actuators, processors, and\ntransceivers. IoT is not a single technology;\
    \ rather it is an\nagglomeration of various technologies that work together in\n\
    tandem.\nSensors and actuators are devices, which help in interact-\ning with\
    \ the physical environment. The data collected by the\nsensors has to be stored\
    \ and processed intelligently in order to\nderive useful inferences from it. Note\
    \ that we broadly define\nthe term sensor; a mobile phone or even a microwave\
    \ oven\ncan count as a sensor as long as it provides inputs about its\ncurrent\
    \ state (internal state + environment). An actuator is a\ndevice that is used\
    \ to effect a change in the environment such\nas the temperature controller of\
    \ an air conditioner.\nThe storage and processing of data can be done on the\n\
    edge of the network itself or in a remote server. If any prepro-\ncessing of data\
    \ is possible, then it is typically done at either\nthe sensor or some other proximate\
    \ device. The processed\ndata is then typically sent to a remote server. The storage\n\
    and processing capabilities of an IoT object are also restricted\nby the resources\
    \ available, which are often very constrained\ndue to limitations of size, energy,\
    \ power, and computational\ncapability. As a result the main research challenge\
    \ is to\nensure that we get the right kind of data at the desired level\nof accuracy.\
    \ Along with the challenges of data collection,\nand handling, there are challenges\
    \ in communication as\nwell. The communication between IoT devices is mainly\n\
    wireless because they are generally installed at geographically\ndispersed locations.\

    \ reliably\ncommunicating data without too many retransmissions is an\nimportant\
    \ problem and thus communication technologies\nare integral to the study of IoT\
    \ devices.\nNow, after processing the received data, some action\nneeds to be\
    \ taken on the basis of the derived inferences. The\nnature of actions can be\
    \ diverse. We can directly modify the\nphysical world through actuators. Or we\
    \ may do something\nvirtually. For example, we can send some information to other\n\
    smart things.\nThe process of effecting a change in the physical world\nis often\
    \ dependent on its state at that point of time. This\nis called context awareness.\
    \ Each action is taken keeping in\nconsideration the context because an application\
    \ can behave\ndifferently in different contexts. For example, a person may\nnot\
    \ like messages from his office to interrupt him when he is\non vacation.\nSensors,\
    \ actuators, compute servers, and the commu-\nnication network form the core infrastructure\
    \ of an IoT\nframework. However, there are many software aspects that\nneed to\
    \ be considered. First, we need a middleware that can\nbe used to connect and\
    \ manage all of these heterogeneous\ncomponents. We need a lot of standardization\
    \ to connect\nmany different devices. We shall discuss methods to exchange\ninformation\
    \ and prevailing standards in Section 7.\nThe Internet of Things finds various\
    \ applications in health\ncare, fitness, education, entertainment, social life,\
    \ energy\nconservation, environment monitoring, home automation,\nand transport\
    \ systems. We shall focus on these application\nareas in Section 9. We shall find\
    \ that, in all these application\nareas, IoT technologies have significantly been\
    \ able to reduce\nhuman effort and improve the quality of life.\n2. Architecture\
    \ of IoT\nThere is no single consensus on architecture for IoT, which\nis agreed\
    \ universally. Different architectures have been pro-\nposed by different researchers.\n\
    2.1. Three- and Five-Layer Architectures. The most basic\narchitecture is a three-layer\
    \ architecture [3–5] as shown in\nFigure 1. It was introduced in the early stages\
    \ of research in\nthis area. It has three layers, namely, the perception, network,\n\
    and application layers.\n(i) The perception layer is the physical layer, which\
    \ has\nsensors for sensing and gathering information about\nthe environment. It\
    \ senses some physical parameters\nor identifies other smart objects in the environment.\n\
    (ii) The network layer is responsible for connecting to\nother smart things, network\
    \ devices, and servers. Its\nfeatures are also used for transmitting and processing\n\
    sensor data.\n(iii) The application layer is responsible for delivering\napplication\
    \ specific services to the user. It defines\nvarious applications in which the\
    \ Internet of Things\ncan be deployed, for example, smart homes, smart\ncities,\
    \ and smart health.\nThe three-layer architecture defines the main idea of the\n\
    Internet of Things, but it is not sufficient for research on\nIoT because research\
    \ often focuses on finer aspects of the\nInternet of Things. That is why, we have\
    \ many more layered\narchitectures proposed in the literature. One is the five-\n\
    layer architecture, which additionally includes the processing\nand business layers\
    \ [3–6]. The five layers are perception,\ntransport, processing, application,\
    \ and business layers (see\nFigure 1). The role of the perception and application\
    \ layers\nis the same as the architecture with three layers. We outline\nthe function\
    \ of the remaining three layers.\n(i) The transport layer transfers the sensor\
    \ data from\nthe perception layer to the processing layer and vice\nversa through\
    \ networks such as wireless, 3G, LAN,\nBluetooth, RFID, and NFC.\n(ii) The processing\
    \ layer is also known as the middleware\nlayer. It stores, analyzes, and processes\
    \ huge amounts\nof data that comes from the transport layer. It can\nmanage and\
    \ provide a diverse set of services to the\nlower layers. It employs many technologies\
    \ such as\ndatabases, cloud computing, and big data processing\nmodules.\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n3\n(iii) The business layer manages\
    \ the whole IoT system,\nincluding applications, business and profit models,\n\
    and users’ privacy. The business layer is out of the\nscope of this paper. Hence,\
    \ we do not discuss it\nfurther.\nAnother architecture proposed by Ning and Wang\
    \ [7] is\ninspired by the layers of processing in the human brain. It\nis inspired\
    \ by the intelligence and ability of human beings\nto think, feel, remember, make\
    \ decisions, and react to the\nphysical environment. It is constituted of three\
    \ parts. First is\nthe human brain, which is analogous to the processing and\n\
    data management unit or the data center. Second is the spinal\ncord, which is\
    \ analogous to the distributed network of data\nprocessing nodes and smart gateways.\
    \ Third is the network\nof nerves, which corresponds to the networking components\n\
    and sensors.\n2.2. Cloud and Fog Based Architectures. Let us now discuss\ntwo\
    \ kinds of systems architectures: cloud and fog computing\n(see the reference\
    \ architectures in [8]). Note that this classifi-\ncation is different from the\
    \ classification in Section 2.1, which\nwas done on the basis of protocols.\n\
    In particular, we have been slightly vague about the nature\nof data generated\
    \ by IoT devices, and the nature of data\nprocessing. In some system architectures\
    \ the data processing\nis done in a large centralized fashion by cloud computers.\n\
    Such a cloud centric architecture keeps the cloud at the\ncenter, applications\
    \ above it, and the network of smart things\nbelow it [9]. Cloud computing is\
    \ given primacy because it\nprovides great flexibility and scalability. It offers\
    \ services such\nas the core infrastructure, platform, software, and storage.\n\
    Developers can provide their storage tools, software tools,\ndata mining, and\
    \ machine learning tools, and visualization\ntools through the cloud.\nLately,\
    \ there is a move towards another system archi-\ntecture, namely, fog computing\
    \ [10–12], where the sensors\nand network gateways do a part of the data processing\
    \ and\nanalytics. A fog architecture [13] presents a layered approach\nas shown\
    \ in Figure 2, which inserts monitoring, prepro-\ncessing, storage, and security\
    \ layers between the physical\nand transport layers. The monitoring layer monitors\
    \ power,\nresources, responses, and services. The preprocessing layer\nperforms\
    \ filtering, processing, and analytics of sensor data.\nThe temporary storage\
    \ layer provides storage functionalities\nsuch as data replication, distribution,\
    \ and storage. Finally, the\nsecurity layer performs encryption/decryption and\
    \ ensures\ndata integrity and privacy. Monitoring and preprocessing are\ndone\
    \ on the edge of the network before sending data to the\ncloud.\nOften the terms\
    \ “fog computing” and “edge computing”\nare used interchangeably. The latter term\
    \ predates the former\nand is construed to be more generic. Fog computing originally\n\
    termed by Cisco refers to smart gateways and smart sensors,\nwhereas edge computing\
    \ is slightly more penetrative in nature.\nThis paradigm envisions adding smart\
    \ data preprocessing\ncapabilities to physical devices such as motors, pumps,\
    \ or\nlights. The aim is to do as much of preprocessing of data\nas possible in\
    \ these devices, which are termed to be at the\nStorage layer \nPreprocessing\
    \ layer \nMonitoring layer \nPhysical layer\nSecurity layer\nTransport layer\n\
    Figure 2: Fog architecture of a smart IoT gateway.\nedge of the network. In terms\
    \ of the system architecture,\nthe architectural diagram is not appreciably different\
    \ from\nFigure 2. As a result, we do not describe edge computing\nseparately.\n\
    Finally, the distinction between protocol architectures\nand system architectures\
    \ is not very crisp. Often the protocols\nand the system are codesigned. We shall\
    \ use the generic 5-\nlayer IoT protocol stack (architectural diagram presented\
    \ in\nFigure 2) for both the fog and cloud architectures.\n2.3. Social IoT. Let\
    \ us now discuss a new paradigm: social IoT\n(SIoT). Here, we consider social\
    \ relationships between objects\nthe same way as humans form social relationships\
    \ (see [14]).\nHere are the three main facets of an SIoT system:\n(i) The SIoT\
    \ is navigable. We can start with one device\nand navigate through all the devices\
    \ that are con-\nnected to it. It is easy to discover new devices and\nservices\
    \ using such a social network of IoT devices.\n(ii) A need of trustworthiness\
    \ (strength of the relation-\nship) is present between devices (similar to friends\
    \ on\nFacebook).\n(iii) We can use models similar to studying human social\nnetworks\
    \ to also study the social networks of IoT\ndevices.\n2.3.1. Basic Components.\
    \ In a typical social IoT setting, we\ntreat the devices and services as bots\
    \ where they can set up\nrelationships between them and modify them over time.\
    \ This\nwill allow us to seamlessly let the devices cooperate among\neach other\
    \ and achieve a complex task.\nTo make such a model work, we need to have many\n\
    interoperating components. Let us look at some of the major\ncomponents in such\
    \ a system.\n(1) ID: we need a unique method of object identifica-\ntion. An ID\
    \ can be assigned to an object based on\ntraditional parameters such as the MAC\
    \ ID, IPv6\nID, a universal product code, or some other custom\nmethod.\n4\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(2) Metainformation: along with an ID,\
    \ we need some\nmetainformation about the device that describes its\nform and\
    \ operation. This is required to establish\nappropriate relationships with the\
    \ device and also\nappropriately place it in the universe of IoT devices.\n(3)\
    \ Security controls: this is similar to “friend list” set-\ntings on Facebook.\
    \ An owner of a device might place\nrestrictions on the kinds of devices that\
    \ can connect\nto it. These are typically referred to as owner controls.\n(4)\
    \ Service discovery: such kind of a system is like\na service cloud, where we\
    \ need to have dedicated\ndirectories that store details of devices providing\n\
    certain kinds of services. It becomes very important\nto keep these directories\
    \ up to date such that devices\ncan learn about other devices.\n(5) Relationship\
    \ management: this module manages rela-\ntionships with other devices. It also\
    \ stores the types\nof devices that a given device should try to connect\nwith\
    \ based on the type of services provided. For\nexample, it makes sense for a light\
    \ controller to make\na relationship with a light sensor.\n(6) Service composition:\
    \ this module takes the social IoT\nmodel to a new level. The ultimate goal of\
    \ having such\na system is to provide better integrated services to\nusers. For\
    \ example, if a person has a power sensor\nwith her air conditioner and this device\
    \ establishes\na relationship with an analytics engine, then it is\npossible for\
    \ the ensemble to yield a lot of data about\nthe usage patterns of the air conditioner.\
    \ If the social\nmodel is more expansive, and there are many more\ndevices, then\
    \ it is possible to compare the data with\nthe usage patterns of other users and\
    \ come up with\neven more meaningful data. For example, users can\nbe told that\
    \ they are the largest energy consumers in\ntheir community or among their Facebook\
    \ friends.\n2.3.2. Representative Architecture. Most architectures pro-\nposed\
    \ for the SIoT have a server side architecture as well.\nThe server connects to\
    \ all the interconnected components,\naggregates (composes) the services, and\
    \ acts as a single point\nof service for users.\nThe server side architecture\
    \ typically has three layers. The\nfirst is the base layer that contains a database\
    \ that stores details\nof all the devices, their attributes, metainformation,\
    \ and their\nrelationships. The second layer (Component layer) contains\ncode\
    \ to interact with the devices, query their status, and use\na subset of them\
    \ to effect a service. The topmost layer is the\napplication layer, which provides\
    \ services to the users.\nOn the device (object) side, we broadly have two layers.\n\
    The first is the object layer, which allows a device to connect to\nother devices,\
    \ talk to them (via standardized protocols), and\nexchange information. The object\
    \ layer passes information to\nthe social layer. The social layer manages the\
    \ execution of\nusers’ applications, executes queries, and interacts with the\n\
    application layer on the server.\n3. Taxonomy\nLet us now propose taxonomy for\
    \ research in IoT tech-\nnologies (see Figure 3). Our taxonomy is based on the\n\
    architectural elements of IoT as presented in Section 2.\nThe first architectural\
    \ component of IoT is the perception\nlayer. It collects data using sensors, which\
    \ are the most\nimportant drivers of the Internet of Things [15]. There are\n\
    various types of sensors used in diverse IoT applications.\nThe most generic sensor\
    \ available today is the smartphone.\nThe smartphone itself has many types of\
    \ sensors embedded\nin it [16] such as the location sensor (GPS), movement\nsensors\
    \ (accelerometer, gyroscope), camera, light sensor,\nmicrophone, proximity sensor,\
    \ and magnetometer. These are\nbeing heavily used in different IoT applications.\
    \ Many other\ntypes of sensors are beginning to be used such as sensors for\n\
    measuring temperature, pressure, humidity, medical param-\neters of the body,\
    \ chemical and biochemical substances, and\nneural signals. A class of sensors\
    \ that stand out is infrared\nsensors that predate smartphones. They are now being\
    \ used\nwidely in many IoT applications: IR cameras, motion detec-\ntors, measuring\
    \ the distance to nearby objects, presence of\nsmoke and gases, and as moisture\
    \ sensors. We shall discuss\nthe different types of sensors used in IoT applications\
    \ in\nSection 5.\nSubsequently, we shall discuss related work in data pre-\nprocessing.\
    \ Such applications (also known as fog comput-\ning applications) mainly filter\
    \ and summarize data before\nsending it on the network. Such units typically have\
    \ a little\namount of temporary storage, a small processing unit, and\nsome security\
    \ features.\nThe next architectural component that we shall discuss\nis communication.\
    \ We shall discuss related work (in Sec-\ntion 7) on different communication technologies\
    \ used for\nthe Internet of Things. Different entities communicate over\nthe network\
    \ [17–19] using a diverse set of protocols and\nstandards. The most common communication\
    \ technologies\nfor short range low power communication protocols are\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identification) and NFC (Near Field\nCommunication). For the medium\
    \ range, they are Bluetooth,\nZigbee, and WiFi. Communication in the IoT world\
    \ requires\nspecial networking protocols and mechanisms. Therefore,\nnew mechanisms\
    \ and protocols have been proposed and\nimplemented for each layer of the networking\
    \ stack, accord-\ning to the requirements imposed by IoT devices.\nWe shall subsequently\
    \ look at two kinds of software com-\nponents: middleware and applications. The\
    \ middleware cre-\nates an abstraction for the programmer such that the details\n\
    of the hardware can be hidden. This enhances interoperability\nof smart things\
    \ and makes it easy to offer different kinds of\nservices [20]. There are many\
    \ commercial and open source\nofferings for providing middleware services to IoT\
    \ devices.\nSome examples are OpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], Hydra\n[23], FiWare\
    \ [24], and Oracle Fusion Middleware. Finally, we\ndiscuss the applications of\
    \ IoT in Section 9. We primarily\nfocus on home automation, ambient assisted living,\
    \ health\nand fitness, smart vehicular systems, smart cities, smart\nenvironments,\
    \ smart grids, social life, and entertainment.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of research in IoT technologies.\n4. Related Survey Papers\nOur taxonomy describes\
    \ the technologies in the IoT domain\nand is classified on the basis of architectural\
    \ layers. We\nhave tried to cover all subareas and recent technologies in\nour\
    \ taxonomy. There have been many survey papers on the\nInternet of Things in the\
    \ past. Table 1 shows how our survey\nis different from other highly cited surveys\
    \ in the literature.\nLet us first consider our novel contributions. Our paper\n\
    looks at each and every layer in the IoT stack, and as a\nresult the presentation\
    \ is also far more balanced. A novel\naddition in our survey is that we have discussed\
    \ different IoT\narchitectures. This has not been discussed in prior surveys on\n\
    the Internet of Things. The architecture section also considers\nnewer paradigms\
    \ such as fog computing, which have also\nhitherto not been considered. Moreover,\
    \ our survey nicely\ncategorizes technologies based on the architectural layer\n\
    that they belong to. We have also thoroughly categorized\nthe network layer and\
    \ tried to consolidate almost all the\ntechnologies that are used in IoT systems.\
    \ Such kind of a\nthorough categorization and presentation of technologies is\n\
    novel to the best of our knowledge.\nAlong with these novel contributions our\
    \ survey is far\nmore comprehensive, detailed, and exhaustive as compared\nto\
    \ other surveys in the area. Most of the other surveys look\nat only one or two\
    \ types of sensors, whereas we describe\n9 types of sensors with many examples.\
    \ Other surveys\nare also fairly restricted when they discuss communication\n\
    technologies and applications. We have discussed many types\nof middleware technologies\
    \ as well. Prior works have not\ngiven middleware technologies this level of attention.\
    \ We\ncover 10 communication technologies in detail and consider\na large variety\
    \ of applications encompassing smart homes,\nhealth care, logistics, transport,\
    \ agriculture, environment,\nsmart cities, and green energy. No other survey in\
    \ this area\nprofiles so many technologies, applications, and use cases.\n5. Sensors\
    \ and Actuators\nAll IoT applications need to have one or more sensors to\ncollect\
    \ data from the environment. Sensors are essential\ncomponents of smart objects.\
    \ One of the most important\naspects of the Internet of Things is context awareness,\
    \ which\nis not possible without sensor technology. IoT sensors are\nmostly small\
    \ in size, have low cost, and consume less power.\nThey are constrained by factors\
    \ such as battery capacity and\nease of deployment. Schmidt and Van Laerhoven\
    \ [25] provide\nan overview of various types of sensors used for building\nsmart\
    \ applications.\n5.1. Mobile Phone Based Sensors. First of all, let us look at\n\
    the mobile phone, which is ubiquitous and has many types\nof sensors embedded\
    \ in it. In specific, the smartphone is\na very handy and user friendly device\
    \ that has a host of\nbuilt in communication and data processing features. With\n\
    the increasing popularity of smartphones among people,\nresearchers are showing\
    \ interest in building smart IoT solu-\ntions using smartphones because of the\
    \ embedded sensors\n[16, 26]. Some additional sensors can also be used depending\n\

    \ can be built on the\nsmartphone that uses sensor data to produce meaningful\n\
    results. Some of the sensors inside a modern smartphone are\nas follows.\n(1)\
    \ The accelerometer senses the motion and acceleration\nof a mobile phone. It\
    \ typically measures changes in\nvelocity of the smartphone in three dimensions.\
    \ There\nare many types of accelerometers [27].\nIn a mechanical accelerometer,\
    \ we have a seismic\nmass in a housing, which is tied to the housing\nwith a spring.\
    \ The mass takes time to move and is\nleft behind as the housing moves, so the\
    \ force in\nthe spring can be correlated with the acceleration.\nIn a capacitive\
    \ accelerometer, capacitive plates are\nused with the same setup. With a change\
    \ in velocity,\nthe mass pushes the capacitive plates together, thus\nchanging\
    \ the capacitance. The rate of change of\ncapacitance is then converted into acceleration.\
    \ In\na piezoelectric accelerometer, piezoelectric crystals\nare used, which when\
    \ squeezed generate an electric\nvoltage. The changes in voltage can be translated\
    \ into\nacceleration.\nThe data patterns captured by the accelerometer can\nbe\
    \ used to detect physical activities of the user such as\nrunning, walking, and\
    \ bicycling.\n(2) The gyroscope detects the orientation of the phone\nvery precisely.\
    \ Orientation is measured using capac-\nitive changes when a seismic mass moves\
    \ in a partic-\nular direction.\n(3) The camera and microphone are very powerful\
    \ sen-\nsors since they capture visual and audio information,\nwhich can then\
    \ be analyzed and processed to detect\nvarious types of contextual information.\
    \ For example,\nwe can infer a user’s current environment and the\ninteractions\
    \ that she is having. To make sense of the\naudio data, technologies such as voice\
    \ recognition\nand acoustic features can be exploited.\n(4) The magnetometer detects\
    \ magnetic fields. This can\nbe used as a digital compass and in applications\
    \ to\ndetect the presence of metals.\n(5) The GPS (Global Positioning System)\
    \ detects the\nlocation of the phone, which is one of the most\nimportant pieces\
    \ of contextual information for smart\napplications. The location is detected\
    \ using the prin-\nciple of trilateration [28]. The distance is measured\nfrom\
    \ three or more satellites (or mobile phone towers\nin the case of A-GPS) and\
    \ coordinates are computed.\n(6) The light sensor detects the intensity of ambient\
    \ light.\nIt can be used for setting the brightness of the screen\nand other applications\
    \ in which some action is to be\ntaken depending on the intensity of ambient light.\
    \ For\nexample, we can control the lights in a room.\n(7) The proximity sensor\
    \ uses an infrared (IR) LED,\nwhich emits IR rays. These rays bounce back when\n\
    they strike some object. Based on the difference in\ntime, we can calculate the\
    \ distance. In this way, the\ndistance to different objects from the phone can\
    \ be\nmeasured. For example, we can use it to determine\nwhen the phone is close\
    \ to the face while talking. It\ncan also be used in applications in which we\
    \ have\nto trigger some event when an object approaches the\nphone.\n(8) Some\
    \ smartphones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S4 also\nhave a thermometer, barometer,\
    \ and humidity sensor\nto measure the temperature, atmospheric pressure,\nand\
    \ humidity, respectively.\nWe have studied many smart applications that use sensor\n\
    data collected from smartphones. For example, activity detec-\ntion [29] is achieved\
    \ by applying machine learning algorithms\nto the data collected by smartphone\
    \ sensors. It detects activi-\nties such as running, going up and down stairs,\
    \ walking, driv-\ning, and cycling. The application is trained with patterns of\n\
    data using data sets recorded by sensors when these activities\nare being performed.\n\
    Many health and fitness applications are being built to\nkeep track of a person’s\
    \ health continuously using smart-\nphones. They keep track of users’ physical\
    \ activities, diet,\nexercises, and lifestyle to determine the fitness level and\n\
    give suggestions to the user accordingly. Wang et al. [30]\ndescribe a mobile\
    \ application that is based completely on a\nsmartphone. They use it to assess\
    \ the overall mental health\nand performance of a college student. To track the\
    \ location\nand activities in which the student is involved, activity\nrecognition\
    \ (accelerometer) and GPS data are used. To keep\na check on how much the student\
    \ sleeps, the accelerometer\nand light sensors are used. For social life and conversations,\n\
    audio data from a microphone is used. The application also\nconducts quick questionnaires\
    \ with the students to know\nabout their mood. All this data can be used to assess\
    \ the stress\nlevels, social life, behavior, and exercise patterns of a student.\n\
    Another application by McClernon and Choudhury [31]\ndetects when the user is\
    \ going to smoke using context\ninformation such as the presence of other smokers,\
    \ location,\nand associated activities. The sensors provide information\nrelated\
    \ to the user’s movement, location, visual images, and\nsurrounding sounds. To\
    \ summarize smartphone sensors are\nbeing used to study different kinds of human\
    \ behavior (see\n[32]) and to improve the quality of human life.\n5.2. Medical\
    \ Sensors. The Internet of Things can be really\nbeneficial for health care applications.\
    \ We can use sensors,\nwhich can measure and monitor various medical parameters\n\
    in the human body [33]. These applications can aim at\nmonitoring a patient’s\
    \ health when they are not in hospital or\nwhen they are alone. Subsequently,\
    \ they can provide real time\nfeedback to the doctor, relatives, or the patient.\
    \ McGrath and\nScanaill [34] have described in detail the different sensors that\n\
    can be worn on the body for monitoring a person’s health.\nThere are many wearable\
    \ sensing devices available in the\nmarket. They are equipped with medical sensors\
    \ that are\ncapable of measuring different parameters such as the heart\nrate,\
    \ pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration\nrate, and blood glucose\
    \ levels [35]. These wearables include\n8\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nFigure 4: Smart watches and fitness trackers (source:https://www\n\
    .pebble.com/ and http://www.fitbit.com/).\nFigure 5: Embedded skin patches (source:\
    \ MC10 Electronics).\nsmart watches, wristbands, monitoring patches, and smart\n\
    textiles.\nMoreover, smart watches and fitness trackers are becom-\ning fairly\
    \ popular in the market as companies such as Apple,\nSamsung, and Sony are coming\
    \ up with very innovative\nfeatures. For example, a smart watch includes features\
    \ such\nas connectivity with a smartphone, sensors such as an\naccelerometer,\
    \ and a heart rate monitor (see Figure 4).\nAnother novel IoT device, which has\
    \ a lot of promise are\nmonitoring patches that are pasted on the skin. Monitoring\n\
    patches are like tattoos. They are stretchable and disposable\nand are very cheap.\
    \ These patches are supposed to be worn\nby the patient for a few days to monitor\
    \ a vital health\nparameter continuously [15]. All the electronic components\n\
    are embedded in these rubbery structures. They can even\ntransmit the sensed data\
    \ wirelessly. Just like a tattoo, these\npatches can be applied on the skin as\
    \ shown in Figure 5.\nOne of the most common applications of such patches is to\n\
    monitor blood pressure.\nA very important consideration here is the context [34].\n\
    The data collected by the medical sensors must be combined\nwith contextual information\
    \ such as physical activity. For\nexample, the heart rate depends on the context.\
    \ It increases\nwhen we exercise. In that case, we cannot infer abnormal\nheart\
    \ rate. Therefore, we need to combine data from different\nsensors for making\
    \ the correct inference.\nFigure 6: Brain sensing headband with embedded neurosensors\n\
    (source: http://www.choosemuse.com/).\n5.3. Neural Sensors. Today, it is possible\
    \ to understand\nneural signals in the brain, infer the state of the brain, and\n\
    train it for better attention and focus. This is known as\nneurofeedback [36]\
    \ (see Figure 6). The technology used for\nreading brain signals is called EEG\
    \ (Electroencephalography)\nor a brain computer interface. The neurons inside\
    \ the brain\ncommunicate electronically and create an electric field, which\n\
    can be measured from outside in terms of frequencies. Brain\nwaves can be categorized\
    \ into alpha, beta, gamma, theta, and\ndelta waves depending upon the frequency.\n\
    Based on the type of wave, it can be inferred whether\nthe brain is calm or wandering\
    \ in thoughts. This type of\nneurofeedback can be obtained in real time and can\
    \ be used\nto train the brain to focus, pay better attention towards things,\n\
    manage stress, and have better mental well-being.\n5.4. Environmental and Chemical\
    \ Sensors. Environmental\nsensors are used to sense parameters in the physical\
    \ environ-\nment such as temperature, humidity, pressure, water pollu-\ntion,\
    \ and air pollution. Parameters such as the temperature\nand pressure can be measured\
    \ with a thermometer and\nbarometer. Air quality can be measured with sensors,\
    \ which\nsense the presence of gases and other particulate matter in the\nair\
    \ (refer to Sekhar et al. [37] for more details).\nChemical sensors are used to\
    \ detect chemical and bio-\nchemical substances. These sensors consist of a recognition\n\
    element and a transducer. The electronic nose (e-nose) and\nelectronic tongue\
    \ (e-tongue) are technologies that can be\nused to sense chemicals on the basis\
    \ of odor and taste,\nrespectively [38]. The e-nose and e-tongue consist of an\
    \ array\nof chemical sensors coupled with advance pattern recognition\nsoftware.\
    \ The sensors inside the e-nose and e-tongue produce\ncomplex data, which is then\
    \ analyzed through pattern recog-\nnition to identify the stimulus.\nThese sensors\
    \ can be used in monitoring the pollution\nlevel in smart cities [39], keeping\
    \ a check on food quality\nin smart kitchens, testing food, and agricultural products\
    \ in\nsupply chain applications.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\
    9\n5.5. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID is an iden-\ntification technology\
    \ in which an RFID tag (a small chip with\nan antenna) carries data, which is\
    \ read by a RFID reader. The\ntag transmits the data stored in it via radio waves.\
    \ It is similar\nto bar code technology. But unlike a traditional bar code, it\n\
    does not require line of sight communication between the tag\nand the reader and\
    \ can identify itself from a distance even\nwithout a human operator. The range\
    \ of RFID varies with the\nfrequency. It can go up to hundreds of meters.\nRFID\
    \ tags are of two types: active and passive. Active tags\nhave a power source\
    \ and passive tags do not have any power\nsource. Passive tags draw power from\
    \ the electromagnetic\nwaves emitted by the reader and are thus cheap and have\
    \ a\nlong lifetime [40, 41].\nThere are two types of RFID technologies: near and\
    \ far\n[40]. A near RFID reader uses a coil through which we pass\nalternating\
    \ current and generate a magnetic field. The tag has\na smaller coil, which generates\
    \ a potential due to the ambient\nchanges in the magnetic field. This voltage\
    \ is then coupled\nwith a capacitor to accumulate a charge, which then powers\n\
    up the tag chip. The tag can then produce a small magnetic\nfield that encodes\
    \ the signal to be transmitted, and this can\nbe picked up by the reader.\nIn\
    \ far RFID, there is a dipole antenna in the reader, which\npropagates EM waves.\
    \ The tag also has a dipole antenna on\nwhich an alternating potential difference\
    \ appears and it is\npowered up. It can then use this power to transmit messages.\n\
    RFID technology is being used in various applications\nsuch as supply chain management,\
    \ access control, identity\nauthentication, and object tracking. The RFID tag\
    \ is attached\nto the object to be tracked and the reader detects and records\n\
    its presence when the object passes by it. In this manner,\nobject movement can\
    \ be tracked and RFID can serve as a\nsearch engine for smart things.\nFor access\
    \ control, an RFID tag is attached to the\nauthorized object. For example, small\
    \ chips are glued to the\nfront of vehicles. When the car reaches a barricade\
    \ on which\nthere is a reader, it reads the tag data and decides whether it\n\
    is an authorized car. If yes, it opens automatically. RFID cards\nare issued to\
    \ the people, who can then be identified by a RFID\nreader and given access accordingly.\n\
    The low level data collected from the RFID tags can be\ntransformed into higher\
    \ level insights in IoT applications\n[42]. There are many user level tools available,\
    \ in which all the\ndata collected by particular RFID readers and data associated\n\
    with the RFID tags can be managed. The high level data can\nbe used to draw inferences\
    \ and take further action.\n5.6. Actuators. Let us look at some examples of actuators\
    \ that\nare used in the Internet of Things. An actuator is a device,\nwhich can\
    \ effect a change in the environment by converting\nelectrical energy into some\
    \ form of useful energy. Some\nexamples are heating or cooling elements, speakers,\
    \ lights,\ndisplays, and motors.\nThe actuators, which induce motion, can be classified\
    \ into\nthree categories, namely, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic\nactuators\
    \ depending on their operation. Hydraulic actuators\nfacilitate mechanical motion\
    \ using fluid or hydraulic power.\nPneumatic actuators use the pressure of compressed\
    \ air and\nelectrical ones use electrical energy.\nAs an example, we can consider\
    \ a smart home system,\nwhich consists of many sensors and actuators. The actuators\n\
    are used to lock/unlock the doors, switch on/off the lights or\nother electrical\
    \ appliances, alert users of any threats through\nalarms or notifications, and\
    \ control the temperature of a\nhome (via a thermostat).\nA sophisticated example\
    \ of an actuator used in IoT is\na digital finger, which is used to turn on/off\
    \ the switches\n(or anything which requires small motion) and is controlled\n\
    wirelessly.\n6. Preprocessing\nAs smart things collect huge amount of sensor data,\
    \ compute\nand storage resources are required to analyze, store, and\nprocess\
    \ this data. The most common compute and storage\nresources are cloud based because\
    \ the cloud offers massive\ndata handling, scalability, and flexibility. But this\
    \ will not be\nsufficient to meet the requirements of many IoT applications\n\
    because of the following reasons [43].\n(1) Mobility: most of the smart devices\
    \ are mobile. Their\nchanging location makes it difficult to communicate\nwith\
    \ the cloud data center because of changing net-\nwork conditions across different\
    \ locations.\n(2) Reliable and real time actuation: communicating with\nthe cloud\
    \ and getting back responses takes time.\nLatency sensitive applications, which\
    \ need real time\nresponses, may not be feasible with this model. Also,\nthe communication\
    \ may be lossy due to wireless links,\nwhich can lead to unreliable data.\n(3)\
    \ Scalability: more devices means more requests to the\ncloud, thereby increasing\
    \ the latency.\n(4) Power constraints: communication consumes a lot of\npower,\
    \ and IoT devices are battery powered. They\nthus cannot afford to communicate\
    \ all the time.\nTo solve the problem of mobility, researchers have pro-\nposed\
    \ mobile cloud computing (MCC) [44]. But there are\nstill problems associated\
    \ with latency and power. MCC also\nsuffers from mobility problems such as frequently\
    \ changing\nnetwork conditions due to which problems such as signal\nfading and\
    \ service degradation arise.\nAs a solution to these problems, we can bring some\n\
    compute and storage resources to the edge of the network\ninstead of relying on\
    \ the cloud for everything. This concept\nis known as fog computing [11, 45] (also\
    \ see Section 2.2).\nThe fog can be viewed as a cloud, which is close to the\n\
    ground. Data can be stored, processed, filtered, and analyzed\non the edge of\
    \ the network before sending it to the cloud\nthrough expensive communication\
    \ media. The fog and cloud\nparadigms go together. Both of them are required for\
    \ the\noptimal performance of IoT applications. A smart gateway\n[13] can be employed\
    \ between underlying networks and the\ncloud to realize fog computing as shown\
    \ in Figure 7.\nThe features of fog computing [11] are as follows:\n(1) Low latency:\
    \ less time is required to access computing\nand storage resources on fog nodes\
    \ (smart gateways).\n10\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nSmart\
    \ devices\nSmart gateway\nLocal real time analysis \npreprocessing\nﬁltering\n\
    Cloud data center \nGlobal data analytics\nstorage\ndata\ndata\nFigure 7: Smart\
    \ gateway for preprocessing.\n(2) Location awareness: as the fog is located on\
    \ the edge\nof the network, it is aware of the location of the\napplications and\
    \ their context. This is beneficial as\ncontext awareness is an important feature\
    \ of IoT\napplications.\n(3) Distributed nodes: fog nodes are distributed unlike\n\
    centralized cloud nodes. Multiple fog nodes need to\nbe deployed in distributed\
    \ geographical areas in order\nto provide services to mobile devices in those\
    \ areas.\nFor example, in vehicular networks, deploying fog\nnodes at highways\
    \ can provide low latency data/video\nstreaming to vehicles.\n(4) Mobility: the\
    \ fog supports mobility as smart devices\ncan directly communicate with smart\
    \ gateways\npresent in their proximity.\n(5) Real time response: fog nodes can\
    \ give an immediate\nresponse unlike the cloud, which has a much greater\nlatency.\n\
    (6) Interaction with the cloud: fog nodes can further\ninteract with the cloud\
    \ and communicate only that\ndata, which is required to be sent to the cloud.\n\
    The tasks performed by a smart gateway [46] are col-\nlecting sensor data, preprocessing\
    \ and filtering collected\ndata, providing compute, storage and networking services\n\
    to IoT devices, communicating with the cloud and sending\nonly necessary data,\
    \ monitoring power consumption of IoT\ndevices, monitoring activities and services\
    \ of IoT devices, and\nensuring security and privacy of data. Some applications\
    \ of\nfog computing are as follows [10, 11]:\n(1) Smart vehicular networks: smart\
    \ traffic lights are\ndeployed as smart gateways to locally detect pedes-\ntrians\
    \ and vehicles through sensors, calculate their\ndistance and speed, and finally\
    \ infer traffic conditions.\nThis is used to warn oncoming vehicles. These sensors\n\
    also interact with neighboring smart traffic lights\nto perform traffic management\
    \ tasks. For example,\nif sensors detect an approaching ambulance, they\ncan change\
    \ the traffic lights to let the ambulance\npass first and also inform other lights\
    \ to do so. The\ndata collected by these smart traffic lights are locally\nanalyzed\
    \ in real time to serve real time needs of traffic\nmanagement. Further, data\
    \ from multiple gateways\nis combined and sent to the cloud for further global\n\
    analysis of traffic in the city.\n(2) Smart grid: the smart electrical grid facilitates\
    \ load\nbalancing of energy on the basis of usage and avail-\nability. This is\
    \ done in order to switch automatically\nto alternative sources of energy such\
    \ as solar and\nwind power. This balancing can be done at the edge\nof the network\
    \ using smart meters or microgrids\nconnected by smart gateways. These gateways\
    \ can\nanalyze and process data. They can then project future\nenergy demand,\
    \ calculate the availability and price of\npower, and supply power from both conventional\
    \ and\nalternative sources to consumers.\n7. Communication\nAs the Internet of\
    \ Things is growing very rapidly, there are a\nlarge number of heterogeneous smart\
    \ devices connecting to\nthe Internet. IoT devices are battery powered, with minimal\n\
    compute and storage resources. Because of their constrained\nnature, there are\
    \ various communication challenges involved,\nwhich are as follows [19]:\n(1)\
    \ Addressing and identification: since millions of smart\nthings will be connected\
    \ to the Internet, they will\nhave to be identified through a unique address,\
    \ on the\nbasis of which they communicate with each other. For\nthis, we need\
    \ a large addressing space, and a unique\naddress for each smart object.\n(2)\
    \ Low power communication: communication of data\nbetween devices is a power consuming\
    \ task, specially,\nwireless communication. Therefore, we need a solu-\ntion that\
    \ facilitates communication with low power\nconsumption.\n(3) Routing protocols\
    \ with low memory requirement and\nefficient communication patterns.\n(4) High\
    \ speed and nonlossy communication.\n(5) Mobility of smart things.\nIoT devices\
    \ typically connect to the Internet through\nthe IP (Internet Protocol) stack.\
    \ This stack is very complex\nand demands a large amount of power and memory from\n\
    the connecting devices. The IoT devices can also connect\nlocally through non-IP\
    \ networks, which consume less power,\nand connect to the Internet via a smart\
    \ gateway. Non-IP\ncommunication channels such as Bluetooth, RFID, and NFC\nare\
    \ fairly popular but are limited in their range (up to a\nfew meters). Therefore,\
    \ their applications are limited to small\npersonal area networks. Personal area\
    \ networks (PAN) are\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n11\nbeing\
    \ widely used in IoT applications such as wearables\nconnected to smartphones.\
    \ For increasing the range of such\nlocal networks, there was a need to modify\
    \ the IP stack so as to\nfacilitate low power communication using the IP stack.\
    \ One\nof the solutions is 6LoWPAN, which incorporates IPv6 with\nlow power personal\
    \ area networks. The range of a PAN with\n6LoWPAN is similar to local area networks,\
    \ and the power\nconsumption is much lower.\nThe leading communication technologies\
    \ used in the IoT\nworld are IEEE 802.15.4, low power WiFi, 6LoWPAN, RFID,\nNFC,\
    \ Sigfox, LoraWAN, and other proprietary protocols for\nwireless networks.\n7.1.\
    \ Near Field Communication (NFC). Near Field Communi-\ncation [47–49] is a very\
    \ short range wireless communication\ntechnology, through which mobile devices\
    \ can interact with\neach other over a distance of few centimeters only. All types\
    \ of\ndata can be transferred between two NFC enabled devices in\nseconds by bringing\
    \ them close to each other. This technology\nis based on RFID. It uses variations\
    \ in the magnetic field\nto communicate data between two NFC enabled devices.\n\
    NFC operates over a frequency band of 13.56 MHz, which is\nthe same as high frequency\
    \ RFID. There are two modes of\noperation: active and passive. In the active mode,\
    \ both the\ndevices generate magnetic fields, while in the passive mode,\nonly\
    \ one device generates the field and the other uses load\nmodulation to transfer\
    \ the data. The passive mode is useful in\nbattery powered devices to optimize\
    \ energy use. One benefit\nof the requirement of close proximity between devices\
    \ is that\nit is useful for secure transactions such as payments. Finally,\nnote\
    \ that NFC can be used for two-way communication\nunlike RFID. Consequently, almost\
    \ all smartphones in the\nmarket today are NFC enabled.\n7.2. Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSN) Based on IP for Smart\nObjects. Many times, data from a single\
    \ sensor is not useful\nin monitoring large areas and complex activities. Different\n\
    sensor nodes need to interact with each other wirelessly. The\ndisadvantage of\
    \ non-IP technologies such as RFID, NFC,\nand Bluetooth is that their range is\
    \ very small. So, they\ncannot be used in many applications, where a large area\
    \ needs\nto be monitored through many sensor nodes deployed in\ndiverse locations.\
    \ A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists\nof tens to thousands of sensor nodes\
    \ connected using wireless\ntechnologies. They collect data about the environment\
    \ and\ncommunicate it to gateway devices that relay the information\nto the cloud\
    \ over the Internet. The communication between\nnodes in a WSN may be direct or\
    \ multihop. The sensor nodes\nare of a constrained nature, but gateway nodes have\
    \ suffi-\ncient power and processing resources. The popular network\ntopologies\
    \ used in a WSN are a star, a mesh, and a hybrid\nnetwork. Most of the communication\
    \ in WSN is based on the\nIEEE 802.15.4 standard (discussed in Section 7.3). There\
    \ are\nclearly a lot of protocols that can be used in IoT scenarios.\nLet us discuss\
    \ the design of a typical IoT network protocol\nstack with the most popular alternatives.\n\
    7.3. IoT Network Protocol Stack. The Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF) has\
    \ developed alternative protocols for\ncommunication between IoT devices using\
    \ IP because IP is a\nflexible and reliable standard [50, 51]. The Internet Protocol\n\
    for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance has published various\nwhite papers describing\
    \ alternative protocols and standards\nfor the layers of the IP stack and an additional\
    \ adaptation\nlayer, which is used for communication [51–54] between\nsmart objects.\n\
    (1) Physical and MAC Layer (IEEE 802.15.4). The IEEE\n802.15.4 protocol is designed\
    \ for enabling communication\nbetween compact and inexpensive low power embedded\n\
    devices that need a long battery life. It defines standards and\nprotocols for\
    \ the physical and link (MAC) layer of the IP\nstack. It supports low power communication\
    \ along with low\ncost and short range communication. In the case of such\nresource\
    \ constrained environments, we need a small frame\nsize, low bandwidth, and low\
    \ transmit power.\nTransmission requires very little power (maximum one\nmilliwatt),\
    \ which is only one percent of that used in WiFi or\ncellular networks. This limits\
    \ the range of communication.\nBecause of the limited range, the devices have\
    \ to operate\ncooperatively in order to enable multihop routing over\nlonger distances.\
    \ As a result, the packet size is limited to\n127 bytes only, and the rate of\
    \ communication is limited to\n250 kbps. The coding scheme in IEEE 802.15.4 has\
    \ built in\nredundancy, which makes the communication robust, allows\nus to detect\
    \ losses, and enables the retransmission of lost\npackets. The protocol also supports\
    \ short 16-bit link addresses\nto decrease the size of the header, communication\
    \ overheads,\nand memory requirements [55].\nReaders can refer to the survey by\
    \ Vasseur et al. [54]\nfor more information on different physical and link layer\n\
    technologies for communication between smart objects.\n(2) Adaptation Layer. IPv6\
    \ is considered the best protocol for\ncommunication in the IoT domain because\
    \ of its scalability\nand stability. Such bulky IP protocols were initially not\n\
    thought to be suitable for communication in scenarios with\nlow power wireless\
    \ links such as IEEE 802.15.4.\n6LoWPAN, an acronym for IPv6 over low power wireless\n\
    personal area networks, is a very popular standard for\nwireless communication.\
    \ It enables communication using\nIPv6 over the IEEE 802.15.4 [52] protocol. This\
    \ standard\ndefines an adaptation layer between the 802.15.4 link layer\nand the\
    \ transport layer. 6LoWPAN devices can communicate\nwith all other IP based devices\
    \ on the Internet. The choice\nof IPv6 is because of the large addressing space\
    \ available\nin IPv6. 6LoWPAN networks connect to the Internet via a\ngateway\
    \ (WiFi or Ethernet), which also has protocol support\nfor conversion between\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 as today’s deployed\nInternet is mostly IPv4. IPv6 headers are\
    \ not small enough\nto fit within the small 127 byte MTU of the 802.15.4 standard.\n\
    Hence, squeezing and fragmenting the packets to carry\nonly the essential information\
    \ is an optimization that the\nadaptation layer performs.\nSpecifically, the adaptation\
    \ layer performs the following\nthree optimizations in order to reduce communication\
    \ over-\nhead [55]:\n12\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(i) Header\
    \ compression 6loWPAN defines header com-\npression of IPv6 packets for decreasing\
    \ the overhead\nof IPv6. Some of the fields are deleted because they\ncan be derived\
    \ from link level information or can be\nshared across packets.\n(ii) Fragmentation:\
    \ the minimum MTU size (maximum\ntransmission unit) of IPv6 is 1280 bytes. On\
    \ the other\nhand, the maximum size of a frame in IEEE 802.15.4\nis 127 bytes.\
    \ Therefore, we need to fragment the IPv6\npacket. This is done by the adaptation\
    \ layer.\n(iii) Link layer forwarding 6LoWPAN also supports mesh\nunder routing,\
    \ which is done at the link layer using\nlink level short addresses instead of\
    \ in the network\nlayer. This feature can be used to communicate within\na 6LoWPAN\
    \ network.\n(3) Network Layer. The network layer is responsible for\nrouting the\
    \ packets received from the transport layer. The\nIETF Routing over Low Power\
    \ and Lossy Networks (ROLL)\nworking group has developed a routing protocol (RPL)\
    \ for\nLow Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) [53].\nFor such networks, RPL is an\
    \ open routing protocol,\nbased on distance vectors. It describes how a destination\n\
    oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) is built with\nthe nodes after they exchange\
    \ distance vectors. A set of\nconstraints and an objective function is used to\
    \ build the\ngraph with the best path [53]. The objective function and\nconstraints\
    \ may differ with respect to their requirements. For\nexample, constraints can\
    \ be to avoid battery powered nodes\nor to prefer encrypted links. The objective\
    \ function can aim\nto minimize the latency or the expected number of packets\n\
    that need to be sent.\nThe making of this graph starts from the root node. The\n\
    root starts sending messages to neighboring nodes, which\nthen process the message\
    \ and decide whether to join or not\ndepending upon the constraints and the objective\
    \ function.\nSubsequently, they forward the message to their neighbors.\nIn this\
    \ manner, the message travels till the leaf nodes and a\ngraph is formed. Now\
    \ all the nodes in the graph can send\npackets upwards hop by hop to the root.\
    \ We can realize a point\nto point routing algorithm as follows. We send packets\
    \ to a\ncommon ancestor, from which it travels downwards (towards\nleaves) to\
    \ reach the destination.\nTo manage the memory requirements of nodes, nodes are\n\
    classified into storing and nonstoring nodes depending upon\ntheir ability to\
    \ store routing information. When nodes are in a\nnonstoring mode and a downward\
    \ path is being constructed,\nthe route information is attached to the incoming\
    \ message\nand forwarded further till the root. The root receives the\nwhole path\
    \ in the message and sends a data packet along with\nthe path message to the destination\
    \ hop by hop. But there is\na trade-off here because nonstoring nodes need more\
    \ power\nand bandwidth to send additional route information as they\ndo not have\
    \ the memory to store routing tables.\n(4) Transport Layer. TCP is not a good\
    \ option for communi-\ncation in low power environments as it has a large overhead\n\
    owing to the fact that it is a connection oriented protocol.\nTherefore, UDP is\
    \ preferred because it is a connectionless\nprotocol and has low overhead.\n(5)\
    \ Application Layer. The application layer is responsible for\ndata formatting\
    \ and presentation. The application layer in\nthe Internet is typically based\
    \ on HTTP. However, HTTP is\nnot suitable in resource constrained environments\
    \ because\nit is fairly verbose in nature and thus incurs a large parsing\noverhead.\
    \ Many alternate protocols have been developed for\nIoT environments such as CoAP\
    \ (Constrained Application\nProtocol) and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport).\n\
    (a) Constrained Application Protocol: CoAP can be\nthought of as an alternative\
    \ to HTTP. It is used\nin most IoT applications [56, 57]. Unlike HTTP, it\nincorporates\
    \ optimizations for constrained applica-\ntion environments [50]. It uses the\
    \ EXI (Efficient\nXML Interchanges) data format, which is a binary\ndata format\
    \ and is far more efficient in terms of\nspace as compared to plain text HTML/XML.\
    \ Other\nsupported features are built in header compression,\nresource discovery,\
    \ autoconfiguration, asynchronous\nmessage exchange, congestion control, and support\n\
    for multicast messages. There are four types of mes-\nsages in CoAP: nonconfirmable,\
    \ confirmable, reset\n(nack), and acknowledgement. For reliable transmis-\nsion\
    \ over UDP, confirmable messages are used [58].\nThe response can be piggybacked\
    \ in the acknowledge-\nment itself. Furthermore, it uses DTLS (Datagram\nTransport\
    \ Layer Security) for security purposes.\n(b) Message Queue Telemetry Transport:\
    \ MQTT is a\npublish/subscribe protocol that runs over TCP. It was\ndeveloped\
    \ by IBM [59] primarily as a client/server\nprotocol. The clients are publishers/subscribers\
    \ and\nthe server acts as a broker to which clients connect\nthrough TCP. Clients\
    \ can publish or subscribe to a\ntopic. This communication takes place through\
    \ the\nbroker whose job is to coordinate subscriptions and\nalso authenticate\
    \ the client for security. MQTT is\na lightweight protocol, which makes it suitable\
    \ for\nIoT applications. But because of the fact that it runs\nover TCP, it cannot\
    \ be used with all types of IoT\napplications. Moreover, it uses text for topic\
    \ names,\nwhich increases its overhead.\nMQTT-S/MQTT-SN is an extension of MQTT\
    \ [60],\nwhich is designed for low power and low cost devices. It is\nbased on\
    \ MQTT but has some optimizations for WSNs as\nfollows [61]. The topic names are\
    \ replaced by topic IDs, which\nreduce the overheads of transmission. Topics do\
    \ not need\nregistration as they are preregistered. Messages are also split\n\
    so that only the necessary information is sent. Further, for\npower conservation,\
    \ there is an offline procedure for clients\nwho are in a sleep state. Messages\
    \ can be buffered and later\nread by clients when they wake up. Clients connect\
    \ to the\nbroker through a gateway device, which resides within the\nsensor network\
    \ and connects to the broker.\n7.4. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Bluetooth Low\
    \ Energy, also\nknown as “Bluetooth Smart,” was developed by the Bluetooth\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n13\nSpecial Interest Group. It has a\
    \ relatively shorter range and\nconsumes lower energy as compared to competing\
    \ protocols.\nThe BLE protocol stack is similar to the stack used in classic\n\
    Bluetooth technology. It has two parts: controller and host.\nThe physical and\
    \ link layer are implemented in the controller.\nThe controller is typically a\
    \ SOC (System on Chip) with a\nradio. The functionalities of upper layers are\
    \ included in the\nhost [62]. BLE is not compatible with classic Bluetooth. Let\n\
    us look at the differences between classic Bluetooth and BLE\n[63, 64].\nThe main\
    \ difference is that BLE does not support data\nstreaming. Instead, it supports\
    \ quick transfer of small packets\nof data (packet size is small) with a data\
    \ rate of 1 Mbps.\nThere are two types of devices in BLE: master and slave.\n\
    The master acts as a central device that can connect to various\nslaves. Let us\
    \ consider an IoT scenario where a phone or PC\nserve as the master and mobile\
    \ devices such as a thermostat,\nfitness tracker, smart watch, or any monitoring\
    \ device act\nas slaves. In such cases, slaves must be very power efficient.\n\
    Therefore, to save energy, slaves are by default in sleep mode\nand wake up periodically\
    \ to receive packets from the master.\nIn classic Bluetooth, the connection is\
    \ on all the time even\nif no data transfer is going on. Additionally, it supports\
    \ 79\ndata channels (1 MHz channel bandwidth) and a data rate\nof 1 million symbols/s,\
    \ whereas, BLE supports 40 channels\nwith 2 MHz channel bandwidth (double of classic\
    \ Bluetooth)\nand 1 million symbols/s data rate. BLE supports low duty\ncycle\
    \ requirements as its packet size is small and the time\ntaken to transmit the\
    \ smallest packet is as small as 80 \U0001D707s. The\nBLE protocol stack supports\
    \ IP based communication also.\nAn experiment conducted by Siekkinen et al. [65]\
    \ recorded\nthe number of bytes transferred per Joule to show that BLE\nconsumes\
    \ far less energy as compared to competing protocols\nsuch as Zigbee. The energy\
    \ efficiency of BLE is 2.5 times better\nthan Zigbee.\n7.5. Low Power WiFi. The\
    \ WiFi alliance has recently devel-\noped “WiFi HaLow,” which is based on the\
    \ IEEE 802.11ah\nstandard. It consumes lower power than a traditional WiFi\ndevice\
    \ and also has a longer range. This is why this protocol\nis suitable for Internet\
    \ of Things applications. The range of\nWiFi HaLow is nearly twice that of traditional\
    \ WiFi.\nLike other WiFi devices, devices supporting WiFi HaLow\nalso support\
    \ IP connectivity, which is important for IoT\napplications. Let us look at the\
    \ specifications of the IEEE\n802.11ah standard [66, 67]. This standard was developed\
    \ to\ndeal with wireless sensor network scenarios, where devices\nare energy constrained\
    \ and require relatively long range\ncommunication. IEEE 802.11ah operates in\
    \ the sub-gigahertz\nband (900 MHz). Because of the relatively lower frequency,\n\
    the range is longer since higher frequency waves suffer from\nhigher attenuation.\
    \ We can extend the range (currently 1 km)\nby lowering the frequency further;\
    \ however, the data rate\nwill also be lower and thus the tradeoff is not justified.\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah is also designed to support large star shaped\nnetworks, where a\
    \ lot of stations are connected to a single\naccess point.\n7.6. Zigbee. It is\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.15.4 communication\nprotocol standard and is used for\
    \ personal area networks\nor PANs [68]. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has low power\n\
    MAC and physical layers and has already been explained\nin Section 7.3. Zigbee\
    \ was developed by the Zigbee alliance,\nwhich works for reliable, low energy,\
    \ and cheap communi-\ncation solutions. The range of Zigbee device communication\n\
    is very small (10–100 meters). The details of the network and\napplication layers\
    \ are also specified by the Zigbee standard.\nUnlike BLE, the network layer here\
    \ provides for multihop\nrouting.\nThere are three types of devices in a Zigbee\
    \ network:\nFFD (Fully Functional Device), RFD (Reduced Functional\nDevice), and\
    \ one Zigbee coordinator. A FFD node can addi-\ntionally act as a router. Zigbee\
    \ supports star, tree, and mesh\ntopologies. The routing scheme depends on the\
    \ topology.\nOther features of Zigbee are discovery and maintenance of\nroutes,\
    \ support for nodes joining/leaving the network, short\n16-bit addresses, and\
    \ multihop routing.\nThe framework for communication and distributed appli-\n\
    cation development is provided by the application layer.\nThe application layer\
    \ consists of Application Objects (APO),\nApplication Sublayer (APS), and a Zigbee\
    \ Device Object\n(ZDO). APOs are spread over the network nodes. These are\npieces\
    \ of software, which control some underlying device\nhardware (examples: switch\
    \ and transducer). The device and\nnetwork management services are provided by\
    \ the ZDO,\nwhich are then used by the APOs. Data transfer services\nare provided\
    \ by the Application Sublayer to the APOs and\nZDO. It is responsible for secure\
    \ communication between the\nApplication Objects. These features can be used to\
    \ create a\nlarge distributed application.\n7.7. Integration of RFID and WSN.\
    \ RFID and wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) are both important technologies in\
    \ the IoT\ndomain. RFID can only be used for object identification, but\nWSNs\
    \ serve a far greater purpose. The two are very different\nbut merging them has\
    \ many advantages. The following\ncomponents can be added to RFID to enhance its\
    \ usability:\n(a) Sensing capabilities\n(b) Multihop communication\n(c) Intelligence\n\
    RFID is inexpensive and uses very little power. That is\nwhy its integration with\
    \ WSN is very useful. The integration\nis possible in the following ways [69,\
    \ 70]:\n(a) Integration of RFID tags with sensors: RFID tags\nwith sensing capabilities\
    \ are called sensor tags. These\nsensor tags sense data from the environment and\n\
    then the RFID reader can read this sensed data from\nthe tag. In such cases, simple\
    \ RFID protocols are\nused, where there is only single hop communication.\nRFID\
    \ sensing technologies can be further classified\non the basis of the power requirement\
    \ of sensor tags as\nexplained earlier in the section on RFIDs (active and\npassive)\
    \ (see Section 5.5).\n14\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(b)\
    \ Integration of RFID tags with WSN nodes: the com-\nmunication capabilities of\
    \ sensor tags are limited to a\nsingle hop. To extend its capabilities, the sensor\
    \ tag is\nequipped with a wireless transceiver, little bit of Flash\nmemory, and\
    \ computational capabilities such that it\ncan initiate communication with other\
    \ nodes and\nwireless devices. The nodes can in this fashion be used\nto form\
    \ a wireless mesh network. In such networks,\nsensor tags can communicate with\
    \ each other over a\nlarge range (via intermediate hops). With additional\nprocessing\
    \ capabilities at a node, we can reduce the\nnet amount of data communicated and\
    \ thus increase\nthe power efficiency of the WSN.\n(c) Integration of RFID readers\
    \ with WSN nodes: this\ntype of integration is also done to increase the range\n\
    of RFID tag readers. The readers are equipped with\nwireless transceivers and\
    \ microcontrollers so that\nthey can communicate with each other and therefore,\n\
    the tag data can reach a reader, which is not in the\nrange of that tag. It takes\
    \ advantage of multihop\ncommunication of wireless sensor network devices.\nThe\
    \ data from all the RFID readers in the network\nultimately reaches a central\
    \ gateway or base station\nthat processes the data or sends it to a remote server.\n\
    These kinds of integrated solutions have many applica-\ntions in a diverse set\
    \ of domains such as security, healthcare,\nand manufacturing.\n7.8. Low Power\
    \ Wide-Area-Networks (LPWAN). Let us now\ndiscuss a protocol for long range communication\
    \ in power\nconstrained devices. The LPWAN class of protocols is low bit-\nrate\
    \ communication technologies for such IoT scenarios.\nLet us now discuss some\
    \ of the most common technolo-\ngies in this area.\nNarrow band IoT: it is a technology\
    \ made for a large\nnumber of devices that are energy constrained. It is\nthus\
    \ necessary to reduce the bit rate. This protocol\ncan be deployed with both the\
    \ cellular phone GSM\nand LTE spectra. The downlink speeds vary between\n40 kbps\
    \ (LTE M2) and 10 Mbps (LTE category 1).\nSigfox: it is one more protocol that\
    \ uses narrow band\ncommunication (≈10 MHz). It uses free sections of\nthe radio\
    \ spectrum (ISM band) to transmit its data.\nInstead of 4G networks, Sigfox focuses\
    \ on using\nvery long waves. Thus, the range can increase to a\n1000 kms. Because\
    \ of this the energy for transmission\nis significantly lower (<0.1%) than contemporary\
    \ cell\nphones.\nAgain the cost is bandwidth. It can only transmit\n12 bytes per\
    \ message, and a device is limited to 140\nmessages per day. This is reasonable\
    \ for many kinds of\napplications: submarine applications, sending control\n(emergency)\
    \ codes, geolocation, monitoring remote\nlocations, and medical applications.\n\
    Weightless: it uses a differential binary phase shift\nkeying based method to\
    \ transmit narrow band sig-\nnals. To avoid interference, the protocol hops across\n\
    frequency bands (instead of using CSMA). It sup-\nports cryptographic encryption\
    \ and mobility. Along\nwith frequency hopping, two additional mechanisms\nare\
    \ used to reduce collisions. The downlink service\nuses time division multiple\
    \ access (TDMA) and the\nuplink service uses multiple subchannels that are first\n\
    allocated to transmitting nodes by contacting a cen-\ntral server. Some applications\
    \ include smart meters,\nvehicle tracking, health monitoring, and industrial\n\
    machine monitoring.\nNeul: this protocol operates in the sub-1 GHz band.\nIt uses\
    \ small chunks of the TV whitespace spectrum\nto create low cost and low power\
    \ networks with very\nhigh scalability. It has a 10 km range and uses the\nWeightless\
    \ protocol for communication.\nLoRaWAN: this protocol is similar to Sigfox. It\
    \ targets\nwide area network applications and is designed to be\na low power protocol.\
    \ Its data rates can vary from\n0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, and it can be used within\
    \ an\nurban or a suburban environment (2–5 kms range\nin a crowded urban area).\
    \ It was designed to serve\nas a standard for long range IoT protocols. It thus\n\
    has features to support multitenancy, enable multiple\napplications, and include\
    \ several different network\ndomains.\n7.9. Lightweight Application Layer Protocols.\
    \ Along with\nphysical and MAC layer protocols, we also need application\nlayer\
    \ protocols for IoT networks. These lightweight protocols\nneed to be able to\
    \ carry application messages, while simulta-\nneously reducing power as far as\
    \ possible.\nOMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) is one such protocol.\nIt defines the\
    \ communication protocol between a server and\na device. The devices often have\
    \ limited capabilities and are\nthus referred to as constrained devices. The main\
    \ aims of the\nOMA protocol are as follows:\n(1) Remote device management.\n(2)\
    \ Transferring service data/information between differ-\nent nodes in the LWM2M\
    \ network.\nAll the protocols in this class treat all the network\nresources as\
    \ objects. Such resources can be created, deleted,\nand remotely configured. These\
    \ devices have their unique\nlimitations and can use different kinds of protocols\
    \ for\ninternally representing information. The LWM2M protocol\nabstracts all\
    \ of this away and provides a convenient interface\nto send messages between a\
    \ generic LWM2M server and a\ndistributed set of LWM2M clients.\nThis protocol\
    \ is often used along with CoAP (Constrained\nApplication Protocol). It is an\
    \ application layer protocol\nthat allows constrained nodes such as sensor motes\
    \ or small\nembedded devices to communicate across the Internet. CoAP\nseamlessly\
    \ integrates with HTTP, yet it provides additional\nfacilities such as support\
    \ for multicast operations. It is ideally\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\n15\nsuited for small devices because of its low overhead and\n\
    parsing complexity and reliance on UDP rather than TCP.\n8. Middleware\nUbiquitous\
    \ computing is the core of the Internet of Things,\nwhich means incorporating\
    \ computing and connectivity in\nall the things around us. Interoperability of\
    \ such heteroge-\nneous devices needs well-defined standards. But standard-\n\
    ization is difficult because of the varied requirements of\ndifferent applications\
    \ and devices. For such heterogeneous\napplications, the solution is to have a\
    \ middleware platform,\nwhich will abstract the details of the things for applications.\n\
    That is, it will hide the details of the smart things. It\nshould act as a software\
    \ bridge between the things and the\napplications. It needs to provide the required\
    \ services to the\napplication developers [20] so that they can focus more on\n\
    the requirements of applications rather than on interacting\nwith the baseline\
    \ hardware. To summarize, the middleware\nabstracts the hardware and provides\
    \ an Application Program-\nming Interface (API) for communication, data management,\n\
    computation, security, and privacy.\nThe challenges, which are addressed by any\
    \ IoT middle-\nware, are as follows: [20, 71, 72].\n(1) Interoperability and programming\
    \ abstractions: for\nfacilitating collaboration and information exchange\nbetween\
    \ heterogeneous devices, different types of\nthings can interact with each other\
    \ easily with the help\nof middleware services. Interoperability is of three\n\
    types: network, semantic, and syntactic. Network\ninteroperability deals with\
    \ heterogeneous interface\nprotocols for communication between devices. It\ninsulates\
    \ the applications from the intricacies of\ndifferent protocols. Syntactic interoperability\
    \ ensures\nthat applications are oblivious of different formats,\nstructures,\
    \ and encoding of data. Semantic interop-\nerability deals with abstracting the\
    \ meaning of data\nwithin a particular domain. It is loosely inspired by\nthe\
    \ semantic web.\n(2) Device discovery and management: this feature\nenables the\
    \ devices to be aware of all other devices\nin the neighborhood and the services\
    \ provided by\nthem. In the Internet of Things, the infrastructure is\nmostly\
    \ dynamic. The devices have to announce their\npresence and the services they\
    \ provide. The solution\nneeds to be scalable because the devices in an IoT\n\
    network can increase. Most solutions in this domain\nare loosely inspired by semantic\
    \ web technologies.\nThe middleware provides APIs to list the IoT devices,\ntheir\
    \ services, and capabilities. In addition, typically\nAPIs are provided to discover\
    \ devices based on their\ncapabilities. Finally, any IoT middleware needs to\n\
    perform load balancing, manage devices based on\ntheir levels of battery power,\
    \ and report problems in\ndevices to the users.\n(3) Scalability: a large number\
    \ of devices are expected to\ncommunicate in an IoT setup. Moreover, IoT appli-\n\
    cations need to scale due to ever increasing require-\nments. This should be managed\
    \ by the middleware\nby making required changes when the infrastructure\nscales.\n\
    (4) Big data and analytics: IoT sensors typically collect\na huge amount of data.\
    \ It is necessary to analyze\nall of this data in great detail. As a result a\
    \ lot of\nbig data algorithms are used to analyze IoT data.\nMoreover, it is possible\
    \ that due to the flimsy nature\nof the network some of the data collected might\
    \ be\nincomplete. It is necessary to take this into account\nand extrapolate data\
    \ by using sophisticated machine\nlearning algorithms.\n(5) Security and privacy:\
    \ IoT applications are mostly\nrelated to someone’s personal life or an industry.\n\
    Security and privacy issues need to be addressed in\nall such environments. The\
    \ middleware should have\nbuilt in mechanisms to address such issues, along with\n\
    user authentication, and the implementation of access\ncontrol.\n(6) Cloud services:\
    \ the cloud is an important part of an\nIoT deployment. Most of the sensor data\
    \ is analyzed\nand stored in a centralized cloud. It is necessary for\nIoT middleware\
    \ to seamlessly run on different types\nof clouds and to enable users to leverage\
    \ the cloud\nto get better insights from the data collected by the\nsensors.\n\
    (7) Context detection: the data collected from the sensors\nneeds to be used to\
    \ extract the context by applying\nvarious types of algorithms. The context can\
    \ subse-\nquently be used for providing sophisticated services\nto users.\nThere\
    \ are many middleware solutions available for the\nInternet of Things, which address\
    \ one or more of the\naforementioned issues. All of them support interoperabil-\n\
    ity and abstraction, which is the foremost requirement of\nmiddleware. Some examples\
    \ are Oracle’s Fusion Middleware,\nOpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], and Hydra [23].\
    \ Middle-\nwares can be classified as follows on the basis of their design\n[72]:\n\
    (1) Event based: here, all the components interact with\neach other through events.\
    \ Each event has a type and\nsome parameters. Events are generated by producers\n\
    and received by the consumers. This can be viewed\nas a publish/subscribe architecture,\
    \ where entities can\nsubscribe for some event types and get notified for\nthose\
    \ events.\n(2) Service oriented: service oriented middlewares are\nbased on Service\
    \ Oriented Architectures (SOA), in\nwhich we have independent modules that provide\
    \ ser-\nvices through accessible interfaces. A service oriented\nmiddleware views\
    \ resources as service providers.\nIt abstracts the underlying resources through\
    \ a set\nof services that are used by applications. There is\n16\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\na service repository, where services are published\n\
    by providers. The consumers can discover services\nfrom the repository and then\
    \ bind with the provider\nto access the service. Service oriented middleware\n\
    must have runtime support for advertising services\nby providers and support for\
    \ discovering and using\nservices by consumers.\nHYDRA [23] is a service oriented\
    \ middleware. It\nincorporates many software components, which are\nused in handling\
    \ various tasks required for the devel-\nopment of intelligent applications. Hydra\
    \ also pro-\nvides semantic interoperability using semantic web\ntechnologies.\
    \ It supports dynamic reconfiguration\nand self-management.\n(3) Database oriented:\
    \ in this approach, the network\nof IoT devices is considered as a virtual relational\n\
    database system. The database can then be queried\nby the applications using a\
    \ query language. There\nare easy to use interfaces for extracting data from\n\
    the database. This approach has issues with scaling\nbecause of its centralized\
    \ model.\n(4) Semantic: semantic middleware focuses on the inter-\noperation of\
    \ different types of devices, which commu-\nnicate using different formats of\
    \ data. It incorporates\ndevices with different data formats and ontologies and\n\
    ties all of them together in a common framework.\nThe framework is used for exchanging\
    \ data between\ndiverse types of devices. For a common semantic for-\nmat, we\
    \ need to have \U0001D441 adapters for communication\nbetween \U0001D441 devices\
    \ because; for each device, we need\nadapters to map \U0001D441 standards to one\
    \ abstract standard\n[73]. In such a semantic middleware [74], a semantic\nlayer\
    \ is introduced, in which there is a mapping from\neach resource to a software\
    \ layer for that resource.\nThe software layers then communicate with each\nother\
    \ using a mutually intelligible language (based\non the semantic web). This technique\
    \ allows multiple\nphysical resources to communicate even though they\ndo not\
    \ implement or understand the same protocols.\n(5) Application specific: this\
    \ type of middleware is used\nspecifically for an application domain for which\
    \ it\nis developed because the whole architecture of this\nmiddleware software\
    \ is fine-tuned on the basis of\nrequirements of the application. The application\
    \ and\nmiddleware are tightly coupled. These are not general\npurpose solutions.\n\
    8.1. Popular IoT Middleware\n8.1.1. FiWare. FiWare is a very popular IoT middleware\n\
    framework that is promoted by the EU. It has been designed\nkeeping smart cities,\
    \ logistics, and shop floor analytics in\nmind. FiWare contains a large body of\
    \ code, reusable mod-\nules, and APIs that have been contributed by thousands\
    \ of\nFiWare developers. Any application developer can take a\nsubset of these\
    \ components and build his/her IoT application.\nA typical IoT application has\
    \ many producers of data\n(sensors), a set of servers to process the data, and\
    \ a set\nof actuators. FiWare refers to the information collected by\nsensors\
    \ as context information. It defines generic REST APIs\nto capture the context\
    \ from different scenarios. All the context\ninformation is sent to a dedicated\
    \ service called a context\nbroker. FiWare provides APIs to store the context\
    \ and also\nquery it. Moreover, any application can register itself as a\ncontext\
    \ consumer, and it can request the context broker for\ninformation. It also supports\
    \ the publish-subscribe paradigm.\nSubsequently, the context can be supplied to\
    \ systems using\ncontext adapters whose main role is to transform the data (the\n\
    context) based on the requirements of the destination nodes.\nMoreover, FiWare\
    \ defines a set of SNMP APIs via which we\ncan control the behavior of IoT devices\
    \ and also configure\nthem.\nThe target applications are provided APIs to analyze,\n\
    query, and mine the information that is collected from the\ncontext broker. Additionally,\
    \ with advanced visualization\nAPIs, it is possible to create and deploy feature\
    \ rich applica-\ntions very quickly.\n8.1.2. OpenIoT. OpenIoT is another popular\
    \ open source\ninitiative. It has 7 different components. At the lowest level,\n\
    we have a physical plane. It collects data from IoT devices\nand also does some\
    \ preprocessing of data. It has different\nAPIs to interface with different types\
    \ of physical nodes and\nget information from them.\nThe next plane is the virtualized\
    \ plane, which has 3\ncomponents. We first have the scheduler, which manages the\n\
    streams of data generated by devices. It primarily assigns\nthem to resources\
    \ and takes care of their QoS requirements.\nThe data storage component manages\
    \ the storage and archival\nof data streams. Finally, the service delivery component\n\
    processes the streams. It has several roles. It combines\ndata streams, preprocesses\
    \ them, and tracks some statistics\nassociated with these streams such as the\
    \ number of unique\nrequests or the size of each request.\nThe uppermost layer,\
    \ that is, the application layer, also\nhas 3 components: request definition,\
    \ request presentation,\nand configuration. The request definition component helps\n\
    us create requests to be sent to the IoT sensors and storage\nlayers. It can be\
    \ used to fetch and query data. The request\npresentation component creates mashups\
    \ of data by issuing\ndifferent queries to the storage layer, and finally the\
    \ configu-\nration component helps us configure the IoT devices.\n9. Applications\
    \ of IoT\nThere are a diverse set of areas in which intelligent applica-\ntions\
    \ have been developed. All of these applications are not\nyet readily available;\
    \ however, preliminary research indicates\nthe potential of IoT in improving the\
    \ quality of life in our soci-\nety. Some uses of IoT applications are in home\
    \ automation,\nfitness tracking, health monitoring, environment protection,\n\
    smart cities, and industrial settings.\n9.1. Home Automation. Smart homes are\
    \ becoming more\npopular today because of two reasons. First, the sensor\nand\
    \ actuation technologies along with wireless sensor net-\nworks have significantly\
    \ matured. Second, people today trust\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\

    \ their quality of\nlife and security of their homes (see Figure 8).\nIn smart\
    \ homes, various sensors are deployed, which\nprovide intelligent and automated\
    \ services to the user. They\nhelp in automating daily tasks and help in maintaining\
    \ a\nroutine for individuals who tend to be forgetful. They help\nin energy conservation\
    \ by turning off lights and electronic\ngadgets automatically. We typically use\
    \ motion sensors for\nthis purpose. Motion sensors can be additionally used for\n\
    security also.\nFor example, the project, MavHome [75], provides an\nintelligent\
    \ agent, which uses various prediction algorithms\nfor doing automated tasks in\
    \ response to user triggered events\nand adapts itself to the routines of the\
    \ inhabitants. Predic-\ntion algorithms are used to predict the sequence of events\n\
    [76] in a home. A sequence matching algorithm maintains\nsequences of events in\
    \ a queue and also stores their frequency.\nThen a prediction is made using the\
    \ match length and\nfrequency. Other algorithms used by similar applications use\n\
    compression based prediction and Markov models.\nEnergy conservation in smart\
    \ homes [77] is typically\nachieved through sensors and context awareness. The\
    \ sen-\nsors collect data from the environment (light, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ gas, and fire events). This data from heterogeneous\nsensors is fed to a context\
    \ aggregator, which forwards the\ncollected data to the context aware service\
    \ engine. This engine\nselects services based on the context. For example, an\
    \ appli-\ncation can automatically turn on the AC when the humidity\nrises. Or,\
    \ when there is a gas leak, it can turn all the lights off.\nSmart home applications\
    \ are really beneficial for the\nelderly and differently abled. Their health is\
    \ monitored and\nrelatives are informed immediately in case of emergencies.\n\
    Floors are equipped with pressure sensors, which track the\nmovement of an individual\
    \ across the smart home and also\nhelp in detecting if a person has fallen down.\
    \ In smart homes,\nCCTV cameras can be used to record events of interest. These\n\
    can then be used for feature extraction to find out what is\ngoing on.\nIn specific,\
    \ fall detection applications in smart environ-\nments [78–80] are useful for\
    \ detecting if elderly people have\nfallen down. Yu et al. [80] use computer vision\
    \ based tech-\nniques for analyzing postures of the human body. Sixsmith\net al.\
    \ [79] used low cost infrared sensor array technology,\nwhich can provide information\
    \ such as the location, size,\nand velocity of a target object. It detects dynamics\
    \ of a fall\nby analyzing the motion patterns and also detects inactivity\nand\
    \ compares it with activity in the past. Neural networks\nare employed and sample\
    \ data is provided to the system for\nvarious types of falls. Many smartphone\
    \ based applications\nare also available, which detect a fall on the basis of\
    \ readings\nfrom the accelerometer and gyroscope data.\nThere are many challenges\
    \ and issues with regard to smart\nhome applications [81]. The most important\
    \ is security and\nprivacy [82] since all the data about the events taking place\
    \ in\nthe home is being recorded. If the security and trustworthi-\nness of the\
    \ system are not guaranteed, an intruder may attack\nthe system and may make the\
    \ system behave maliciously.\nSmart home systems are supposed to notify the owners\
    \ in case\nthey detect such abnormalities. This is possible using AI and\nmachine\
    \ learning algorithms, and researchers have already\nstarted working in this direction\
    \ [83]. Reliability is also an\nissue since there is no system administrator to\
    \ monitor the\nsystem.\n9.2. Smart Cities\n9.2.1. Smart Transport. Smart transport\
    \ applications can\nmanage daily traffic in cities using sensors and intelligent\n\
    information processing systems. The main aim of intelligent\ntransport systems\
    \ is to minimize traffic congestion, ensure\n18\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nDatacenter\nGateway\nSend status to cloud\nabout availability\n\
    Search for nearest\navailable parking\nParking space with sensors\nFigure 9: Block\
    \ diagram of a smart parking system.\neasy and hassle-free parking, and avoid\
    \ accidents by prop-\nerly routing traffic and spotting drunk drivers. The sensor\n\
    technologies governing these types of applications are GPS\nsensors for location,\
    \ accelerometers for speed, gyroscopes for\ndirection, RFIDs for vehicle identification,\
    \ infrared sensors\nfor counting passengers and vehicles, and cameras for record-\n\
    ing vehicle movement and traffic. There are many types of\napplications in this\
    \ area (refer to [84]):\n(1) Traffic surveillance and management applications:\n\
    vehicles are connected by a network to each other,\nthe cloud, and to a host of\
    \ IoT devices such as GPS\nsensors, RFID devices, and cameras. These devices\n\
    can estimate traffic conditions in different parts of the\ncity. Custom applications\
    \ can analyze traffic patterns\nso that future traffic conditions can be estimated.\
    \ Yu et\nal. [85] implement a vehicle tracking system for traffic\nsurveillance\
    \ using video sequences captured on the\nroads.\nTraffic congestion detection\
    \ can also be implemented\nusing smartphone sensors such as accelerometers\n[86]\
    \ and GPS sensors. These applications can detect\nmovement patterns of the vehicle\
    \ while the user is\ndriving. Such kind of information is already being\ncollected\
    \ by Google maps and users are using it to\nroute around potentially congested\
    \ areas of the city.\n(2) Applications to ensure safety: smart transport does\n\
    not only imply managing traffic conditions. It also\nincludes safety of people\
    \ travelling in their vehicles,\nwhich up till now was mainly in the hands of\
    \ drivers.\nThere are many IoT applications developed to help\ndrivers become\
    \ safer drivers. Such applications mon-\nitor driving behavior of drivers and\
    \ help them drive\nsafely by detecting when they are feeling drowsy or\ntired\
    \ and helping them to cope with it or suggesting\nrest [87, 88]. Technologies\
    \ used in such applications\nare face detection, eye movement detection, and\n\
    pressure detection on the steering (to measure the\ngrip of the driver’s hands\
    \ on the steering).\nA smartphone application, which estimates the\ndriver’s driving\
    \ behavior using smartphone sensors\nsuch as the accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS,\
    \ and cam-\nera, has been proposed by Eren et al. [89]. It can\ndecide whether\
    \ the driving is safe or rash by analyzing\nthe sensor data.\n(3) Intelligent\
    \ parking management (see Figure 9): in a\nsmart transportation system, parking\
    \ is completely\nhassle free as one can easily check on the Internet to\nfind\
    \ out which parking lot has free spaces. Such lots\nuse sensors to detect if the\
    \ slots are free or occupied by\nvehicles. This data is then uploaded to a central\
    \ server.\n(4) Smart traffic lights: traffic lights equipped with sens-\ning,\
    \ processing, and communication capabilities are\ncalled smart traffic lights.\
    \ These lights sense the\ntraffic congestion at the intersection and the amount\n\
    of traffic going each way. This information can be\nanalyzed and then sent to\
    \ neighboring traffic lights\nor a central controller. It is possible to use this\n\
    information creatively. For example, in an emergency\nsituation the traffic lights\
    \ can preferentially give way\nto an ambulance. When the smart traffic light senses\n\
    an ambulance coming, it clears the path for it and\nalso informs neighboring lights\
    \ about it. Technologies\nused in these lights are cameras, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, and data analysis modules. Such systems\nhave already been deployed\
    \ in Rio De Janeiro.\n(5) Accident detection applications: a smartphone appli-\n\
    cation designed by White et al. [90] detects the occur-\nrence of an accident\
    \ with the help of an accelerometer\nand acoustic data. It immediately sends this\
    \ informa-\ntion along with the location to the nearest hospital.\nJournal of\
    \ Electrical and Computer Engineering\n19\nSome additional situational information\
    \ such as on-\nsite photographs is also sent so that the first respon-\nders know\
    \ about the whole scenario and the degree of\nmedical help that is required.\n\
    9.2.2. Smart Water Systems. Given the prevailing amount of\nwater scarcity in\
    \ most parts of the world, it is very important\nto manage our water resources\
    \ efficiently. As a result most\ncities are opting for smart solutions that place\
    \ a lot of meters\non water supply lines and storm drains. A good reference\n\
    in this area is the paper by Hauber-Davidson and Idris [91].\nThey describe various\
    \ designs for smart water meters. These\nmeters can be used to measure the degree\
    \ of water inflow and\noutflow and to identify possible leaks. Smart water metering\n\
    systems are also used in conjunction with data from weather\nsatellites and river\
    \ water sensors. They can also help us predict\nflooding.\n9.2.3. Examples of\
    \ Smart Cities. Barcelona and Stockholm\nstand out in the list of smart cities.\
    \ Barcelona has a CityOS\nproject, where it aims to create a single virtualized\
    \ OS for\nall the smart devices and services offered within the city.\nBarcelona\
    \ has mainly focused on smart transportation (as\ndiscussed in Section 9.2.1)\
    \ and smart water. Smart transporta-\ntion is implemented using a network of sensors,\
    \ centralized\nanalysis, and smart traffic lights. On similar lines Barcelona\n\
    has sensors on most of its storm drains, water storage tanks,\nand water supply\
    \ lines. This information is integrated with\nweather and usage information. The\
    \ result of all of this is\na centralized water planning strategy. The city is\
    \ able to\nestimate the water requirements in terms of domestic usage\nand industrial\
    \ usage and for activities such as landscaping and\ngardening.\nStockholm started\
    \ way back in 1994, and its first step in\nthis direction was to install an extensive\
    \ fiber optic system.\nSubsequently, the city added thousands of sensors for smart\n\
    traffic and smart water management applications. Stockholm\nwas one of the first\
    \ cities to implement congestion charging.\nUsers were charged money, when they\
    \ drove into congested\nareas. This was enabled by smart traffic technologies.\
    \ Since\nthe city has a solid network backbone, it is very easy to\ndeploy sensors\
    \ and applications. For example, recently the\ncity created a smart parking system,\
    \ where it is possible to\neasily locate parking spots nearby. Parking lots have\
    \ sensors,\nwhich let a server know about their usage. Once a driver\nqueries\
    \ the server with her/his GPS location, she/he is guided\nto the nearest parking\
    \ lot with free slots. Similar innovations\nhave taken place in the city’s smart\
    \ buildings, snow clearance,\nand political announcement systems.\n9.3. Social\
    \ Life and Entertainment. Social life and entertain-\nment play an important role\
    \ in an individual’s life. Many\napplications have been developed, which keep\
    \ track of such\nhuman activities. The term “opportunistic IoT” [92] refers\n\
    to information sharing among opportunistic devices (devices\nthat seek to make\
    \ contact with other devices) based on\nmovement and availability of contacts\
    \ in the vicinity. Personal\ndevices such as tablets, wearables, and mobile phones\
    \ have\nsensing and short range communication capabilities. People\ncan find and\
    \ interact with each other when there is a common\npurpose.\nCircle Sense [93]\
    \ is an application, which detects social\nactivities of a person with the help\
    \ of various types of sensor\ndata. It identifies the social circle of a person\
    \ by analyzing\nthe patterns of social activities and the people present in\n\
    those activities. Various types of social activities and the set\nof people participating\
    \ in those activities are identified. It\nuses location sensors to find out where\
    \ the person is and\nuses Bluetooth for searching people around her. The system\n\
    has built in machine learning algorithms, and it gradually\nimproves its behavior\
    \ with learning.\nAffective computing [94] is a technology, which recog-\nnizes,\
    \ understands, stimulates, and responds to the emotions\nof human beings. There\
    \ are many parameters, which are\nconsidered while dealing with human affects\
    \ such as facial\nexpressions, speech, body gestures, hand movements, and\nsleep\
    \ patterns. These are analyzed to figure out how a person\nis feeling. The utterance\
    \ of emotional keywords is identified\nby voice recognition and the quality of\
    \ voice by looking at\nacoustic features of speech.\nOne of the applications of\
    \ affective computing is Camy,\nan artificial pet dog [95], which is designed\
    \ to interact with\nhuman beings and show affection and emotions. Many sen-\n\
    sors and actuators are embedded in it. It provides emotional\nsupport to the owner,\
    \ encourages playful and active behavior,\nrecognizes its owner, and shows love\
    \ for her and increases\nthe owner’s communication with other people. Based on\
    \ the\nowner’s mood, Camy interacts with the owner and gives her\nsuggestions.\n\
    Logmusic [96] is an entertainment application, which\nrecommends music on the\
    \ basis of the context, such as the\nweather, temperature, time, and location.\n\
    9.4. Health and Fitness. IoT appliances have proven really\nbeneficial in the\
    \ health and wellness domains. Many wearable\ndevices are being developed, which\
    \ monitor a person’s health\ncondition (see Figure 10).\nHealth applications make\
    \ independent living possible for\nthe elderly and patients with serious health\
    \ conditions. Cur-\nrently, IoT sensors are being used to continuously monitor\n\
    and record their health conditions and transmit warnings in\ncase any abnormal\
    \ indicators are found. If there is a minor\nproblem, the IoT application itself\
    \ may suggest a prescription\nto the patient.\nIoT applications can be used in\
    \ creating an Electronic\nHealth Record (EHR), which is a record of all the medical\n\
    details of a person. It is maintained by the health system. An\nEHR can be used\
    \ to record allergies, surges in blood sugar\nand blood pressure.\nStress recognition\
    \ applications are also fairly popular\n[97]. They can be realized using smartphone\
    \ sensors. Wang\net al. describe an application [30], which measures the stress\n\
    level of a college student and is installed on the student’s\nsmartphone. It senses\
    \ the locations the student visits during\nthe whole day, the amount of physical\
    \ activity, amount of\nsleep and rest, and her/his interaction and relationships\
    \ with\nother people (audio data and calls). In addition, it also\nconducts surveys\
    \ with the student by randomly popping up\n20\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of a smart healthcare system.\na question in the smartphone. Using all of this\
    \ data and\nanalyzing it intelligently, the level of stress and academic\nperformance\
    \ can be measured.\nIn the fitness sector, we have applications that monitor\n\
    how fit we are based on our daily activity level. Smartphone\naccelerometer data\
    \ can be used for activity detection by\napplying complex algorithms. For example,\
    \ we can measure\nthe number of steps taken and the amount of exercise done\n\
    by using fitness trackers. Fitness trackers are available in the\nmarket as wearables\
    \ to monitor the fitness level of an indi-\nvidual. In addition, gym apparatus\
    \ can be fitted with sensors\nto count the number of times an exercise is performed.\
    \ For\nexample, a smart mat [98] can count the number of exercise\nsteps performed\
    \ on it. This is implemented using pressure\nsensors on the mat and then by analyzing\
    \ the patterns of\npressure, and the shape of the contact area.\n9.5. Smart Environment\
    \ and Agriculture. Environmental\nparameters such as temperature and humidity\
    \ are important\nfor agricultural production. Sensors are used by farmers in\n\
    the field to measure such parameters and this data can be\nused for efficient\
    \ production. One application is automated\nirrigation according to weather conditions.\n\
    Production using greenhouses [99] is one of the main\napplications of IoT in agriculture.\
    \ Environmental parameters\nmeasured in terms of temperature, soil information,\
    \ and\nhumidity are measured in real time and sent to a server for\nanalysis.\
    \ The results are then used to improve crop quality and\nyield.\nPesticide residues\
    \ in crop production are detected using\nan Acetylcholinesterase biosensor [100].\
    \ This data is saved\nand analyzed for extracting useful information such as the\n\
    sample size, time, location, and amount of residues. We can\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\n21\nthus maintain the quality of the crop. Moreover,\
    \ a QR code\ncan be used to uniquely identify a carton of farm produce.\nConsumers\
    \ can scan the QR code and check the amount\nof pesticides in it (via a centralized\
    \ database) online before\nbuying.\nAir pollution is an important concern today\
    \ because it is\nchanging the climate of the earth and degrading air quality.\n\
    Vehicles cause a lot of air pollution. An IoT application\nproposed by Manna et\
    \ al. [39] monitors air pollution on the\nroads. It also tracks vehicles that\
    \ cause an undue amount of\npollution. Electrochemical toxic gas sensors can also\
    \ be used\nto measure air pollution. Vehicles are identified by RFID tags.\nRFID\
    \ readers are placed on both sides of the road along with\nthe gas sensors. With\
    \ this approach it is possible to identify\nand take action against polluting\
    \ vehicles.\n9.6. Supply Chain and Logistics. IoT tries to simplify real\nworld\
    \ processes in business and information systems [101].\nThe goods in the supply\
    \ chain can be tracked easily from\nthe place of manufacture to the final places\
    \ of distribution\nusing sensor technologies such as RFID and NFC. Real\ntime\
    \ information is recorded and analyzed for tracking.\nInformation about the quality\
    \ and usability of the product can\nalso be saved in RFID tags attached with the\
    \ shipments.\nBo and Guangwen [102] explain an information transmis-\nsion system\
    \ for supply chain management, which is based\non the Internet of Things. RFID\
    \ tags uniquely identify a\nproduct automatically and a product information network\n\
    is created to transmit this information in real time along\nwith location information.\
    \ This system helps in automatic\ncollection and analysis of all the information\
    \ related to supply\nchain management, which may help examine past demand\nand\
    \ come up with a forecast of future demand. Supply chain\ncomponents can get access\
    \ to real time data and all of this\ninformation can be analyzed to get useful\
    \ insights. This will\nin the long run improve the performance of supply chain\n\
    systems.\n9.7. Energy Conservation. The smart grid is information and\ncommunication\
    \ technology enabled modern electricity gen-\neration, transmission, distribution,\
    \ and consumption system\n[103].\nTo make electric power generation, transmission,\
    \ and\ndistribution smart, the concept of smart grids adds intel-\nligence at\
    \ each step and also allows the two-way flow of\npower (back from the consumer\
    \ to the supplier). This can\nsave a lot of energy and help consumers better understand\n\
    the flow of power and dynamic pricing. In a smart grid,\npower generation is distributed.\
    \ There are sensors deployed\nthroughout the system to monitor everything. It\
    \ is actually a\ndistributed network of microgrids [104]. Microgrids generate\n\
    power to meet demands of local sites and transmit back\nthe surplus energy to\
    \ the central grid. Microgrids can also\ndemand energy from the central grid in\
    \ case of a shortfall.\nTwo-way flow of power also benefits consumers, who are\n\
    also using their own generated energy occasionally (say, solar,\nor wind power);\
    \ the surplus power can be transmitted back so\nthat it is not wasted. The user\
    \ will also get paid for that power.\nSome of the IoT applications in a smart\
    \ grid are online\nmonitoring of transmission lines for disaster prevention and\n\
    efficient use of power in smart homes by having a smart meter\nfor monitoring\
    \ energy consumption [105].\nSmart meters read and analyze consumption patterns\
    \ of\npower at regular and peak load times. This information is\nthen sent to\
    \ the server and also made available to the user. The\ngeneration is then set\
    \ according to the consumption patterns.\nIn addition, the user can adjust her/his\
    \ use so as to reduce\ncosts. Smart power appliances can leverage this information\n\
    and operate when the prices are low.\n10. Design Considerations in an IoT System\n\
    Now, that we have profiled most of the IoT technologies, let\nus look at some\
    \ of the design considerations for designing a\npractical IoT network.\nThe first\
    \ consideration is the design of the sensors. Even\nthough there might not be\
    \ much of a choice regarding\nthe sensors, there is definitely a lot of choice\
    \ regarding\nthe processing and networking capabilities that are bundled\nalong\
    \ with the sensors. Our choices range from small sub-\nmW boards meant for sensor\
    \ motes to Arduino or Atom\nboards that consume 300–500 mW of power. This choice\n\
    depends on the degree of analytics and data preprocessing\nthat we want to perform\
    \ at the sensor itself. Secondly, there\nis an issue of logistics also. To create\
    \ a sub-mW board, we\nneed board design expertise, and this might not be readily\n\
    available. Hence, it might be advisable to bundle a sensor with\ncommercially\
    \ available embedded processor kits.\nThe next important consideration is communication.\
    \ In\nIoT nodes, power is the most dominant issue. The power\nrequired to transmit\
    \ and receive messages is a major fraction\nof the overall power, and as a result\
    \ a choice of the networking\ntechnology is vital. The important factors that\
    \ we need\nto consider are the distance between the sender and the\nreceiver,\
    \ the nature of obstacles, signal distortion, ambient\nnoise, and governmental\
    \ regulations. Based on these key\nfactors, we need to choose a given wireless\
    \ networking\nprotocol. For example, if we just need to communicate\ninside a\
    \ small building, we can use Zigbee, whereas if we\nneed communication in a smart\
    \ city, we should choose\nSigfox or LoraWAN. In addition, often there are significant\n\
    constraints on the frequency and the power that can be spent\nin transmission.\
    \ These limitations are mainly imposed by\ngovernment agencies. An apt decision\
    \ needs to be made by\ntaking all of these factors into account.\nLet us then\
    \ come to the middleware. The first choice that\nneeds to be made is to choose\
    \ between an open source mid-\ndleware such as FiWare or a proprietary solution.\
    \ There are\npros and cons of both. It is true that open source middleware\nis\
    \ in theory more flexible; however, they may have limited\nsupport for IoT devices.\
    \ We ideally want a middleware\nsolution to interoperate with all kinds of communication\n\
    protocols and devices; however, that might not be the case.\nHence, if we need\
    \ strict compatibility with certain devices and\nprotocols, a proprietary solution\
    \ is better. Nevertheless, open\nsource offerings have cost advantages and are\
    \ sometimes\neasier to deploy. We also need to choose the communication\n22\n\
    Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nprotocol and ensure that it is\
    \ compatible with the firewalls\nin the organizations involved. In general choosing\
    \ a protocol\nbased on HTTP is the best from this point of view. We also\nneed\
    \ to choose between TCP and UDP. UDP is always better\nfrom the point of view\
    \ of power consumption. Along with\nthese considerations, we also need to look\
    \ at options to store\nsensor data streams, querying languages, and support for\n\
    generating dynamic alerts.\nFinally, let us consider the application layer. Most\
    \ IoT\nframeworks provide significant amount of support for cre-\nating the application\
    \ layer. This includes data mining, data\nprocessing, and visualization APIs.\
    \ Creating mashups and\ndashboards of data is nowadays very easy to do given the\n\
    extensive support provided by IoT frameworks. Nevertheless,\nhere the tradeoff\
    \ is between the features provided and the\nresources that are required. We do\
    \ not need a very heavy\nframework if we do not desire a lot of features. This\
    \ call needs\nto be taken by the application developers.\n11. Conclusion\nIn this\
    \ survey paper we presented a survey of the current\ntechnologies used in the\
    \ IoT domain as of 2016. Currently,\nthis field is in a very nascent stage. The\
    \ technologies in\nthe core infrastructure layers are showing signs of maturity.\n\
    However, a lot more needs to happen in the areas of IoT\napplications and communication\
    \ technologies. These fields\nwill definitely mature and impact human life in\
    \ inconceivable\nways over the next decade.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors\

    \ to the increased demand of animal protein in developing countries, intensive\
    \ farming is\ninstigated, which results in antibiotic residues in animal-derived\
    \ products, and eventually, antibiotic\nresistance. Antibiotic resistance is of\
    \ great public health concern because the antibiotic-resistant\nbacteria associated\
    \ with the animals may be pathogenic to humans, easily transmitted to humans\n\
    via food chains, and widely disseminated in the environment via animal wastes.\
    \ These may cause\ncomplicated, untreatable, and prolonged infections in humans,\
    \ leading to higher healthcare cost\nand sometimes death. In the said countries,\
    \ antibiotic resistance is so complex and difﬁcult, due to\nirrational use of\
    \ antibiotics both in the clinical and agriculture settings, low socioeconomic\
    \ status, poor\nsanitation and hygienic status, as well as that zoonotic bacterial\
    \ pathogens are not regularly cultured,\nand their resistance to commonly used\
    \ antibiotics are scarcely investigated (poor surveillance systems).\nThe challenges\
    \ that follow are of local, national, regional, and international dimensions,\
    \ as there are\nno geographic boundaries to impede the spread of antibiotic resistance.\
    \ In addition, the information\nassembled in this study through a thorough review\
    \ of published ﬁndings, emphasized the presence of\nantibiotics in animal-derived\
    \ products and the phenomenon of multidrug resistance in environmental\nsamples.\
    \ This therefore calls for strengthening of regulations that direct antibiotic\
    \ manufacture,\ndistribution, dispensing, and prescription, hence fostering antibiotic\
    \ stewardship. Joint collaboration\nacross the world with international bodies\
    \ is needed to assist the developing countries to implement\ngood surveillance\
    \ of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance.\nKeywords: antibiotics; agriculture;\
    \ antibiotic resistance; environmental sources; developing countries\n1. Introduction\n\
    The term antibiotics encompass a wide range of chemical substances that are produced\
    \ naturally,\nsemi-synthetically, and synthetically, and are used to inhibit (bacteriostatic)\
    \ bacterial growth or kill them\n(bactericidal) [1–3]. They are categorized based\
    \ on their effects as either bacteriostatic or bactericidal,\nand on their series\
    \ of efficacy, as narrow or broad-spectrum antibiotics. Furthermore, the classes\
    \ of drugs\nthat are more widely used in agriculture at the global level, which\
    \ are of growing scientific concern\nwith regards to their potential adverse effects\
    \ and risk management steps, include the tetracyclines,\naminoglycosides, β-lactams,\
    \ lincosamides, macrolides, pleuromutilins, and sulphonamides [4–7]. Gelband\n\
    et al. [8] noted that these antibiotics have the same mode of actions or belong\
    \ to the same general classes\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795; doi:10.3390/molecules23040795\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n2 of 48\nas those used\
    \ for humans; a situation that demands the judicious use of these drugs in animal\
    \ farming,\nas there is bound to be a degree of interaction between animals and\
    \ humans.\nMarkedly, the antibiotic consumption patterns in agriculture vary across\
    \ regions and countries\nin the developing world, and even antibiotics that have\
    \ been banned in other countries, including\nthe developed countries, are still\
    \ being used in most developing countries [9,10]. However, the antibiotic\nconsumption\
    \ profiles in developing countries are greatly influenced by the gross abuse and\
    \ misuse\nof antibiotics due to their availability over the counter, through unregulated\
    \ supply chains as well as\nthe purchase without prescriptions [11]. Also, Van\
    \ Boeckel et al. [12] projected that the antibiotic\nconsumption will approximately\
    \ double in the BRICS countries consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China,\n\
    and South Africa. The forecast is propelled by a shift to large-scale farms requiring\
    \ the routine use of\nantibiotics to maintain the health of animals and productivity.\
    \ The shift is caused by the progress in\nconsumer demand for animal products.\
    \ Resistance to antibiotics is an inherent side effect associated with\nthe overuse,\
    \ abuse, or substantial use of antibiotics [13,14].\nThe antibiotic resistance\
    \ pattern varies between regions and countries corresponding to the degree\nof\
    \ antibiotic consumption, which is guided and regulated by the antibiotic policies\
    \ of a particular\ncountry [15,16].\nNevertheless, China has been registered as\
    \ the world’s leading producer and\nconsumer of both animals and human antibiotics.\
    \ Antibiotic-related crisis is ascribed to the misuse of\nantibiotics that are,\
    \ ultimately, discharged into the environment, the presence of antibiotic residues\n\
    (parent antibiotic or its metabolites or both found in animal derived products)\
    \ in livestock products\nand wastes, and lastly, the lack of stringent and effective\
    \ supervision and control over antibiotics\nproduction, use, and disposal [17].\
    \ Human activities in response to industrialization drastically\nheightened the\
    \ availability of antibiotic residues in food and the environment, and the development\n\
    and distribution of antibiotic resistant bacteria along with their resistance\
    \ genes, thus causing\nan increase in the abundance of resistant bacteria and\
    \ genes [4].\nThe antibiotic residues, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance\
    \ genes are considered as\nenvironmental pollutants and responsible for a tenacious\
    \ public health crisis throughout the globe [18].\nThe health challenges linked\
    \ to antibiotic-resistant microorganisms are more about restricted therapeutic\n\
    remedies in most developing countries that lack access to good quality treatment,\
    \ thus, accentuating\ninfection as an important root of morbidity and mortality\
    \ [19]. However, the soil and water environment\nhave been regarded as vital reservoirs\
    \ and sources of antibiotic resistance [20,21]; more so, as they\nare affected\
    \ by agriculture [22]. Not only does the administration of antibiotics in food-producing\n\
    animals facilitate antibiotic resistance, but it may also result in the presence\
    \ of antibiotic residues\n(including the parent compounds or its metabolites,\
    \ or both) in animal-derived products (muscles, kidney,\nliver, fat, milk, and\
    \ egg) available for human consumption. However, these antibiotic residues have\n\
    been reported to exert a huge and negative impact on public health and food safety\
    \ with regards to\ndrug toxicity, immunopathological diseases, carcinogenicity,\
    \ allergic reactions, and drug sensitization,\namongst others [7,23–25]. These\
    \ adverse impacts tend to be influenced by land use, contaminated water\nsources,\
    \ national policies (that symbolize production, trade, animal health, and food\
    \ security), national\nand international trade, animal demography, and interactions\
    \ between the human populations as well,\nas they are reported to vary considerably\
    \ between regions and countries [26].\nIn a nutshell, antibiotic resistance is\
    \ observed as a “One Health subject”, both as a cause\nand solution encompassing\
    \ the interactions between humans, animals, and the environment [27].\nAccordingly,\
    \ in an attempt to contain antibiotic resistance, the World Health Organisation\
    \ instituted\na Global Action Plan (GAP) which demands that each country should\
    \ develop national action plans\nin line with the key actions of the GAP, but\
    \ with respect to its ﬁnancial resources and extent of its\nproblems [28]. Surveillance\
    \ and monitoring of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance is one facet\nof\
    \ the strategies against antibiotic resistance. However, developing countries\
    \ encounter challenges\nregarding surveillance systems because of lack of capacity\
    \ and integration [29].\nThis paper assembles information about antibiotic and\
    \ antibiotic resistance in animals,\nanimal-derived products, and the agriculture-impacted\
    \ environment. Basically, it covers antibiotics used\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n\
    3 of 48\nin agriculture, ways through which they end up in the environment causing\
    \ antibiotic pollution, and on\nthe other hand, the consequential effects of antibiotic\
    \ residues on public health. In depth, the consequential\nand devastating effect\
    \ of antibiotic use, known as antibiotic resistance, has been deliberated on to\
    \ include\nsalient aspects, such as the determination of antibiotic resistance,\
    \ antibiotic resistance in livestock farming,\nas well as antibiotic resistance\
    \ in manure-impacted environment (soil and water).\n2. Antibiotics in Agriculture\n\
    The use of antibiotics is not only constrained to the clinical settings, as prescriptions\
    \ involved in\nthe therapeutic regimens for the eradication of diseases in humans.\
    \ It is also employed in livestock\nfarming, where antibiotics can be used for\
    \ disease treatment of animals, and in sub-therapeutic levels\nin concentrated\
    \ animal feed for growth promotion, improved feed conversion efficiency, and for\n\
    the prevention of diseases [22,30,31]. Of great concern, the uses, types, and\
    \ mode of actions of the\nantibiotics employed in agriculture and veterinary practice\
    \ are closely related or the same (that may\nbelong to the same general classes,\
    \ function and act in similar ways) to those prescribed to humans [32].\nClearly,\
    \ the choice of antibiotics and the antimicrobial consumption pattern demonstrates\
    \ geographical\nvariation across the continents being influenced by the food animal\
    \ species, regional production patterns\nand types of production system, intensive\
    \ or extensive farming, purpose of farming (commercial or\nindustrial or domestic),\
    \ lack of clear legislative framework or policies on the use of antibiotics, as\
    \ well as\nthe size and socioeconomic status of the population, and the farmers\
    \ in particular [12,33].\nThe inclusion of nonessential antibiotics in animal\
    \ feed for growth promotion purposes remains\nlargely unregulated in the underdeveloped\
    \ countries [34]. The persistent use of these nonessential\nantibiotics in livestock\
    \ farming can be attributed to the expansion and greater concentration of farmlands,\n\
    inadequate governmental policies, and control over the use and sales of antibiotics,\
    \ reduced use of\ninfection control measures, and the unwillingness of farmers\
    \ to execute delegated changes in farm\npractices [35]. Developing countries continue\
    \ to employ the antimicrobial agent for growth promotion to\nmaintain the healthy\
    \ state of the animals, to increase productivity, and raise incomes for the farmers\
    \ [36,37].\nHowever, these are contradictory to the Swedish agricultural data,\
    \ as it recorded no loss of production\nafter the ban exercise [36].\nAltogether,\
    \ Boeckel et al. [12] noted that on a global scale, the average antimicrobial\
    \ agent consumed\nper annum of animal produced (per kg) varied across the animal\
    \ species with values of 45 mg/kg,\n148 mg/kg, and 172 mg/kg associated with cattle,\
    \ chicken, and pigs, respectively. Equally, their mode of\nadministration differs\
    \ with the animal types. In this light, Apata [38] noted that antibiotics were\
    \ added to\nwater and feed for chicken in sub-therapeutic levels for growth promotion\
    \ and prophylaxis. This had\na devastating effect, as even healthy birds were\
    \ unnecessarily exposed to antibiotics. Moreover, as these\nbirds compete for\
    \ food sources, eventually, there exists a difference in the doses consumed between\n\
    the individuals, with one receiving a higher dose than others. This introduces\
    \ another differential in\nthe selective pressure on commensals, which could lead\
    \ to the selection of resistant commensals that\nwould eventually end up in the\
    \ environment [39]. Singer et al. [40] accorded the administration of\nantibiotics\
    \ in animal feed or water, in which the animals are reared in groups, making it\
    \ difficult to\nisolate only the infected animals, as well as that the isolation\
    \ process could be stressful to the animals and\ndangerous to the veterinarian\
    \ who has to administer the antibiotic process.\nContrarily, Sekyere [41], in\
    \ their study, demonstrated the administration of antibiotics to pigs\nvia the\
    \ intravenous route for treatment, and in this case, shunned the exposure of healthy\
    \ animals\nto antibiotics. However, this mode of administration might cause the\
    \ accumulation of these drugs\nin adipose tissues, thereby posing a health risk\
    \ to consumers of pork fat. In addition, Cromwell [42]\nmentioned that varying\
    \ quantities of antibiotics are being employed at the different stages of livestock\n\
    production, especially in pig farming, that incorporates four stages viz. gestation,\
    \ farrowing, weaning,\nand ﬁnishing. Kim et al. [43] emphasized the signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in the use of antibiotics amongst\npiglets, fattening pigs, and sows\
    \ during therapy and growth promotion; antibiotics are employed in\npig farming\
    \ for treatment, metaphylaxis, prophylaxis, and growth promotion. The authors\
    \ further\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n4 of 48\nrecorded a signiﬁcant difference\
    \ in the use of antibiotics between the three production systems in\npoultry farming,\
    \ including breeding poultry, broilers, and laying hens. Accordingly, these may\
    \ release\ndifferent masses of remnant antibiotics into the environment [30].\n\
    Generally, in the developing countries, the level and rate of antibiotic utilization\
    \ in the farming\nsector might be influenced by the manner in which the farmers\
    \ acquire (over the counters) and use\nthese antibiotics (multidrug practices),\
    \ and also, the presence of existing factors. The existing factors\ninclude a\
    \ high prevalence or level of infections, profound scarcity of state management\
    \ and development\nstrategies, shortfall in husbandry zone planning, negligible\
    \ hygienic practices in livestock husbandry\nin conjunction with the presence\
    \ of an integrated agricultural system [32,44]. Specifically, in Vietnam,\nthere\
    \ has been reported cases of frequent and uncontrolled epidemic diseases, such\
    \ as the porcine\nreproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), foot and mouth\
    \ disease, and digestive tract infections\nand reproductive disorders in piglets\
    \ and exotic sows, respectively. The disease conditions necessitate\nthe wide\
    \ use of antibiotics by producers in livestock for the prevention and therapy\
    \ of diseases as one\nof the most likely approaches to combat diseases [45]. Moreover,\
    \ the country practices an integrated\nagriculture–aquaculture farming system,\
    \ whereby the aquaculture is being sustained via livestock and\nhuman wastes.\
    \ This further strengthens the risk of exposure of humans, animals, and environment\
    \ to\navailable antibiotics [43].\nSimilarly, Guetiya Wadoum\net al.\n[25] noted\
    \ the multidrug practices by farmers in addition\nto the use of formulations with\
    \ low doses of antibiotics that do not indicate the active ingredients,\nor the\
    \ withdrawal periods in poultry farming, in Cameroon. As a result, they diagnosed\
    \ the diseases\nthat occurred or threatened the chickens and decided on the types\
    \ of antibiotics and dosage to employ,\nas well, the ‘veterinarians even gave\
    \ wrong diagnosis about the diseases amongst the birds to encourage\nand promote\
    \ the sales of their drugs. What a bizarre situation that creates chances for\
    \ the abuse of\nantibiotics? Several authors have demonstrated the indiscriminate\
    \ use of antibiotics by farmers, and\nattributed it to lack of knowledge on the\
    \ prudent use of these drugs, and the possible adverse effects\nassociated with\
    \ their abuse, non-adherence to manufacturer’s instructions, and the antibiotic\
    \ withdrawal\nperiods, unavailability of veterinarians and their services. Furthermore,\
    \ inexperienced farmers relied on\nthe knowledge and advice of experienced farmers\
    \ and local drug sellers for drug administration, and above\nall, wealthy farmers\
    \ tended to employ multiple antibiotics, since they have the potential to acquire\
    \ the\ndrugs. Also, very few animals are referred to the laboratory for diagnosis\
    \ to identify the causative agent\nand to assess the antibiotic susceptibility\
    \ testing prior to antibiotic application [10,32,37,41,46].\nAs a consequence,\
    \ some of these underdeveloped countries still employ some antibiotics, such as\n\
    chloramphenicol, tylosin, and TCN (a powder mixture that consisted of oxytetracycline,\
    \ chloramphenicol,\nand neomycin) which have been banned for use in the developed\
    \ countries. Accordingly, these drugs\nhave been associated with aggravation of\
    \ kidney disease (neomycin), carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and\ndevelopment of\
    \ aplastic anemia in humans (chloramphenicol) [47,48]. In addition, Guetiya Wadoum\n\
    et al. [25] mentioned that TCN and tylosin had to be withdrawn for 21 days and\
    \ 10 days respectively,\nbefore the sales of eggs or meat; a situation which is\
    \ quite difficult for the farmers to implement and\nrespect. This expedites the\
    \ consumption, by humans, of poultry products harbouring antibiotic residues.\n\
    Notwithstanding, the available limited data on antimicrobial utilization in livestock\
    \ farming\nensues the partial reports of antimicrobial consumption and sales.\n\
    This is due to the lack of\nsurveillance systems subsidized by the government\
    \ to monitor antimicrobial use and resistance,\nthe lack of knowledge and the\
    \ reluctance of food animal producers, animal feed producers,\npublic health and\
    \ veterinary ofﬁcers and veterinary pharmaceutical companies to provide such\n\
    in-depth measurements [49,50]. In conclusion, the information presented herein\
    \ is deduced from\nthe ﬁndings obtained by several authors who have previously\
    \ conducted investigations on antibiotic\nuse and antibiotic resistance, yet the\
    \ rate of antibiotic usage and antibiotic resistance is alarming;\nimagine the\
    \ scenario in which the real/actual data has to be presented. Seemingly, there\
    \ is a need\nto call for cooperation or team collaboration from individuals, farmers,\
    \ veterinarians, consumers,\nand local vendors of pharmaceutical products for\
    \ the prudent use of antibiotics both in the clinical\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n\
    5 of 48\nand agricultural settings across the nations or countries, in a bid to\
    \ circumvent the rising antibiotic\nresistance of bacteria [51].\n2.1. Antibiotics’\
    \ Introduction into the Environment\nThe indiscriminate and abusive use of antibiotics\
    \ can result in higher concentrations of antibiotics\nin the environment, which\
    \ can be termed as antibiotic pollution. The sources via which antibiotics\ncan\
    \ be released into the environment are diverse, including the human waste streams,\
    \ and wastes\nfrom veterinary use and livestock farming [3]. Antibiotics used\
    \ for prophylaxis or therapy in humans\ncontaminate the human waste streams, likewise,\
    \ the antibiotics used in animals for growth promotion,\nprevention, and treatment\
    \ equally contaminate the animals’ waste streams. Thus, these are considered\n\
    as prime sources of antibiotic release into the environment [52]. This is because\
    \ the administered\nantibiotics are not fully metabolized, and are released unchanged\
    \ into the environment, i.e., water,\nmanure or soils. The amount and rate at\
    \ which the antibiotics are being released into the environments\ndepends on the\
    \ speciﬁc antibiotic and its administered dosage, as well as the species and the\
    \ age of\nthe animals [51]. Nevertheless, these waste streams will contain both\
    \ the antibiotics and resistance\ngenes; both considered as pollutants, and their\
    \ fate in the environment differ [49].\nFurthermore, antibiotics and their metabolites\
    \ contained in stockpiled animal manure may seep\nthrough the pile to surface\
    \ and groundwater, and also into the soil. This is especially so for antibiotics\n\
    with high water afﬁnity or which are water soluble, thus making their spread and\
    \ ecotoxicity in\nthe environment faster, and widely with the aid of water ﬂuidity\
    \ [53]. In the same view, antibiotics\ncan be introduced into the environment\
    \ via soil fertilization with raw animal manure, irrigation\nwith wastewater generated\
    \ from farm activities, or via accidental release by runoffs from farms [54].\n\
    Interestingly, Hamscher et al. [55] noted that dust contaminated with antibiotics\
    \ from farms could\nequally serve as another route of environmental release of\
    \ these drugs. Chee-Sanford et al. [56] also\nemphasized the release of antibiotics\
    \ into the environment via the dispersal of feed and accidental\nspill of products,\
    \ as well as discharges.\nIn addition, Sekyere [41] noted that pig farmers in\
    \ some different districts in the Ashanti Region\nof Ghana do not secure their\
    \ antibiotics, thereby making them freely accessible for use and abuse by\nunauthorized\
    \ persons and children. Also, the farmers disposed of their used antibiotic containers\n\
    by merely throwing them into drains, refuse dumps, or onto bare ground, instead\
    \ of burying\nthem as recommended. The author further mentioned that these antibiotics\
    \ were stored under\nsuboptimal environmental conditions, vulnerable to temperature\
    \ fluctuations that could accelerate their\ndecomposition, thereby causing a reduction\
    \ in their concentration and efficacy during administration.\nSuch circumstances\
    \ promote antibiotic resistance of bacteria living in the gastrointestinal tracts\
    \ of\nthe animals, due to constant exposure to sublethal levels of these antibiotics,\
    \ or could even cause\nprompt administration of an overdose of the antibiotics\
    \ which is noted to be inefficient. More especially,\nin commercial and intensive\
    \ poultry farming, antibiotics may be administered to the entire animal\npopulation\
    \ in feed or water, rather than targeting only the diseased animals. Thus, resistance\
    \ becomes\nunavoidable [57]. Interestingly, antibiotics produced naturally by\
    \ environmental microorganisms,\nto deter competitors from living space and food,\
    \ are gradually accumulating in the environment [58].\nSeemingly, antibiotics\
    \ are released from their production facilities in high concentrations into\n\
    the environment [59]. Also, Sahoo and colleagues [60] noted that antibiotics could\
    \ be found in the natural\nenvironment via improper disposal of out-of-date drugs\
    \ from pharmaceutical shops, and unwanted,\nexpired household pharmaceuticals.\n\
    Accordingly, these antibiotics released usually consist of different types, and\
    \ consequently,\nthey do not degrade, all at the same time, i.e., they degrade\
    \ at different rates in the environment\nover time by the main elimination processes,\
    \ including sorption, photo degradation, biodegradation,\nand oxidation [61,62].\
    \ Albeit, other applied methods, such as adsorption, filtration, coagulation,\n\
    sedimentation, advanced oxidation processes have been implemented [63]. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ several ﬁndings\nhave demonstrated the use of composting, and anaerobic and\
    \ aerobic digestion to cause the reduction\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n6 of 48\n\
    of the antibiotic’s level in manure, wastewater, and sludge, but these processes\
    \ vary in efﬁciency with\nthe category of the antibiotics, the conditions employed\
    \ for composting, as well as the type of livestock\nmanure [53,64]. Nonetheless,\
    \ the presence of these antibiotics in the environment may create selective\n\
    pressure resulting in antibiotic resistance and also the removal processes, reduce\
    \ the concentrations of\nthese antibiotics, allowing time for the exposed bacteria\
    \ to develop resistance which may be presented\nas stress adaptation, co-selection,\
    \ cross-resistance, and cross-protection.\nMoreover, the use of antibiotics urges\
    \ susceptible bacteria to these antibiotics to develop resistance in\na bid to\
    \ survive. In this view, bacteria prevaricate the inhibitory or bactericidal activities\
    \ of the antibiotics,\nand execute resistance by either modifying or altering\
    \ the target sites (ribosomes) for binding by antibiotics,\nwith the help of ribosomal\
    \ protection proteins which bind to the ribosomes, thereby preventing the binding\n\
    and interference of protein synthesis [65,66] or neutralizing antibiotics via\
    \ enzymes produced by adding\nacetyl or phosphate groups to the precise site on\
    \ the antibiotics [67], or finally, via changing of membrane\npermeability due\
    \ to the presence of efflux pumps on the cell membrane [68,69]. Furthermore, the\
    \ sensitive\nbacteria tend to survive in an antibiotic polluted environment by\
    \ acquiring antibiotic resistance genes\nfrom other bacteria or phages (lateral\
    \ gene transfer), undergo mutations in specific antibiotic gene targets,\nand\
    \ by altering of the bacterial surfaces [70].\n2.2. Animal-Derived Products and\
    \ Antibiotic Pollution vs Public Health\nIn developing countries, food prepared\
    \ and sold by street vendors is in vogue, and it is still emerging\nhastily in\
    \ some countries, notably Indonesia, Cameroon, and Democratic Republic of Congo\
    \ [71,72].\nThese foods usually comprise of meat (beef, pork, snails) either raw,\
    \ roasted, or cooked in sauce/stew,\nstarchy foods and snacks, which are sold\
    \ in restaurants located in public places (markets, schools,\nhospitals), on the\
    \ ground in the streets, and along main roads [73]. It is for this reason that\
    \ foodborne\noutbreaks are highest in developing countries, and dawdles as an\
    \ issue of public health concern\nworldwide, because it is indicated as one of\
    \ the signiﬁcant food safety hazards concomitant with\nanimal-derived foods [74].\
    \ Cooked foods sold on the street have a great socioeconomic impact; they create\n\
    jobs and provide income to low or unskilled men and women, as well as serve as\
    \ a major channel for\nthe supply of food to financially handicapped individuals\
    \ or poor and less privileged individuals [75].\nHowever, there is increased meat\
    \ consumption to meet the protein demand of the population [72].\nAntibiotics\
    \ have been reported to accumulate and form residues at varying concentrations\
    \ in\nthe tissues and organs of food animals, as presented in Table 1. Billah\
    \ et al. [24] referred to these\nantibiotic residues as chemical residues or pharmacologically\
    \ active substances representing either\nthe parent compound or its degraded products,\
    \ which are released, gathered, or stored in the edible\ntissues of the animal,\
    \ due to their use in the prevention, treatment, and control of animal diseases.\n\
    Undoubtedly, in Cameroon, Guetiya Wadoum et al. [25] demonstrated the presence\
    \ of chloramphenicol\nand tetracycline residues in concentrations above the maximum\
    \ residue limit (MRL) recommended\nby the European Union in 2010, in edible chicken\
    \ tissues (muscle, gizzards, heart, liver, kidney) and\neggs. Similarly, Billah\
    \ et al. [24] detected ciprofloxacin in higher concentration in egg white, but\
    \ in\nlower concentration in egg yolk during treatment of the birds. Also, Olufemi\
    \ and Agboola [76] reported\na high oxytetracycline residue in edible beef tissues\
    \ of cattle slaughtered at Akure, in Nigeria, at violating\nlevels beyond the\
    \ MRL stipulated by WHO. However, of profound concern are circumstances in which\n\
    diseased animals and animals undergoing therapy could be sold quickly to save\
    \ funds, or could be\nslaughtered and used as food or feed for other animals [43].\
    \ This causes difficulties in the prophylactic\napproach to handling epidemic\
    \ diseases and health risks to consumers, as well as a negative influence on\n\
    the environment. Van Ryssen [77] reported the use of poultry litter as a feed\
    \ to farm animals in South\nAfrica, since it is considered as a bulky protein\
    \ supplement.\nIdeally, no animal derived product should be consumed unless there\
    \ is a complete absence of\nresidual amounts of administered drugs. Nevertheless,\
    \ the intriguing fact is that there are constant\ndetectable levels of residues,\
    \ identiﬁed via the help of markedly improved analytical methods.\nTherefore,\
    \ the world regulatory authorities have set the MRL for various veterinary drugs\
    \ that should\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n7 of 48\nbe expected and considered safe\
    \ in foods for human consumption [78,79]. According to Beyene [80],\nthe diet,\
    \ age and disease status of the animal added to the absorption, distribution,\
    \ metabolism, and\nexcretion of the drugs, the extra-label drug use and the improper\
    \ withdrawal times, amongst others,\nare the risk factors responsible for the\
    \ development of residues. In this light, farmers are supposed to\nadhere and\
    \ implement the right dosages of the antibiotics, as well as observed their withdrawal\
    \ periods\nprior to slaughter and market, in a bid to avoid illegal concentrations\
    \ of drug residues in the animal\nproducts. The withdrawal period (clearance or\
    \ depletion time) deﬁnes the length of time required\nfor an animal to metabolize\
    \ the administered antibiotics under normal conditions, and also, the time\nneeded\
    \ for the antibiotic concentration in the tissues to reduce to a safe and acceptable\
    \ level described\nas tolerance. It can equally be referred to, the time interval\
    \ necessary between the last administration\nof the drug under normal conditions\
    \ of use to animals and the time when treated animals can be\nslaughtered to produce\
    \ foodstuff safe for public consumption. Depending on the drug product, route\
    \ of\nadministration, and dosage form (even with the same active ingredients),\
    \ the withdrawal periods vary\nfrom a day to several days or weeks, and according\
    \ to the target animals [81].\nIt has been reported that the health of humans\
    \ correlates directly with the environment\n(i.e., their habitat and its components,\
    \ including plants, animals, microorganisms, and other human\nbeings) and the\
    \ quality of food that they consume [60,82]. Taking into consideration the growing\
    \ human\npopulation, the changing standard of living conditions, the food shortages,\
    \ and the greater demands\nfor the intensiﬁed production of animal proteins for\
    \ human consumption across the globe, essential\npractices to improve on the agricultural\
    \ and industrial productivity are needed [83]. Of interest is\nthe critical use\
    \ of antibiotics in agriculture to meet the demands of the rising human population,\n\
    as the use of antibiotics in this setting has been associated with several beneﬁts.\
    \ It is therefore\nanticipated that, in the future, almost all the animals slaughtered\
    \ and consumed as food must have\nreceived a chemotherapeutic or a prophylactic\
    \ agent of some sort [81]. However, the consumption of\nthese meats, milk, and\
    \ eggs contaminated with antibiotic residues usually has tremendous impacts on\n\
    the health of humans. These effects may be direct or indirect, owing to the high\
    \ dose of the residues,\nwhich must have accrued over a prolonged period [81].\
    \ They can be exhibited as drug hypersensitivity\nreactions, aplastic anemia,\
    \ carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunologic and teratogenic effects, nephropathy,\n\
    hepatotoxicity, disruption of the normal ﬂora of the intestines, a reproductive\
    \ disorder, as well as\nthe development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the\
    \ gut [80,81,84].\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n8 of 48\nTable 1. Presence of varying\

    \ Challenge: Antibiotics Resistance\nThe routine employment of antibiotics, for\
    \ prevention and growth promotion purposes in livestock\nfarming, selects for\
    \ antibiotic resistance among commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Owing to the\
    \ fact\nthat most of these antibiotics are not fully metabolized but released\
    \ into the environment as waste\nproducts, antibiotic resistance has an ecological\
    \ impact, since these waste products still have the potential\nto influence the\
    \ bacteria population and promote antibiotic resistance. Cogliani et al. [36]\
    \ pointed out\nthat the low concentrations of these antibiotics in the environment\
    \ bring about random and spontaneous\nmutagenesis. Therefore, the environment\
    \ has been viewed as a plausible reservoir or pool of antibiotics\nand antibiotic-resistant\
    \ bacteria, as well as their resistance genes [97]. It is a situation of great\
    \ concern to\npublic health facilities worldwide, as bacteria have the capability\
    \ to transfer resistance genes between\nstrains of the same species and between\
    \ different species [98]. This is, however, possible due to the fact\nthat the\
    \ antibiotic resistance genes are located on elements, including transposons,\
    \ integrons, and\nplasmids, that can be immobilized [99]. The transmission of\
    \ these resistance genes is termed horizontal\ngene transfer (HGT) or lateral\
    \ gene transfer (LGT), and it does occur via transformation, conjugation,\nand\
    \ transduction processes [100,101]. These processes are responsible for the increasing\
    \ antibiotic\nresistance worldwide (because of gene transfers between different\
    \ bacteria species). LGT has been\nimplicated in the distribution of numerous\
    \ antimicrobial-resistance determinants, and as the cause of\nan epidemic in nosocomial\
    \ and community infections, by conferring resistance to many classes\nof antimicrobials,\
    \ which leads to multidrug resistance [102,103]. Moreover, the employment of\n\
    broad-spectrum antibiotics creates selective pressure on the bacterial ﬂora, thus\
    \ increasing the advent\nof multidrug-resistant bacteria which results in the\
    \ production of new antibiotic-resistant bacteria with\ncycles of unpleasant treatments\
    \ [70].\n(a)\nPrevalence of antibiotic resistance in some environmental sources\n\
    Several authors have investigated the prevalence of antibiotic resistance of some\
    \ bacteria in different\nenvironmental samples. These include the following: Ejo\
    \ et al. [104] in their findings observed an overall\nprevalence rate of 5.5%\
    \ of Salmonella isolates identified from raw meat, eggs, milk, and minced meat\
    \ and\nburger samples in Ethiopia. The isolates demonstrated relative resistance\
    \ to ampicillin, tetracycline, and\nsulphamethoxazole–trimethoprim, with a prevalence\
    \ of 47.6%. Rasheed et al. [105] equally noted an\noverall incidence of 14.7%\
    \ of drug-resistant E. coli obtained from vegetable salad, unpasteurized milk,\n\
    raw chicken, raw meat, and raw egg surface, with 4% of these isolates exhibiting\
    \ the extended-spectrum\nβ-lactamase activity. In addition, Carballo et al. [106]\
    \ recovered three tetracycline residues and sixty-three\nantibiotic-resistant\
    \ Gram-negative bacteria that presented with percentage resistance between 33.3%\
    \ and\n66.7% to five well-known antibiotics employed in livestock farming, viz.\
    \ tetracycline, chloramphenicol,\nnalidixic acid, sulphamethoxazole, and ampicillin.\n\
    Similarly, Zhu and colleagues [107], in their findings, noted the high levels\
    \ of tetracycline\nconcentration in manure and soil samples procured from three\
    \ large commercial swine farms, from three\ndifferent regions in China. The authors\
    \ further revealed a great diversity of antibiotic resistance\ngenes (149 unique\
    \ ARGs), and emphasized the absolute abundance of 43% of the aminoglycoside\n\
    phosphorylation gene aphA3 in all the manure samples. In the same country, Gao\
    \ and co-workers [108]\nequally unravelled the cefotaxime (CTX)-M gene as the\
    \ most prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamase\n(ESBL) gene found in E. coli\
    \ isolates recovered from both pig farm and soil samples. Apparently,\nXiao et\
    \ al. [21], in a metagenomics analysis of paddy soils from China, provided a broad\
    \ spectrum profile of\nantibiotic resistance genes, with multidrug resistance\
    \ being the most dominant at a level of 38–47.5% of all\nthe samples collected.\n\
    Furthermore, Lin et al. [109] isolated and characterized one hundred and thirteen\
    \ enteric\nbacteria from the Mhlathuze River, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.\n\
    Of these bacteria,\n75.2% were multidrug resistant, and the enteric isolates obtained\
    \ from downstream (urban and\nindustrial regions) exhibited greater antibiotic\
    \ resistance, unlike those from upstream (rural vicinity).\nThis suggests that\
    \ environmental, industrial, and human activities have a huge impact on the level\
    \ of\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n11 of 48\nenvironmental antibiotic resistance.\
    \ Wahome [110] noted the microbial contamination of groundwater\nsamples obtained\
    \ in Ongata Rongai, Kajiado North County, Kenya, with enteric pathogens including\n\
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella and Vibrio species, E. coli, and Salmonella.\
    \ The enteric pathogens\nexhibited high resistance, between 87.5% and 98.5%, to\
    \ ampicillin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole.\n(b)\nMethods of determining antibiotic\
    \ resistance of bacterial isolates\nThe antibiotic resistance proﬁle of bacterial\
    \ isolates to available antibiotics can be determined by\nusing multiple culture-based\
    \ methods, with the key feature to isolate the target organism through\ngrowth\
    \ on general multipurpose or selective and/or enriched microbiological media,\
    \ and subsequent\nevaluation of their growth in response to speciﬁc antibiotic\
    \ concentrations.\nThe culture-based\nmethods offer a link between antibiotic\
    \ resistance measurement both in the environment and human\nclinical setting [111].\
    \ These cultured-based techniques are designed as susceptibility tests, and\n\
    the resistance of the bacterium can be deduced directly from the susceptibility\
    \ testing. The antibiotic\nsusceptibility test involves both qualitative diffusion\
    \ and quantitative dilution methods, amongst\nwhich is the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion\
    \ technique that implements the guidelines adpoted from\nClinical Laboratory Standards\
    \ Institute (CLSI) [112]. In this methodology, the size (diameter) of\nthe zone\
    \ of inhibition developed around each disc placed on plates of microbiological\
    \ medium\ninoculated with the pure culture of bacteria isolate is considered as\
    \ the degree of sensitivity [113].\nThe antibiotic susceptibility test with disc\
    \ diffusion test is, however, regarded as a qualitative test to\nclassify an organism\
    \ as being susceptible or resistant, and paves the way for the better quantitative\
    \ tests.\nDetermining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic\
    \ against a bacterial isolate\nensures the best quantitative estimate of susceptibility.\
    \ The MIC describes the lowest or least concentration\nof a drug that is required\
    \ to inhibit visible bacterial growth after overnight incubation [114]. The MIC\
    \ value\ngives an insight into the degree of resistance, the resistance mechanisms,\
    \ as well as the resistance\ngenes. It can be determined both by micro broth dilution\
    \ in microplates [115], and agar dilution [116].\nIn between, the E-test (Epsilometer\
    \ test) combines the diffusion and dilution theories in susceptibility\ntesting,\
    \ whereby it determines whether the isolate is resistant or susceptible, based\
    \ on the clear zone of\ninhibition. At the same time, it quantifies the sensitivity\
    \ of the isolate by giving a discrete MIC value\nat the point where the clear\
    \ zone of inhibition intersects on the test strip that harbours a predefined\n\
    gradient of continuous antibiotic concentration ranges [117]. Nevertheless, owing\
    \ to the inherent ability\nof microbiological agars to detect contamination of\
    \ inoculum, Jenkins and Schuetz [116] suggested\nthat agar-based methods are more\
    \ reliable for the detection of antibiotic resistance, unlike the broth\ndilution\
    \ methods. In general, both the agar-based and broth dilution methods are faced\
    \ with challenges,\nincluding cost, and that they are time-consuming and labour\
    \ intensive [111]. It is worth mentioning\nthat the resistance level of a bacterium\
    \ greatly depends on the type of test and test conditions applied\nfor the determination\
    \ of resistance, as well as the kind of antibiotics and its mode of action [118].\
    \ It is\nnecessary to conduct continuous surveillance of the antibiotic resistance\
    \ profile of bacteria, since bacteria\nare vulnerable to develop unpredictable\
    \ resistance patterns, based on their genetic plasticity. In addition,\nthe susceptibility\
    \ patterns of a particular bacteria changes with time, geographical location,\
    \ country,\nand the prevailing environmental conditions [16,119]. The recovered\
    \ information gives knowledge\nand serves as guidelines in antibiotic selection\
    \ for treatment, to reduce the use of broad-spectrum\nantibiotics, and also to\
    \ slow down resistance development, hence predict future resistance in bacterial\n\
    isolates [113,120].\n(c)\nZoonoses and agriculture versus clinical setting\nTaking\
    \ into consideration the routine use of the same antibiotics with similar modes\
    \ of action both for\nanimal and human purposes, added to the report of zoonoses,\
    \ which are bacterial infections in humans\ncaused by animal pathogens, including\
    \ Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes,\nStaphylococcus\
    \ spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia coli, it is somewhat\
    \ obvious\nthat antibiotic resistance can be transferred from animals to humans\
    \ [121]. These bacterial pathogens are\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n12 of 48\nof\
    \ prime importance due to their public health implications, are easily detectable\
    \ indicator organisms\nwhich signify the presence of fecal contamination of the\
    \ environment, have the potential to acquire\nresistance genes via lateral gene\
    \ transfer, and lastly, they can develop resistance to a broad spectrum of\nlast-resort\
    \ antibiotics [122]. Wegener [123] affirmed that the public health consequences\
    \ perpetrated by\nzoonotic pathogens are ever-challenging to evaluate. The consequences\
    \ involve complex production and\ndistribution systems of food and animals, dissemination\
    \ of resistance genes and bacterial clones, increased\nmortality and morbidity,\
    \ and higher cost in the treatment of disease as well as infections that would\
    \ have\notherwise not have occurred.\nThese zoonotic pathogens develop resistance\
    \ in response to the antibiotics used in food animals, and\nthe same strains colonize\
    \ both animals and humans, and the antibiotic resistance genes can easily spread\n\
    among the bacterial species or clones that are phylogenetically related [124].\
    \ Therefore, these zoonotic\nbacteria can serve as vectors of antibiotic resistance\
    \ genes. The resistance can be transferred from\nanimal to animal, or animals\
    \ to humans, either directly via contact, or indirectly through the food chain,\n\
    water, sludge-fertilized soils and manure [125]. More specifically, humans can\
    \ come into contact with\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes either\
    \ directly via immediate exposure to animals and\nbiological substances, including\
    \ urine, feces, milk, semen, and saliva, or indirectly via contact or ingestion\n\
    of contaminated animal-derived food products [126]. This is, however, the main\
    \ route for the cause\nof enteric infections in humans with the zoonotic bacterial\
    \ pathogens listed above. On the other hand,\nantibiotic-resistant bacterial strains\
    \ can be transmitted from humans, including the workers on the farm\nand their\
    \ families, to food animals, since it is noted that the digestive tract and the\
    \ skin of these humans\nharbour high numbers of commensals, notably Staphylococcus\
    \ aureus [127]. Notwithstanding, the feasibility\nof transmission is reliant on\
    \ geographical location, ethnic/cultural practices, religion, hygienic status,\n\
    farm size, and the type of integrated farming [128]. However, this status quo\
    \ is true in the rural settings in\ndeveloping countries, where there is close\
    \ contact between the animals (specifically, poultry) and humans.\nSince farming\
    \ of indigenous-species animals in small numbers appears to be the most common\
    \ practice of\npoultry production systems, in this regard, the animals depend\
    \ on scavenging as a source of food [37,129].\nAlso, in the developing world,\
    \ biosecurity and food safety measures are inadequate, thus facilitating\nthe\
    \ direct and indirect mode of acquiring antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains\
    \ and their resistance genes.\nKagambéga et al. [130] isolated and characterized\
    \ S. typhimurium from poultry and humans that\nwere resistant to the same antibiotics,\
    \ and harboured the same phage, DT 56, which demonstrated\nclose-relatedness as\
    \ revealed by pulse field gel electrophoresis.\nLipsitch et al. [131] presented\
    \ three mechanisms through which antibiotic resistance originating\nfrom agriculture\
    \ can threaten human health, as follows: an individual might be infected by a\
    \ resistant\nbacterial pathogen via direct contact or via ingestion of contaminated\
    \ meat, milk, eggs, or water,\nand not transmit to other humans. In another scenario,\
    \ a person might be infected with a resistant\npathogen via the aforementioned\
    \ pathways, with ongoing transmission to other humans and causing\ninfections\
    \ in some of the individuals. Thirdly, resistance genes derived from the agricultural\
    \ settings\nare being introduced into human pathogens by lateral gene transfer.\
    \ Apart from acquiring resistance\nby these bacteria, they can equally receive\
    \ additional virulent genetic elements, leading to an increase\nin pathogenicity\
    \ or virulence [39,132].\nWegener et al. [133] emphasized that the observed level\
    \ of antibiotic resistance is closely\nassociated with the amount that is being\
    \ consumed. Apparently, the level of antibiotic resistance of\nthese bacteria\
    \ relies on the quantity and the effects of antibiotics in the natural environment\
    \ originating\nfrom antibiotic management within the agricultural and healthcare\
    \ settings, as well as the antibiotic\nprescription guidelines. According to Sahoo\
    \ et al. [16], the antibiotic prescription is inﬂuenced by\ngeographical and climatic\
    \ factors, socioeconomic conditions, local population density, the behaviour\n\
    of a particular community towards antibiotic prescription or consumption, and\
    \ supplier incentives to\nthe prescribers in conjunction to the type of pathogen.\n\
    All the same, antibiotic resistance has adverse effects on patients, healthcare\
    \ systems, and\nsociety [134]. More speciﬁcally, patients witness a more severe\
    \ underlying infection, are administered\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n13 of 48\n\
    less efﬁcacious but more toxic antibacterial agents, and receive broad-spectrum\
    \ antibacterial agents,\nwhich are so-called reserved or last resorts as an empirical\
    \ antibiotic regimen [132]. These might result\nin treatment failure, as well\
    \ as an increase in the cost of human therapies, due to the severity and\npersistence\
    \ of the diseases, added to long hospital stay and prolonged therapy, respectively\
    \ [135,136].\nAntibiotic resistance equally limits the choice of antibiotics to\
    \ be implemented in therapy and\njeopardizes the chances of the effectiveness\
    \ of the existing potent antibiotics in treatment regimens\nused for the eradication\
    \ of serious but common diseases in the future [137]. The rising level of\nantibiotic-resistant\
    \ bacterial pathogens will eventually hamper future treatment and the prevention\
    \ of\ninfectious diseases in both animals and humans [138]. Also, the incidence\
    \ of antibiotic resistance is\nvery critical to the immunocompromised population,\
    \ since these individuals rely solely on the use\nof antimicrobials as a defense\
    \ against pathogens [139]. Unfavourably, the rise in antibiotic resistance\npresents\
    \ a potential threat to surgical and advanced therapeutic procedures, including\
    \ transplantation\nor anticancer therapy that involve immunosuppression. Therefore,\
    \ these medical procedures need\nvigorous anti-infective preventive therapies\
    \ [2,134]. However, antibiotic resistance can cause the death\nof individuals\
    \ which is the most severe outcome [134].\n(d)\nPrinciples of antibiotic use and\
    \ antibiotic resistance in the clinical and agricultural sectors in both\ndeveloping\
    \ and developed countries\nThe principles or standards established to guide antibiotic\
    \ use in both agricultural and clinical\nsettings vary between the developed and\
    \ developing countries, as well as differs from one country to\nthe other. This\
    \ is visualised from the variation in the antibiotic consumption pattern across\
    \ the globe,\nhighlighted by Van Boeckel et al. [12]. It is greatly inﬂuenced\
    \ by the antibiotic policies which govern\nantibiotic use concerning the antibiotic\
    \ manufacture, antibiotic dispensation, and antibiotic prescription\n(inappropriate\
    \ choice and dosing of drugs) of a particular country [140]. However, antibiotic\
    \ policies\nare negatively affected by the socioeconomic level (infectious disease\
    \ burden, income level, educational\nstatus, etc.), large population size, and\
    \ heterogeneity disparity in the healthcare systems in developing\ncountries [11].\n\
    The dearth of functioning antibiotic policies has culminated in the inappropriate\
    \ use of antibiotics.\nVan Boeckel et al. [12] stated that about 50% of antimicrobials\
    \ are used incongruously, regardless of\nthe setting owing to lack of antimicrobial\
    \ stewardship. Antimicrobial stewardship (formerly called\nantibiotic policy)\
    \ entails the choice, dosing, route, and duration of administration of a particular\n\
    antimicrobial agent. It is deﬁned as the administration of the right drug at the\
    \ right dose, through the\nright route, at the right time, to the right patient,\
    \ to ensure the best clinical outcome for treatment or\nprevention, thereby causing\
    \ least harm or toxicity in the patient and future patients [141]. The leading\n\
    goal of antimicrobial stewardship is to optimize clinical outcomes, to maximize\
    \ clinical cure or\nprevention, and to limit the unintended penalties of antibiotic\
    \ use, including toxicity and the emergence\nof antibiotic-resistant bacteria\
    \ [141,142].\nFrom the clinical perspective, antibiotics are the most widely used\
    \ therapeutic agents worldwide.\nTo avoid the irrational and unnecessary use of\
    \ antibiotics, it is imperative that antimicrobial\nstewardship is implemented\
    \ regarding prescriptions guided by appropriate principles based on\nthe patient’s\
    \ characteristics, the characteristics of the disease-causing agent, and the colonizing\n\
    microﬂora [142]. More speciﬁcally, that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics\
    \ of the drug,\nas well as host factors are not left out, in an appropriate antibiotic\
    \ therapy. The microbiological\ndiagnosis presents as the key procedure in any\
    \ therapeutic process, where the etiologic agent and\nthe antimicrobial susceptibility\
    \ patterns, as well as surveillance of the resistance of the pathogen are\nconducted.\
    \ Appropriate specimens are collected and submitted to the microbiology laboratory\
    \ for\ndiagnosis. Diagnosis, in most cases, often relies on culture-based methods\
    \ which are time-consuming\nand take several days for a positive result to be\
    \ obtained. As a consequence, other rapid microbiological\nmethods, including\
    \ rapid polymerase chain reaction and mass spectrometry have been adopted,\nand\
    \ stand a better chance for the future [143].\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n14 of\
    \ 48\nIn addition, new and rapid molecular tests, including peptide nucleic acid\
    \ and matrix-assisted\nlaser desorption/ionization technologies have been introduced,\
    \ that identify common organisms\nfrom positive cultures within several minutes\
    \ [141]. However, especially in critically ill patients\n(e.g., endocarditis,\
    \ bacterial meningitis) that are hospitalised, an empirical therapy is decided\
    \ guided\nby the clinical presentation of the patients and the site of the infection,\
    \ in order to reduce the morbidity\nand mortality rate. Broad-spectrum antibiotics\
    \ are used that cover a broad spectrum of suspected and\nnon-susceptible pathogens\
    \ responsible for the clinical presentation [144]. Usually, the combination\n\
    therapy relies on the synergistic action of the recommended drugs to clear, more\
    \ rapidly, the infecting\nmicroorganism or infection caused by resistant bacteria\
    \ to multiple antibiotics, or infections caused by\nmore than one organism, as\
    \ well as to truncate antibiotic therapy [143]. On the other hand, a deﬁnitive\n\
    therapy is employed following the release of the laboratory results on the speciﬁc\
    \ etiologic agent,\nwith the critical opinion to narrow the antibiotic spectrum.\
    \ Disapprovingly, the deﬁnitive therapy\nis described as the most important component\
    \ of the antibiotic therapy, as it optimises treatment,\nreduces costs and toxicity,\
    \ added to its great possibility of preventing the development of antibiotic\n\
    resistance [145]. Also, very important at this junction, the clinician consults\
    \ the modes of action of\nthese drugs, whether they are bacteriostatic or bactericidal,\
    \ but in more serious infections, bactericidal\nantibiotics are preferred. In\
    \ summary, antibiotics maybe consumed in therapies/treatments as ﬁrst,\nsecond,\
    \ and third line antibiotics. First line drugs are administered to patients guided\
    \ by the clinical\npresentation and antibiotic susceptibility results, and are\
    \ based on their broad availability, relatively low\ncost, and tolerance. However,\
    \ if a patient fails to respond to the initial drugs or develops intolerance\n\
    to drugs and/or relapse of infection occurs, other drugs, known as the second\
    \ line, are added to\nthe treatment. Also, if resistance to the second line drugs\
    \ is observed, third line drugs are included\nin the treatment, even though these\
    \ drugs are associated with higher risk of toxicity and other side\neffects, unlike\
    \ the ﬁrst and second line drugs [144].\nAs indicated above, the use of antibiotics\
    \ in agricultural settings is not only for therapeutic\npurposes. The employment\
    \ of antibiotics in different applications in food animals is described as\ntherapeutic\
    \ use, prophylactic use, and sub-therapeutic use [146]. Ideally, the use of antibiotics\
    \ in\nfood animals for therapeutic purposes should be accompanied by antibiotic\
    \ susceptibility testing\n(AST). Altogether, the results, the age and immune status\
    \ of the animal, attributes of the drug\n(pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics),\
    \ and the cost of the drug, are considered in order to\ndecide on the appropriate\
    \ drug to be used. As in human medicine, the antibiotics during therapy can\n\
    be categorized into ﬁrst, second, and third line drugs [147]. However, with respect\
    \ to the different\nanimal type and practice, the antibiotics vary in the classiﬁcation,\
    \ but the principle still remains that\nthe ﬁrst line drugs are often used in\
    \ the treatment of most bacterial infections, and the second and\nthird line options\
    \ are rarely needed.\nHowever, there is an obvious link between antibiotic use\
    \ and resistance, both on an individual and\npopulation level. The high disease\
    \ burden, poor hygienic and sanitation conditions, limited access to\navailable\
    \ antibiotics (due to poverty), disparity in healthcare systems and personnels,\
    \ over-the-counter\npurchase of drugs, lack of stringent antibiotic policies (that\
    \ affect the quality and potency of drugs\nproduced), unregulated prescription\
    \ principles (that lead to self-mediation and prescription by\nuntrained persons),\
    \ patient expectations, ﬁnancial incentives to healthcare providers to prescribe\n\
    antibiotics in developing countries, cause inappropriate use of antibiotics, resulting\
    \ in antibiotic\nresistance [140,148,149]. Thus, there exists differences in the\
    \ antibiotic resistance levels between and\nwithin countries. For instance, Gebeyehu\
    \ et al. [150] gave an insight into the inappropriate use of\nantibiotics in the\
    \ rural (29.2%) and urban (31.1%) communities in North West Ethiopia, and attributed\n\
    the practice to younger age, involvement with a job, paucity of knowledge on the\
    \ use of antibiotic\npreparations of humans to animals, and dissatisfaction with\
    \ the healthcare services.\n(e)\nContainment of antibiotic resistance or strategies\
    \ implemented to maintain appropriate use\nof antibiotics\nMolecules 2018, 23,\
    \ 795\n15 of 48\nNevertheless, across the globe, countries, states, and regions\
    \ within the countries have\nimplemented several procedures to regulate and reinforce\
    \ rational and prudent use of antibiotics in\nboth the clinical and agricultural\
    \ sectors, in order to contain antibiotic resistance. All these procedures\nare\
    \ necessary to conserve the available antibiotics and to maintain their effectiveness.\
    \ Antimicrobial\nstewardship occupies a central role in the endeavour to avoid\
    \ misuse, overuse, or abuse of antibiotics\nin both settings.\nI.\nClinical sector\n\
    In the clinical sector, the front-end or preprescription, and the back-end or\
    \ postprescription approach\nare implemented with different techniques/strategies\
    \ to optimize the use of antibiotics. These techniques\ninclude formulary restrictions,\
    \ order sets and treatment algorithms, clinical guidelines, education,\npharmacodynamic\
    \ dose optimization, computer-assisted decision support system, pharmacist-driven\n\
    intravenous to oral switch programs, pharmacy dosing programs, and antibiotic\
    \ cycling [141].\nThe back-end approach offers as a better option because it uses\
    \ prospective review and feedback,\nand focuses on de-escalation, which permits\
    \ the modiﬁcation (a change, adjustment/reduction,\ndiscontinuation) of initial\
    \ empirical antibiotic therapy relying on the culture data, clinical status\n\
    of the patient, as well as the other laboratory results [151]. The antibiotic\
    \ de-escalation therapy is\nthe key component within antimicrobial stewardship\
    \ [152].\nApparently, McKenzie\net al.\n[153] demonstrated that antibiotic restriction,\
    \ education of\nprescribers and patients, and prescription feedbacks as antimicrobial\
    \ stewardship strategies have\nimproved with the prudent use of antibiotics in\
    \ Australian hospitals. In addition, the California state\nin the United States\
    \ has instituted antimicrobial stewardship in its state legislation [154]. In\
    \ addition,\nsome countries (e.g., Brazil and Mexico) have implemented policies\
    \ to regulate and prohibit the sales\nof over-the-counter antibiotics without\
    \ prescription [155]. Also, the Central Drugs Standard Control\nOrganization (CDSCO)\
    \ in India instigated Schedule H1, a stricter regulation, unlike Schedule 1, in\
    \ a bid\nto prohibit the sales of over-the- counter antibiotics. According to\
    \ Laxminarayan and Chaudhury [156],\nSchedule 1 harbours antibiotics that must\
    \ be sold with a valid prescription issued by a registered\nmedical practitioner,\
    \ and the pharmacist is required to retain a separate register that carries the\
    \ contact\ndetails of the prescribing doctor, the name of the patient, as well\
    \ as the name and quantity of the drug\nthat is dispensed. The register is kept\
    \ for three years, and the information contained therein is subject\nto audit\
    \ by the government.\nFurthermore, the Medicine Control Council (MCC) as part\
    \ of the National Drug Policy in South Africa\nsubscribes to the World Health\
    \ Organization Certification scheme. It is mandated to register and relicense,\n\
    conduct dossier-based medicine evaluation and laboratory-based testing of all\
    \ medicines utilized in\nthe country in conformity to the criteria for medical\
    \ evaluation and good manufacturing practice.\nMoreover, Essential Drug Lists\
    \ (EDLs) and Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) are developed as part\nof the\
    \ strategy of National Health policy (NHP) in South Africa, so as to ensure that\
    \ drugs are readily\navailable and accessible at primary care and at the hospital\
    \ level, in addition to limiting the choice of\nantibiotics use via replacement\
    \ with formularies in the public sector. Thus, the practice results rational\n\
    prescribing [157]. Gelband and Duse [158] highlighted that as a regulatory strategy\
    \ in South Africa, only\nlicensed practitioners might prescribe and/or dispense\
    \ antibiotics, and the antibiotics are available only\non prescription, but not\
    \ bought over the counter like in other developing countries. In the same way,\n\
    antibiotic use was substantially decreased at the primary care in Thailand, as\
    \ well as nationwide actions\nwere demonstrated to address the problem of inappropriate\
    \ antibiotic use through strengthening of\nhospital drug and therapeutics committee,\
    \ engagement in a project based on multifaceted behavioural\nchange intervention,\
    \ and updating of its essential medicine lists on a regular basis [159].\nSurveillance\
    \ is the pivot in any control strategy directed against infections in a clinical\
    \ setting and\nantimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic surveillance is regarded as\
    \ the keystone in endorsing antibiotic\nstewardship, and eases the control of\
    \ antibiotic resistance. It is also considered as the force behind\nthe programmes\
    \ geared towards antimicrobial resistance, since it generates reliable and crucial\
    \ data\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n16 of 48\nthat can be used to formulate policies\
    \ on antibiotic use to promote accurate prescriptions of drugs [160].\nAccording\
    \ to the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership—India [161], real changes in\
    \ antibiotic\nconsumption or dissemination of resistant bacteria can only be appreciated\
    \ and/or supported when\nthe resistance level is known and tracked over time,\
    \ unlike undergoing any type of surveillance.\nHence, surveillance of antibiotic\
    \ resistance complements the surveillance of antibiotic use, and obtained\ndata\
    \ can be implemented to evaluate the success of intervention programmes. Therefore,\
    \ salient data\nrequired for clinical decision making and national policies can\
    \ be assembled via surveillance of\nantibiotic use and antibiotic resistance [162].\n\
    According to Lowmann [163], the clinical microbiology laboratory undertakes a\
    \ central role in\nachieving the key motives of antibiotic stewardship by providing\
    \ data on culture and susceptibility\nof the speciﬁc patient, and insights for\
    \ surveillance activities that guides the selection of antibiotics\nfor empirical\
    \ therapy. Monitoring the consumption of antibiotics is inevitable, as it generates\
    \ data\nthat can assist in the design and evaluation of interventions aimed at\
    \ optimizing the use of these\nantibiotics and prevent rising resistance [155].\
    \ The World Health Organisation [164] and the Global\nAction Plan [165] advocated\
    \ that the quantity and pattern of antibiotics consumed should be monitored\n\
    as part of surveillance. Pereko and colleagues [160] analyzed prescription claims\
    \ data and sales data\nfrom 2008 to 2011 in the private sector in Namibia to obtain\
    \ the number of prescriptions that contained\nantibiotics and the volume of units\
    \ sold. The ﬁndings highlighted the highest antibiotic consumption\nby females\
    \ (53%), followed by individuals of age, 18–45 years (41%) and 34% in Windhoek,\
    \ with\ncombined therapy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as the post prevalent\
    \ agents used which belong to\nthe family of penicillins.\nOn the other hand,\
    \ surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is equally paramount, and should be\n\
    conducted continuously in order to gain insight into the problem on time, because\
    \ resistance is evolving.\nIt is deﬁned as the continuous, systematic gathering,\
    \ analysis, and interpretation of health-related data\nto monitor and describe\
    \ an event [166]. Surveillance provides current and salient information needed\n\
    to develop and monitor antibiotic stewardship programmes, antibiotic formularies,\
    \ infection control\npolicies, public health interventions, novel antimicrobials,\
    \ and antibiotic therapy guidelines [167]. It can\nbe executed at the local, regional,\
    \ national or international level, involving the monitoring of a single\nbacterial\
    \ infection or the organism, as well as it can be effected based on funds offered\
    \ by companies or\nnon-proﬁtable organizations [168,169]. The procedure provides\
    \ data on the antibiotic-resistant bacteria,\nresistance genes, and predict the\
    \ rise of antibiotic resistance as depicted from the trend in the antibiotic\n\
    resistance proﬁles. Surveillance represents an early-warning system which performs\
    \ fast distribution\nof crucial information to public health and regulatory authorities\
    \ regarding trends and possibility of\noutbreaks, to bring about timely response\
    \ measures [170]. Also, Essack [168] reiterated that antibiotic\nresistance surveillance\
    \ data are critically needed to update national infection control policies, essential\n\
    drug lists, and standard treatment guidelines. In addition, Critchley and Karlowsky\
    \ [170] further\nemphasized that the data obtained from surveillance and clinical\
    \ trial can be employed in association\nto determine breakpoints. Moreover, new\
    \ medical needs, as well as notorious isolates for the screening\nof new agents,\
    \ can be identiﬁed from the information contained in surveillance of antibiotic\
    \ resistance.\nIn Africa, South Africa is viewed as the only country with the\
    \ most active surveillance system. The\nsystem comprises of two main active groups,\
    \ namely; the Group for Enteric, Respiratory and Meningeal\nDisease Surveillance\
    \ (GERMS) which focuses on obtaining data centered on AIDS-related opportunistic\n\
    infections, epidemic-prone diseases, and vaccine-preventable diseases. On the\
    \ other hand, the South\nAfrican Society for Clinical Microbiology (SASCM) assembles\
    \ data from the academic hospital on\npreferred invasive pathogens secluded from\
    \ the cerebrospinal ﬂuid samples [171].\nAside from\nthese two groups, extra contributions\
    \ in the collection of data on antibiotic resistance are given\nby other groups,\
    \ including the Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Reference Centre in alliance\n\
    with the National Department of Health, the Enteric Diseases Reference United\
    \ (EDRU) etc. during\nsurveys. It is worth mentioning that the Gonococcal Antimicrobial\
    \ Surveillance Programme (GASP)\nco-ordinated by WHO in Africa was accomplished,\
    \ owing to the principal role performed by the STI\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n\
    17 of 48\nReference Centre. The STI Reference Centre has provided training and\
    \ technical assistance in isolate\ncollection and laboratories in Madagascar,\
    \ Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Namibia [158].\nFurthermore, in Nigeria, the surveillance\
    \ system for antibiotic resistance in pulmonary\ntuberculosis referred to as the\
    \ National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP)\nis commended by\
    \ Nasir and co-authors [169] as the only functioning system in which services\n\
    for drug-resistant TB is provided by four reference laboratories of the country.\
    \ Also, WHO [172]\nhas introduced the nested PCR equipment in numerous healthcare\
    \ facilities in Nigeria,\ntherefore, facilitating the molecular-based anti-TB\
    \ resistance testing regarding rifampicin resistance.\nXiao and Li [173] also\
    \ noted that the Chinese government embarked on a three-year special campaign\n\
    with the theme “Administrative regulations for the clinical use of antibiotics”\
    \ to enhance the rational use\nof antibiotics in 2011. The outcomes of a survey\
    \ conducted at the tertiary hospitals from 2010 to 2012\ninvolved reductions in\
    \ antibiotic consumption during prophylaxis in surgical processes (95% to 44.6%),\n\
    as well as in antibiotic prescriptions to outpatients (22% to 14.7%) and inpatients\
    \ (68.9% to 54%).\nII.\nAgricultural sector\nAntibiotic use for essentially non-medical\
    \ or non-therapeutic purposes in agricultural settings that\nare at subtherapeutic\
    \ levels over an extended period is observed as a major route for the advent\n\
    of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and resistance genes\
    \ have been reported\nto be transferred to humans [174]. Irrational or non-prudent\
    \ use of antibiotics in food-producing\nanimals have resulted in antibiotic residues\
    \ in animal-derived products. Therefore, antimicrobial\nstewardship is equally\
    \ implemented to ensure prudent antibiotic use in agriculture, in order to conserve\n\
    and maintain the effectiveness of available antibiotics, as well as curb the problem\
    \ of antibiotic\nresistance and residues in food products derived from animal\
    \ [175]. Sadly, stewardship interventions\nin developing countries have often\
    \ been weakened by the attitude of poorly paid veterinarians who\nseek supplementary\
    \ incomes from drug sales, plus the existence of inadequate regulations [25,176].\n\
    Summarily, all stakeholders involved in the fight against antibiotic resistance\
    \ must address it from\nthe stand point of regulations, surveillance, research,\
    \ treatment guidelines, infection control, education,\nand awareness [177]. The\
    \ National Farmed Animal Health and Welfare Council [178] pointed out that\nthe\
    \ implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in agriculture can be approached\
    \ from the following\nperspectives, including clinical microbiology, infection\
    \ control (biosecurity), regulations, surveillance\non antibiotic use and resistance,\
    \ animal management, husbandry, and alternatives to antibiotics. A\ncoordinated\
    \ network of actions from the veterinarians, livestock producers, pharmacists,\
    \ veterinary\npharmaceutical industries, and regulatory authorities are relevant\
    \ to enforce prudent antibiotic use [179].\nFollowing the Global Action Plan on\
    \ antimicrobial resistance [28] and the Global principles\nfor the containment\
    \ of antibiotic resistance in animals intended for food presented by WHO [180],\n\
    nations are expected to implement measures that are in line with the key actions\
    \ highlighted for\nthe combat of antimicrobial resistance. Accordingly, Walsh\
    \ and Wu [181] expressed the interdict\non the use of colistin (an antibiotic\
    \ critical for the treatment of infections caused by highly resistant\nGram-negative\
    \ bacteria in humans) as a feed additive for animals in China. More elaborately,\
    \ some\nEuropean countries, including Sweden, Denmark, United Kingdom, Netherlands,\
    \ etc. introduced bans\non the use of antimicrobial growth promoters [36], while\
    \ Australia and New Zealand implemented\na partial ban. Seemingly, in the United\
    \ States, the restraint on antimicrobial growth promoters is\nvoluntary. In addition,\
    \ a tripartite alliance involving WHO, World Organisation of Animal Health\n(OIE),\
    \ and Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) was formed\
    \ in 2003,\nwhich led to the categorization of veterinary medicines into critically\
    \ important, highly important,\nand important drugs for human health. This differentiation\
    \ is to guide their use in animal agriculture\nacross the globe, hence, combating\
    \ antimicrobial resistance.\nAlso, some developing countries do not have national\
    \ limits for antibiotic residues found in\nanimal-derived food, and thus, rely\
    \ on international maximum residue limits (MRLs). Therefore,\nin this continuous\
    \ ﬁght against antibiotic resistance, the joint FAO/WHO expert committee and\n\
    Molecules 2018, 23, 795\n18 of 48\nCodex Alimentarius Commission updated the MRLs\
    \ of veterinary drugs in foods of animal origin [79].\nLikewise, the Ministry\
    \ of Health and Family Welfare in India amended the Drugs and Cosmetics\nregulations,\
    \ 1945, and set withdrawal limits for drugs used in animal farming. The ministry\
    \ further\nemphasized that drug producing companies should equally imprint the\
    \ withdrawal periods on\nthe containers of drugs meant for animal consumption;\
    \ however, if not provided, a withdrawal period\nof not less than 28 days should\
    \ be considered [182].\nIt is worth mentioning that the drug delivery system and\
    \ the priorities and demands of a country\nvary from one country to another across\
    \ the world, thereby causing governments to outline regulations or\npolicies or\
    \ measures according to their local scheme [183]. Mehrotra et al. [184] found\
    \ that Health Canada\nhas strengthened the veterinary drug regulatory framework\
    \ in a bid to enhance antibiotic stewardship.\nThese were accomplished via increased\
    \ control over imported veterinary drugs and active pharmaceutical\ningredients\
    \ (API), a compulsory annual compilation of veterinary antibiotic sales by manufacturers,\n\
    importers, and compounders. Lastly, it created easy access to low-risk veterinary\
    \ health products\n(e.g., vitamins, botanicals, traditional medicines, minerals)\
    \ which serve as alternatives to antibiotics.\nAlso, antibiotic prescription and\
    \ administration to farm animals are supervised by veterinarians,\nand several\
    \ behavioral studies have proven that the attitude of farmers to antibiotic use\
    \ is\ngreatly inﬂuenced by the veterinarians.\nTherefore, interventions geared\
    \ toward the change of\nprescribing behaviour of the veterinary could go a long\
    \ way to optimize antibiotic use by farmers.\nHowever, the determinant factors,\
    \ including a personal opinion regarding the contribution of\nveterinary medicines\
    \ in antibiotic resistance, professional ethics to alleviate animal suffering,\n\
    ﬁnancial dependence on clients, amongst others, have been noted to inﬂuence the\
    \ prescribing\nbehaviour of the veterinarian [185]. Also, Henton et al. [186]\
    \ emphasized that the registration\nof over-the-counter drugs for sales is not\
    \ optional in South Africa, and the drugs are distributed by the\nmanufacturers\
    \ to veterinary wholesalers, farmers’ cooperatives, distributors, and feed mix\
    \ companies.\nAlso, Lee et al. [187] affirmed that educational programs should\
    \ be conducted for undergraduate medical\nand non-medical students in line with\
    \ generic medicines, mechanism of antibiotic resistance, and prudent\nuse of antibiotics.\n\
    Strategies to reduce or limit the therapeutic use of antibiotics in animals via\
    \ improved animal\nnutrition, improved living conditions and waste management,\
    \ biosecurity measures, and improvement\nin animals’ natural immunity can result\
    \ in infection prevention and control.\nThese strategies,\nhowever, will reduce\
    \ the level and type of antibiotic needed for treatment, because once the animal\n\
    is exposed to infection, its immune system can ﬁght seriously against the agent,\
    \ resulting in less\nsevere manifestations [176]. Moreover, reductions in antibiotic\
    \ consumption can be achieved by\nusing non-antibiotic alternatives, including\
    \ prebiotics, probiotics, bacteriocins, vaccines, innate\nimmune system potentiators,\
    \ bacteriophages, and competitive exclusion cultures for non-speciﬁc\nand speciﬁc\
    \ control of enteric pathogens in animals [188]. Nevertheless, guided interventions,\
    \ such as\nvaccination, antihelminthic therapy, optimized herd management, improved\
    \ biosecurity measures,\nprudent antibiotic use, performed as teamwork involving\
    \ the farmers and veterinarians, have led to a\nmarked curtail in antibiotic use,\
    \ especially the critically important antibiotics, with a decrease of 52%\nand\
    \ 32% of the pigs from birth to slaughter and breeding animals, respectively [189].\n\
    According to Silbergeld\net al.\n[190], the largest consumption of antibiotics\
    \ is found in\nthe production of food animals. The documentation of resistant\
    \ and multidrug-resistant pathogens\nin food animals poses threats to public health\
    \ and food security [191].\nAlso, the ﬁndings of\nthe investigation conducted\
    \ by Chantziaras et al. [192] revealed a strong correlation between the\nlevel\
    \ of speciﬁc antibiotics used and the level of resistance in E. coli strains recovered\
    \ from pigs, cattle,\nand poultry of seven European countries. Therefore, data\
    \ collection of antibiotic use is necessary\nto understand and counteract antibiotic\
    \ resistance. The monitoring of antibiotic use is crucial in\ndetermining the\
    \ appropriateness of the drugs in use, detect compliance with prudent drug practice,\n\
    programmes, or regulations [193]. It can equally contribute in the process of\
    \ optimizing antibiotic\nuse by identifying the most efﬁcient interventions. In\
    \ addition, monitoring of antibiotic use creates\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n19\
    \ of 48\ntolerance in analyzing the temporal trend of antibiotic consumption,\
    \ and of remarkable interest is\nthe data collected on antibiotic use per animal\
    \ species. For instance, Schaekel et al. [194] investigated\nthe distribution\
    \ of antibiotic use per pig age group and active substances (in percentages) used\n\
    in overall treatment in pig holdings in Germany over a two-year period. The authors\
    \ found that\nthe types or combination of antibiotics employed varied between\
    \ the age groups, and the fattening\npig experienced a decreasing trend in treatment,\
    \ but no distinct temporal trend was obtained for\nthe weaners and sucklers. The\
    \ quantiﬁcation of antibiotic use in conjunction with data on antibiotic\nresistance\
    \ can pave the way for targeted research and development. This is because the\
    \ data can be\nused to describe temporal associations between antibiotic use and\
    \ antibiotic resistance, as well as offer\nevidence for their links to researchers\
    \ and policy/decision makers [195].\nSurveillance produces reliable data, and\
    \ it can be approached from various angles; the antibiotic\nresistance of pathogens\
    \ or commensal bacteria, antibiotic use in the treatment of diseases and\nnon-therapeutic\
    \ uses [196]. The surveillance systems for antibiotic consumption are not standardized\n\
    and differ from one country to the next. These systems may include; DANMAP (Danish\
    \ Integrated\nAntimicrobial Monitoring and Resistance programme, Kongens Lyngby,\
    \ Denmark), MARAN (Monitoring\nof Antimicrobial Resistance and Antibiotic usage\
    \ in Animals in Wageningen, The Netherlands),\nand SANVAD (South African National\
    \ Veterinary Surveillance and Monitoring Programme for Resistance\nto Antimicrobial\
    \ Drugs, Pretoria, South Africa). Systems designed for antibiotic consumption\
    \ can\nbe automated systems or randomized ﬁeld studies, as well as nationwide\
    \ or cross-sectional or\nlongitudinal studies, which focus on analyzing the sample\
    \ population of farms [194]. On the other hand,\nthe cross-sectional studies can\
    \ be differentiated into national or regional studies. Overall, these studies\n\
    are heterogenous, and cannot be compared as they consist of differences, including\
    \ the duration of data\ncollection (yearly, half a year, or even days), different\
    \ calculation and reporting methods, along with\nthe stratiﬁcation in the production\
    \ systems and farm types [194]. Furthermore, some systems monitor\nand collect\
    \ data only at the farm level, making it possible for the implementation of benchmarking\n\
    approaches, whereby farmers or veterinarians are compared and ranked as stated\
    \ by their level of\nantibiotic use. By so doing, measures that are relevant to\
    \ reduce consumption in the top antibiotic\nusers are introduced or implemented\
    \ [197].\nIn addition, Adesokan et al. [198] surveyed the different classes of\
    \ antimicrobials administered\nto food animals in South Western Nigeria, and noted\
    \ that tetracyclines, ﬂuoroquinolones, and followed\nby beta-lactam/aminoglycosides,\
    \ were consumed in order of decreasing volume, and mostly in rainy\nseason than\
    \ dry season. In addition, World Organisation for Animal Health highlighted that\
    \ 94% of\nAfrican Countries lack an ofﬁcial surveillance system on the use of\
    \ antimicrobials in animals [199].\nHowever, though the survey of antimicrobial\
    \ use in developing countries is inadequate, it demonstrates\na high level of\
    \ farmer prescription, purchase of over-the-counter antibiotics, non-compliance\
    \ to\nantibiotic withdrawal periods, and drug counterfeiting [25,167,175].\nSurveillance\
    \ of antibiotic resistance is a vital tool for microbial risk assessment, and\
    \ the data\ngenerated enlighten the understanding of resistance epidemiology,\
    \ as well as calls for prompt, effective,\nand early control actions from the\
    \ government, and also monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of\npolicies implemented\
    \ by the government [200]. According to Dar et al. [201], and Gelband and\nDuse\
    \ [158], only a few national, cross-sectional studies on antibiotic resistance\
    \ of animal-recovered\nisolates have been carried out in low- and middle-income\
    \ countries and South Africa, respectively.\nHowever, the surveillance systems\
    \ differ between countries and/or agencies, due to variation in\nagricultural\
    \ practices, monitoring needs, and available guidelines [177]. Furthermore, an\
    \ integrated\nsurveillance of drug-resistant bacteria obtained from humans, food-producing\
    \ animals, food and\nother environmental sites, synchronized with the monitoring\
    \ system for antibiotic use, can assist in\nthe containment of antibiotic resistance.\
    \ This is described as the “One Health Approach” intended to\nattain optimal health\
    \ for humans, domesticated animals, wildlife, plants, and our environment [29,196].\n\
    The ﬁrst ever integrated animal–human surveillance system was created in Denmark,\
    \ known as\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n20 of 48\nDANMAP (Danish Integrated Antimicrobial\
    \ Monitoring and Resistance Programme) which addresses\nthe problem of antibiotic\
    \ resistance with bacteria of food, animal, and human origin [201].\nIII.\nChallenges\
    \ Faced by Developing Countries Regarding Surveillance Systems\nA satisfactory\
    \ and comprehensive survey is needed to understand the epidemiology of antibiotic\n\
    resistance in both animals and humans. Even though the global action plan by WHO/OIE/FAO\n\
    to contain antimicrobial resistance requires each nation or country to implement\
    \ national action\nplans, developing countries are still to develop a sustainable\
    \ surveillance system of antibiotic use and\nantibiotic resistance [202]. The\
    \ challenges regarding the surveillance system include:\n1.\nThe countries have\
    \ just a few laboratories with the potential to conduct quality-assured\nmicrobiology\
    \ and drug sensitivity testing.\nrdal et al. [203] strongly afﬁrmed that collection\n\
    and reporting of data and the strengthening of laboratory capacity are the two\
    \ related issues\nin surveillance.\n2.\nDue to the high burden of infectious diseases\
    \ and low socioeconomic status of these countries,\nthere is a lack of available\
    \ resources [204]. According to Nasir et al. [169], the developing\ncountries\
    \ lack the funds to purchase reagents and consumables essential for testing antibiotic\n\
    resistance, thus lack necessary plans for the surveillance of antibiotic-resistant\
    \ bacteria. The cost\nnecessary for the adequate surveillance, together with the\
    \ small margin proﬁts in the veterinary\nsector presents a ﬁnancial drawback to\
    \ support surveillance in the veterinary and agricultural\nsector [166].\n3.\n\
    There is a discrepancy in the selection of isolates. Most of the isolates are\
    \ from clinical cases\nthat are sick individuals (human or animals). Therefore,\
    \ the sample of isolrates is biased toward\na more resistant isolate, owing to\
    \ the previous antibiotic therapy administered. Also, only a\nfew isolates are\
    \ involved, since the veterinarian decides on the individual animals to refer\
    \ to\nthe laboratory. Consequently, the proportion of the isolates is not a representative\
    \ of the bacteria\nstrains under survey taken from animals [200].\n4.\nAlso, relatively\
    \ few studies have been conducted on animal-recovered isolates, as well as the\
    \ criteria\nfor testing isolates differ between countries, likewise, the antibiotics\
    \ that are tested [158,201].\n5.\nEither at the regional, national, and local\
    \ levels, there exists variation in obtaining data, owing\nto differences in laboratory\
    \ protocols, conditions employed for testing, personnel conducting\nthe drug sensitivity\
    \ assay, antibiotic policies, quality control and assurance of the laboratory,\n\
    and considerations regarding breakpoints. In reality, there are no well-known\
    \ breakpoints for\nthe animal, which results in the adoption of breakpoints values\
    \ from human medicines. Nevertheless,\nthe standard protocols and breakpoints\
    \ from the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) have\nbeen adopted by\
    \ most countries [200].\n6.\nThese countries also lack stringent and comprehensive\
    \ policies and plans to circumvent antibiotic\nresistance. They lack enforcement\
    \ of regulations regarding prudent antibiotic use, since many are\nstill faced\
    \ with the problem of purchasing drugs over the counter or without a prescription\
    \ [161],\nand the presence of counterfeit drugs [158,196]. Nevertheless, even\
    \ if some data are collected,\nthey fail to translate the surveillance data into\
    \ policy, especially in South Africa [9].\n7.\nAt the national level, there is\
    \ a lack of collaborative measures between the different laboratories\nregarding\
    \ surveillance of antibiotic resistance, which might hamper efforts to track emerging\n\
    resistance and also limit the chances of systematic comparison and evaluation\
    \ of national activities\ndirected toward the containment of antibiotic resistance.\n\
    3.1. Antibiotic Resistance in Livestock Farming\nAccording to Woolhouse et al.\
    \ [205], antibiotic resistance in livestock farming can be looked\nat from four\
    \ different viewpoints, i.e., the animals (cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep) and animal-derived\n\
    products, farm workers, and farm environmental sites (water, soil, feeds, wastewater,\
    \ sewage, lagoon,\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n21 of 48\nmanure, and sludge after\
    \ treatment). All these constitute the several compartments and different\nniches\
    \ in the farm described as an ecosystem [127]. Undoubtedly, farm animals are a\
    \ very important\ncomponent in understanding the interplay between humans, animals,\
    \ and the environment regarding\nbacteria, antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance\
    \ gene movement [205]. The digestive tract of animals, like\nhumans (farm workers),\
    \ is colonized with diverse microorganisms, including commensals and resistant\n\
    bacteria. Thus, it serves as the most important reservoir of microorganisms. Therefore,\
    \ it can play\na vital role in the dissemination and acquisition of resistant\
    \ bacteria and their resistance genes [127].\nShobrak and Abo-Amer [206] noted\
    \ the occurrence of multidrug-resistant E. coli and E. vulneris in\ncloacal samples\
    \ of both migrating and non-migrating birds which served as carriers. Through\
    \ the release\nof their fecal residues into water bodies and other environmental\
    \ sources, it could enable the spread\nof these resistant bacterial strains and\
    \ their resistance determinants even to remote areas by means of\nmigration. The\
    \ anatomical feature of the gut varies between poultry and the other mammalian\
    \ animals,\nwhich in turn influences the intestinal microbiome [207]. The intestinal\
    \ microbiome changes with age,\nthe type of diet fed, antibiotics ingested, infection\
    \ with pathogens, amongst other life events [208]. It has\nbeen reported that\
    \ microorganisms in the gut interact extensively with the host, diet, and the\
    \ intestinal\ngut microbes, and exert a huge impact on the animal’s immunity and\
    \ physiology, and ultimately affects\nthe health of the animal and its production\
    \ [209].\nThe continuous antibiotic exposure to animals via oral administration\
    \ creates selective pressure\nfor the development of resistance, and resistant\
    \ bacteria associated with animals can then enter into\nthe food chain through\
    \ the consumption of meat (contaminated during slaughter or processing\nof carcass,\
    \ if the gut is accidentally cut or intestine empties its contents into the thoracic\
    \ and\nabdominal cavities when the carcass of poultry is gutted during processing)\
    \ or other animal-derived\nproducts, through farm runoff water and other means.\
    \ However, the greater the quantity of antibiotic\nused, the higher the selective\
    \ pressure. Van et al. [210] reiterated that food contaminated with\nantibiotic-resistant\
    \ bacteria could cause ampliﬁcation of resistance genes and facilitate the transfer\
    \ of\nthe antibiotic resistance determinants to other bacteria of clinical importance\
    \ found in humans, and can\nbe further transferred within humans to more pathogenic\
    \ bacteria. Therefore, food or animal-derived\nproducts, including meat, milk,\
    \ and eggs, may represent an active and key medium through which\nantibiotic resistance\
    \ determinants are continually being transferred between bacteria, and from animals\n\
    to humans [123]. Bosco et al. [211] clearly documented the multidrug resistance\
    \ of Salmonella isolates\nrecovered from cattle, pigs, chickens, eggs, and animal-derived\
    \ products, as well as cross-species\ntransmission of plasmids between animal\
    \ and humans in Uganda.\nAlso, the farm environment is composed of environmental\
    \ sites, such as manure, wastewater, soils,\neffluent, and sewage, which serve\
    \ as hotspots for antibiotic resistance pollution. More specifically, Bester\n\
    and Essack [39] indicated that animals are very exposed at a high degree to their\
    \ environment, making it\neasier for them to be infected with bacteria harboring\
    \ problematic genetic material, especially from the soil\nenvironment. In the\
    \ same light, animal urine and feces containing antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant\n\
    bacteria, and resistance genes may be released into manure, and animals might,\
    \ in turn, be allowed to\ngraze on pasture grown on soil fertilized with this\
    \ raw manure. This, therefore, creates the likelihood of\nbringing back these\
    \ xenobiotics to animals and humans [127].\nNevertheless, manure, which has been\
    \ described as a hotspot for antibiotic resistance bacteria and\nantibiotic resistance\
    \ genes, can serve as a plausible route of transmission of these resistant bacteria\
    \ and\ntheir genes into the soil and water via deliberate or accidental processes\
    \ [212]. Therefore, it is advised\nthat manure should be treated before land application\
    \ via biological methods, including anaerobic\ndigestion. However, Resende et\
    \ al. [213] in their ﬁndings noted the prevalence and persistence of\npotentially\
    \ pathogenic bacteria which demonstrated multidrug resistance against oxacillin,\
    \ ampicillin,\nand levoﬂoxacin, amongst other antibiotics, both in the inﬂuent\
    \ (cattle manure) and efﬂuent (digestate)\nreleased from an anaerobic biodigester.\
    \ The authors suggested that the rate of survival of these\nbacteria depended\
    \ on the temperature of the operating process in association with the duration\
    \ of\nthe fermentation process and the microbial composition. Ostensibly, Maynaud\
    \ et al. [214] further\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n22 of 48\nconﬁrmed the occurrence\
    \ of enteric pathogenic bacteria in the digestate obtained from the anaerobic\n\
    biodigester. The authors emphasized the potential of the viable, but non-cultural\
    \ state of bacteria,\nwhich might cause the regrowth of pathogens during digestate\
    \ storage, prior to land spreading.\nConsequently, the need of post treatment\
    \ of digestate via mechanical, chemical, physical, and biological\nmethods is\
    \ very vital [215]. In addition, the sanitary risk and microbiological safety\
    \ of digestate should\nbe evaluated before land application of digestate, in a\
    \ bid to dodge the ecological, human, animal,\nand environmental health implications.\
    \ Nevertheless, it is a call for concern when pathogenic bacteria\nare present\
    \ alongside with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in untreated or treated animal\
    \ manure.\nAlternatively, the very common and economic approach to manage manure\
    \ generated from\nlivestock farming is by application on nearby agricultural ﬁelds.\
    \ However, raw manure can be ﬂushed\nby heavy rainfall or runoffs from the surface\
    \ of manure-amended soils into nearby water bodies\nused by humans for sanitation\
    \ and domestic purposes [216]. Moreover, due to the constraints on\navailable\
    \ freshwater resources in developing countries, wastewater serves as a vital source\
    \ of water\nand nutrients for irrigation of agricultural ﬁelds, in a bid to circumvent\
    \ the problem of food insecurity\nin these countries [217]. However, wastewater\
    \ may inﬁltrate into groundwater, causing pollution and\ncontamination with toxic\
    \ chemicals, antibiotics, and organic matter. In addition, owing to the lack of\n\
    or inefﬁcient wastewater treatment plants, wastewater or improperly treated wastewater\
    \ is mostly\nreleased into surface water bodies that act as reservoirs for domestic\
    \ and industrial wastes, causing\npollution [218].\n3.2. Antibiotic Resistance\
    \ in the Soil Environment\nThe soil is an ecosystem and a natural resource with\
    \ unique biodiversity, taking into consideration\nabundance, quantities of species,\
    \ and functions of organisms [218,219]. With respect to total biomass,\nmicroorganisms\
    \ are considered as the principal part of the soil community, and are basically\n\
    responsible for decomposition of organic matter, degradation of toxic compounds,\
    \ and nutrient\ntransformation [218]. Interestingly, the soil is composed of microorganisms\
    \ that produce antibiotic by\nso doing; it can equally serve as a reservoir of\
    \ antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes [220,221].\nThe soil serves\
    \ as a hub to establish connections between the air, water, rocks, and organisms,\n\
    and it is involved in many different functions termed ecosystem services in the\
    \ natural world [222].\nThus, it can be described as quite a large reservoir of\
    \ antibiotic resistance determinants, since it\nincludes the antibiotic resistance\
    \ determinants found in all plants, fungi, soil bacteria, small animals,\nand\
    \ protists [222]. In addition, Reisenfeld et al. [20] indicated that uncultured\
    \ soil bacteria are\na possible reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes with\
    \ greater diversity as compared to previous\nﬁndings, and such diversity can be\
    \ ascertained and fathomed using culture-independent methods.\nFurthermore, vegetables\
    \ grown in unfertilized soil were equally shown to harbour antibiotic-resistant\n\
    bacteria and resistance determinants that naturally occur in soils [97].\nIt is\
    \ somewhat obvious that the abundance and the mobility of antibiotic-resistant\
    \ bacteria and\nresistance determinants in the soil can be greatly inﬂuenced by\
    \ the application of manure (containing\nantibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant\
    \ bacteria, and their resistance genes on mobile elements) during\nfertilization\
    \ of the soil, the use of wastewater (black or grey water) for the irrigation\
    \ of agricultural\nlands, and the use of antibiotics to treat crop diseases [4,223].\
    \ More speciﬁcally, when soils are treated\nor amended, antibiotics and their\
    \ degraded metabolites, as well as antibiotic-resistant bacteria and\ntheir corresponding\
    \ resistance genes, are introduced into the soil environment. Therefore, transfer\
    \ of\nantibiotic resistance genes becomes inevitably fast, owing to the rapid\
    \ growth of bacteria and HGT [224].\nHowever, the persistence and the rate of\
    \ dissipation of the antibiotic resistance genes is dependent on\nthe VGT/HGT\
    \ of ARG, the transport and viability of the bacteria harbouring the genes, whether\
    \ the\nfree DNA obtained from cell lysis will be degraded, adsorbed to soil or\
    \ organic matter, or acquired by\nnew cells, as well as the transportation of\
    \ the extracellular ARG [56]. However, the introduction into\nthe soil environment\
    \ via manure fertilization has been reported to cause an alteration in phylogenetic\n\

    \ and disturbance in ecological function (e.g., nutrient cycling)\nin the microenvironment\
    \ [49,212,225].\nAlso, the degree or extent of the changes impacted on the soil\
    \ will depend on the type of manure.\nIn details, varying quantities of antibiotics\
    \ are employed in livestock, and the quantity depends on\nthe species of animals\
    \ and the kind of farming system. The level of antibiotics found in manure\navailable\
    \ for a land application depends on manure management practices, which equally\
    \ vary\ndepending on the size of the herd, the type of livestock and farm operations,\
    \ as well as the production\nstage of the animals [56]. According to Chee-Sanford\
    \ et al. [56], the introduction of antibiotics in\nthe soil may give a selective\
    \ advantage to commensal bacteria harbouring resistance genes, or may\ncreate\
    \ selective pressure, necessitating the acquisition of resistance genes in the\
    \ commensal population.\nNumerous authors have characterized antibiotic-resistant\
    \ bacteria and resistance genes from\nvegetables, including lettuce, cabbage,\
    \ radish, green corn, onion, carrot, and fluted pumpkins grown on\nmanure fertilized\
    \ soils and irrigated with wastewater [97,223,226]. Speciﬁcally, Bonyadian et\
    \ al. [227],\nin a study in Iran, demonstrated the presence of antibiotic-resistant\
    \ verotoxigenic E. coli on vegetable\nsamples collected randomly from retail shops.\
    \ However, Kumar et al. [228] indicated that these\nvegetables absorb antibiotic\
    \ contained in the manure. Therefore, the direct consumption by humans\n(uncooked\
    \ or raw) of vegetables might lead to the transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria\
    \ and\ntheir resistance genes, which may cause bacterial infections. Notwithstanding,\
    \ Beuchat [229] and\nJohannessen et al. [230] suggested that the contamination\
    \ of vegetable leaves may arise from diverse\nsources, such as manure, soil, water\
    \ (for irrigation and cleaning), the handling equipment for product\nharvesting\
    \ and processing, the mode of transportation, in addition to animals at both the\
    \ pre- and\npost-harvest process.\n3.3. Antibiotic Resistance in the Water Environment\n\
    Microorganisms (speciﬁcally, bacteria) do not live in isolation [4], but are found\
    \ in milieu/medium\n(humans, air, water, plants, and soil) known as their habitat\
    \ (aquatic ecosystem), which offers them\nwith the appropriate nutritional and\
    \ growth requirements necessary for survival. Consequently, water\nrepresents\
    \ one of the most important habitats for bacteria on the planet earth, and serves\
    \ as a main natural\nroute for the dissemination of microorganisms between different\
    \ environmental compartments and/or\naquatic ecosystems, humans, and other animals\
    \ [231,232]. According to Taylor et al. [233], the aquatic\nenvironment is considered\
    \ as a fundamental setting for environmental release, transformation,\nmixing,\
    \ and persistence of antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and antibiotic\
    \ resistance\ngenes. The water (aquatic) environment can be subdivided into marine\
    \ and fresh water based on\nsalinity, average temperature, depth, and nutrient\
    \ content [234]. More elaborately, the microbial\naquatic environment includes\
    \ surface and ground waters, drinking water, tap water, and wastewater.\nThese\
    \ waters have dynamic and distinct bacterial composition patterns inﬂuenced by\
    \ temporal and\nspatial unevenness in physicochemical and biotic factors, including\
    \ environmental stresses and nutrient\ncomposition [232,235]. Nevertheless, some\
    \ known waterborne bacteria include E. coli, Vibrio, Shigella,\nand Salmonella\
    \ species [236]. The aquatic environment has been reported to be the origin and\
    \ reservoir\nof antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes [231,237].\n\
    Microbial communities respond to drastic changes in the ecosystem functioning,\
    \ species\ncomposition and abundance, due to pollution [238,239], resulting in\
    \ hypoxia, eutrophication,\nbioaccumulation and dissemination of pathogens [240].\
    \ Consequently, the abundance of antibiotic\nresidues and pool of antibiotic-resistant\
    \ bacteria and their resistance genes in aquatic ecosystems can\nbe inﬂuenced\
    \ or altered or ampliﬁed by the discharge of wastewaters from industrial and municipal\n\
    wastewater treatment plants, runoff from manure-fertilized agricultural land,\
    \ leakage from septic\ntanks and broken sewage pipes, and feces from wildlife,\
    \ into water bodies [97,118,223,241].\nFurthermore, the aquatic environments offer\
    \ ecological and economic benefits [240]. Rivers serve\nas predominant sources\
    \ of renewable water for freshwater ecosystems and humans, wherein they\nperform\
    \ functions such as in irrigation, and are used as drinking water and for recreation\
    \ [242]. Water is\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n24 of 48\nindispensable to life. Therefore,\
    \ humans need clean and safe drinking water to protect their health from\nwaterborne\
    \ bacterial infections [236]. Water safe for human consumption needs to be free\
    \ of pathogenic\nbacteria, although, the existence of pathogenic bacteria in water\
    \ is intermittent, changeable, and at low\nlevels, coupled with the fact that\
    \ the isolation and cultivation of pathogenic bacteria from water sources\nare\
    \ not straightforward. Therefore, routine microbiological water analysis does\
    \ not involve the detection\nof pathogenic bacteria [236]. Interestingly, Enterococci\
    \ and E. coli have been used in monitoring the fecal\ncontamination of drinking\
    \ and recreational water [235]. Nevertheless, fecal pollution of water sources\
    \ is\nan increasing problem both in the developed and developing countries. In\
    \ the latter countries, there may\nbe an increase in the occurrence of pathogenic\
    \ bacteria in river water near large urban populations, due to\ninept sewage treatment,\
    \ fast-growing population, low income, and severe water stress. Hence, infection\n\
    rates tend to be high, with waterborne pathogens [243]. Mulamattathil et al. [243]\
    \ recovered coliforms\nand heterotrophic bacteria, as well as antibiotic-resistant\
    \ Aeromonas and Pseudomonas species from surface\nand drinking water in Mafikeng,\
    \ South Africa. The occurrence of these pathogens in drinking water might\nindicate\
    \ serious health implications, especially among the immunocompromised individuals\
    \ [244,245].\n(a)\nRecreational waters and antibiotic resistance\nRecreation has\
    \ a pertinent role in the life of the human population, who always tend to couple\n\
    the scene with water, be it man-made or natural. It has been reported that antibiotic\
    \ resistant bacteria\ncan equally be transmitted to humans during recreational\
    \ use of fresh or marine water, which are\nnatural aquatic habitats [246]. The\
    \ natural aquatic environment, e.g., the surface waters, such as\nrivers and sea,\
    \ serve as a receiving body of runoff water from farmlands fertilized with sewage\n\
    sludge and animal manure, and wastewater discharged from treatment plants, which\
    \ contain obvious\nconcentrations of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their resistance\
    \ determinants, along with biologically\nactive metabolites of antibiotics or\
    \ the parent compounds [247]. This causes great environmental\ndamage and eutrophication,\
    \ which might result in serious degradation of the water quality owing\nto the\
    \ inﬂux of high nutrients [248]. The quality of recreational water can be evaluated\
    \ using fecal\nindicator bacteria, including E. coli and Enterococcus. Restricted\
    \ to these two bacteria, the prevalence\nof antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the\
    \ natural aquatic environment is always underestimated, because\nall the studies\
    \ are geared towards measuring antibiotic resistance in the aforementioned culturable\n\
    bacteria. However, other bacteria are present in the natural habitat, and might\
    \ harbour antibiotic\nresistance genes which may equally contribute in the pool\
    \ of resistance genes found in the habitat, thus,\nhave the potential to disseminate\
    \ bacterial resistance [249]. This is afﬁrmed by the ﬁndings of Lihan\net al.\
    \ [250], who through culture-based methods and DNA ﬁngerprinting unraveled the\
    \ presence\nof single and multiple antibiotic-resistant Enterobacter, Serratia,\
    \ Pantoea, Klebsiella, and Citrobacter\nin water samples obtained from a recreational\
    \ river located in a resort community in Malaysia\nBorneo. Besides, the marine\
    \ settings are special areas desired for recreational purposes and resting,\n\
    and as such, are exposed to waste from residences, ships, and industries, as well\
    \ as coastal areas\nwhich are site for highly populated cities, extensive ﬁsh\
    \ farming, and recreational areas [251,252].\nThe transmission of the resistant\
    \ bacteria and the resistance genes to humans depends on the type of\nwater sport\
    \ undertaken, as well as the density of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the\
    \ water [249].\nThe concentration/magnitude of these resistant bacteria in the\
    \ recreational waters is determined\nby the local landscape (e.g., coastal waters),\
    \ wind speed, ultraviolet radiation, temperature, rainfall,\nand the source and\
    \ level of pollution [253]. In a study conducted by Overbey and colleagues [247],\n\
    higher levels of E. coli and Enterococcus were enumerated in recreational water\
    \ samples collected from\nsewage-impacted sites in ﬁve beaches in Galápagos Island,\
    \ Ecuador. In addition, Fernandes Cardoso\nde Oliveira et al. [254] revealed a\
    \ higher level of multiple antibiotic resistance in heterotrophic marine\nbacteria\
    \ recovered from sea water and sand in Gonzaguinha, the most organic polluted\
    \ recreational\nbeach, amongst Ilha Porchat and Guaraú beaches located in Southeast\
    \ Brazil.\nAlso, Alipour et al. [255] noted the presence of multiple antibiotic-resistant\
    \ Enterococcus species\ncharacterized from the river and coastal water samples\
    \ in the Northern part of Iran, therefore,\nthese habitats are not suitable for\
    \ swimming, as they would increase the risk of human exposure\nMolecules 2018,\
    \ 23, 795\n25 of 48\nto antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes. Furthermore,\
    \ Akanbi et al. [256] demonstrated\nthe multiple antibiotic resistance patterns\
    \ of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from recreational waters\nand beach sand identified\
    \ by the occurrence of mec A, fem A, rpo B, bla Z, erm B, and tet M genes,\nin\
    \ the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The beach water and sand can act\
    \ as a plausible pool for\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes,\
    \ and hence facilitate transmission via the direct ingestion\nof the seawater\
    \ and/or direct contact with sea water during recreational activities undertaken\
    \ in these\nwaters [249]. In recent times, the awareness and involvement of many\
    \ people in water sports have greatly\nincreased [257], due to an increase in\
    \ the local population and income earners, as well as tourism.\n(b)\nDrinking\
    \ water and antibiotic resistance\nMost of the population in rural settings and\
    \ urban settlements rely on untreated groundwater as\na source of drinking water,\
    \ due to the scarcity of fresh surface waters [258]. Untreated groundwater\nis\
    \ considered safe for drinking, because it originates from the ground. Therefore,\
    \ it is described\nas a natural water habitat protected from human intervention.\
    \ Apparently, its microbiota reﬂects\nthe natural population of the habitat [259].\
    \ Nevertheless, depending on the location/environment,\ngroundwater becomes vulnerable\
    \ to contamination with antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria,\n\
    and resistance genes from surface runoff of animal feces deposited on the ground\
    \ in concentrated animal\nfeeding operations, seepage of liquid/solid manure from\
    \ storage sites (lagoons), leachate from landfill\nsites, spillage from broken\
    \ sewage pipes, and leakage from septic tanks [56,118]. Also, in the North West\n\
    province of South Africa, a study conducted by Carsten [260] revealed a very poor\
    \ physicochemical\nand microbiological quality of water samples obtained from\
    \ boreholes in the Mooi River and Harts\nRiver catchment areas. The authors attributed\
    \ the results to the fecal contamination of groundwater\nwith fecal bacteria and\
    \ opportunistic bacteria that displayed different levels of antibiotic resistance.\n\
    Surprisingly, Kümmerer [118] reported that antibacterial agents found in groundwater\
    \ are of\nconsiderable low concentration. In accordance with this, Li et al. [261]\
    \ mentioned that the microbial\nconcentration in groundwater is closely associated\
    \ with its depth, season, weather conditions,\nand the type of adjacent land used\
    \ in the concentrated animal feeding operations.\nWastewater constitutes “black\
    \ water and grey water”. It describes all water with adversely\naffected quality\
    \ due to inﬂuences from human activities [262]. Wastewater embodies water from\n\
    livestock and poultry farms, aquaculture farms, and municipality that is sometimes\
    \ released into\nthe environment without treatment or used for irrigation by farmers\
    \ involved in urban agriculture,\nsince it contains significant amounts of micronutrients\
    \ and organic matter, and provides water [263,264].\nDue to the unavailability\
    \ of good quality water worldwide, farmers resort to employing wastewater for\n\
    irrigation, thereby promoting plant growth, water conservation, nutrient recycling,\
    \ and reductions in\ninorganic fertilizer applied to the soil, and polluted water\
    \ being discharged into the surroundings [265,266].\nOwing to its numerous sources\
    \ of water collection, wastewater contains diverse elements, inorganic\nmineral,\
    \ antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, human\
    \ and animal feces\nand urine, etc. [267]. The sewage or wastewater treatment\
    \ plant receives the wastewater, and partially\ntreats or treats it, before discharge\
    \ of its effluents into the environment. Therefore, the wastewater\ntreatment\
    \ plant serves as a link between human activities and the environment, and serves\
    \ as a potential\nreservoir and release channel of antibiotic-resistant bacteria\
    \ and resistance genes, giving a perfect\nopportunity for the transfer of antibiotic\
    \ resistance genes [14,268,269]. The biological processes at\nthe wastewater treatment\
    \ plant might cause a reduction in the volume of antibiotics to varying\ndegrees\
    \ [267].\nHowever, across the different regions of the world utilizing distinct\
    \ types of\nwastewater treatment, these plants have been reported to be responsible\
    \ for the discharge of about\none billion cultivable coliform bacteria into the\
    \ environment, indicating their inefﬁciency to reduce\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria\
    \ and their resistance genes [270]. Clearly, Adeﬁsoye and Okoh [268]\ndemonstrated\
    \ the occurrence of multidrug-resistant E. coli from the ﬁnal discharged efﬂuents\
    \ of two\nwastewater treatment plants situated in the Eastern Cape Province, South\
    \ Africa.\n(c)\nWaterborne\ndisease\noutbreaks\ncaused\nby\nrecreational/drinking\n\
    waters\nversus\nantibiotic resistance\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n26 of 48\nOutbreaks\
    \ of diseases implicating water as a vehicle of transmission are termed waterborne\n\
    disease outbreaks, because two or more persons are affected by a similar illness\
    \ after being exposed to\nwater, and are epidemiologically linked by time and\
    \ by location of the water [271,272]. Humans become\nvulnerable to infections\
    \ when exposed to the beaches when the waters are turbid and experiencing\nhigh\
    \ waves, as well as after heavy rainfall; these cause the waters to be contaminated\
    \ and unsafe [273].\nDepending on the environmental conditions (climactic factors)\
    \ and the characteristics of the pathogens,\nthe waterborne pathogen grows in\
    \ the aquatic habitat, however, its number, type, infectivity, and\nvirulence\
    \ is greatly inﬂuenced by the temperature, UV radiation, precipitation patterns,\
    \ and water\navailability in the recreational waters [274].\nAccording to Schets\
    \ et al. [275], the waterborne illnesses in humans associated with the use of\n\
    untreated or contaminated recreational water mainly comprise of gastroenteritis\
    \ and skin infections.\nThe authors further revealed that the bathing sites were\
    \ predisposed to fecal contamination and\nenvironmental conditions that favoured\
    \ the growth of naturally occurring pathogens. Children are\nviewed to be at a\
    \ higher risk of gastroenteritis from recreational waters, because they last longer\
    \ and\nswallow more water during swimming, as well as they play in shallow water\
    \ and sand which are most\ncontaminated, and experience a high tendency of hand\
    \ to mouth exposure [273].\nHowever, waterborne infections associated with exposure\
    \ to drinking water include acute\ngastroenteritis, typhoid, diarrhoea, acute\
    \ respiratory and neurological illness, and skin infections [272,276].\nBetween\
    \ 2000 and 2001, South Africa witnessed a surprising and the biggest cholera outbreak\
    \ in Africa,\nwhich involved 114,000 cases across nine provinces and caused 260\
    \ deaths, although it originated from\nKwaZulu Natal province [277]. Equally,\
    \ Allam et al. [278] reported an outbreak of cholera involving\n218 persons, which\
    \ attacked a greater number of children (aged 5–14 years), males, and individuals\n\
    greater than or equal to 60 years in Andhra Pradesh, India, and was caused by\
    \ the contamination\nof reservoir water with Vibrio cholerae. This outbreak claimed\
    \ three human lives. Even Biswas and\ncolleagues [279] investigated an outbreak\
    \ of cholera in Haibatpur village, India, caused by pond\nwater contaminated with\
    \ Vibrio cholerae. Ramurmutty and Sharma [280] suggested that the recurrent\n\
    outbreaks of cholera in India are due to the presence of short-term carriers of\
    \ Vibro cholerae in\nthe communities, the constant change in biotypes and serotypes\
    \ of this strain, development of\nresistance to the previous multiple antimicrobial\
    \ agents used in the treatment of cholera- as well\nas poor water quality, unhygienic\
    \ sanitation- and overcrowding.\nA shigellosis outbreak among 533 students in\
    \ a rural elementary school in China was investigated,\nand findings were linked\
    \ to the presence of Shigella flexneri 2b in untreated well water [281].\nA diarrhoea\
    \ outbreak in China caused by enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic E. coli was\
    \ noted among\n131 individuals exposed to well water contaminated by river water\
    \ [282]. Between May and August 2010\nin Southern Vietnam, Nguyen and co-authors\
    \ [283] documented an outbreak of diarrhea that infected\nseventy-one persons\
    \ through the consumption of iced tea contaminated with V. cholerae O1, altered\
    \ El Tor\nstrains. Also, Ali et al. [284] noted a typhoid fever outbreak that\
    \ affected 1430 individuals, originating\nfrom the consumption of fecally contaminated\
    \ tap water both in military camps and the general population\nlocated in Kikwit,\
    \ Democratic Republic of Congo, in 2011. In a Croatian study, Kovaˇci´c et al.\
    \ [285]\nreported an outbreak of gastroenteritis, which affected 68 persons in\
    \ a County Centre of Šibenik, caused by\nthe pollution of groundwater used for\
    \ drinking with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis.\nFortunately,\
    \ the isolates of the bacterium were susceptible to a range of antibiotics.\n\
    Furthermore, Farooqui et al. [286] documented an outbreak of typhoid fever caused\
    \ in Nek\nMuhammad village, Karachi—Pakistan, which involved over 300 hundred\
    \ people, and resulted\nin the deaths of three humans in 2004.\nThe ﬁndings in\
    \ this study associated the outbreak to\nmultidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica\
    \ serovar Typhi ingested through well water that served as the sole\nsource of\
    \ drinking water in the community, but was unacceptably polluted with dead and\
    \ decaying\nbodies of animal, fecal material, and garbage. Similarly, Ma et al.\
    \ [287] reported the waterborne\noutbreak of shigellosis in China caused by Shigella\
    \ sonnei with resistance to azithromycin, and third\nclass cephalospsorins, due\
    \ to mph (A) and bla CTX-M-14-harboring IncB/O/K/Z group transmissible\nMolecules\
    \ 2018, 23, 795\n27 of 48\nplasmid. In addition, Akoachere et al. [288] unravelled\
    \ the persistence of multidrug-resistant toxigenic\nVibrio cholerae O1 in water\
    \ samples (taps, dug wells, and streams) collected from New Bell—Doula,\nand associated\
    \ these bacteria strains with the 2010–2011 cholera epidemic that recorded the\
    \ highest\nnumber of death cases in the Littoral province of Cameroon.\nIn a nutshell,\
    \ in developing countries, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are mostly found in\n\
    animals, animal-derived food products, and agro-food environments [289]. Consequently,\
    \ most of\nthe gastrointestinal diseases of humans of public health concern including\
    \ gastroenteritis, salmonellosis,\nshigellosis, cholera, listeriosis, campylobacteriosis,\
    \ and yersiniosis are caused by pathogenic bacteria\nof public health and environmental\
    \ importance via water and/or food contaminated with feces\nof animals or patients\
    \ [236].\nThese diseases even become more complicated and severe with\nthe presence\
    \ of the antibiotic-resistant strains of the causative pathogens harbouring antibiotic\n\
    resistance genes.\nAs a result, Table 2 compiles information on the notorious\
    \ environmental\npathogens causing gastrointestinal and other diseases in humans/animals\
    \ through the consumption\nof fecally-contaminated water and/or food, their resistance\

    \ the ﬁndings obtained from several studies conducted by different\nresearchers\
    \ across the world in their quest to determine antibiotic resistance genes in\
    \ environmental\nsources, in a bid to strategically ﬁght against the problem of\
    \ rising antibiotic resistance. These ﬁndings\nwere retrieved from published articles\
    \ found in Science Direct, Pubmed, Medline databases, etc.,\nusing Google search\
    \ engine. The search was done in a systematic way, and the search query term was\n\
    modiﬁed using related terms to maximize accuracy. It can be depicted from Table\
    \ 2, that antibiotic\nresistance is a global challenge, and needs to be addressed\
    \ by the joint efforts from all the countries\nacross the world, as we can never\
    \ stop international travel and trade. Secondly, antibiotic resistant\nbacteria\
    \ and resistance genes do not originate only from humans relating to clinical\
    \ settings, but they\nare available and prevalent in the environment, food, and\
    \ water that we consume. In addition, the table\nemphasises the presence of multidrug\
    \ resistance in the respective countries, which is an uglier scenario,\nas the\
    \ antibiotic resistance genes can be disseminated via food, water, and other environmental\
    \ sources\nto clinical pathogens, thereby causing health threats to the public\
    \ (especially the immunocompromised\nindividuals who depend on antibiotics to\
    \ boost their immune system). Consequently, owing to\nthe high infectious disease\
    \ burden in developing countries, alongside the poor sanitation and hygienic\n\
    conditions, data in the tables create more awareness in the population about environmental\
    \ antibiotic\nresistance, such that intervention measures be reinforced, to ensure\
    \ prudent use of antibiotics, in a bid\nto contain antibiotic resistance. Furthermore,\
    \ there is a clear need for continuous surveillance to\nmonitor antibiotic resistance.\n\
    4. Conclusions\nAntibiotics, naturally or semi-synthetically or synthetically\
    \ produced substances, are very vital in\nthe agricultural, veterinary, and clinical\
    \ settings. These substances are endowed with bacteriostatic\n(inhibitory) or\
    \ bactericidal activities necessary for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes\
    \ in the lives of\nhumans and animals, to prevent and treat diseases. Regardless\
    \ of these beneﬁcial roles, associated with\nantibiotics use are also hostile\
    \ effects, in addition to their implementation at a sub-therapeutic level\nas\
    \ growth promoters in feed and water consumed by livestock over an extended period.\
    \ These may\nlead to antibiotic pollution, resulting in antibiotic residues in\
    \ animal-derived products, including\nmeat, milk, eggs, and edible tissues, and\
    \ when consumed by humans, can cause direct toxicity, the\ndevelopment and emergence\
    \ of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, as well as therapeutic failure\
    \ in\nclinical cases [136].\nOf great concern are the food/waterborne pathogens\
    \ responsible for life-threatening and\ndifﬁcult-to-treat gastrointestinal infections\
    \ in humans, thus, of great concern to public healthcare\nsystems worldwide. Nevertheless,\
    \ following the chronicles of multidrug resistance of these pathogens\nin the\
    \ developing countries, we hereby conclude that continuous surveillance of the\
    \ antibiotic resistance\nproﬁles of bacterial pathogens (obtained from humans,\
    \ animals, food, and other environmental sites)\nof public and environmental signiﬁcance\
    \ be implemented because of the high burden of infectious\ndiseases. Also, patients\
    \ harboring antibiotic-resistant infections might be unable to secure or afford\n\
    effective second and third line antibiotic treatments. The situation is further\
    \ compounded in these\nregions due to pollution of available water sources, poor\
    \ hygienic measures, civil conﬂicts, increased\npopulation of immunocompromised\
    \ individuals, lack of adequate laboratory infrastructures and\npersonnel for\
    \ the diagnosis of the disease-causing agents and surveillance of their antibiogram\
    \ patterns,\nadded to the deﬁciency in knowledge on prudent antibiotic use and\
    \ antibiotic resistance [331].\n5. Recommendations on Ways to Reduce the Overall\
    \ Level of Antibiotic Resistance in\nAgricultural Settings\nThe unscrupulous use\
    \ of antibiotics in farm animals has further compounded the problems\nof antibiotic\
    \ resistance.\nTaking this into consideration, implementing measures that will\
    \ help\nto reduce the abuse of antibiotics in livestock farming will, therefore,\
    \ go a long way to further\naffect the level of antibiotic resistance. This is\
    \ because there is an interrelationship between the\nMolecules 2018, 23, 795\n\
    32 of 48\nenvironment and animals, which ultimately inﬂuences public health (humans).\
    \ Altogether, the\nfollowing recommendations are set forth; following the chronicles\
    \ of the information studied, there is\na general weakness among farmers regarding\
    \ the lack of knowledge on antibiotic use and storage, its\nabuse, and consequent\
    \ hazards to public health and the environment [32]. Accordingly, a sensitization\n\
    campaign is inevitable to educate both the farmers and the general population\
    \ on the dangers\nof the imprudent use of antibiotics, improper storage of antibiotics,\
    \ and the resulting antibiotic\nresistance, with its consequences on public health.\
    \ Also, veterinary activities and therapy are mostly\nassumed and performed by\
    \ owners in industrial and semi-industrial production systems, regardless\nof\
    \ whether they are qualiﬁed or trained [43]. Sekyere [41] equally highlighted\
    \ that the veterinarian\nservices are lacking due to the locations of the farms\
    \ and/or the veterinarians are limited in number\nand their facilities. Notwithstanding,\
    \ livestock farming contributes to the economy of the country,\ntherefore, at\
    \ this juncture, we hereby propose that the government and well renowned and ﬁnancially\n\
    viable private companies that are interested in the economic development of the\
    \ country should\nencourage the employment of regular, proper, and efﬁcient veterinarian\
    \ services via subsidies to\nfarmers, especially to lower-income farmers in the\
    \ rural and remote settings of the country.\nFurthermore, the indiscriminate use\
    \ of antibiotics (that is, without prescription, supervision,\nand guidance from\
    \ veterinarians) in animal farming should be avoided.\nVeterinary officers and\n\
    pharmacists should adhere strictly to the policies governing prescriptions of\
    \ antibiotics used in\nanimal farming. They should equally ensure (via sensitization\
    \ and consultation) that the farmers\nadhere to the dosage, length, and administration\
    \ of treatment and withdrawal periods of antibiotics\nprescribed for a purpose,\
    \ as well as the causative agent of the disease be diagnosed and antibiotic\n\
    susceptibility testing conducted against the disease causative agent prior to\
    \ prescription and employment\nof the antibiotics [41,43]. Moreover, routine surveillance\
    \ and detailed analysis of antibiotic residues\npresent in foods of animal origin\
    \ should be conducted before being dispatched or delivered for human\nconsumption.\
    \ Owing to the variations in antibiotic consumption patterns and differences in\
    \ animal\nproduction systems between countries [12,43], we therefore advise that\
    \ based on the country, stringent\ncontrol and/or regulations should be implemented\
    \ by policy makers to enforce the legitimate purchase\nand employment of antibiotics\
    \ in animal farming.\nNonetheless, farmers should be educated on the need of good\
    \ and proper hygienic/sanitation\nconditions and facilities which nurture healthy\
    \ living in the animals and preclude the opportunities\nfor the emergence of disease\
    \ conditions and infections, thus evading therapeutic antibiotic regimens.\nUltimately,\
    \ the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals should be limited by incorporating\
    \ possible\nalternative substances, including probiotics, prebiotics, and plant-derived\
    \ or crude plant extracts for\nthe treatment and prevention of diseases [9,25].\
    \ Consequently, persistent and extensive surveillance\nshould be conducted by\
    \ the government in collaboration with the public health authorities to monitor\n\
    antibiotic consumption in animal farming, in addition to the antibiotic resistance\
    \ proﬁles of notorious\nfoodborne pathogens to well-known drugs used in animal\
    \ farming. Furthermore, the government\nand public health sector should make available,\
    \ services for research and analysis of data obtained via\nthe surveillance studies\
    \ in order to track the drug and its residue level in most environmental samples.\n\

    for enhancing our understanding of genotype–phenotype\nrelationships and its relevance\
    \ to crop improvement\nJoshua N. Cobb • Genevieve DeClerck •\nAnthony Greenberg\
    \ • Randy Clark •\nSusan McCouch\nReceived: 1 November 2012 / Accepted: 8 February\
    \ 2013 / Published online: 8 March 2013\n\x02 The Author(s) 2013. This article\
    \ is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract\nMore accurate and\
    \ precise phenotyping strate-\ngies are necessary to empower high-resolution linkage\n\
    mapping and genome-wide association studies and for\ntraining genomic selection\
    \ models in plant improvement.\nWithin this framework, the objective of modern\
    \ pheno-\ntyping is to increase the accuracy, precision and throughput\nof phenotypic\
    \ estimation at all levels of biological orga-\nnization while reducing costs\
    \ and minimizing labor\nthrough automation, remote sensing, improved data inte-\n\
    gration and experimental design. Much like the efforts to\noptimize genotyping\
    \ during the 1980s and 1990s, design-\ning effective phenotyping initiatives today\
    \ requires multi-\nfaceted collaborations between biologists, computer sci-\n\
    entists, statisticians and engineers. Robust phenotyping\nsystems are needed to\
    \ characterize the full suite of genetic\nfactors that contribute to quantitative\
    \ phenotypic variation\nacross cells, organs and tissues, developmental stages,\n\
    years, environments, species and research programs. Next-\ngeneration phenotyping\
    \ generates signiﬁcantly more data\nthan previously and requires novel data management,\n\
    access and storage systems, increased use of ontologies to\nfacilitate data integration,\
    \ and new statistical tools for\nenhancing experimental design and extracting\
    \ biologically\nmeaningful signal from environmental and experimental\nnoise.\
    \ To ensure relevance, the implementation of efﬁcient\nand informative phenotyping\
    \ experiments also requires\nfamiliarity with diverse germplasm resources, population\n\
    structures, and target populations of environments. Today,\nphenotyping is quickly\
    \ emerging as the major operational\nbottleneck limiting the power of genetic\
    \ analysis and\ngenomic prediction. The challenge for the next generation\nof\
    \ quantitative geneticists and plant breeders is not only to\nunderstand the genetic\
    \ basis of complex trait variation, but\nalso to use that knowledge to efﬁciently\
    \ synthesize twenty-\nﬁrst century crop varieties.\nIntroduction\nAgriculture\
    \ faces tremendous challenges in the decades\nahead. The FAO predicts that population\
    \ and income\ngrowth will double the global demand for food by 2050,\neffectively\
    \ increasing competition for crops as sources\nof bioenergy, ﬁber and for other\
    \ industrial purposes\n(http://www.fao.org).\nCompounding\nthe\npressure\nfor\n\
    increased agricultural output are looming threats of water\nscarcity, soil fertility\
    \ constraints, and climate change.\nAddressing\nthese\nproblems\nwill\nrequire\n\
    innovative\napproaches to both the agronomic and the genetic com-\nponents of\
    \ crop production systems. More sustainable\nmanagement of renewable soil and\
    \ water resources, in\nconcert with more efﬁcient utilization of genetic diversity\n\
    will be key to achieving the necessary gains in productivity\nCommunicated by\

    \ al. 2011;\nPypers et al. 2011; McCouch et al. 2012).\nGenetic diversity provides\
    \ the basis for all plant\nimprovement. Historically, plant breeders have sought\
    \ to\nunderstand the nature of genetic variation by evaluating the\nperformance\
    \ of breeding populations over years and loca-\ntions. Using replication and sophisticated\
    \ experimental\ndesigns, they obtained useful insights about trait herita-\nbility,\
    \ the inﬂuence of environment, the breeding value of\ndifferent parents, and strategies\
    \ for selecting genetically\nsuperior offspring in the ﬁeld. With the dawn of\
    \ the\ngenomics era, emphasis began to shift toward the evalua-\ntion of genetic\
    \ diversity directly at the DNA level. This\napproach is of interest to geneticists\
    \ for the evolutionary\nand functional insights it brings, and to plant breeders\
    \ as a\nsource of tools for improving the power and efﬁciency of\nselection. Parallel\
    \ investments in genotyping and pheno-\ntyping have generated datasets that can\
    \ be associated with\neach other to address both basic and applied questions.\n\
    Geneticists are interested in the nature and origin of\nmutations and their functional\
    \ signiﬁcance in the context of\nboth qualitative and quantitative traits. Plant\
    \ breeders\nembrace genomics as a way to document and protect the\ngenetic composition\
    \ of plant varieties, trace pedigree\nrelationships, identify and select valuable\
    \ mutations, and\ngain insight into the nature of genotype by genotype\n(G9G)\
    \ and genotype by environment (G9E) interactions.\nThe ultimate goal of genomics\
    \ research in plant breeding is\nto contribute to improving the efﬁciency, effectiveness\
    \ and\neconomy of cultivar improvement.\nAs biology moves from a data-starved\
    \ and largely\nobservational discipline to a data-rich science capable of\nprediction,\
    \ it follows the path of physics and engineering\nthat came before. The tremendous\
    \ innovation in genomics\ntechnology over the last two decades has been driven\
    \ by\nmulti-faceted collaborations between chemists, biologists\nand engineers,\
    \ and today, costs continue to decline while\naccuracy and throughput continue\
    \ to increase (Elshire et al.\n2011; Tung et al. 2010). Correlated with the downward\n\
    trend in the cost of sequencing is the expanded use of high-\nresolution genotyping\
    \ in plant species that were previously\nignored by the genomics community, a\
    \ sampling of which\ninclude cassava, common bean, pea, sunﬂower, cowpea,\nand\
    \ grain amaranth (Bachlava et al. 2012; Ferguson et al.\n2011; Hyten et al. 2010;\
    \ Maughan et al. 2011; Smy´kal et al.\n2012; Varshney et al. 2009; Varshney et\
    \ al. 2010). In\naddition to offering new insights into diverse germplasm\nresources,\
    \ high-throughput genotyping and next-generation\nsequencing (NGS) make it possible\
    \ to efﬁciently leverage\ngenetic information across species. The power of whole-\n\
    genome sequencing as a unifying force in biology has\nmotivated the development\
    \ of diversity panels and large\nmapping populations in many crop species to facilitate\
    \ trait\ndissection and gene discovery (Atwell et al. 2010; Huang\net al. 2010;\
    \ McCouch et al. 2012; Yu et al. 2008; Zhao\net al. 2011a; Neumann et al. 2011;\
    \ Pasam et al. 2012). It\nhas also catalyzed new thinking about how to manipulate\n\
    the genetic variation that exists in elite gene pools (Chen\net al. 2011; Thomson\
    \ et al. 2011; Trebbi et al. 2011).\nWith the deluge of low-cost genomic information\
    \ on\nimportant crop species, a fundamental change in research\nemphasis is needed\
    \ to address the shortage of high-quality\nphenotypic information. At this time,\
    \ phenotyping has\nreplaced genotyping as the major operational bottleneck\nand\
    \ funding constraint of genetic analyses. Unlike geno-\ntyping, which is now highly\
    \ mechanized and essentially\nuniform across organisms, phenotyping is still a\
    \ cottage\nindustry, species-speciﬁc, labor intensive, and inevitably\nenvironmentally\
    \ sensitive. Further, while sequence varia-\ntion is theoretically ﬁnite, and\
    \ thus all sequence variants\ncould conceivably be discovered for a given crop\
    \ species,\nthere is no expectation that the phenome will ever be fully\ncharacterized\
    \ (Houle et al. 2010). The phenome of an\norganism is dynamic and conditional,\
    \ representing a com-\nplex set of responses to a multi-dimensional set of endog-\n\
    enous and exogenous signals that are integrated over the\nevolutionary and developmental\
    \ life history of an individ-\nual. Phenotypic information can be envisioned as\
    \ a con-\ntinuous stream of data that changes over the course of\ndevelopment\
    \ of species, a population or an individual in\nresponse to different environmental\
    \ conditions. While it can\nbe associated with genomic information to understand\
    \ the\ncomponents of phenotypic variation that are due to genetics,\nwith increasing\
    \ availability of high-density genotypic\ninformation, understanding genotype–phenotype\
    \ relation-\nships is becoming more dependent on the availability of\nhigh-quality\
    \ phenotypic and environmental information.\nOver the next two decades, the development\
    \ of pheno-\ntyping strategies will almost certainly mirror innovations in\ngenotyping\
    \ technology that have occurred over the last\n20 years, characterized by increasing\
    \ automation and\nthroughput (Rafalski and Tingey 1993; Perlin et al. 1995;\n\
    Shefﬁeld et al. 1995; Weber and Broman 2001). As the\nscience of phenotyping evolves,\
    \ emphasis will increasingly\nbe placed on generating information that is as accurate\n\
    (able to effectively measure traits and/or performance\ncharacteristics), precise\
    \ (small variance associated with\nreplicated measurement), and as relevant as\
    \ possible, while\nkeeping costs within reasonable limits. If developments in\n\
    genotyping offer a roadmap for where phenotyping is going\nin the future, these\
    \ objectives will be reached based on new\nforms of automation and collaborations\
    \ between biologists,\nengineers and computer scientists.\nThe purpose of this\
    \ review is to outline considerations\nrelated to the future of phenotyping as\

    The central challenge of modern genetic analysis is to\nunderstand the biological\
    \ determinants of quantitative\nphenotypic variation. To date efforts in the plant\
    \ genetics\ncommunity have done well at identifying genes underlying\ntraits controlled\
    \ by one or a few loci with large effects.\nThis is particularly true in the major\
    \ crop species where\ngenetic analyses have identiﬁed the biochemical basis of\n\
    many important phenotypes (particularly, resistance to\nbiotic and abiotic stress)\
    \ and have also been the driving\nforce behind the development of tools for marker-assisted\n\
    selection in crop improvement (Foolad and Panthee 2012;\nJin et al. 2010; Paux\
    \ et al. 2010; Robbins et al. 2010).\nHowever, understanding complex trait variation\
    \ has proven\nfrustratingly difﬁcult, as the genetic architecture of these\nimportant\
    \ traits often involves many loci of small effect\nthat may interact with each\
    \ other as well as with the\nenvironment (Buckler et al. 2009; Collard and Mackill\n\
    2008; Schuster 2011). To discriminate such small effects, a\ncombination of technologies\
    \ and statistical methods are\nnow being employed. NGS technologies have provided\
    \ an\neconomically feasible way to survey genetic variation with\na resolution\
    \ that is now limited more by the linkage dis-\nequilibrium (LD) in a particular\
    \ mapping population than\nby marker density. This phenomenon has motivated the\n\
    assembly of large panels of genetic diversity as well as the\ncreation of large\
    \ inter-mated populations to manipulate LD\nand facilitate the association of\
    \ genotype with phenotype\n(Huang et al. 2011; Morris et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2008;\
    \ Zhao\net al. 2011a). These large and diverse populations aim to\nincrease the\
    \ recombination frequency and the frequency of\nrare alleles in order to enhance\
    \ the power to infer the\neffects of individual loci. This also highlights the\
    \ need for\ncareful population design and advocates for the inclusion\nof admixed\
    \ lines that may provide statistically useful\nobservations\nof\nallele\neffects\n\
    in\ndiverse\ngenetic\nbackgrounds.\nPhenotyping for genomic selection\nThe emphasis\
    \ on precision-phenotyping represents a sig-\nniﬁcant change for breeders engaged\
    \ in variety develop-\nment who have traditionally favored simplicity, speed,\
    \ and\nﬂexibility over sensitivity, precision and accuracy. This is\nbecause,\
    \ historically the advantages of the latter could not\nbe translated into economically\
    \ relevant genetic gain in a\nbreeding context. We argue that this paradigm is\
    \ beginning\nto change with the potential to integrate GS into a variety\ndevelopment\
    \ program. As the cost and efﬁciency of\nobtaining genomic information on large\
    \ numbers of indi-\nviduals dips below the cost and efﬁciency of evaluating\n\
    populations phenotypically over years and environments,\nthe breeding community\
    \ is alert to the idea that genomic\ninformation can be leveraged to predict phenotypic\
    \ out-\ncomes (Cabrera-Bosquet et al. 2012; Heffner et al. 2009;\nHeslot et al.\
    \ 2012). Further, the use of Bayesian models\nfacilitates the analysis of sparse\
    \ data (where not all indi-\nviduals or families are evaluated phenotypically\
    \ in each\nenvironment) and strongly suggests that there are cost-\neffective\
    \ experimental designs that can dramatically reduce\nthe amount of replication\
    \ needed to extract meaningful\nphenotypic performance indicators for a population\
    \ (see\nsection on ‘‘Analysis, adjustment, and value extraction of\nphenotypic\
    \ data’’).\nIf the accuracy of genomic predictions is sufﬁcient to\noffset the\
    \ time and expense required to evaluate the per-\nformance of the breeding populations\
    \ in the traditional\nmanner, and if GS demonstrates a clear increase in the rate\n\
    of genetic gain per cycle of selection, then breeders will\nquickly adopt the\
    \ most efﬁcient strategy to accomplish\ntheir goals. This may require staggered\
    \ use of traditional\nand precision-phenotyping, depending on the trait(s) and\n\
    the species under consideration. What is important is\nbreeders begin to reevaluate\
    \ how a focused investment in\nprecision-phenotyping of a training population\
    \ may be able\nto minimize the requirement for costly, extensive pheno-\ntyping\
    \ of large numbers of lines every generation in the\nfuture. The purpose of this\
    \ paper is to explore some of the\nkey dimensions of next-generation phenotyping\
    \ that will\nallow geneticists and breeders to productively interrogate\nthe complex\
    \ me´nage-a`-trois between genotype, phenotype\nand the environment as well as\
    \ to develop models that\nleverage genotypic information to predict phenotypic\n\
    outcomes.\nUnder a GS model, precision-phenotyping is most\nimportant when evaluating\
    \ a training population because\nthat dataset provides the basis for developing\
    \ the statistical\nmodel that is then used to predict phenotypic performance\n\
    in related members of a breeding population. The model is\nderived from the relationship\
    \ between phenotype, geno-\ntype, and G9E, where marker genotypes are treated\
    \ as\nrandom variables. GS is particularly useful when it can\nsave a generation\
    \ or two of time-consuming and expensive\nphenotyping, as only comparatively small\
    \ training popu-\nlations need be screened.\nGenomic selection aims to model genome-wide\
    \ SNP\nvariation without concern for identifying particular alleles,\nloci or\
    \ pathways or understanding how different alleles\ncontribute to the phenotype.\
    \ Since the metric of success is\nthe ability to predict the performance of an\
    \ adapted line or\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n869\n123\nvariety under\
    \ relevant agronomic conditions, it is important\nto consider phenotyping strategies\
    \ that (1) estimate crop\nperformance under appropriate management conditions\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld; (2) can evaluate performance across a population\nof target environments;\
    \ and (3) can generate useful data in\nreal time without a disproportionate investment\
    \ in labor\nand infrastructure. Despite the advantages of accelerating\nthe breeding\
    \ cycle, the ability of GS models to accurately\npredict phenotype is dependent\
    \ on using prohibitively large\ntraining populations when working with traits\
    \ with low\nheritability and complex inheritance (Calus et al. 2008;\nGuo et al.\
    \ 2012; Hayes et al. 2009; Heffner et al. 2010; Jia\nand Jannink 2012; Kumar et\
    \ al. 2012; Nakaya and Isobe\n2012; Munoz et al. 2011; Resende et al. 2012; Zhao\
    \ et al.\n2011b; Zhong et al. 2009). This is due to the fact that G9E\ninteraction\
    \ plays a major role in explaining ﬁeld perfor-\nmance, and GS is highly dependent\
    \ on a prediction model\ndeveloped from a limited sampling of the environmental\n\
    variance. Recombination also disrupts phasing of markers\nand leads to low accuracy\
    \ of predictions as breeding gen-\nerations are farther and farther removed from\
    \ the training\npopulation. Further research is needed to improve the\naccuracy\
    \ of prediction under GS models.\nPhenotyping for QTL and gene discovery\nIn contrast\
    \ to GS, phenotyping of a diversity panel for\ngenome-wide association studies\
    \ (GWAS) or a bi-parental\nmapping population for QTL analysis is designed to\n\
    interpret and dissect the genetic architecture of complex\ntraits and to understand\
    \ how speciﬁc DNA variants con-\ndition the inheritance of diverse phenotypes.\
    \ Both forms of\nlinkage mapping are successful at implicating genomic\nregions\
    \ involved in complex trait variation, but cloning the\ngene(s) underlying the\
    \ QTL remains time-consuming and\nresource intensive, even when the QTL explains\
    \ a sub-\nstantial proportion of the phenotypic variation (Bhatta-\ncharyya 2010;\
    \ Fan et al. 2006; Krattinger et al. 2009; Li\net al. 2010; Liu et al. 2008; Saito\
    \ et al. 2010). Bi-parental\npopulations are limited by the particular alleles\
    \ present in\nthe parents, but they offer power for QTL dissection\nbecause population\
    \ structure is disrupted and genetic\nbackground differences in the progeny are\
    \ constrained.\nAssociation mapping studies, on the other hand, generally\nprovide\
    \ higher resolution of QTL for the same number of\nlines and evaluate a wider\
    \ array of alleles but are limited by\nthe inability to interrogate rare alleles\
    \ or to dissect phe-\nnotypes that are perfectly correlated with population\n\
    structure (Manolio and Collins 2009; Price et al. 2006;\nPritchard and Cox 2002;\
    \ Reich and Lander 2001). When\nlarge numbers of markers are used for either QTL\
    \ analysis\nor GWAS, a multiple test correction is required to limit the\nfalse\
    \ discovery rate. With ever-improving approaches to\nstatistical modeling and\
    \ improvements in the accuracy and\nprecision of phenotyping, both forms of linkage\
    \ mapping\nhold great promise for elucidating the genetic architecture\nof complex\
    \ traits and identifying the genes and speciﬁc\nalleles underlying trait variation.\n\
    Sampling vs. controlling environmental variation\nDifferent approaches to phenotyping\
    \ are required for dif-\nferent purposes (Campos et al. 2004; Crouch et al. 2009;\n\
    Gordon and Finch 2005; Kloth et al. 2012; Masuka et al.\n2012; Pieruschka and\
    \ Poorter 2012). Plant breeders have\ntraditionally relied on large-scale replication\
    \ of phenotypic\ntrials over years and locations to identify individual fami-\n\
    lies or populations that perform best in a target population\nof environments\
    \ (TPE). By modeling locations and years as\nrandom effects, they were able to\
    \ reliably extract genetic\nsignal from environmental noise and identify varieties\
    \ with\nbroad or narrow zones of adaptation (Beavis 1998), though\nthe process\
    \ was very time and labor consuming. Many\ngeneticists, on the other hand study\
    \ phenotypic variation at\nthe cell or tissue-speciﬁc level using plants grown\
    \ under\ncarefully deﬁned environmental conditions, and evaluate\ncascades of\
    \ molecular events using biochemical and\n‘‘omics’’ technology. The world of the\
    \ plant breeder and\nthat of the molecular geneticist intersect at the level of\
    \ the\nplant, but the different scales of phenotyping make it\nchallenging to\
    \ integrate the knowledge contributed by each\ncommunity into a uniﬁed and comprehensive\
    \ view of the\ngenetic determinants of plant growth, development and\nresponse\
    \ to environment.\nUnder ﬁeld conditions, it is often convenient to collapse\n\
    quantitative phenotypes into discrete categories to facilitate\nmanual data collection\
    \ in real time and at reasonable cost.\nThis has been the practice for many years\
    \ among breeders\nand geneticists working with large, ﬁeld-grown popula-\ntions,\
    \ and different communities of researchers have\ndeveloped standardized categorical\
    \ scales or indices for\nimportant whole-plant phenotypes that are easy to apply\n\
    (Clarke et al. 1992; De Boever et al. 1993; International\nRice Research Institute\
    \ 1996; Kuhn and Smith 1977; Mo-\nlina-Cano 1987; Yuan et al. 2004). For example,\
    \ traits such\nas ﬂowering time or disease resistance are frequently\nestimated\
    \ using a visual assessment of ‘‘days to 50 %\nﬂowering’’ in a row or plot, or\
    \ ‘‘percent leaf area affected’’\non individual diseased plants. Historically,\
    \ trait evaluation\nusing these indices was reliable enough to provide rea-\n\
    sonable data in the context of plant breeding. However,\nnew population designs\
    \ (Yu et al. 2008) in combination\nwith high-density marker coverage have increased\
    \ the\npower to detect small-effect QTL and estimate their\n870\nTheor Appl Genet\
    \ (2013) 126:867–887\n123\neffects, even on whole-plant phenotypes. This suggests\
    \ that\nmore rigorous, quantitative approaches to phenotyping are\nlikely to bring\
    \ rewards. Further, when there is signiﬁcant\nvariability in phenotypic scores\
    \ collected by different\nindividuals, more objective phenotyping protocols are\n\
    desirable (Poland and Nelson 2010).\nRecently, it has been argued that automated,\
    \ high-\nthroughput, ﬁeld-based organismal phenotyping techniques\ninvolving remote\
    \ sensing (such as near-infrared spectros-\ncopy mounted on agricultural harvesters\
    \ to measure spec-\ntral canopy reﬂectance with the aid of global positioning\n\
    system (GPS)-guided tractors) will enhance the precision\nand accuracy of phenotyping\
    \ without extracting plants\nfrom the production environment (Cabrera-Bosquet\
    \ et al.\n2012; Houle et al. 2010; Montes et al. 2007; Tuberosa\n2012; White et\
    \ al. 2012). While these efforts can certainly\nfacilitate selection for enhanced\
    \ performance in a target\nzone of adaptation, one of the biggest challenges associated\n\
    with these automated, ﬁeld-based technologies is the var-\niable nature of most\
    \ natural environments.\nTo enhance the ability to screen for stress tolerance\
    \ in\nﬁeld-grown plants, scientists often use plant populations to\n‘sample’ the\
    \ degree of stress encountered in a TPE. Once\nthis has been ascertained, the\
    \ TPE is used to evaluate the\nrelative performance of different populations over\
    \ several\ngrowing seasons. This requires signiﬁcant up-front invest-\nment, as\
    \ many different locations must be tested over\nmultiple years in order to make\
    \ an accurate estimation.\nAlternatively, breeders use ‘‘managed stress’’ as a\
    \ way of\noptimizing screening protocols for application to large\nplant populations\
    \ in the ﬁeld. By managing the amount and\ntiming of water, fertilizer, pest control\
    \ or soil amendments,\nplants can be exposed to fairly reliable levels of stress\n\
    while experiencing normal temperature, day length, etc.,\nover the course of the\
    \ growing season. These approaches\nwork well if the genetic component of phenotypic\
    \ variation\n(heritability) is high, and if the differences among popu-\nlations\
    \ or individuals within a population are large. How-\never, in cases where complex\
    \ traits are conditioned by\nmany alleles with small effects, the error associated\
    \ with\nestimating the phenotype and the environmental variance\ncontributing\
    \ to the observed phenotypic variation are likely\nto dilute the relatively weak\
    \ genetic signals and may pre-\nclude their detection.\nTo partially overcome\
    \ this problem, many researchers\nhave endeavored to take advantage of phenotyping\
    \ strate-\ngies based on analytical chemistry (i.e. gas chromatogra-\nphy–mass\n\
    spectroscopy,\nhigh\nperformance\nliquid\nchromatography, inductively coupled\
    \ plasma spectroscopy,\netc.) or a wide range of -omics technologies (transcripto-\n\
    mics, metabolomics, ionomics, proteomics, etc.). These are\nall highly automated\
    \ and are important and useful due to\ntheir high throughput and high accuracy.\
    \ They are\ngenerally used to analyze speciﬁc anatomical parts of a\nplant at\
    \ a particular time(s) in its development, and are best\nused on plants grown\
    \ under well-deﬁned growing condi-\ntions. Owing to the high cost per sample and\
    \ the require-\nment\nfor\nconsiderable\ntechnical\nexpertise\nand\ninfrastructure,\
    \ these techniques may not be available to\neveryone and it may not be economically\
    \ feasible to survey\nlarge numbers of ﬁeld-grown plants. Thus, it often makes\n\
    sense to ﬁrst screen a population under controlled condi-\ntions with minimal\
    \ replication and once a hypothesis about\nthe genetic control of a trait of interest\
    \ is formulated, it can\nbe tested in a focused way in the ﬁeld, or simply used\
    \ to\neliminate a large proportion of a population prior to\nundertaking ﬁeld\
    \ evaluation.\nScreening populations under controlled conditions is\nalso appropriate\
    \ when the controlled environment is nec-\nessary to impose a particular form\
    \ of stress or to permit\ngrowth of plants under speciﬁc conditions that cannot\
    \ be\nreplicated in the ﬁeld. Controlled environments have been\nsuccessfully\
    \ used to inoculate plants with a particular strain\nof a pathogen, or to impose\
    \ a particular abiotic stress such\nas aluminum toxicity without the natural coupling\
    \ with\nphosphorus deﬁciency, or high CO2 in combination with a\ncritical night\
    \ time temperature. Use of multi-step strategies\ninvolving both controlled and\
    \ ﬁeld environments are often\nthe best way to maximize the extraction of useful\
    \ genetic\ninformation while minimizing the expense and time\ninvolved (Fernie\
    \ and Schauer 2009; Rafalski 2010).\nDrought tolerance as an illustration\nWhile\
    \ a complete survey of advances in drought pheno-\ntyping is beyond the scope\
    \ of this review (see Mir et al.\n2012 for a detailed overview of this topic),\
    \ drought toler-\nance offers a compelling example of a combined approach\nof\
    \ leveraging both controlled and uncontrolled phenotyp-\ning designs to enhance\
    \ genetic analysis. The onset of water\ndeﬁcit and its impact on plant performance\
    \ is a dynamic\nprocess that occurs across space and time. Under ﬁeld\nconditions\
    \ the inability to obtain standardized and consis-\ntent drought stress contributes\
    \ to a loss in heritability and\npresents a challenge for both selection and mapping\n\
    experiments (Berger et al. 2010). Many different approa-\nches have been used\
    \ to apply deﬁned levels of drought\nstress in an effort to understand the nature\
    \ of this complex\ntrait, ranging from chemically manipulating osmotic bal-\n\
    ance in hydroponics (Rengasamy 2010; Tavakkoli et al.\n2010) to conveyer systems\
    \ in glasshouses with digitally\ncontrolled irrigation systems (Granier et al.\
    \ 2006; Jansen\net al. 2009; Neumann 2013; Pereyra-Irujo et al. 2012) to\nthe\
    \ use of rainout shelters in the ﬁeld (Czyczyło-Mysza\net al. 2011; Dodig et al.\

    \ Zhu et al.\n2011b; Clark et al. 2011) to physiological metrics related to\n\
    water status (Bartlett et al. 2012a, b; Blum 2009; Gilbert et al.\n2011; Ogburn\
    \ and Edwards 2012; Tucker et al. 2011) to\nspectral imaging of shoot tissue (Berger\
    \ et al. 2010; Goltsev\net al. 2012; Liu et al. 2011; Zia et al. 2012) to simply\
    \ evaluating\nyield under stress in the ﬁeld (Bennett et al. 2012; Bernier et\

    \ Rehman et al. 2011; Swamy et al. 2011; Venuprasad\net al. 2012; Vikram et al.\
    \ 2011). Screening can be done using\nin-house facilities (growth chambers, green\
    \ houses) or out-\nsourced to a phenotyping facility such as the Ju¨lich Plant\n\
    Phenotyping Centre—JPPC (Ju¨lich, Germany; http://www.fz-\njuelich.de/ibg/ibg-2/EN/About_us/organisation/JPPC/JPPC_\n\

    the High Resolution Plant Phenomics Center—HRPPC\n(CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra\
    \ Australia; http://www.plant\nphenomics.org/HRPPC). The two former facilities\
    \ are part of\nthe larger European Plant Phenomics Network (http://\nwww.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/)\
    \ and the latter two are\npart of the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility (http://www.\n\
    plantphenomics.org.au/). Each system presents its own\nadvantages and disadvantages,\
    \ but collectively they empower\nthe researcher to investigate plant response\
    \ to drought in ways\nthat are more comprehensive than any one design can offer.\n\
    These approaches are most often utilized for linkage mapping\nand gene discovery,\
    \ and once QTL or candidate genes are\nidentiﬁed, they can be validated for practical\
    \ application by\nevaluating speciﬁc germplasm, genetic stocks or breeding\npopulations\
    \ under managed drought conditions in the ﬁeld (Ali\net al. 2010; Cavanagh et\
    \ al. 2008; Huang et al. 2012; Kholova´\net al. 2010; Saisho and Takeda 2011;\
    \ Venuprasad et al. 2011;\nYadav et al. 2011). If validated, lines carrying the\
    \ genes or\nQTLs of interest will be useful for elucidating the molecular\nmechanism(s)\
    \ involved in the component trait(s), and will also\nbe of immediate value as\
    \ donor material for breeding with elite\ngermplasm.\nExamining the relationship\
    \ between phenotypic varia-\ntion under controlled environments and that observed\n\
    under ﬁeld conditions offers valuable insights that can be\nused to iteratively\
    \ improve controlled environment phe-\nnotyping techniques so they are more predictive\
    \ of plant\nperformance in the ﬁeld (Table 1; Fig. 1). Ultimately, the\nchoice\
    \ of phenotyping approach will depend on the inten-\ntion of the researcher, the\
    \ size of the population in question\n[e.g. less than ten individuals for precise\
    \ physiological\nexperiments, to a moderate number of lines (200–400) for\nmapping\
    \ studies or GS training populations, or a large\nnumber of lines (400–1,000?)\
    \ for association studies], the\nheritability of the phenotype, the tractability\
    \ of the phe-\nnotype to controlled environment testing, and resource\navailability.\n\
    Development of technology and phenotyping tools\nThe creative use of technology\
    \ and careful development of\ntools to automate processes without sacriﬁcing predictive\n\
    power will be critical as next-generation phenotyping\nplatforms are developed.\
    \ This can be a real challenge as\nmany\nexperimental\ntechniques\nin\nplant\n\
    physiology,\nmolecular biology and breeding can be restrictive and\nrequire specialized\
    \ protocols that are often difﬁcult to\nstandardize. The integration of these\
    \ approaches will be\nnecessary to fully interrogate the genetic landscape of\n\
    complex traits. Standardized phenotyping systems are not\nfeasible for all research\
    \ questions, but with thorough con-\nsideration and clearly deﬁned objectives,\
    \ many techniques\ncan be harnessed to investigate speciﬁc traits under high-\n\
    throughput settings.\nIn recent years, automation, imaging, and software\nsolutions\
    \ have paved the way for many high-throughput\nphenotyping studies. Semi-automated\

    \ meaningful estimates of phenotypic variation. Most\nimage analysis tools for\
    \ plant phenotyping incorporate\npredeﬁned processing and analysis procedures\
    \ into semi-\nautomatic or automatic routines in order to quantify mul-\ntiple\
    \ phenotypes from single images or groups of images.\nIn its essence, high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping means\nintegrating and optimizing a phenotyping process in a way\n\
    that makes it as efﬁcient and controlled as possible. In\nconsidering efﬁciency,\
    \ several questions and decisions\narise related to the accuracy, precision, automation,\
    \ and\nadaptability of various stages of the phenotyping process,\nfrom growth\
    \ techniques to experimental design and man-\nagement practices to data capture\
    \ and analysis strategies.\nThe accuracy and precision of the treatment and mea-\n\
    surement process is a fundamental concern during any\nexperimental procedure.\
    \ During phenotyping studies where\nmultiple individuals and replicates from different\
    \ genetic\nbackgrounds are evaluated across batches, effectively\ncontrolling\
    \ the accuracy and precision of the phenotyping\nsystem will have direct impacts\
    \ on the outcome of the\nanalysis. Accuracy and precision are intimately interre-\n\
    lated, where accuracy represents how close the process or\nmeasurement is to the\
    \ absolute truth and precision repre-\nsents the repeatability or variance of\
    \ the measurement\nprocess. Accuracy is important when there is variation\nacross\
    \ individual genotypes during mapping experiments.\nFor instance, Clark et al.\
    \ (2011) characterized the root\nsystems of a rice bi-parental recombinant inbred\
    \ line (RIL)\npopulation, and found that one parental genotype had\ndense, highly\
    \ branched root systems while the other had\nlong, sparse root systems. In order\
    \ to clearly capture these\ndifferences, a system needed to be designed that could\n\
    correctly quantify both types of root systems in order to\nproperly assess their\
    \ relationship and further analyze var-\niation within the progeny. Comparison\
    \ and validation\nstudies with known standards, such as the use of comple-\nmentary\
    \ imaging modalities or other quantiﬁcation soft-\nware, can help evaluate the\
    \ accuracy of a system.\nPrecision is critical when individual genotypes have\n\
    multiple replicates that are evaluated across several bat-\nches. Presuming that\
    \ the replicates share similar charac-\nteristics, the measurement system must\
    \ be able to quantify\nthe features in a repeatable way to prevent unpredictable\n\
    system noise from masking the true similarities/differences\nbetween the genotypes.\
    \ While there are statistical approa-\nches for accounting for unwarranted variability\
    \ in silico,\nefforts to improve the precision of data collection will only\n\
    serve to enhance the statistical power of any analysis per-\nformed. The key to\
    \ maintaining precision throughout a\nphenotyping activity is to employ stable\
    \ instrument designs\nthat can effectively control precision, such as the ﬁxed\n\
    lighting and camera setups used in the root systems in\nstudies cited previously.\n\
    Unfortunately, there will always be trade-offs between\nthe maintenance of accuracy,\
    \ precision, and the ultimate\nthroughput of the phenotyping approach. As throughput\n\
    and standardization increase, it necessitates a drop in\naccuracy and precision\
    \ that must be carefully monitored in\norder to maintain the economic feasibility\
    \ of the data\ncollection. It is not always straightforward to properly\nbalance\
    \ these trade-offs, but through iterative design and\ntesting, phenotyping tools\
    \ can be established to satisfy\nresearch objectives and meet resource constraints.\n\
    The level of automation employed by a phenotyping\napproach is counter-balanced\
    \ not only by trade-offs with\naccuracy\nand\nprecision,\nbut\nalso\nwith\nadaptability.\n\
    Increasing automation improves throughput and reduces\nlabor costs, but also results\
    \ in more specialized designs that\nhave less adaptability and predictive power,\
    \ and are prone\nto errors from non-standard individuals. This principle is\n\
    illustrated well when image analysis involves batch pro-\ncessing many photographs\
    \ using predeﬁned algorithms and\ncommands. It is fairly obvious that batch processing\
    \ is\ninvaluable during large-scale phenotyping experiments\nwhere thousands of\
    \ images can be generated daily, but this\nalso means that the software must rely\
    \ on a rigid set of\nconstraints. The quality of the images is usually not a\n\
    problem during high-throughput phenotyping where the\nimaging process is standardized,\
    \ but if any individuals\ndeviate from pre-speciﬁed growth assumptions of the\n\
    measurement algorithm, unpredictable and misleading\nmeasurement errors can arise.\
    \ Even with automated anal-\nysis algorithms that have been thoroughly tested,\
    \ it is\nnecessary for the experimenter to manually check and\nvalidate the system\
    \ outputs regularly. Along those same\nlines, incorporating user-guided processes\
    \ into the pheno-\ntyping pipeline can also provide a useful compromise that\n\
    improves the ﬂexibility while maintaining the efﬁciency\nneeded to perform large\
    \ experiments (Clark et al. 2012; Le\nBot et al. 2010; Lobet et al. 2011).\nMost\
    \ phenotyping tools that have been developed by\nresearch groups in the public\
    \ and private sector are inte-\ngrated in a way that makes them easy to disseminate\
    \ and\nuse, but sometimes this convenience can limit the range of\ntheir functionality\
    \ to other studies. While this has precip-\nitated the release of a number of\
    \ software programs\navailable for the extraction of phenotype data from images\n\
    (Table 2), the highly speciﬁc nature of individual pheno-\ntypes also motivates\
    \ the development of in-house tools\nideally suited to the analysis at hand. Although\
    \ it is not a\nsimple task, implementing modular designs will help\nincrease ﬂexibility\
    \ of phenotyping in the future. The\n874\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n\

    \ users to create and share custom-developed plugins\nthat expand the functionality\
    \ of the software and make it\napplicable to wide range of research disciplines.\
    \ Modular\nconcepts have proven quite successful for the high-\nthroughput phenotyping\
    \ of notoriously difﬁcult phenotypes\nsuch as root system traits. A notable example\
    \ is GiaRoots,\na software program that allows users to incorporate their\nown\
    \ processing and algorithms into the automated analysis\nroutines as a way of\
    \ overcoming the limitations imposed by\nmore integrated approaches (Galkovskyi\
    \ et al. 2012).\nAccess, storage, and management of phenotypic data\nIt is clear\
    \ then, that much of next-generation phenotyping\nwill be done at the intersection\
    \ of the ﬁelds of biology,\nengineering, and computer science. Progress in developing\n\
    technology in these disciplines that empowers next-gener-\nation phenotyping strategies\
    \ is moving forward rapidly.\nHowever, congruent with the progress in the capability\
    \ to\ncollect high-throughput phenotypic data, is the growing\nproblem of managing\
    \ these data sets in ways that empower\nvalue extraction. Retroﬁtting a lab to\
    \ handle the rapid\ninﬂux of phenotype data could require signiﬁcant invest-\n\
    ment in facilities, device control systems and computa-\ntional resources.\nFor\
    \ experiments that are only measuring a few traits on a\npanel of germplasm, setting\
    \ up a local (customized) phe-\nnotyping system in-house might be practical; but\
    \ in such\ncases, a laboratory information management system (LIMS)\nor local\
    \ database may be needed to manage the high vol-\numes of phenotypic information.\
    \ Generally, there are no\n‘off the shelf’ solutions that can be applied universally,\
    \ so\nsome computer expertise will be needed for data manage-\nment. Even so,\
    \ organizing that information into a ‘‘phe-\nnome’’ is challenging because of\
    \ the continuous, multi-\nfaceted, and interpretive nature of what a phenotypic\n\
    observation is, contrasted with the ‘‘discrete’’ nature of\ngenotypic data, which\
    \ can be abstracted into a single\nalphabetical character (National Science Foundation\
    \ 2011).\nBeyond the technologies used to run, collect and digest\nlarge-scale\
    \ phenotypic evaluations, the ﬁeld of phenomics\nfaces similar bottlenecks that\
    \ genomics has been grappling\nwith as the drop in cost of DNA sequencing outpaces\
    \ the\ncost of hard drive data storage (Stein 2010). Though there\nis ample exploration\
    \ that can be done on genomic data\nalone, for many plant researchers, associating\
    \ and enrich-\ning genotype data with phenotypic manifestations contex-\ntualized\
    \ by the ﬁeld environment is a vital part of gaining\ntrue biological insight\
    \ and solving agronomic problems.\nThe storage of phenotype data at this scale\
    \ has become a\nsub-discipline on its own and some projects are dealing\nwith\
    \ it quite well. There are many public databases that\nhave been working to organize\
    \ and collate plant phenotype\ndata (Lai et al. 2012; Table 3), but most only\
    \ have the\ncurrent capacity to present free-text phenotypic descrip-\ntions of\
    \ mutants, e.g. SoyBase (Grant et al. 2010) and\nMaizeGDB (Schaeffer et al. 2011).\
    \ Some crop databases\nhave tried to move beyond this paradigm by including\n\
    functionality for the management of phenotypic measure-\nments, predominantly\
    \ from either managed ﬁeld trials or\nGWA studies [e.g. T3 Triticeae Toolbox (http://triticeae\n\
    toolbox.org), Panzea (Canaran et al. 2008), and Gramene’s\ndiversity module (Chen\
    \ et al. 2010)]. They are also among\na number of projects preparing for an increasing\
    \ amount of\nassociation data emerging from the marriage of powerful\ngenomic\
    \ information with next-generation phenotyping.\nOne effort is NCBI’s dbGAP (Mailman\
    \ et al. 2007), which\nwas created as a public repository for phenotypes, geno-\n\
    types and the associations between them. Currently, how-\never, dbGAP only accepts\
    \ human data.\nThere are a few database projects that specialize spe-\nciﬁcally\
    \ in plant phenomics data, and deserve to be high-\nlighted. The ﬁrst example\
    \ of these is PHENOPSIS DB\n(Juliette et al. 2011), which mainly houses information\n\
    regarding the growth response of Arabidopsis thaliana to\nvarious environmental\
    \ conditions. The database is popu-\nlated with phenotype information extracted\
    \ from images\nand measurements collected automatically in specialized\ngrowth\
    \ chambers. The collaborative international network\nfor ionomics ( http://www.ionomicshub.org;\
    \ Baxter et al.\n2007) is a second example that hosts ICP-mass spectrom-\netry\
    \ ionomics data for thousands of Arabidopsis, rice, and\nyeast samples with the\
    \ goal to facilitate the understanding\nof response mechanisms in plants to various\
    \ nutrient\navailabilities and/or abiotic toxicities.\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ other efforts in human and mouse\ngenomics research that could serve as useful\
    \ models for\ncontinued development in the plant phenomics domain.\nMouse genomics\
    \ informatics (MGI), (http://www.infor\nmatics.jax.org)\ncomprise\nseveral\ndatabase\n\
    projects,\nincluding the mouse genome database (MGD), (Eppig et al.\n2012) and\
    \ houses a variety of tools for searching and\nbrowsing large phenotype data sets.\
    \ PhenomicDB is\nanother, multi-species (primarily human, mouse, fruit ﬂy,\nand\
    \ yeast) resource designed to empower ‘‘comparative\nphenomics’’ (Kahraman et\
    \ al. 2005). The nutritional phe-\nnotype database (Van Ommen et al. 2010) is\
    \ a third, which\nfocuses on human nutritional phenotype data. The DbNP\neven\
    \ goes a step further than most databases by empha-\nsizing the importance of\
    \ the characterization and uniﬁca-\ntion of experimental designs and allows for\
    \ ﬁner grained\nstorage and searching protocol parameters. The DbNP\n876\nTheor\
    \ Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n123\nproject recently announced that it will\
    \ further expand the\nscope of the resource to include management of environ-\n\
    mental plant studies (http://www.dbnp.org).\nOne important feature shared among\
    \ many current dat-\nabases organizing phenotype data is the use of controlled\n\
    vocabularies known as ‘ontological terms’. Ontologies are\nsets of deﬁned keywords\
    \ that can be used as tags to qualify\nand describe features related to biological\
    \ data points and\ndata sets. Such ontological terms can be used to describe\n\
    traits, genes, environments, or taxonomy. As an example,\none might use the hierarchy\
    \ of terms ‘‘growth and devel-\nopment C shoot\ndevelopment C inﬂorescence\ndevelop-\n\
    ment C ﬂower development C ﬂowering time C days to\nﬂower’’ to describe formally\
    \ what is colloquially referred\nto as simply ‘‘ﬂowering time’’. While this is\
    \ an arguably\nsimple example, it is not difﬁcult to imagine the com-\nplexity\
    \ that ensues when trying to use ontologies to\ndescribe\ncomplicated\nmolecular\n\
    pathways.\nUsage\nof\nontologies is a critical step toward making diverse and\n\
    rapidly growing collections of biological data searchable,\nand accessible to\
    \ computational algorithms. The Open\nBiological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry\
    \ (OBO\nfoundry) (Smith et al. 2007) has emerged as an important\ncentralized\
    \ repository for plant and animal ontological\ncollections, with the goal of increasing\
    \ standardization and\nmaximizing interoperability between ontologies. For plant\n\
    data the most commonly used ontologies include the plant\nontology (PO), (Avraham\
    \ et al. 2008; Jaiswal et al. 2005)\nthe plant trait ontology (TO), plant environment\
    \ ontology\n(EO), and the phenotypic quality ontology (PATO).\nUnfortunately,\
    \ all research groups do not universally\nadopt usage of these community standards\
    \ and without a\ncritical mass of ‘‘buy-in’’, their beneﬁts cannot be fully\n\
    realized. Also a great deal of time and resources go into the\ncuration and maintenance\
    \ of ontologies and projects rely\non term-based grant funding, which is not always\
    \ reliable.\nIn order to meet the demand imposed by the upscaling\nof phenotypic\
    \ data production, sophisticated computational\nmethods will need to be employed.\
    \ Phenotype data is\ncomplex and highly context sensitive, and crucial infor-\n\
    mation can potentially be lost when data descriptions are\nﬂattened down to only\
    \ a few ontology terms. As a way of\ndealing with this complexity, some groups\
    \ have been\nexploring the potential of the Semantic Web (Lee et al. 2001)\ntoexpandthedimensionalityofstoredbiologicaldata\
    \ inorder\nto more effectively mine the enormous volume of descriptive\ndata available\
    \ in the literature (Vision et al. 2011). The\nPhenoscape project (http://kb.phenoscape.org;\
    \ Mabee et al.\n2012) has been working on developing semantical search\nalgorithms\
    \ capable of linking biological data by relationships\nbetween ontological terms\
    \ and by similarities found between\nfree-text descriptions. Data are characterized\
    \ as statements of\nfact, where there is a subject (e.g. ‘‘a ﬂoret’’), a predicate\
    \ (e.g.\nTable 3\nA selection of integrated storage and maintenance systems designed\

    \ this approach adds some of the\nnecessary dimensionality for unlocking biological\
    \ meaning\nusing linguistic and intuitive tool sets.\nAnalysis, adjustment, and\
    \ value extraction\nof phenotypic data\nIndependent of the effort involved to\
    \ both collect and\nappropriately manage high-throughput phenotype data, the\n\
    data sets themselves are only as valuable as the analyses\nthat can be performed\
    \ on them. Great care must be taken to\nmake accurate inferences from the data\
    \ in order to cor-\nrectly characterize the genotype–phenotype relationship.\n\
    Correct estimations of genetic gain from selection, for\nexample, depend heavily\
    \ on accurate estimates of herita-\nbility and the covariance among phenotypes\
    \ (Dickerson\n1955). Because none of these parameters are directly\nobservable,\
    \ they must be estimated from data using a\nvariety of statistical models.\nWhile\
    \ the methods for measuring phenotypic data are\nbecoming more sophisticated and\
    \ the ability to catalog and\nquery data across experimental designs is becoming\
    \ more\nachievable, the precision of such data will always be lim-\nited by inherent\
    \ biological noise. This biological noise is\nunavoidable and is even present\
    \ under the most controlled\nexperimental conditions. These ﬂuctuations can be\
    \ local,\naffecting single organisms, or more general, inﬂuencing the\nwhole experiment\
    \ and modifying the phenotypes for the\nwhole replicate population. Furthermore,\
    \ where automation\nis impractical, and a team of researchers is employed to\n\
    conduct the experiment, individual bias can skew obser-\nvations, even in cases\
    \ where subjective criteria are not\ndirectly used to measure the phenotypes.\
    \ These problems\nare further compounded by the environmental variability\nthat\
    \ inconsistently affects phenotypic observation over\nboth space and time. Unpredictable\
    \ environmental condi-\ntions can also lead to a fair amount of missing data,\
    \ which\nin turn will limit the statistical power to make inferences\nabout the\
    \ genotypic contribution to the phenotype. In\naddition to biological and environmental\
    \ noise, variable\nassay quality can introduce further uncertainty and must be\n\
    accounted for in any statistical models that are used to\nestimate parameters\
    \ of interest.\nLinear models have long been the mainstay of quanti-\ntative-genetic\
    \ experiments, and are the most commonly\napplied statistical approach to understanding\
    \ phenotypic\nvariation. Traditionally, these models are ﬁt using a variety\n\
    of maximum-likelihood approaches (Lynch and Walsh\n1997; Sorensen and Gianola\
    \ 2002). These approaches are\npopular because they are fast and easy to use,\
    \ and their\nlong history has resulted in a wide availability of user-\nfriendly\
    \ software. However, maximum-likelihood methods\nhave a number of serious limitations.\
    \ Fundamentally,\nmaximum-likelihood model ﬁtting yields point estimates of\n\
    parameters, ignoring the inherent uncertainty in their val-\nues. Parameters are\
    \ then tested for statistical signiﬁcance\nbased on a threshold (typically the\
    \ 5 % cut-off) and are\nexcluded from further analysis if they are not ‘‘signiﬁcant’’.\n\
    Finally, these statistical tests rely on restrictive assump-\ntions about the\
    \ distributions of model parameters. These\nconstraints of maximum-likelihood\
    \ model ﬁtting affect\nexperimental designs and data acquisition procedures, as\n\
    well as biasing the resulting associations. More pointedly,\nthese estimates perform\
    \ well only when measurements are\nextensively replicated and normally distributed.\
    \ Therefore,\na great variety of procedures for data normalization and\ndetection\
    \ of outliers are necessary in order to meet the\nassumptions of the model. Unfortunately,\
    \ these methods\nare often poorly motivated from a statistical point of view\n\
    because they involve arbitrary thresholds for data exclu-\nsion. Despite these\
    \ drawbacks, the speed and prevalence of\nmaximum-likelihood\nmethods\nmake\n\
    them\nuseful\nas\nexploratory data analysis tools even in cases where the\nresulting\
    \ estimates are not expected to be robust.\nThe Bayesian approach to statistical\
    \ inference is funda-\nmentally different and overcomes many of the limitations\n\
    imposed by a maximum-likelihood approach. Instead of\narriving at single most\
    \ likely point estimates of parameters,\nthe goal of Bayesian inference is to\
    \ describe distributions of\nrandom variables of interest, taking into account\
    \ uncertainty\nin all the other model parameters. This perspective on\ninference\
    \ is thus much more in line with biological reality\nand should be preferable\
    \ when dealing with phenotype data\nthat have been contextualized by both the\
    \ genotype and the\nenvironment. The drawback of Bayesian inference is its\ncomputational\
    \ complexity. Historically, this complexity has\nbeen the disadvantage that held\
    \ back widespread applica-\ntions of Bayesian statistics. However, with the dramatic\n\
    increase in computer power, it is now feasible to apply this\napproach to inference\
    \ even when the data sets are large and\nmulti-faceted. Furthermore, computer\
    \ packages that make\nmodel building and analysis relatively simple and accessi-\n\
    ble to researchers without a programming background are\nstarting to make an appearance\
    \ (Lunn et al. 2009; Plummer\n2003). Bayesian formulations of the standard quantitative-\n\
    genetic models have been extensively studied (Sorensen\nand Gianola 2002), but\
    \ these models can be computation-\nally inefﬁcient for large data sets. This\
    \ is true for maximum-\nlikelihood as well, but because Bayesian estimation\n\
    involves the extra step of estimating full distributions rather\nthan just point\
    \ estimates of parameters the computational\nproblems are particularly acute.\n\
    Appreciable improvements in computational stability\nand efﬁciency can be achieved\
    \ by re-formulating the\n878\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n123\nstandard\
    \ linear models in a hierarchical framework (Gel-\nman et al. 2003; Gelman and\
    \ Hill 2007). This framework is\npopular in the analyses of sociological data,\
    \ and is now\nachieving more currency in genetics (Greenberg et al.\n2010; Lenarcic\
    \ et al. 2012). The basic idea is that quanti-\ntative-genetic experiments are\
    \ inherently structured. For\nexample, when an inbred line is evaluated in a number\
    \ of\nenvironments, environmental effects can be nested within\ngenotypic effects.\
    \ Such nesting improves computational\nefﬁciency, increases power by incorporating\
    \ data-driven\npooling of observations from replicates (Gelman et al.\n2003; Gelman\
    \ and Hill 2007; Greenberg et al. 2010), and\naids in biological interpretation\
    \ of the results. Nesting\nenvironmental effects within genotypes has the added\n\
    convenience of allowing the direct modeling of G9E\ninteractions simply by estimating\
    \ the regression slopes as\nthey vary between inbred lines.\nIn cases where even\
    \ modest numbers of outlier obser-\nvations are present, Bayesian hierarchical\
    \ models also\nout-perform\nsimilar\nmaximum-likelihood\napproaches\n(Greenberg\
    \ et al. 2010). Furthermore, it is straightforward\nto expand hierarchical models\
    \ to include non-normal data\n(Gelman et al. 2003; Gelman and Hill 2007; Greenberg\n\
    et al. 2010), handle unbalanced designs (Gelman et al.\n2003; Greenberg et al.\
    \ 2010), incorporate variable assay\nquality (Greenberg et al. 2010, 2011), account\
    \ for outlier\nobservations without using arbitrary thresholds to exclude\nthem\
    \ from the data (Greenberg et al. 2010, 2011; Lenarcic\net al. 2012), and interrogate\
    \ phenotypic networks by\nextending the analyses to multiple phenotypes through\n\
    multivariate modeling (Greenberg et al. 2011). Finally,\nbecause the Bayesian\
    \ approach integrates over the inherent\nuncertainty in a system and borrows power\
    \ across the\nexperiment through hierarchical modeling, it reduces the\nneed for\
    \ extensive biological replicates, and therefore\nmaximizes the number of lines\
    \ that can be evaluated in a\ngiven study (Greenberg et al. 2010).\nThat being\
    \ said, while Bayesian hierarchical models are\nrobust to many problems in experimental\
    \ design and data\nacquisition, it is still a good idea to follow best practices\n\
    when embarking on a quantitative-genetic experiment.\nCertain problems, such as\
    \ putting all replicates for a line in\na single block, lead to complete confounding\
    \ of variables\nthat cannot be resolved by any statistical treatment.\nAlthough\
    \ it is possible to incorporate non-Gaussian data\ninto Bayesian models, these\
    \ extensions are typically com-\nputationally more expensive. For example, when\
    \ modeling\ncategorical data, one attempts to estimate an underlying\ncontinuous\
    \ distribution that would yield the observed data\nwhen coerced to being discrete.\
    \ Converting quantitative\nphenotypes (for example, the fraction of a plant tissue\n\
    affected by disease) to an index (susceptibility class) leads\nto loss of information\
    \ and an increase in model complexity.\nLikewise, summarizing replicate observations\
    \ and report-\ning only means can lead to either increased noise when\noutliers\
    \ are present or unwarranted precision. Such short\ncuts were defensible in the\
    \ past, when computational power\nand storage capacity to handle large data sets\
    \ was limited,\nbut this is no longer the case and the data should be\nreported\
    \ as ‘‘raw’’ as possible, and then modeled explicitly.\nGermplasm development\
    \ and distributed phenotyping\nnetworks\nAdvances in phenotyping and genotyping\
    \ technology, as\nwell as data storage, and computational capacity are\nopening\
    \ many new opportunities to extract meaningful\ninferences from even noisy biological\
    \ data. New statistical\nmodels that account for biological uncertainty and estimate\n\
    values of direct interest, rather than those dictated by\ncomputational\nconvenience,\n\
    promise\nto\naid\nin\nthe\nachievement of this goal. However, the value of any\
    \ pro-\ngress that may be gained through the marriage of next-\ngeneration phenotyping\
    \ with modern genomic tools is\npredicated on the availability of diverse germplasm\
    \ and\ngenetically well-deﬁned populations. Indeed associating\ngenotype with\
    \ phenotype in ways that address hypothesis-\ndriven questions and empower crop\
    \ improvement depends\non the availability of appropriate germplasm resources\
    \ to\naddress speciﬁc questions.\nThe preservation of plant biodiversity in publicly\n\
    available, international germplasm collections is of central\nimportance to our\
    \ quest to understand natural variation and\nto utilize that variation to meet\
    \ the future needs of the\nplanet. It is not unimaginable that we will be able\
    \ to ge-\nnomically characterize most of the accessions in the\nworld’s repositories\
    \ of genetic resources, but the sheer size\nof these collections, the broad range\
    \ of adaptation they\nrepresent, import–export restrictions, and the genetic\n\
    redundancy housed within their ranks presents a challenge\nfor direct phenotypic\
    \ evaluation. Targeted subsets of this\nvariation need to be assembled so that\
    \ available pheno-\ntyping resources can be efﬁciently used to evaluate them,\n\
    taking advantage of economies of scale wherever possible\n(Glaszmann et al. 2010;\
    \ McCouch et al. 2012). The\ndevelopment of shared populations with publically\
    \ avail-\nable, high-resolution genotype data will be critical for\npermitting\
    \ the kind of distributed phenotyping necessary to\nunderstand genotype–phenotype\
    \ relationships (Valdar et al.\n2006). Examples of research communities that have\n\
    developed these kinds of publicly shared germplasm\nresources include rice (Zhao\
    \ et al. 2011a), maize (Yu et al.\n2008), wheat (Neumann et al. 2011) Arabidopsis\
    \ (Atwell\net al. 2010), sorghum (Mitchell et al. 2008), barley (Pasam\net al.\
    \ 2012) and many other species (Zhu et al. 2008). The\nTheor Appl Genet (2013)\
    \ 126:867–887\n879\n123\navailability of these resources makes it possible for\
    \ mul-\ntiple researchers to interrogate the same genetic materials,\nphenotyping\
    \ in environments and with technology and\nanalytical expertise that are uniquely\
    \ available to different\nresearch groups. Integrating such vast phenotypic datasets\n\
    on common germplasm resources in well-structured dat-\nabases will permit high-end\
    \ analysis not just of the phe-\nnotypes\nthemselves,\nbut\nalso\nof\ncomplex\n\
    correlated\nphenotypic networks that represent a more accurate\ndepiction of biological\
    \ reality.\nAdditionally, more genetically structured resources such\nas chromosome\
    \ segment substitution lines (Ali et al. 2010;\nLu et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012;\
    \ Fukuoka et al. 2010; Xu\net al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2011), multi-parent advanced\n\
    generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations (Huang et al.\n2011, 2012; Rakshit\
    \ et al. 2012), and nested association\nmapping (NAM) populations (Yu et al. 2008)\
    \ will permit\nthe interrogation of natural variation in elite genetic\nbackgrounds\
    \ that may be intractable otherwise. These\ngenetically structured populations\
    \ partition the variation in\nways that facilitate the identiﬁcation of exotic\
    \ alleles that\nmay have a signiﬁcant impact on a phenotype of interest,\nbut\
    \ only when introgressed into the elite background. They\nalso expedite the subsequent\
    \ use of these resources as\nparents in a breeding program, helping expand the\
    \ range of\ngenetic variation available in an elite gene pool and\nopening up\
    \ new opportunities to utilize natural variation to\ndrive crop improvement.\n\
    Conclusions\nEver since the ﬁrst published QTL analysis (Sax 1923),\ngenetics\
    \ as a discipline has endeavored to shed light on the\ncomplexities of phenotypic\
    \ variation. For most of recent\nmemory, progress in understanding the genetic\
    \ architecture\nof complex traits has been driven by improvement in\ngenotyping\
    \ technology. As a clear picture of the genome\nemerges, a renewed focus on understanding\
    \ the nature of\nphenotypes will be necessary for continued advancement.\nWe have\
    \ discussed the role of phenotyping in gene\ndiscovery and crop improvement through\
    \ both GWAS and\nGS, and we have attempted to understand the complexities\nincumbent\
    \ on the association of genotype with phenotype\nunder variable environmental\
    \ conditions. We considered\nstrategies that permit the collection of phenotypic\
    \ data in\nquantitative ways as well as the development of modular\ntechnologies\
    \ to accommodate the changing needs and\nopportunities of phenotyping in the future.\
    \ We have pon-\ndered on the best practices for storing, cataloging, man-\naging,\n\
    and\ndisseminating\nthis\ninformation\nwithin\na\ncommunity, and suggested how\
    \ this data might be com-\nbined with cutting edge statistical analysis to leverage\n\
    increased computing capacity (Fig. 2). To conclude, we\nconsider where some of\
    \ the current deﬁciencies lie and\nhighlight a few questions that still need answers.\n\
    Genotyping, while closing in on understanding the full\nextent of allelic variation\
    \ in major crop species, is still\nyears away from delivering on the quest to\
    \ catalogue the\nworld’s collection of DNA variants for an entire species.\nThis\
    \ requires assembly of multiple de novo reference\ngenomes and re-sequencing of\
    \ thousands of diverse lines to\nidentify all of the SNPs, copy number variants,\
    \ and other\nforms of DNA and epigenetic variation within a gene pool.\nAs that\
    \ information is generated, researchers will seek to\nannotate the functional\
    \ signiﬁcance of the SNPs and\ninsertion/deletion polymorphisms, and design databases\n\
    that can host this information and make it accessible and\nquery-able for the\
    \ research community. This is a real\nchallenge because many functional variants\
    \ do not fall\nwithin gene models, but are found as inter-genic regulatory\nelements\
    \ or may condition gene expression through epi-\ngenetic pathways that contribute\
    \ to quantitative phenotypic\nvariation (Ding et al. 2012; Loehlin et al. 2010;\
    \ Salvi et al.\n2007; Zhou et al. 2012; Zhu and Deng 2012). This chal-\nlenge\
    \ also highlights the value of positional cloning to\nverify the functional nucleotide\
    \ polymorphisms (FNP)\nrather than taking a candidate gene approach, as the FNP\n\
    may not be found within a gene model at all. Additionally,\nfor many years to\
    \ come, the identiﬁcation and character-\nization of rare alleles will remain\
    \ a priority, despite the fact\nthat both GWAS and GS have little power to detect\
    \ their\ncontributions to phenotypic variation.\nAlgorithms for optimizing signal-to-noise\
    \ ratios in\nphenotypic experiments, pipelines for identifying GWAS\npeaks and\
    \ extracting meaningful lists of candidate genes\nunderlying those peaks are needed\
    \ to help standardize\nassociation mapping studies. Functional annotation of QTL\n\
    alleles and correspondence to the germplasm samples in\nwhich they are found would\
    \ help link genetic research with\nbreeding applications. Better tools for SNP\
    \ haplotype\nvisualization and management of high-volume SNP data\nneed to be\
    \ integrated into software platforms to facilitate\nthe identiﬁcation of functionally\
    \ relevant SNPs that can be\nused for marker-assisted selection and as ﬁxed variables\
    \ in\ngenomic prediction. As more and more phenotype data are\ncollected and databased,\
    \ tools to facilitate our under-\nstanding of intersecting phenotypic networks\
    \ will shed\nlight on the complex relationships within and between\nphenotypes\
    \ (Yin and Struik 2008). This information will\nprovide important insights about\
    \ selection trade-offs and\nphenotypic correlations that are relevant to variety\
    \ devel-\nopment and plant breeding.\nMajor questions about phenotypic variation,\
    \ which we\ncurrently have limited capacity to answer, include: How\ndoes variation\
    \ in regulatory elements manifest itself in the\n880\nTheor Appl Genet (2013)\
    \ 126:867–887\n123\nphenotype? Which environmental variables act as signals\n\
    that regulate these genes and how do different allelic\nvariants recognize those\
    \ signals? What is the role of epis-\ntasis and epigenetics in determining phenotypic\
    \ variation,\nor in phenotypic plasticity?\nApproaching many of these questions\
    \ will require more\nreﬁned strategies of collecting and managing phenotype\n\
    data. Many of the considerations that need to be addressed\nbefore making decisions\
    \ about deﬁning a phenotyping\napproach include: How easy is it to evaluate the\
    \ pheno-\ntype? How quantitative is that measurement? Can the\nprocess be automated?\
    \ If so, does it make economic sense\nto do so? What value would automation bring?\
    \ What\nindirect\nfactors\nwill\ninﬂuence\nthe\nphenotypic\nFig. 2\nWhen combined\
    \ with high-throughput genotyping on shared\ngermplasm resources, and done in\
    \ geographically distributed collab-\norative networks, next-generation phenotyping\
    \ can empower both\ngene discovery and crop improvement. Central to that capacity\
    \ is the\ncareful and judicious use of modular technologies and managed\nenvironments.\
    \ The use of standardized ontologies and Bayesian\nanalysis then create a controlled\
    \ vocabulary for describing the data\nand provide a way to integrate results across\
    \ experiments by\naccounting for the unique signatures of biological noise generated\n\
    by environmental covariates\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n881\n123\nmeasurement?\
    \ Can they be quantiﬁed? How much storage\ncapacity do I need to maintain the\
    \ raw or processed phe-\nnotypic data? How will the data be organized so that\
    \ it is\nboth query-able and understandable? What data processing\nneeds must\
    \ be considered before the phenotype is biolog-\nically meaningful? Do I have\
    \ the skills in-house or\nappropriate collaborators in place to realize a sophisticated\n\
    analysis of the data? Answers to these questions will\ndepend entirely on the\
    \ purpose and intention of collecting\nphenotypic data to start with, and of course\
    \ the nature of\nthe phenotype itself.\nThe phenotype of an organism is fundamentally\
    \ a\nmanifestation of a genotype’s interaction with the envi-\nronment. With increased\
    \ allocation of funding and intel-\nlectual investment over the next decade, advances\
    \ in\nphenotyping will enhance our ability to associate that data\nwith the genotypic\
    \ and environmental variables to simul-\ntaneously and synergistically drive gene\
    \ discovery efforts\naimed at understanding the genetic basis of quantitative\n\
    phenotypic variation and fuel the development of genomic\nprediction models for\
    \ crop improvement. As these two\ndrivers of genetic analysis feed into each other,\
    \ not only\nwill tremendous gains be made in comprehending the\nbiology of plants,\
    \ but we will also ensure continued\nadvancement in crop improvement aimed at\
    \ meeting the\ndemands of a growing population.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors\

    amounts of data have been produced, since the past decade as the miniaturization
    of Internet of things (IoT) devices increases. However, such data are not useful
    without analytic power. Numerous big data, IoT, and analytics solutions have enabled
    people to obtain valuable insight into large data generated by IoT devices. However,
    these solutions are still in their infancy, and the domain lacks a comprehensive
    survey. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art research efforts directed
    toward big IoT data analytics. The relationship between big data analytics and
    IoT is explained. Moreover, this paper adds value by proposing a new architecture
    for big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big IoT data analytic types, methods,
    and technologies for big data mining are discussed. Numerous notable use cases
    are also presented. Several opportunities brought by data analytics in IoT paradigm
    are then discussed. Finally, open research challenges, such as privacy, big data

    DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2689040 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The development of big data and the Internet of things (IoT) is rapidly accelerating
    and affecting all areas of technologies and businesses by increasing the benefits
    for organizations and individuals. The growth of data produced via IoT has played
    a major role on the big data landscape. Big data can be categorized according
    to three aspects: (a) volume, (b) variety, and (c) velocity [1]. These categories
    were first introduced byGartner to describe the elements of big data challenges
    [2]. Immense opportunities are presented by the capability to analyze and utilize
    huge amounts of IoT data, including applications in smart cities, smart transport
    and grid systems, energy smart meters, and remote patient healthcare monitoring
    devices. The widespread popularity of IoT has made big data analytics challenging
    because of the processing and collection of data through different sensors in
    the IoT environment. The International Data Corporation (IDC) report indicates
    that the big data market will reach over US$125 billion by 2019 [3]. IoT big data
    analytics can be defined as the steps in which a variety of IoT data are examined
    [4] to reveal trends, unseen patterns, hidden correlations, and new information
    [5]. Companies and individuals can benefit from analyzing large amounts of data
    and managing huge amounts of information that can affect businesses [6]. Therefore,
    IoT big data analytics aims to assist business associations and other organizations
    to achieve improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed
    decisions. Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze huge
    amounts of unstructured data that can be harnessed using traditional tools [5].
    Moreover,big data analytics aims to immediately extract knowledgeable information
    using data mining techniques that help in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and making decisions [7]. Techniques in data
    mining are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized data
    analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    IoT data are different from normal big data collected via systems in terms of
    characteristics because of the various sensors and objects involved during data
    collection, which include heterogeneity, noise, variety, and rapid growth. Statistics
    [8] show that the number of sensors will be increased by 1 trillion in 2030. This
    increase will affect the growth of big data. Introducing data analytics and IoT
    into big data requires huge resources, and IoT has the capability to offer an
    excellent solution. Appropriate resources and intensive applications of the platforms
    are provided by IoT services for effective communication among various deployed
    applications. Such process is suitable for fulfilling the requirements of IoT
    applications, and can reduce some challenges in the future of big data analytics.
    This technological amalgamation increases the possibility of implementing IoT
    toward a better direction. Moreover, implementing IoT and big data integration
    solutions can help address issues on storage, processing, data analytics, and
    visualization tools. It can also assist in improving collaboration and communication
    among various objects in a smart city [9]. Application areas, such as smart ecological
    environments, smart traffic, smart grids, intelligent buildings, and logistic
    intelligent management, can benefit from the aforementioned arrangement. Many
    studies on big data has focused on big data management; in particular, big data
    analytics has been surveyed [10], [11]. However, this survey focused on IoT big
    data in the context of the analytics of a huge amount of data. The contributions
    of this survey are as follows. State-of-the-art research efforts conducted in
    terms of big data analytics are investigated. An architecture for big IoT data
    analytics is proposed. Several unprecedented opportunities brought by data analytics
    in the IoT domain are introduced. Credible use cases are presented. Research challenges
    that remain to be addressed are identified and discussed. These contributions
    are presented from Sections 3 to 6. The conclusion is provided in Section 7. SECTION
    II. Overview of IoT and Big Data An overview of IoT technologies and big data
    is provided before the discussion. A. IoT IoT offers a platform for sensors and
    devices to communicate seamlessly within a smart environment and enables information
    sharing across platforms in a convenient manner. The recent adaptation of different
    wireless technologies places IoT as the next revolutionary technology by benefiting
    from the full opportunities offered by the Internet technology. IoT has witnessed
    its recent adoption in smart cities with interest in developing intelligent systems,
    such as smart office, smart retail, smart agriculture, smart water, smart transportation,
    smart healthcare, and smart energy [12], [13]. IoT has emerged as a new trend
    in the last few years, where mobile devices, transportation facilities, public
    facilities, and home appliances can all be used as data acquisition equipment
    in IoT. All surrounding electronic equipment to facilitate daily life operations,
    such as wristwatches, vending machines, emergency alarms, and garage doors, as
    well as home appliances, such as refrigerators, microwave ovens, air conditioners,
    and water heaters are connected to an IoT network and can be controlled remotely.
    Ciufo [14] stated that these devices “talk” to one another and to central controlling
    devices. Such devices deployed in different areas may collect various kinds of
    data, such as geographical, astronomical, environmental, and logistical data.
    A large number of communication devices in the IoT paradigm are embedded into
    sensor devices in the real world. Data collecting devices sense data and transmit
    these data using embedded communication devices. The continuum of devices and
    objects are interconnected through a variety of communication solutions, such
    as Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee, and GSM. These communication devices transmit data
    and receive commands from remotely controlled devices, which allow direct integration
    with the physical world through computer-based systems to improve living standards.
    Over 50 billion devices ranging from smartphones, laptops, sensors, and game consoles
    are anticipated to be connected to the Internet through several heterogeneous
    access networks enabled by technologies, such as radio frequency identification
    (RFID) and wireless sensor networks. Reference [15] mentioned that IoT could be
    recognized in three paradigms: Internet-oriented, sensors, and knowledge [16].
    The recent adaptation of different wireless technologies places IoT as the next
    revolutionary technology by benefiting from the full opportunities offered by
    Internet technology. B. Big Data The volume of data generated by sensors, devices,
    social media, health care applications, temperature sensors, and various other
    software applications and digital devices that continuously generate large amounts
    of structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data is strongly increasing. This
    massive data generation results in “big data” [17]. Traditional database systems
    are inefficient when storing, processing, and analyzing rapidly growing amount
    of data or big data [18]. The term “big data” has been used in the previous literature
    but is relatively new in business and IT [19]. An example of big data-related
    studies is the next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity; McKinsey
    Global Institute [20] defined big data as the size of data sets that are a better
    database system tool than the usual tools for capturing, storing, processing,
    and analyzing such data [18]. “The Digital Universe” study [21] labels big data
    technologies as a new generation of technologies and architectures that aim to
    take out the value from a massive volume of data with various formats by enabling
    high-velocity capture, discovery, and analysis. This previous study also characterizes
    big data into three aspects: (a) data sources, (b) data analytics, and (c) the
    presentation of the results of the analytics. This definition uses the 3V’s (volume,
    variety, velocity) model proposed by Beyer [2]. The model highlights an e-commerce
    trend in data management that faces challenges to manage volume or size of data,
    variety or different sources of data, and velocity or speed of data creation.
    Some studies declare volume as a main characteristic of big data without providing
    a pure definition [22]. However, other researchers introduced additional characteristics
    for big data, such as veracity, value, variability, and complexity [23], [24].
    The 3V’s model, or its derivations, is the most common descriptions of the term
    “big data.” SECTION III. Big Data Analytics Big data analytics involves the processes
    of searching a database, mining, and analyzing data dedicated to improve company
    performance [25]. Big data analytics is the process of examining large data sets
    that contain a variety of data types [4] to reveal unseen patterns, hidden correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful business information [5].
    The capability to analyze large amounts of data can help an organization deal
    with considerable information that can affect the business [6]. Therefore, the
    main objective of big data analytics is to assist business associations to have
    improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed decisions.
    Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze a large volume
    of data that may not be harnessed using traditional tools [5]. Big data analytics
    require technologies and tools that can transform a large amount of structured,
    unstructured, and semi-structured data into a more understandable data and metadata
    format for analytical processes. The algorithms used in these analytical tools
    must discover patterns, trends, and correlations over a variety of time horizons
    in the data [26]. After analyzing the data, these tools visualize the findings
    in tables, graphs, and spatial charts for efficient decision making. Thus, big
    data analysis is a serious challenge for many applications because of data complexity
    and the scalability of underlying algorithms that support such processes [27].
    Talia (2013) highlighted that obtaining helpful information from big data analysis
    is a critical matter that requires scalable analytical algorithms and techniques
    to return well-timed results, whereas current techniques and algorithms are inefficient
    to handle big data analytics. Therefore, large infrastructure and additional applications
    are necessary to support data parallelism. Moreover, data sources, such as high-speed
    data stream received from different data sources, have different formats, which
    makes integrating multiple sources for analytics solutions critical [28]. Hence,
    the challenge is focused on the performance of current algorithms used in big
    data analysis, which is not rising linearly with the rapid increase in computational
    resources [19]. Big data analytics processes consume considerable time to provide
    feedback and guidelines to users, whereas only a few tools [29] can process huge
    data sets within reasonable amount of processing time. By contrast, most of the
    remaining tools use the complicated trial-and-error method to deal with massive
    amounts of data sets and data heterogeneity [30]. Big data analytics systems exist.
    For example, the Exploratory Data Analysis Environment [31] is a big data visual
    analytics system that is used to analyze complex earth system simulations with
    large numbers of data sets. A. Existing Analytics Systems Different analytic types
    are used according to the requirements of IoT applications [32]. These analytic
    types are discussed in this subsection under real-time, off-line, memory-level,
    business intelligence (BI) level, and massive level analytics categories. Moreover,
    a comparison based on analytics types and their levels is presented in Table 1.
    TABLE 1 Comparison of Different Analytics Types and Their Levels Real-time analytics
    is typically performed on data collected from sensors. In this situation, data
    change constantly, and rapid data analytics techniques are required to obtain
    an analytical result within a short period. Consequently, two existing architectures
    have been proposed for real-time analysis: parallel processing clusters using
    traditional relational databases and memory-based computing platforms [33]. Greenplum
    [34] and Hana [35] are examples of real-time analytics architecture. Off-line
    analytics is used when a quick response is not required [32]. For example, many
    Internet enterprises use Hadoop-based off-line analytics architecture to reduce
    the cost of data format conversion [36]. Such analytics improves data acquisition
    efficiency. SCRIBE [37], Kafka [38], Time-Tunnel [39], and Chukwa [40] are examples
    of architectures that conduct off-line analytics and can satisfy the demands of
    data acquisition. Memory-level analytics is applied when the size of data is smaller
    than the memory of a cluster [32]. To date, the memory of clusters has reached
    terabyte (TB) level [41]. Therefore, several internal database technologies are
    required to improve analytical efficiency. Memory-level analytics is suitable
    for conducting real-time analysis. MongoDB [42] is an example of this architecture.
    BI analytics is adopted when the size of data is larger than the memory level,
    but in this case, data may be imported to the BI analysis environment [43]. BI
    analytic currently supports TB-level data [32]. Moreover, BI can help discover
    strategic business opportunities from the flood of data. In addition, BI analytics
    allows easy interpretation of data volumes. Identifying new opportunities and
    implementing an effective strategy provide competitive market advantage and long-term
    stability. Massive analytics is applied when the size of data is greater than
    the entire capacity of the BI analysis product and traditional databases [44].
    Massive analytics uses the Hadoop distributed file system for data storage and
    map/reduce for data analysis. Massive analytics helps create the business foundation
    and increases market competitiveness by extracting meaningful values from data.
    Moreover, massive analytics obtains accurate data that leverage the risks involved
    in making any business decision. In addition, massive analytics provides services
    effectively. B. Relationship Between IoT and Big Data Analytics Big data analytics
    is rapidly emerging as a key IoT initiative to improve decision making. One of
    the most prominent features of IoT is its analysis of information about “connected
    things.” Big data analytics in IoT requires processing a large amount of data
    on the fly and storing the data in various storage technologies. Given that much
    of the unstructured data are gathered directly from web-enabled “things,” big
    data implementations will necessitate performing lightning-fast analytics with
    large queries to allow organizations to gain rapid insights, make quick decisions,
    and interact with people and other devices. The interconnection of sensing and
    actuating devices provide the capability to share information across platforms
    through a unified architecture and develop a common operating picture for enabling
    innovative applications. The need to adopt big data in IoT applications is compelling.
    These two technologies have already been recognized in the fields of IT and business.
    Although, the development of big data is already lagging, these technologies are
    inter-dependent and should be jointly developed. In general, the deployment of
    IoT increases the amount of data in quantity and category; hence, offering the
    opportunity for the application and development of big data analytics. Moreover,
    the application of big data technologies in IoT accelerates the research advances
    and business models of IoT. The relationship between IoT and big data, which is
    shown in Figure 1, can be divided into three steps to enable the management of
    IoT data. The first step comprises managing IoT data sources, where connected
    sensors devices use applications to interact with one another. For example, the
    interaction of devices such as CCTV cameras, smart traffic lights, and smart home
    devices, generates large amounts of data sources with different formats. This
    data can be stored in low cost commodity storage on the cloud. In the second step,
    the generated data are called “big data,” which are based on their volume, velocity,
    and variety. These huge amounts of data are stored in big data files in shared
    distributed fault-tolerant databases. The last step applies analytics tools such
    as MapReduce, Spark, Splunk, and Skytree that can analyze the stored big IoT data
    sets. The four levels of analytics start from training data, then move on to analytics
    tools, queries, and reports. FIGURE 1. Relationship between IoT and big data analytics.
    Show All C. Big Data Analytics Methods Big data analytics aim to immediately extract
    knowledgeable information that helps in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and ultimately, making decisions [7]. Data
    mining techniques are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized
    data analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    The evolution of big data also changes analytics requirements. Although the requirements
    for efficient mechanisms lie in all aspects of big data management [30], such
    as capturing, storage, preprocessing, and analysis; for our discussion, big data
    analytics requires the same or faster processing speed than traditional data analytics
    with minimum cost for high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data [45].
    Various solutions are available for big data analytics, and advancements in developing
    and improving these solutions are being continuously achieved to make them suitable
    for new big data trends. Data mining plays an important role in analytics, and
    most of the techniques are developed using data mining algorithms according to
    a particular scenario. Knowledge on available big data analytics options is crucial
    when evaluating and choosing an appropriate approach for decision making. In this
    section, we present several methods that can be implemented for several big data
    case studies. Some of these analytics methods are efficient for big IoT data analytics.
    Diverse and tremendous size data sets contribute more in big data insights. However,
    this belief is not always valid because more data may have more ambiguities and
    abnormalities [7]. We present big data analytics methods under classification,
    clustering, association rule mining, and prediction categories. Figure 2 depicts
    and summarizes each of these categories. Each category is a data mining function
    and involves many methods and algorithms to fulfill information extraction and
    analysis requirements. For example, Bayesian network, support vector machine (SVM),
    and k -nearest neighbor (KNN) offer classification methods. Similarly, partitioning,
    hierarchical clustering, and co-occurrence are widespread in clustering. Association
    rule mining and prediction comprise significant methods. FIGURE 2. Overview of
    big data analytics methods. Show All Classification is a supervised learning approach
    that uses prior knowledge as training data to classify data objects into groups
    [46]. A predefined category is assigned to an object, and thus, the objective
    of predicting a group or class for an object is achieved (see Figure 2). Finding
    unknown or hidden patterns is more challenging for big IoT data. Furthermore,
    extracting valuable information from large data sets to improve decision making
    is a critical task. A Bayesian network is a classification method that offers
    model interpretability. Bayesian networks are efficient for analyzing complex
    data structures revealed through big data rather than traditional structured data
    formats. These networks are directed acyclic graphs, where nodes are random variables
    and edges denote conditional dependency [47]. Naïve, selective naïve, semi-naïve
    Bayes, and Bayes multi-nets are the proposed categories for classification [48].
    Analyzing data patterns and creating groups are efficiently performed using SVM,
    which is also classification approach for big data analytics. SVM utilizes statistical
    learning theory to analyze data patterns and create groups. Several applications
    of SVM classification in big data analytics include text classification [49],
    pattern matching [50], health diagnostics [51], and commerce. Similarly, KNN is
    typically designed to provide efficient mechanisms for finding hidden patterns
    from big data sets, such that retrieved objects are similar to the predefined
    category [52]. Using cases further improve the KNN algorithm for application in
    anomaly detection [53], high-dimensional data [54], and scientific experiments
    [55]. Classification has other extensions while adopting a large number of artificial
    intelligence and data mining techniques. Consequently, classification is one of
    the widespread data mining techniques for big data analytics. Clustering is another
    data mining technique used as a big data analytics method. Contrary to classification,
    clustering uses an unsupervised learning approach and creates groups for given
    objects based on their distinctive meaningful features [56]. As we have presented
    in Figure 2 that grouping a large number of objects in the form of clusters makes
    data manipulation simple. The well-known methods used for clustering are hierarchical
    clustering and partitioning. The hierarchical clustering approach keeps combining
    small clusters of data objects to form a hierarchical tree and create agglomerative
    clusters. Divisive clusters are created in the opposite manner by dividing a single
    cluster that contains all data objects into smaller appropriate clusters [57].
    Market analysis and business decision making are the most significant applications
    of big data analytics. The process of association rule mining involves identifying
    interesting relationships among different objects, events, or other entities to
    analyze market trends, consumer buying behavior, and product demand predictions
    (see Figure 2). Association rule mining [58] focuses on identifying and creating
    rules based on the frequency of occurrences for numeric and non-numeric data.
    Data processing is performed in two manners under association rules. First, sequential
    data processing uses priori-based algorithms, such as MSPS [59] and LAPIN-SPAM
    [60], to identify interaction associations. Another significant data processing
    approach under association rule is temporal sequence analysis, which uses algorithms
    to analyze event patterns in continuous data. Predictive analytics use historical
    data, which are known as training data, to determine the results as trends or
    behavior in data. SVM and fuzzy logic algorithms are used to identify relationships
    between independent and dependent variables and to obtain regression curves for
    predictions, such as for natural disasters. Furthermore, customer buying predictions
    and social media trends are analyzed through predictive analytics [61] (see Table
    2). In the case of big data analytics, processing requirements are modified according
    to the nature and volume of data. Fast data access and mining methods for structured
    and unstructured data are major concerns related to big data analytics. Furthermore,
    data representation is a significant requirement in big data analytics. Time series
    analysis reduces high dimensionality associated with big data and offers representation
    for improved decision making. Research related to time series representation includes
    ARMA [62], bitmaps [63], and wavelet functions [64]. TABLE 2 Applications of Big
    Data Mining for IoT The big data analytics methods discussed in this section are
    widely adopted in many application areas of big data, such as disaster management,
    healthcare, business, industry, and e-governance. In Table 2, we present the application
    areas of big data mining functionalities that are elaborated in this section,
    ‘ ✓ ’ is used to show the support for an application whereas ‘-’ denotes that
    it is not obvious whether the method supports to an application or not. In particular,
    Table 2 shows that classification methods are suitable for medical imaging, industry,
    speech recognition, natural language processing, and e-governance. Clustering
    and association rule-based data analytics methods are applicable to industry and
    e-governance and are well adopted in healthcare, e-commerce, and bioinformatics.
    Predictive analytics are useful for disaster and market predictions, whereas time
    series analysis is used in disaster forecasting, medical imaging, speech recognition,
    social network analysis, and e-governance. D. IoT Architecture for Big Data Analytics
    The architectural concept of IoT has several definitions based on IoT domain abstraction
    and identification. It offers a reference model that defines relationships among
    various IoT verticals, such as, smart traffic, smart home, smart transportation,
    and smart health. The architecture for big data analytics offers a design for
    data abstraction. Furthermore, this standard provides a reference architecture
    that builds upon the reference model. Many IoT architectures are found in the
    literature [13], [66], [67]. For example, [13] offered an IoT architecture with
    cloud computing at the center and a model of end-to-end interaction among various
    stakeholders in a cloud-centric IoT framework for better comparison with the proposed
    IoT architecture. This architecture is achieved by seamless ubiquitous sensing,
    data analytics, and information representation with IoT as the unifying architecture.
    However, the current architecture focuses on IoT with regard to communications.
    To our knowledge, our proposed architecture, which integrates IoT and big data
    analytics, has not been studied in the current literature. Figure 3 illustrates
    the IoT architecture and big data analytics. In this figure, the sensor layer
    contains all the sensor devices and the objects, which are connected through a
    wireless network. This wireless network communication can be RFID, WiFi, ultra-wideband,
    ZigBee, and Bluetooth. The IoT gateway allows communication of the Internet and
    various webs. The upper layer concerns big data analytics, where a large amount
    of data received from sensors are stored in the cloud and accessed through big
    data analytics applications. These applications contain API management and a dashboard
    to help in the interaction with the processing engine. FIGURE 3. IoT architecture
    and big data analytics. Show All A novel meta-model-based approach for integrating
    IoT architecture objects is proposed. The concept is semi-automatically federated
    into a holistic digital enterprise architecture environment. The main objective
    is to provide an adequate decision support for complex business, architecture
    management with the development of assessment systems, and IT environment. Thus,
    architectural decisions for IoT are closely connected with code implementation
    to allow users to understand the integration of enterprise architecture management
    with IoT. SECTION IV. Use Cases This section presents a number of use cases for
    big IoT data analytics. Although the use cases are relevant to IoT applications,
    the choices have been guided for the ones that are most commonly used in IoT applications
    and for the amount of data that can be generated for analytics. A. Smart Metering
    Smart metering is one of the IoT application use cases that generates a large
    amount of data from different sources, such as smart grids, tank levels, and water
    flows, and silos stock calculation, in which processing takes a long time even
    on a dedicated and powerful machine [68]. A smart meter is a device that electronically
    records consumption of electric energy data between the meter and the control
    system. Collecting and analyzing smart meter data in IoT environment assist the
    decision maker in predicting electricity consumption. Furthermore, the analytics
    of a smart meter can also be used to forecast demands to prevent crises and satisfy
    strategic objectives through specific pricing plans. Thus, utility companies must
    be capable of high-volume data management and advanced analytics designed to transform
    data into actionable insights. B. Smart Transportation A smart transportation
    system is an IoT-based use case that aims to support the smart city concept. A
    smart transportation system intends to deploy powerful and advanced communication
    technologies for the management of smart cities. Traditional transportation systems,
    which are based on image processing, are affected by weather conditions, such
    as heavy rains and thick fog. Consequently, the captured image may not be clearly
    visible. The design of an e-plate system [69] using RFID technology provides a
    good solution for intelligent monitoring, tracking, and identification of vehicles.
    Moreover, introducing IoT into vehicular technologies will enable traffic congestion
    management to exhibit significantly better performance than the existing infrastructure.
    This technology can improve existing traffic systems in which vehicles can effectively
    communicate with one another in a systematic manner without human intervention.
    Satellite navigation systems and sensors can also be applied in trucks, ships,
    and airplanes in real time. The routing of these vehicles can be optimized by
    using the bulk of available public data, such as traffic jams, road conditions,
    delivery addresses, weather conditions, and locations of refilling stations. For
    example, in case of runtime address change, the updated information (route, cost)
    can be optimized, recalculated, and passed on to drivers in real time. Sensors
    incorporated into these vehicles can also provide real-time information to measure
    engine health, determine whether equipment requires maintenance, and predict errors
    [70]. C. Smart Supply Chains Embedded sensor technologies can communicate bidirectionally
    and provide remote accessibility to over 1 million elevators worldwide [71]. The
    captured data are used by on-and off-site technicians to run diagnostics and repair
    options to make appropriate decisions, which result in increased machine uptime
    and enhanced customer service. Ultimately, big IoT data analytics allows a supply
    chain to execute decisions and control the external environment. IoT-enabled factory
    equipment will be able to communicate within data parameters (i.e., machine utilization,
    temperature) and optimize performance by changing equipment settings or process
    workflow [72]. In-transit visibility is another use case that will play a vital
    role in future supply chains in the presence of IoT infrastructure. Key technologies
    used by in-transit visibility are RFIDs and cloud-based Global Positioning System
    (GPS), which provide location, identity, and other tracking information. These
    data will be the backbone of supply chains supported by IoT technologies. The
    information gathered by equipment will provide detailed visibility of an item
    shipped from a manufacturer to a retailer. Data collected via RFID and GPS technologies
    will allow supply chain managers to enhance automated shipment and accurate delivery
    information by predicting time of arrival. Similarly, managers will be able to
    monitor other information, such as temperature control, which can affect the quality
    of in-transit products. D. Smart Agriculture Smart agriculture is a beneficial
    use case in big IoT data analytics. Sensors are the actors in the smart agriculture
    use case. They are installed in fields to obtain data on moisture level of soil,
    trunk diameter of plants, microclimate condition, and humidity level, as well
    as to forecast weather. Sensors transmit obtained data using network and communication
    devices. These data pass through an IoT gateway and the Internet to reach the
    analytics layer shown in Table 1. The analytics layer processes the data obtained
    from the sensor network to issue commands. Automatic climate control according
    to harvesting requirements, timely and controlled irrigation, and humidity control
    for fungus prevention are examples of actions performed based on big data analytics
    recommendations. E. Smart Grid The smart grid is a new generation of power grid
    in which managing and distributing electricity between suppliers and consumers
    is upgraded using two-way communication technologies and computing capabilities
    to improve reliability, safety, efficiency with real-time control, and monitoring
    [73], [74]. One of the major challenges in a power system is integrating renewable
    and decentralized energy. Electricity systems require a smart grid to manage the
    volatile behavior of distributed energy resources (DERs) [75]. However, most energy
    systems have to follow governmental laws and regulations, as well as consider
    business analysis and potential legal constraints [76]. Grid sensors and devices
    continuously and rapidly generate data related to control loops and protection
    and require real-time processing and analytics along with machine-to-machine (M2M)
    or human-to-machine (HMI) interactions to issue control commands to the system.
    However, the system must fulfill visualization and reporting requirements. F.
    Smart Traffic Light System The smart traffic light system consists of nodes that
    locally interact with IoT sensors and devices to detect the presence of vehicles,
    bikers, and pedestrians. These nodes communicate with neighboring traffic lights
    to measure the speed and distance of approaching transportation means and manage
    green traffic signals [77]. IoT data gathered using the system require real-time
    analytics processing to perform necessary tasks, such as changing the timing cycles
    according to traffic conditions, sending informative signals to neighboring nodes,
    and detecting approaching vehicles that use IoT sensors and devices to prevent
    long queues or accidents. Moreover, smart traffic light systems can send their
    collected IoT data to cloud storage for further analytics. Table 3 presents the
    use cases of IoT big data analytics. TABLE 3 Comparison of IoT Big Data Analytics
    use Cases As shown in Table 3, most use cases are related to M2M communication
    technologies and decrease the role of human interaction. However, the technologies
    use prediction methods and decision-making techniques to improve real-time control,
    monitoring, and performance. Textual data are among the common data types generated
    by IoT devices, which are mostly sensors and cameras. Text-based data are suitable
    for analysis by distributed file systems, such as Hadoop. SECTION V. Opportunities
    IoT is currently considered one of the most profound transitions in technology.
    Current IoT provides several data analytics opportunities for big data analytics.
    Figure 4 shows the examples of use cases and opportunities discussed in Sections
    4 and 5. FIGURE 4. Example of use cases and opportunities for big IoT data analytics
    architecture. Show All A. E-Commerce Big IoT data analytics offers well-designed
    tools to process real-time big data, which produce timely results for decision
    making. Big IoT data exhibit heterogeneity, increasing volume, and real-time data
    processing features. The convergence of big data with IoT brings new challenges
    and opportunities to build a smart environment. Big IoT data analytics has widespread
    applications in nearly every industry. However, the main success areas of analytics
    are in e-commerce, revenue growth, increased customer size, accuracy of sale forecast
    results, product optimization, risk management, and improved customer segmentation.
    B. Smart Cities Big data collected from smart cities offer new opportunities in
    which efficiency gains can be achieved through an appropriate analytics platform/infrastructure
    to analyze big IoT data. Various devices connect to the Internet in a smart environment
    and share information. Moreover, the cost of storing data has been reduced dramatically
    after the invention of cloud computing technology. Analysis capabilities have
    made huge leaps. Thus, the role of big data in a smart city can potentially transform
    every sector of the economy of a nation. Hadoop with YARN resource manager has
    offered recent advancement in big data technology to support and handle numerous
    workloads, real-time processing, and streaming data ingestion. C. Retail and Logistics
    IoT is expected to play a key role as an emerging technology in the area of retail
    and logistics. In logistics, RFID keeps track of containers, pallets, and crates.
    In addition, considerable advancements in IoT technologies can facilitate retailers
    by providing several benefits. However, IoT devices generate large amounts of
    data on a daily basis. Thus, powerful data analytics enables enterprises to gain
    insights from the voluminous amounts of data produced through IoT technologies.
    Applying data analytics to logistic data sets can improve the shipment experience
    of customers. Moreover, retail companies can earn additional profit by analyzing
    customer data, which can predict the trends and demands of goods. By looking into
    customer data, optimizing pricing plans and seasonal promotions can be planned
    efficiently to maximize profit. D. Healthcare Recent years have witnessed tremendous
    growth in smart health monitoring devices. These devices generate enormous amounts
    of data. Thus, applying data analytics to data collected from fetal monitors,
    electrocardiograms, temperature monitors, or blood glucose level monitors can
    help healthcare specialists efficiently assess the physical conditions of patients.
    Moreover, data analytics enables healthcare professionals to diagnose serious
    diseases in their early stages to help save lives. Furthermore, data analytics
    improves the clinical quality of care and ensures the safety of patients. In addition,
    physician profile can be reviewed by looking into the history of treatment of
    patients, which can improve customer satisfaction, acquisition, and retention.
    SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Future Directions IoT and big data analytics have
    been extensively accepted by many organizations. However, these technologies are
    still in their early stages. Several existing research challenges have not yet
    been addressed. This section presents several challenges in the field of big IoT
    data analytics. A. Privacy Privacy issues arise when a system is compromised to
    infer or restore personal information using big data analytics tools, although
    data are generated from anonymous users. With the proliferation of big data analytics
    technologies used in big IoT data, the privacy issue has become a core problem
    in the data mining domain. Consequently, most people are reluctant to rely on
    these systems, which do not provide solid service-level agreement (SLA) conditions
    regarding user personal information theft or misuse. In fact, the sensitive information
    of users has to be secured and protected from external interference. Although
    temporary identification, anonymity, and encryptions provide several ways to enforce
    data privacy, decisions have to be made with regard to ethical factors, such as
    what to use, how to use, and why use generated big IoT data [7]. Another security
    risk associated with IoT data is the heterogeneity of the types of devices used
    and the nature of generated data, such as raw devices, data types, and communication
    protocols. These devices can have different sizes and shapes outside the network
    and are designed to communicate with cooperative applications. Thus, to authenticate
    these devices, an IoT system should assign a non-repudiable identification system
    to each device. Moreover, enterprises should maintain a meta-repository of these
    connected devices for auditing purposes. This heterogeneous IoT architecture is
    new to security professionals, and thus, results in increased security risks.
    Consequently, any attack in this scenario compromises system security and disconnects
    interconnected devices. In the context of big IoT data, security and privacy are
    the key challenges in processing and storing huge amounts of data. Moreover, to
    perform critical operations and host private data, these systems highly rely on
    third party services and infrastructure. Therefore, an exponential growth in data
    rate causes difficulty in securing each and every portion of critical data. As
    previously discussed, existing security solutions (Karim, 2016 #86) are no long
    applicable to providing complete security in big IoT data scenarios. Existing
    algorithms are not designed for the dynamic observation of data, and thus, are
    not effectively applied. Legacy data security solutions are specifically designed
    for static data sets, whereas current data requirements are changing dynamically
    (Lafuente, 2015). Thus, deploying these security solutions is difficult for dynamically
    increasing data. In addition, legislative and regulatory issues should be considered
    while signing SLAs. With regard to data generated through IoT, the following security
    problems can emerge [78]: (a) timely updates - difficulty in keeping systems up
    to date, (b) incident management - identifying suspicious traffic patterns among
    legitimate ones and possible failure to capture unidentifiable incidents, (c)
    interoperability - proprietary and vendor-specific procedures will pose difficulties
    in finding hidden or zero day attacks, (d) and protocol convergence - although
    IPv6 is currently compatible with the latest specifications, this protocol has
    yet to be fully deployed. Therefore, the application of security rules over IPv4
    may not be applicable to protecting IPv6. At present, no answer can address these
    challenges and manage the security and privacy of interconnected devices. However,
    the following guidelines can overcome these adversities. (a) First, a true open
    ecosystem with standard APIs is necessary to avoid interoperability and reliability
    problems. (b) Second, devices must be well protected while communicating with
    peers. (c) Third, devices should be hardcoded with the best security practices
    to protect against common security and privacy threats. B. Data Mining Data mining
    methods provide efficient and best-fitting predictive or descriptive solutions
    for big data that can also be generalized for new data [45]. The evolution of
    big IoT data and cloud computing platforms has brought the challenges of data
    exploration and information extraction [79]. However, for the overall big IoT
    data architecture, Figure 5 presents the primary challenges related to processing
    and data mining. FIGURE 5. Big data mining issues in IoT. Show All Exhaustive
    data reads/writes: The high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety qualities
    of big IoT data challenge exploration, integration, heterogeneous communication,
    and extraction processes. The size and heterogeneity of data impose new data mining
    requirements, and diversity in data sources also poses a challenge [80]–[82].
    Furthermore, compared with small data sets, large data sets comprise more abnormalities
    and ambiguities that require additional preprocessing steps, such as cleansing,
    reduction, and transmission [23], [83]. Another issue lies in the extraction of
    exact and knowledgeable information from the large volumes of diverse data. Consequently,
    obtaining accurate information from complex data requires analyzing data properties
    and finding association among different data points. Researchers have introduced
    parallel and sequential programming models and proposed different algorithms to
    minimize query response time while dealing with big data. Moreover, researchers
    have selected existing data mining algorithms in different manners to (a) improve
    single source knowledge discovery, (b) implement data mining methods for multi-source
    platforms, and (c) study and analyze dynamic data mining methods and stream data
    [84]. Hence, parallel k -means algorithm [85] and parallel association rule mining
    methods [65] are introduced. However, the need to devise algorithms remains to
    provide compatibility with the latest parallel architectures. Moreover, synchronization
    issues may occur in parallel computing, while information is exchanged within
    different data mining methods. This bottleneck of data mining methods has become
    an open issue in big IoT data analytics that should be addressed. C. Visualization
    Visualization is an important entity in big data analytics, particularly when
    dealing with IoT systems where data are generated enormously. Furthermore, conducting
    data visualization is difficult because of the large size and high dimension of
    big data. This situation shows underlying trends and a complete picture of parsed
    data. Therefore, big data analytics and visualization should work seamlessly to
    obtain the best results from IoT applications in big data. However, visualization
    in the case of heterogeneous and diverse data (unstructured, structured, and semi-structured)
    is a challenging task. Designing visualization solution that is compatible with
    advanced big data indexing frameworks is a difficult task. Similarly, response
    time is a desirable factor in big IoT data analytics. Consequently, cloud computing
    architectures supported with rich GUI facilities can be deployed to obtain better
    insights into big IoT data trends [86]. Different dimensionality reduction methods
    have been introduced as a result of complex and high-dimensional big IoT data
    [87], [88]. However, these methods are unsuitable for all types of presented data.
    Similarly, when fine-grained dimensions are visualized effectively, the probability
    to identify observable correlations, patterns, and outliners is high [89]. Moreover,
    data should be kept locally to obtain usable information efficiently because of
    power and bandwidth constraints. In addition, visualization software should run
    with the concept of reference locality to achieve efficient outcome in an IoT
    environment. Given that the amount of big IoT data is increasing rapidly, the
    requirement of enormous parallelization is a challenging task in visualization.
    Thus, to decompose a problem into manageable independent tasks to enforce concurrent
    execution of queries is a challenge for parallel visualization algorithms [90].
    At present, most big data visualization tools used for IoT exhibit poor performance
    results in terms of functionality, scalability, and response time. To provide
    effective uncertainty-aware visualization during the visual analytics process,
    avoiding uncertainty imposes a considerable challenge [32]. Furthermore, several
    important issues are addressed [91], such as (a) visual noise - most data set
    objects are closely related to one another, and thus, users may perceive different
    results of the same type; (b) information loss - applying reduction methods to
    visible data sets can cause information loss; (c) large image observation - data
    visualization tools have inherent problems with respect to aspect ratio, devise
    resolution, and physical perception limits; (d) frequently changing image - users
    will not notice rapid data changes in an output; and (e) high performance requirements
    - high performance requirements are imposed because data are generated dynamically
    in an IoT environment. Moreover, methods supported by advanced analytics enable
    interactive graphics on laptops, desktops, or mobile devices, such as smartphones
    and tablets [92]. Real-time analytics is another consideration highlighted in
    IoT architectures. Several guidelines on visualization in big data are presented
    [93], such as (a) data awareness, i.e., appropriate domain expertise, (b) data
    quality - cleaning data using information management or data governance policies,
    (c) meaningful results - data clustering is used to provide high-level abstraction
    such that the visibility of smaller groups of data is possible, and (d) outliers
    should be removed from the data or treated as a separate entity. Reference [94]
    suggested that visualization should adhere to the following guidelines: (a) the
    system should provide special attention to metadata, (b) visualization software
    should be interactive and should require maximum user involvement, and (c) tools
    should be built based on the dynamic nature of the generated data. D. Integration
    Integration refers to having a uniform view of different formats. Data integration
    provides a single view of the data arriving from different sources and combines
    the view of data [95]. Data integration includes all processes involved in collecting
    data from different sources, as well as in storing and providing data with a unified
    view. For each moment, different forms of data are continuously generated by social
    media, IoT, and other communication and telecommunication approaches. The produced
    data can be categorized into three groups: (a) structured data, such as data stored
    in traditional database systems, including tables with rows and columns; (b) semi-structured,
    such as HTML, XML, and Json files; and (c) unstructured data, such as videos,
    audios, and images. Good data offer good information; however, this relationship
    is only achieved through data integration [96]. Integrating diverse data types
    is a complex task in merging different systems or applications [97]. Overlapping
    the same data, increasing performance and scalability, and enabling real-time
    data access are among the challenges associated with data integration that should
    be addressed in the future. Another challenge is to adjust structures in semi-structured
    and unstructured data before integrating and analyzing these types of data [98].
    Information, such as entities and relationships, can be extracted from textual
    data by using available technologies in the eras of text mining, machine learning,
    natural processing, and information extraction. However, new technologies should
    be developed to extract images, videos, and other information from other non-text
    formats of unstructured data [98]. Text mining is expected to be conducted by
    applying several specialized extractors on the same text. Hence, managing and
    integrating different extraction results from a certain data source require other
    techniques [99]. SECTION VII. Conclusion The growth rate of data production has
    increased drastically over the past years with the proliferation of smart and
    sensor devices. The interaction between IoT and big data is currently at a stage
    where processing, transforming, and analyzing large amounts of data at a high
    frequency are necessary. We conducted this survey in the context of big IoT data
    analytics. First, we explored recent analytics solutions. The relationship between
    big data analytics and IoT was also discussed. Moreover, we proposed an architecture
    for big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big data analytics types, methods, and
    technologies for big data mining were presented. Some credible use cases were
    also provided. In addition, we explored the domain by discussing various opportunities
    brought about by data analytics in the IoT paradigm. Several open research challenges
    were discussed as future research directions. Finally, we concluded that existing
    big IoT data analytics solutions remained in their early stages of development.
    In the future, real-time analytics solution that can provide quick insights will
    be required. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    31 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Nanobiotechnology has the potential to enable smart
    plant sensors that communicate with and actuate electronic devices for improving
    plant productivity, optimize and automate water and agrochemical allocation, and
    enable high-throughput plant chemical phenotyping. Reducing crop loss due to environmental
    and pathogen-related stresses, improving resource use efficiency and selecting
    optimal plant traits are major challenges in plant agriculture industries worldwide.
    New technologies are required to accurately monitor, in real time and with high
    spatial and temporal resolution, plant physiological and developmental responses
    to their microenvironment. Nanomaterials are allowing the translation of plant
    chemical signals into digital information that can be monitored by standoff electronic
    devices. Herein, we discuss the design and interfacing of smart nanobiotechnology-based
    sensors that report plant signalling molecules associated with health status to
    agricultural and phenotyping devices via optical, wireless or electrical signals.
    We describe how nanomaterial-mediated delivery of genetically encoded sensors
    can act as tools for research and development of smart plant sensors. We assess
    performance parameters of smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors in plants (for
    example, resolution, sensitivity, accuracy and durability) including in vivo optical
    nanosensors and wearable nanoelectronic sensors. To conclude, we present an integrated
    and prospective vision on how nanotechnology could enable smart plant sensors
    that communicate with and actuate electronic devices for monitoring and optimizing
    individual plant productivity and resource use. Similar content being viewed by

    Article Open access 28 February 2024 Main To meet the demand in 2050 for food
    and energy from a growing human population, crop productivity is projected to
    require a 60–100% increase from 2005–2007 levels1,2. However, environmental and
    biological stresses impair growth and yield, leading to major crop losses worldwide3,4.
    Plant environmental stresses including drought5, heat6, flooding7, salinity4,6
    and frost6,8 are key drivers of economic losses in agriculture. Microbial pathogens
    and virus-related diseases also lead to devastating crop losses9,10,11. The challenge
    of improving agricultural productivity is magnified by the expected increase in
    the frequency and intensity of plant stress-related events in a changing climate12,13.
    Thus, precise management of limited resources and costly agrochemicals (for example,
    water, nutrients and pesticides) offers the opportunity to increase crop yields
    while minimizing resource losses through the use of remote sensing techniques
    for crop monitoring14,15. Improved tools for high-throughput phenotyping of desired
    crop traits will be needed to accelerate efforts towards developing plant stress
    tolerant varieties16. Increasing total agricultural productivity will require
    innovative and convergent technological approaches for managing plant stressors
    and resource use efficiency. Recent advances in nanotechnology offer untapped
    potential to reduce the impact of major stresses on food and energy crop productivity,
    while optimizing the use of limited resources such as water or nutrients. In this
    Review, we discuss how nanobiotechnology-based sensors in plants can enable communication
    and actuation of electronic agricultural and phenotyping devices for optimizing
    crop growth and yield in response to stresses or resource deficits. We envision
    smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors that report plant health status through
    optical and wireless signals and fine-tune agricultural device responses (Fig.
    1). Nanosensors are poised to enable the translation of plant chemical signals
    into digital information for real-time monitoring of plant health by electronic
    devices. These nanobiotechnology approaches for precisely detecting the onset
    of stress or resource deficits within individual plants will contribute to improving
    phenotyping technologies for plant breeding by facilitating high-throughput screening
    of chemical phenotypes of stress-tolerant varieties. Smart plant sensors engineered
    through nanobiotechnology will be able to report crop health status to existing
    agricultural equipment to promote a transition to automated methods for precise
    and efficient use of resources. Fig. 1: Nanobiotechnology approaches enable research
    and development of smart plant sensors that communicate plant chemical signals
    to agricultural and phenotyping equipment. Major abiotic and biotic stresses and
    resource deficiencies are associated with signalling molecules that communicate
    and regulate plant responses including ROS (for example, H2O2), Ca2+, NO and ABA
    among others. Nanomaterial-mediated delivery of genetically encoded sensors enables
    research on signalling mechanisms of plant health that inform the design and engineering
    of smart plant sensors. Optical nanosensors and wearable nanotechnology-based
    sensors interfaced with plants allow the translation of plant chemical signals
    into optical and radio waves, and electric signals, which can be monitored by
    electronic devices. Machines with the capacity to decode spatiotemporal patterns
    of plant chemical signals will allow smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors to
    actuate agricultural devices for optimizing the plant environment. These nanobiotechnology
    approaches have applications ranging from research and development of technologies
    in the laboratory, chemical phenotyping in specialized facilities to monitoring
    and automation in crops for urban farming and precision agriculture. Full size
    image Nanotechnology, the manipulation and use of matter with dimensions smaller
    than 100 nm, has distinct advantages to engineer smart plant sensors. For example,
    engineered nanomaterials embedded in plants can be designed for monitoring signalling
    molecules by near-infrared (nIR) cameras in real time. Nanomaterials can also
    act as DNA scaffolds that overcome plant cellular barriers and deliver genetically
    encoded biosensors for crop research. Wearable sensors can record volatile compounds
    on plant surfaces and report to wireless devices. In this Review, ‘sensor’ is
    used as a general term for any probe, indicator, reporter, molecular sensor or
    sensing device if not termed differently in the cited reference. Optical nanosensors
    are nanomaterials that allow high spatial and temporal resolution for monitoring
    plant signalling molecules via fluorescence signals in spectral regions, such
    as the nIR, where living tissues are relatively transparent17,18,19,20. These
    nanosensors can be tailored to provide high stability, specificity for analytes
    of interest, rapid dynamics, accuracy and reproducibility in the desired analytical
    range for plants21. Recently, nanotechnology has enabled the delivery of DNA plasmids
    into plant cells using high aspect ratio nanomaterials as scaffolds that penetrate
    plant cell barriers in vivo without external mechanical or chemical aid22,23,
    thus opening the door to deliver genetically encoded sensors for designing and
    engineering smart plant sensors. Genetically encoded sensors generally consist
    of a sensory module coupled to fluorescent proteins that can be detected with
    high spatial and temporal resolution by fluorescence imaging devices24,25. They
    are highly selective for the specific analyte and exhibit a high signal-to-noise
    ratio with low perturbation of biological systems in which they are integrated.
    Wearable sensors integrate flexible substrate materials and nanoelectronics that
    are advancing the fields of sensors for human health monitoring and robotic manipulation26
    but with applications that remain relatively unexplored in plants. Engineered
    nanomaterials are not genome specific, making them more easily deployed across
    diverse plant species than species-specific molecular methods19,20,27,28,29,30.
    Nanobiotechnology approaches do not necessarily require genetically modifying
    whole plants to introduce new traits, which is a procedure that faces considerable
    governmental regulations and public debate31,32. Although nanomaterials are increasingly
    becoming subject of these regulations, studies in the past decade have reported
    that a wide range of nanomaterials are not inherently toxic and that detrimental
    effects on living organisms are dependent on specific nanomaterial composition,
    structure, surface chemistry and concentration33,34,35,36,37,38. Furthermore,
    we expect that exposure to nanomaterials will only be required for selected plants
    within an agricultural field. On these selected plants, a variety of plant structures
    for non-human consumption could be chosen for nanomaterial exposure. In some instances,
    smart nanobiotechnology-based sensor development and application would involve
    plant exposure to nanomaterials only in the laboratory or controlled phenotyping
    setups. Smart plant-sensing devices have the potential to provide unprecedented
    capabilities of allowing real-time monitoring of individual plant physiological
    status in response to stresses in safe and controlled conditions. This Review
    focuses on knowledge gaps, challenges and opportunities to engineer nanobiotechnology-based
    sensors that report plant health status and control actuation of electronic devices
    for improving crop productivity and phenotyping. This field is of interest to
    researchers working on nanoscale science and engineering tools for agriculture,
    engineers aiming to address knowledge gaps in plant nanobiotechnology and biologists
    looking for novel tools to monitor plant biomolecules. Previous reviews discuss
    topics not covered in depth by this article including broad agronomic applications
    of nanotechnology in plants39; design, principles and applications of nanosensors
    for plant biomolecules21 and genetically encoded biosensors in plants24,25. Wang
    et al.39 review targeted and controlled release of agrochemicals, labelling and
    imaging of nanoparticles in vivo and risks associated with exposure of nanomaterials
    to the food chain. Kwak et al.21 explore in more depth the mechanisms of how nanobiotechnology-based
    sensors for plants work and compare the pros and cons of different nanosensor
    technologies. Herein, we discuss nanobiotechnology-based approaches for monitoring
    plant signalling molecules associated with early detection of stress or resource
    deficiencies using nanomaterial-delivered genetic-encoded nanosensors, optical
    nanosensors and wearable sensors. We also provide a perspective on how smart plant
    sensors can actuate agricultural devices by communicating with smartphones, hyperspectral
    imaging cameras, wireless radio frequency devices, meteorological stations and
    phenotyping equipment. Monitoring plant health in real time Crop stress and resource
    deficiencies are currently monitored by assessing plant physical traits through
    imaging, spectroscopy and fluorescence from the visible to the infrared16,40,41.
    Although, these remote-sensing techniques provide important information about
    plant health status including leaf area, chlorophyll content and fluorescence42,43,44,
    stomatal conductance45, transpiration use efficiency46, water potential47 and
    leaf temperature48, they are either not suitable for early detection of some types
    of stresses or resource deficits, lack the potential to identify specific plant
    stresses or are not optimal nor cost efficient for monitoring individual plants16,44,49,50,51.
    Chlorophyll content decline and leaf area loss are stress-induced accumulative
    traits that are the result of impaired plant growth. Chlorophyll fluorescence
    is not always suitable for early stress detection and is not a specific indicator
    of stress types16. Plant water status parameters are related to multiple stresses
    including drought47, salinity46 and pathogens52. Raman and infrared spectroscopy
    have typically low signal-to-noise ratios and require complex equipment. They
    provide rich chemical information about cell composition but are more difficult
    to interpret due to impurities and heterogeneities on or inside the plant that
    affect the spectral signature. However, Raman spectroscopy in leaves has recently
    been performed using a custom-built, portable system capable of being operated
    in the field53, opening the door to applications in plant phenotyping facilities.
    Airborne detection tools are not optimal for monitoring individual plants54 or
    crop plants grown in high-density. They are also influenced by overexposure due
    to sunlight or shadows, low signal-to-noise levels and interfering weather conditions16.
    Novel sensing tools that facilitate continuous monitoring of individual plants
    with high reliability and improved signal-to-noise ratios will complement existing
    remote sensing tools (Fig. 1). Electronic devices, including smartphones, hyperspectral
    imaging cameras and autonomous or manned vehicles, can establish direct communication
    with nanobiotechnology-based sensors in plants. Nanobiotechnology-based approaches
    provide a pathway to transduce the invisible plant stress-related chemical signals
    into optical, wireless or electrical signals that can be recorded by current phenotyping
    equipment such as greenhouse, growth room or field scanalysers. Plant stress or
    resource deficit detection, based on chemical traits such as plant signalling
    molecules, has the potential to report the onset of plant health changes in real
    time and help to diagnose specific environmental or biological stressors. Key
    signalling molecules in plants that have been reported to be monitored by engineered
    nanomaterials and genetically encoded nanoscale sensors include reactive oxygen
    species (ROS), calcium (Ca2+), glucose, sucrose, nitric oxide (NO) and plant hormones
    such as abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid, methyl salicylate and ethylene (Table
    1). Both ROS and Ca2+ are at the forefront of plant stress signalling55. Ca2+
    is involved in most stress signalling pathways and is evolutionarily conserved
    among different plant species56. ROS have a dual role in plants, acting as a toxic
    molecule at high levels and playing a signalling role in a broad range of plant
    stress responses at low levels57,58. Ca2+ and ROS signature signals have been
    associated with specific plant stress responses59,60. Sugars such as glucose and
    sucrose are also important plant molecules that regulate a broad range of physiological
    and developmental changes61,62,63. ABA, NO, methyl salicylate and ethylene have
    been reported to be more specific indicators of plant stress types. ABA is an
    early signal of water stress64,65. NO, methyl salicylate and ethylene are mainly
    involved in plant pathogen defence response66,67,68. The plant hormone jasmonate
    coordinates both biotic and abiotic stress responses including salinity and freezing
    tolerance, drought and wounding response69. Other important signalling molecules
    that can be future targets for sensor development are salicylic acid and isoprenes.
    Salicylic acid is a signalling molecule involved in plant pathogen defence70.
    Plant volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as isoprenes, are associated with
    high light, temperature and water stress71. Developing and applying nanotechnology-based
    sensing tools for real-time monitoring of these key chemical signalling molecules
    in plants will improve our understanding of plant stress communication and enable
    plant health monitoring in the field. Table 1 Plant molecular targets related
    to health status that have been reported to be monitored by nanotechnology-based
    sensors Full size table Nanomaterial delivery of genetically encoded sensors Genetically
    encoded sensors are capable of reporting in vivo concentrations of molecules,
    presence and activity of proteins, and ion dynamics. Most current biosensors enable
    subcellular monitoring and analysis of plant signalling molecules, which can provide
    critical knowledge for designing and engineering smart plant sensors. Recently,
    real-time imaging of calcium levels in whole plants under herbivore attack was
    demonstrated using genetically encoded sensors in laboratory conditions72 (Fig.
    2), providing a technology platform that could be adapted for fluorescence imaging
    in phenotyping facilities41 or with modified portable field equipment73. Stable
    or transient expression of genetically encoded sensors in plants requires the
    generation of transgenic material in amenable plant species. The design of a genetically
    encoded reporter is, to a certain extent, rational and has been demonstrated in
    applications to plant leaves and roots for the detection of signalling molecules63,74,75,76,77,78,79.
    Genetically encoded sensing approaches in plants rely on varying mechanisms from
    protein–protein interactions to covalent bond modifications that influence their
    fluorescence intensity or wavelength in the visible range of the electromagnetic
    radiation spectrum (Fig. 2a,b). Currently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer
    (FRET)-based sensors report sugars in leaves and roots (Fig. 2c), including glucose
    and sucrose, with a high temporal resolution (10 s) and within physiological concentration
    ranges in transgenic plant model systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana74,75,76
    and rice crop plants in response to both abiotic and biotic stresses63 (Table
    1). Genetically encoded sensors have allowed imaging of calcium dynamics at very
    high temporal resolution (1.5 s)72,77,78,80 and the detection of glucose at micromolar
    levels in roots75. Recently, biosensors have been reported to detect H2O2 in vivo
    with subcellular resolution in chloroplasts and nuclei79 (Fig. 2d,e) and within
    physiological pH range during elicitor induced oxidative bursts with 15 s temporal
    resolution81. Overall, genetically encoded sensors offer sensitivities within
    the plant physiological range and temporal resolutions that allow the detection
    of various plant signalling molecules. Concentration changes of signalling molecules
    or metabolites in plant cells are dynamic but genetically encoded sensors have
    a temporal resolution on the order of seconds (Table 1) and could therefore report
    chemical signals on this time scale in real time. However, they require genetically
    amenable plant species to transformation methods such as gene gun particle bombardment
    and Agrobacterium tumefaciens plasmid delivery. Applications in crops have been
    limited by available DNA transformation methods and slow rate of optimization
    per species. Nanomaterial-enabled methods are being developed as an alternative
    approach to enable genetic material delivery into mature wild-type plants without
    the need to develop species-specific genetic techniques22,23. Fig. 2: Genetically
    encoded nanoscale sensors for plant signalling molecules have the potential to
    be delivered to plant genomes by engineered nanomaterials. a, Schematic illustrating
    the mechanisms of two major types of plant genetically encoded sensors. Emission

    of the analyte. HyPer2 (ratiometric) sensors change their fluorescence when disulfide
    bonds form in response to H2O2. b, Genetically encoded sensors modulate their
    emission spectra in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum in the presence
    of analytes. c, Plants have been engineered with FRET and HyPer sensors for sensing
    signalling molecules such as Ca2+, glucose and H2O2 in leaves and roots. d,e,
    HyPer2 sensors in leaves signal the transfer of H2O2 from chloroplasts to the
    nucleus under high light and allow monitoring of H2O2 temporal patterns in chloroplasts
    (sHyper) and nucleus (nHyper). f, Herbivore attack induces rapid Ca2+ wave across
    whole Arabidopsis plants reported by GCaMP3, a Ca2+ GFP sensor. g, Nanomaterials
    coated in DNA including mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DNA-MSN)125, magnetic
    nanoparticles126 and carbon nanotubes (DNA-CNT)22,23 can be utilized as delivery
    systems of gene cassettes and plasmids to nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrion
    genomes. Reproduced from ref. 79, SNL (d,e); ref. 72, AAAS (f). Full size image
    Delivering DNA cassettes or plasmids containing genetically encoded nanoscale
    sensors for expression within wild-type plant species might allow application
    to a broad range of crop plants that are not currently amenable to genetic modification.
    Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) coated with DNA have the ability to penetrate
    plant lipid bilayers through passive and spontaneous translocation processes19,82.
    Thus, SWCNTs have great potential to act as a delivery chassis for exogenous DNA
    into plant cells. By binding the plant expression cassette to SWCNTs and application
    to the leaf lamina through a needleless syringe, transfection of DNA into plants
    is possible without Agrobacterium or gene gun particle bombardment22,23. Using
    a plasmid or amplified dsDNA, each containing a nuclear expression gene cassette,
    bound to the SWCNT, plants expressed transiently a fluorescent reporter protein
    without the integration of DNA into the genome23. How nanomaterial and plasmid
    properties determine transient versus stable gene expression in plants remains
    to be explored. These studies will inform the design of modular DNA–SWCNT transformation
    tools for generating fertile transgenic plants. Nuclear-based integration-dependent
    genetic sensors allow for new research into specific wild-type plant species.
    However, a uniform delivery chassis to plastids such as chloroplasts may enable
    a cross-species protein expression platform for mature plants due to their prokaryotic
    ancestry and evolutionary history in plants83. Nanotechnology is providing tools
    for engineering the relatively conserved plastid genomes of chloroplasts and mitochondria.
    Recently, SWCNTs delivered plasmid DNA to chloroplasts of different plant species
    without external biolistic aid and enabled yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) transient
    gene expression assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging22. Although,
    most biosensors are likely to be located in the cell cytosol, the plastid genome
    represents an opportunity to create translatable sensors for broader plant taxa
    than the nuclear genome (Fig. 2g). To date, genetically encoded sensors for chloroplasts
    are restrained to the few species that are able to be genetically modified24,25.
    Current chloroplast transformation techniques are limited to a small number of
    plant species (<12). The absence of a targeted DNA delivery mechanisms to chloroplasts,
    screening capabilities needed to prevent chimeric genome copies and labour-intensive
    calli culturing techniques hinders efforts to expand the range of transformed
    plant species84. ROS and salicylic acid are key signalling molecules produced
    by chloroplasts that accumulate in plants exposed to abiotic and biotic stress85
    and could act as indicators of plant health. In the future, genetically encoded
    nanosensors could be sent to plastids for detection of these chemical signals
    reporting plant health status without the need to develop species-specific methods.
    Engineered nanomaterials as in vivo optical sensors The unique optical and electronic
    properties of nanomaterials offer key advantages for imaging plant signalling
    molecules in vivo. Nanomaterials have ultra-low photobleaching, fluorescence in
    low- or transparent-background windows of living tissue and allow the detection
    of analytes with high spatiotemporal resolution down to single-molecule level
    and millisecond timescales36,86. SWCNTs have been used as building blocks for
    fluorescent nanosensors in mammalian systems87 and more recently in plants19,20,27
    (Fig. 3). SWCNT fluorescence can be modulated in the nIR transparency window for
    plants through the interaction of the SWCNT’s organic phase coating (corona) with
    surrounding analytes (Fig. 3a). SWCNT-based sensors are highly versatile and have
    been engineered for sensing various molecule classes including ROS, NO, calcium,
    glucose, dopamine, nitroaromatics, proteins and other small molecules19,27,88,89,90,91.
    Multiple delivery methods for these optical nanosensors can be utilized in the
    laboratory, phenotyping facilities or the field including needleless syringe infusion
    through the leaf lamina, topical delivery and vacuum infiltration. Embedding SWCNT
    sensors in leaves allows real-time monitoring of short-lived signalling molecules
    such as NO and ROS in plants19,20. Leaf H2O2 levels can be reported by SWCNT fluorescence
    intensity changes within selected regions of leaves (micrometres) with high temporal
    resolution (seconds) (Fig. 3b,c). Quantum dots (QDs) are also widely used nanoparticles
    for optical sensing applications. Glucose, a key target analyte for assessing
    plant stress and productivity, has been detected with high selectivity by QD optical
    probes down to the level of a few hundred micromolar29. QDs are fluorescent nanomaterials
    with bright and tunable emission range from the visible to the nIR92. These nanoparticles
    also allow facile modification of structural and surface chemical properties92.
    Functionalizing QDs with boronic acids, known to bind to sugars such as glucose,
    has enabled standoff optical detection of glucose and its online monitoring in
    plant tissue with timescales on the order of minutes29. Fig. 3: Nanomaterial-based
    sensors allow in vivo optical monitoring of plant signalling molecules in real
    time. a, Analyte interaction with SWCNT sensors with the nanomaterial carbon lattice,
    organic corona or both leads to changes in nIR fluorescence intensity or wavelength
    shifts. b, Plant leaves have been interfaced with optical nanosensors including
    SWCNT, quantum dots and nanoscale gold virus for optical sensing of plant signalling
    molecules. c, H2O2 monitoring by imaging SWCNT nIR fluorescence intensity changes
    in Arabidopsis leaf sections in vivo with high spatial (>0.5 μm) and temporal
    resolution (>0.5 s). d,e, Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations predict fluorescence
    responses of optical nanosensors to biological signalling events from individual
    cells or subcellular compartments by considering nanosensor kinetics, imaging
    speed and resolution limits. This allows assessment of the nanosensor’s spatial
    and temporal sensitivity to improve sensor design. f, Simulated fluorescence intensity
    response of nanosensors for the release of an analyte from two locations on a
    cell or subcellular compartment. The rate constants of these nanosensors allow
    distinction of two release sites. g, Combined spatiotemporal resolution phase
    diagrams for optimizing biomolecule sensing in specific biological scenarios with
    sensors having different forward and backward rate constants. Adapted from ref.
    20, Wiley (c); ref. 97, American Chemical Society (d–g). Full size image Current
    optical standoff detection readouts from nanosensors embedded in plants suffer
    from low signal-to-noise ratios in comparison to optimized conditions in sophisticated
    microscopes and lack of targeted localization in specific plant tissues, cells
    or organelles. To circumvent these issues, a signal increase through mechanisms,
    including field enhancement by gold nanoparticles, has been proposed93. Plant
    viruses were coated with a thin gold layer to enable field enhancement without
    compromising the targeting capability of the virus. Although this concept has
    not been proven yet for standoff imaging and spectroscopy, it is a possible approach
    to improve the optical signal from a smart nanobiotechnology-based sensor over
    the inherent background in the field. In situ synthesis of artificial sensors
    is another intriguing concept that could circumvent the delivery of nanosensors
    to target tissues or subcellular compartments. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
    are three-dimensional structures with a high surface area built from ions and
    organic ligands. Fluorescent MOFs generated by plants in situ allowed them to
    report acetone levels in air through fluorescence changes in the presence of these
    volatile compounds94. Alternatively, coating nanosensors with targeting moieties
    such as peptides95 could allow specific localization in plant subcellular compartments.
    Important plant signalling molecules, such as Ca2+ and ROS, are characterized
    by fast spatiotemporal concentration changes resulting in waves within single
    cells, organs or whole plants. Although optical nanosensors have been widely developed
    and applied in animal cells both in vivo and in vitro96, imaging signalling molecules
    in neural networks of mammalian systems and in plants share similar challenges,
    including localized transient maxima of concentration at subcellular structures
    such as synapses in neurons or chloroplasts in plants91. A static concentration
    of an analyte, for example, ROS, is not likely to represent the most relevant
    information but the concentration changes in time and space. Consequently, sensor
    kinetics play an important role to determine if stress events can be resolved
    or not by plant signalling molecule detection. Diffusion and stochastic kinetic
    simulations are powerful tools to study biological scenarios and predict the fluorescence
    response of single or multiple sensors to spatiotemporal patterns of signalling
    molecules97 (Fig. 3d,e). It has been shown that such an approach allows predicting
    the expected nanosensor fluorescence response (Fig. 3d,e). Based on such images,
    it is possible to quantify if one could resolve chemical signals, for example,
    to distinguish two release points of a signalling molecule from a cell or organelle
    (Fig. 3f). When simulations are performed for different sensor parameters such
    as rate constants and affinities, measures for spatial and temporal resolution
    can be derived (Fig. 3g). These simulations provide a rationale for the synthesis
    and optimization of sensors to circumvent trial-and-error approaches. Additionally,
    they are promising tools to correlate signalling patterns in plants with stress
    or resource deficiency levels. In the future, sensor responses to plant chemical
    signals could be tested in silico to identify patterns that are distinguishable
    by a given sensor. In silico approaches can pinpoint to candidate sensors and
    optimal properties such as selectivity, sensitivity and dynamic range that could
    in principle inform their design for operation under field conditions. Furthermore,
    simulations and modelling are crucial to translate measured plant chemical signalling
    patterns into the digital information that is necessary for the decisions and
    actions of agricultural devices. Wearable nanotechnology-based sensors The field
    of wearable sensors has been widely developed for human skin and clothing applications26
    and is creating nanotechnology-based platforms that provide minimally invasive
    sensors for plants98 with costs that are significantly being reduced over time
    allowing increase in commercialization26. Sensor networks based on flexible wearable
    nanoelectronic circuits implanted on plant surfaces are enabling wireless communication
    of low concentrations of volatile molecules in real time30. The high sensitivity
    of integrated arrays of SWCNT channels and graphitic electrodes transferred to
    leaf surfaces of live plants can detect trace levels of airborne chemical weapons
    (Fig. 4). The elastic properties of wearable nanotechnology-based sensors act
    as a “flexible skin” that can be bent on organisms with a radius of curvature
    as small as ~100 μm. Wearable SWCNT–graphite sensors can be operated by radio
    frequency (RF) for wireless monitoring with electronic devices without power consumption
    in response to gas molecule concentrations down to 5 ppm (ref. 30). Chemoresistive
    sensors based on SWCNTs and equipped with copper complexes work reversibly, allowing
    long-term monitoring of sub-ppm concentrations of ethylene, a plant hormone that
    acts as a key indicator of the onset of fruit ripening99. Carbon-nanotube-based
    sensing devices for plant VOCs, for example, ethylene, are now commercially available
    for agriculture applications but have not been interfaced directly with crops
    for monitoring plant signalling molecules (Fig. 4a,b). Although, highly stretchable
    wearable sensors based on graphene and carbon nanotubes have been reported to
    wirelessly monitor a wide range of gas and aqueous phase molecules, including
    glucose from mammalian epidermal cells100,101, few publications to date consider
    their applications in plants. Fig. 4: Nanotechnology-based flexible and wearable
    sensors for plant chemical sensing. a, Schematic represents SWCNT-based chemoresistive
    sensors for volatile molecule detection, in this example ethylene, a key plant
    signalling molecule. b, Binding of SWCNT and copper complexes to ethylene molecules
    emitted from plant structures, for example fruits, results in resistance changes
    proportional to the concentration of this volatile compound. c, Plants engineered
    with wireless and wired wearable nanotechnology-based sensors for chemical sensing
    have been interfaced with crop leaves. d,e, Radio frequency wireless monitoring
    a volatile nerve agent simulant DMMP (dimethyl methylphosphonate) with ppm concentration
    resolution. Reproduced from ref. 99, Wiley (a,b); ref. 30, American Chemical Society
    (d,e). Full size image Future nanotechnology-based wearable sensor approaches
    will require high sensitivity and increased signal-to-noise ratios under variable
    ambient conditions. To monitor plant VOCs associated with plant health status,
    the wearable sensors should be able to report ranges in very low concentrations
    in the ppb range (Table 1) or include concentration mechanisms to allow detection.
    The resistance of SWCNT–graphite electronic devices is modulated by molecule adsorption
    and transfer of electrons on the SWCNT surface102. These devices have a tunable
    sensitivity to gas molecules from parts per million 103 to as low as the parts
    per billion range30,104,105. Relative humidity (RH) near the plant surface results
    in increased sensor noise and recovery time30. Thus, wearable sensor performance
    would depend on the type of plant substrate they are interfaced with. Selectivity
    against analyte mixtures under variable ambient conditions, for example, humidity,
    temperature and wind, could be accomplished by multiplexing carbon-nanomaterial-based
    wearable sensors. Carbon-nanotube-based conductive inks and graphene printed on
    the leaf surface allow monitoring RH near the leaf epidermis and plant water status
    continuously through wired multimeters28,98. Changes in plant water transport
    have been reported by graphene-based wearable sensors on leaves that detect reversible
    changes in RH from 20–90% (ref. 98). High-resolution patterning and transferring
    of tape-based graphene RH sensors on the leaf epidermis creates air gaps that
    allow gas exchange between the leaf and environment. The graphene sensor resistance
    dynamics, in response to RH, is measured and reported by a resistance, inductance
    and capacitance (RLC) meter98. Alternatively, microfluidic printed SWCNT ink on
    the leaf epidermis can assess plant water status and the onset of drought stress
    through real-time measurements of single stomatal aperture dynamics28. This wearable
    sensor is made from two printed contact pads and a stripe across a single stoma
    that are responsive to slight variations in stomatal opening and closing latency
    during drought. Other stress conditions that induce changes in stomatal conductance
    including flooding and salinity could be detected through wearable sensing nanotechnologies.
    Wired wearable sensors based on carbon nanomaterials can be designed to be operated
    by RF wireless signals. Thus, allowing integration of sensors for volatile compound
    signalling molecules in plants with potential interfering environmental signals
    such as RH. Wearable sensors report basic but key parameters of crop health and
    have already reached a technical standard close to applications. Wearable flexible
    electronics based on three-dimensional sub-micrometre-thick, centimetre-scale
    macroporous networks106,107 have not been interfaced with plants yet, representing
    an untapped sensing nanotechnology that could continuously monitor multiple plant
    electrochemical signals simultaneously with high temporal resolution. For example,
    syringe-injectable mesh nanoelectronic devices106 could be embedded into plants
    using 100 μm diameter needles with minimal mechanical perturbation. Mesh nanoelectronics
    millisecond temporal resolution could record rapid waves of plant signalling molecules,
    for example, Ca2+ and ROS in the extracellular space, in response to stress, as
    it has been demonstrated for monitoring neural activity in mice brain in vivo106.
    Sensor communication and actuation with machines Nanobiotechnology is on the verge
    of generating the tools for establishing real-time two-way communication channels
    between nanobiotechnology-based sensors merged with plants and electronic devices.
    SWCNT sensors embedded in leaves have converted plants into self-powered chemical
    detectors that report the presence of groundwater analytes via nIR optical signals27
    (Fig. 5). Plants equipped with SWCNTs functionalized with bombolitin peptides
    report the presence of explosive nitroaromatics, such as picric acid, to research
    grade cameras and even smartphones27 (Fig. 5a). By connecting a camera to a miniaturized
    computer, for example, a Raspberry Pi, nanosensors embedded within plants communicate
    the presence of the analyte through optical signals that could trigger e-mails
    and text messages or communicate directly to a smartphone using Bluetooth27. Furthermore,
    monitoring of genetically encoded sensors delivered by nanomaterials to leaves
    with customized imaging devices for plant chlorophyll fluorescence108 may allow
    reporting of stress-induced signals (for example, Ca2+) in plants72 (Fig. 2f).
    Fluorescence imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based Ca2+ sensors (GCaMP3)
    in whole plants was performed at 2 s temporal resolution using a 1× objective
    and a digital camera indicating that standoff imaging of these types of sensors
    would be possible. Nanobiotechnology-based sensors are, therefore, a promising
    tool to create smart crops that communicate their health status to agricultural
    devices. However, validation of smart nanobiotechnology devices on plants has
    not been done outside of the laboratory. Fig. 5: Smart plant sensor communication
    and actuation of electronic devices through optical and radio waves, and electrical
    signals. a, Plant leaves embedded with SWCNTs act as detectors of nitroaromatics,
    for example, picric acid. Polyvinyl-alcohol functionalized SWCNTs (black arrow)
    act as internal controls whereas bombolitin II peptide-coated SWCNT (red arrow)
    monitor picric acid in real time with a high spatiotemporal resolution by reporting
    changes in nIR fluorescence intensity to research-grade and smartphone-quality
    cameras. b, Smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors delivered to plant subcellular
    compartments have the potential to communicate health status to agricultural or
    phenotyping devices equipped with hyperspectral imaging cameras, smartphones,
    drones or meteorological stations. Machines able to decode plant subcellular spatiotemporal
    patterns of chemical signals could, in turn, control the actuation of agricultural
    devices to improve microenvironmental conditions including irrigation, shading,
    heating, the release of fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides, or nanoparticle-based
    therapeutics against stress, for example, CeO2, CuO and ZnO. Real-time monitoring
    of plant chemical signalling by phenotyping systems could improve the selection
    of desired plant traits for high yield and tolerance to stress. Reproduced from
    ref. 27, SNL (a). Full size image Smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors that communicate
    through optical signals, wireless or wired channels have the capability to integrate
    with existing agricultural electronic devices, including smartphones, hyperspectral
    imaging cameras, high-throughput phenotyping instrumentation, radio frequency
    devices and meteorological stations30,44,109,110,111 (Fig. 5b). Smartphones are
    already used to monitor crops with accurate GPS information and active communication
    through Bluetooth and the Internet of Things112,113. In combination with digital
    software platforms, they monitor and measure the impact of agronomic decisions
    on crop performance. Assisting with crop management are unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV) capable of monitoring vegetation indexes through multispectral bands from
    the visible to the nIR110 and detecting water stress with a 40 cm resolution44.
    On the ground, high-throughput chemical phenotyping of plants with smart nanobiotechnology-based
    sensors could be possible through terrestrial platform-based multi-sensor systems
    with vegetation index sensors, thermal infrared radiometers, spectrometers and
    visible cameras111. Radio frequency responses of wireless sensors interfaced with
    plant surfaces30 (Fig. 4c–e) are ready to be interfaced with commercially available
    RF identification devices. Wireless or wired sensor data can be collected and
    transmitted to field-deployable environmental and phenotyping stations. With internet
    connectivity, these stations are capable of cloud-based storage and data analysis,
    which are methods already facilitating data-driven decisions on farms. Remote
    sensing technologies with the help of computer models can complement smart nanobiotechnology-based
    sensors for plant stress management114. Large dataset technologies that transmit,
    process and actuate devices will synergize the integration of smart plant sensors
    with agricultural devices115. Smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors able to monitor
    crop health will face several challenges to ensure applicability, accuracy and
    durability under crop field conditions. Applications can range from urban farming
    and plant phenotyping facilities, to large industrial agriculture applications
    where they will need to report crop health status across hundreds of hectares.
    The required spatial resolution provided by smart plant sensors in the field,
    from individual plants to groups of plants in the field, has not been determined
    yet and will likely depend on microenvironment variations, type of plant stress
    and agricultural or phenotyping sensing instruments. To accurately assess plant
    health status, multiple chemical signalling and environmental parameters are likely
    needed to be detected and analysed. Consequently, multiplexing is crucial to further
    improve the sensing approaches for signalling molecules described above or a combination
    of genetically encoded sensors, optical nanosensors and wearable sensing devices.
    A minimum lifetime of a growing season spanning several months is expected for
    smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors to adequately perform in an agricultural
    system. For most nanobiotechnology-based plant sensors, durability has not been
    tested in the laboratory or in the field. However, genetically encoded sensors
    integrated into the plant nuclear or plastid genome are expected to last for a
    plant lifetime and SWCNT sensors have been demonstrated to operate in mammalian
    systems for at least six months116. To ensure sensor accuracy in agricultural
    environments, plants can be embedded with both smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors
    for analytes of interests and non-responsive sensors to these analytes that act
    as internal controls. Ratiometric approaches have been applied to genetically
    encoded sensors and optical nanosensors for the detection of H2O2, calcium, glucose
    and other biochemicals in plants and the environment27,29,76,77,79. To minimize
    negative impacts due to downtime, the redundancy of smart plant sensors in each
    node will be necessary. Replaceability and reparability of smart nanobiotechnology-based
    sensors will require practical, efficient and scalable interfacing methods of
    plants with nanomaterials. However, the mechanisms of transport and delivery of
    nanomaterials to plants are not well understood. Smart nanobiotechnology-based
    sensor output will not only allow plant health status communication with electronic
    devices but also actuation of agricultural equipment. Machine sensory, learning
    and actuation systems provide a communication platform between smart plant sensors
    and agricultural devices for optimizing environmental conditions through irrigation,
    fertilization and application of pesticides, among other crop management tools.
    Delivery of nanobiotechnology-based therapeutics such as ZnO (ref. 117), CuO (ref.
    118), CeO2 (refs. 119,120) and nanocrystals121 can also contribute to alleviate
    heat and salinity stress, pathogen infections and frost damage, respectively.
    Autonomous vehicles integrating sensory, decision-making and actuation of agricultural
    equipment have been tested in crop fields for plant invasive species detection122.
    The machine-vision systems for these agricultural vehicles allow the recording
    of optical signals within the emission range of the nanotechnology-based sensors
    described above from the visible emission, for example, genetically encoded nanosensors
    and QDs, to the nIR range, for example, SWCNT123. Optimum sensing and actuation
    performance of autonomous vehicles will depend on the high variability of illumination
    in the environment, irregular terrain conditions or plant growth status. Unlike
    optical sensing approaches for machine sensing, automated wireless control systems
    do not suffer from the interference of these environmentally related factors and
    have been applied to regulate water and nutrient supply in hydroponics124. Research
    on automatic actuation of agricultural equipment for fine-tuning crop health status
    remains relatively unexplored. Conclusions and perspectives Meeting the projected
    increase in global demand for food in this century will require interdisciplinary
    and convergent approaches from plant sciences and engineering to bolster sustainable
    agricultural production. Nanotechnology offers high spatial and temporal resolution
    sensors for both aqueous and volatile plant signalling molecules and delivery
    platforms for genetically encoded sensors to study and engineer smart plant sensors
    that communicate and actuate with machines. By translating chemical signals associated
    with stress or resource deficiencies into wireless, electrical and optical signals,
    smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors are poised to improve plant growth and yield
    while fine-tuning resource use by interacting with agricultural devices. They
    could facilitate faster identification of desired crop traits by allowing high-throughput
    screening of chemical phenotypes. Although a number of nanoscale sensors already
    exist for plant signalling molecules associated with abiotic and biotic stresses,
    few are designed for sensing plant nutrient deficiencies. Nanobiotechnology provides
    key advantages to solve the challenges and limitations associated with the engineering
    of smart plant sensors. Genetically encoded sensors are excellent tools for subcellular
    research, that can pinpoint to key plant signalling mechanisms of stress communication
    for designing smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors. These biosensors have an
    adequate spatiotemporal resolution for enabling real-time monitoring of plant
    signalling molecules but are limited to amenable species. Nanomaterials could
    bridge this gap by acting as genetic element delivery platforms to expand the
    range of species that can be transformed. Engineered nanomaterials are a pathway
    to create smart plant sensors without relying on genetically amenable species.
    Optical nanosensors can be designed for monitoring aqueous-based signalling molecules
    with very high spatiotemporal resolutions in the order of single molecules and
    milliseconds. RF nanotechnology-based wearable devices are allowing the detection
    of plant volatile compounds. Unlike optical-based sensing approaches, wireless
    wearable sensors are not subject to background interference from environmental
    or terrain conditions. However, their sensitivity needs to be designed to sense
    very low levels of volatile compounds in the order of parts per billion. To date,
    smart plant sensors that communicate with electronic devices have been demonstrated
    in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Nanoscale plant sensors have yet
    to be tested under real agricultural conditions in which their performance would
    be affected by weather, plant growth and development. If successful in field trials,
    nanotechnology-based sensors could provide individualized and real-time information
    about the onset of stresses, and plant water, nutrient, and pesticide specific
    needs. There is also a need for integrative studies linking smart nanobiotechnology-based
    sensing, plant stress, resource deficit simulations and signal analysis with actuation
    of agricultural devices. The ethical implications of how smart nanobiotechnology
    devices could transform interactions between plants and machines should also be
    explored. Through recently developed nanomaterial-enabled gene delivery methods
    in leaves in planta22,23, genetically encoded sensors reporting plant health by
    inducing changes in plant pigments could be a pathway to allow farmers in undeveloped
    areas without access to electronics to judge plant health status by visual cues.
    Most of these technologies developed for smart plant sensors are not limited to
    agriculture and will likely be translatable to defence and environmental monitoring
    purposes. References van Ittersum, M. K. et al. Can sub-Saharan Africa feed itself?

    To face future challenges in crop production dictated by global climate changes,

    breeders and plant researchers collaborate to develop productive crops that are
    able

    to withstand a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. However, crop selection

    is often focused on shoot performance alone, as observation of root properties
    is

    more complex and asks for artiﬁcial and extensive phenotyping platforms. In addition,

    most root research focuses on development, while a direct link to the functionality
    of

    plasticity in root development for tolerance is often lacking. In this paper we
    review

    the currently known root system architecture (RSA) responses in Arabidopsis and
    a

    number of crop species to a range of abiotic stresses, including nutrient limitation,

    drought, salinity, ﬂooding, and extreme temperatures. For each of these stresses,
    the

    key molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the RSA response are highlighted.

    To explore the relevance for crop selection, we especially review and discuss
    studies

    linking root architectural responses to stress tolerance. This will provide a
    ﬁrst step

    toward understanding the relevance of adaptive root development for a plant’s
    response

    to its environment. We suggest that functional evidence on the role of root plasticity

    will support breeders in their efforts to include root properties in their current
    selection

    pipeline for abiotic stress tolerance, aimed to improve the robustness of crops.

    INTRODUCTION

    From Optimal to Suboptimal Conditions – Closing the Yield Gap

    The world population is growing rapidly and this is accompanied by an increased
    food demand.

    In past decades, this growing food demand has been addressed by plant breeding
    consistent with

    optimal conditions for plant growth. In agricultural practices, the use of fertilizers,
    irrigation,

    pesticides, and other inputs can create these optimal conditions on the short-term.
    However,

    increasing evidence exists for the negative consequences of these practices on
    the long-term.

    First of all, irrigation accounts for almost 70% of all freshwater usage in the
    world (FAO and

    ITPS, 2015). Freshwater scarcity is a big threat to the human population and the
    current water

    usage for agriculture is not sustainable (Rosegrant et al., 2009). Furthermore,
    irrigation causes

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    salinization of soils (Smedema and Shiati, 2002) and increases

    leaching of fertilizer. This leaching, together with excess use

    of fertilizer and deep tilling leads to higher greenhouse gas

    emissions (Snyder et al., 2009).

    These problems illustrate the unsustainability of creating the

    optimal conditions our crops are selected for. In addition, climate

    change will further increase this challenge. Agriculture will have

    to deal with growing crops under suboptimal conditions, creating

    a gap between the yield potential and the currently reached yield –

    the so-called yield gap. An extensive research ﬁeld tries to map

    the current yield gap (Lobell et al., 2009; Licker et al., 2010;

    Van Ittersum et al., 2013) with much focus on improving land

    management practices (Lobell et al., 2009; Mueller et al., 2012).

    In concert, plant breeding is shifting from creating “specialist”

    cultivars that require optimal conditions for their performance

    toward creating “robust” cultivars that can perform optimal in a

    broad range of suboptimal conditions, with the ultimate goal of

    closing the yield gap.

    Crop yield is driven by the combination of climate, soil,

    management, and genetics. Under optimal circumstances the soil

    provides plants with stability, water, and nutrients. However,

    soils are heterogeneous environments, strongly inﬂuenced by

    outside factors. Nutrient deﬁciency, drought, salinity, ﬂooding,

    and temperature are major drivers of the current and future

    yield gap. Researchers and breeders work together to develop

    crops that are able to withstand these stresses (as reviewed

    in Mickelbart et al., 2015). However, current crop selection

    is mainly focused on the shoot, whereas most major drivers

    of the yield gap aﬀect soil properties, directly inﬂuencing the

    root system. This paper will therefore focus on the potential

    of optimizing root systems for improving crop abiotic stress

    tolerance.

    Roots Bridging the Yield Gap

    Breeding eﬀorts to improve crop yield are in general focused

    on aboveground, shoot-related phenotypes, whereas the roots

    as ‘hidden half’ of the plant are still an under-utilized source

    of crop improvement (Den Herder et al., 2010; Wachsman

    et al., 2015). Trials aimed to select for new cultivars with

    improved crop yield are in general performed under optimal

    nutrient concentrations, which has often led to selection for

    smaller and less plastic roots (White et al., 2013). Moreover,

    modern cultivars develop in general faster and the earlier

    initiation of shoot sinks stimulates the investment of biomass

    into the shoots rather than into the roots. Modern wheat

    cultivars indeed have smaller root sizes and root:shoot ratios

    than older ones (Siddique et al., 1990; Waines and Ehdaie,

    2007). Given the crucial role roots play in the establishment

    and performance of plants, researchers have started ‘the

    second green revolution’ to explore the possibility of yield

    improvements through optimization of root systems (Lynch,

    2007).

    Because water and nutrients are not evenly distributed in the

    soil, the spatial arrangement of the root system is crucial for

    optimal use of the available resources. This spatial arrangement

    of the root and its components is referred to as root system

    architecture (RSA). Length, number, positioning, and angle of

    FIGURE 1 | An overview of the different root types that together form

    the root system. A dicot root system consists only of one primary root and

    several orders of lateral roots. In addition, dicots can produce special

    stress-induced shoot-born roots called adventitious roots. A monocot root

    system produces additional axial roots, which can be separated in embryonic

    seminal roots and non-embryonic shoot-born roots. There are several types of

    shoot-borne roots, such as nodal and crown roots, often distinguished by the

    exact place they develop and their increasing thickness. In monocots, the

    primary and seminal roots are especially important during early seedling

    establishment, but shoot-born roots soon take over and are responsible for

    most of the water and nutrient uptake. All axial root types can produce several

    orders of lateral roots.

    root components (as described in Figure 1) together determine

    RSA (Figure 2). These traits determine the soil volume that

    is explored. In addition, the root surface area depends on

    root hair development and root diameter. The ability to adjust

    RSA is an important aspect of plant performance and its

    plasticity to a large variety of abiotic conditions (Smith and

    De Smet, 2012). Root development is guided by environmental

    information that is integrated into decisions regarding how fast

    and in which direction to grow, and where and when to develop

    new lateral roots (Malamy, 2005). The limits of root system

    plasticity are determined by intrinsic pathways governed by

    genetic components (Pigliucci, 2005; Smith and De Smet, 2012;

    Giﬀord et al., 2013; Jung and McCouch, 2013). Understanding

    the development and architecture of roots, as well its plasticity,

    holds thus great potential for stabilizing the productivity under

    suboptimal conditions in the root environment (de Dorlodot

    et al., 2007; Den Herder et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2011). Although,

    plants are capable of adjusting a wide range of developmental and

    molecular processes in the root to cope with abiotic stress, this

    review will mainly focus on the plasticity of RSA, their proposed

    adaptive values, and its use in the selection and breeding of more

    robust crops.

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    FIGURE 2 | RSA is deﬁned as the spatial conﬁguration of root

    components and determines the soil volume that can be explored by

    the roots. Dicot roots consist of a main root and several orders of lateral

    roots. Monocot roots contain in addition seminal roots and shoot-borne roots.

    Each plant species has genetically deﬁned limits to its RSA. Within these

    limits, the RSA is plastic and external (abiotic stress) factors modulate the

    length, number, positioning and angle of root components. The RSA plasticity

    varies strongly among and within plant species. This ﬁgure illustrates the

    modulations in RSA for a typical dicot root system.

    NUTRIENT LIMITATION: ADAPTING RSA

    FOR OPTIMAL FORAGING

    Plants use macronutrients as the basis of proteins and nucleic

    acids. Especially the availability of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen

    (N) determine plant performance. Other nutrients are used

    as co-factors for enzymes or to drive membrane transport.

    Complications in nutrient acquisition can arise because of

    nutrient shortage in the soil, but other factors such as pH, the

    balance of diﬀerent nutrients and soil composition also play a

    role. For examples, high salinity can decrease the solubility and

    thus availability of phosphate (Grattan and Grieve, 1998; Hu and

    Schmidhalter, 2005).

    Nutrient deﬁciencies are responsible for the major part

    of currently observed yield gaps worldwide. Mueller et al.

    (2012) estimated that for 73% of the areas with a yield

    gap bigger than 25%, solely improving nutrient balances in

    the soil could close this gap. This illustrates the impact of

    nutrient imbalances and deﬁciencies on plant productivity.

    If we also consider the high use of fertilizer in agriculture,

    improving plants’ capability of dealing with nutrient deﬁciencies

    and increasing their of nutrient acquisition is of major

    importance.

    Nutrients are distributed heterogeneously and often have a

    strong vertical distribution pattern. Leaching on the one hand

    and plant cycling on the other hand inﬂuence the nutrient

    distribution pattern. Leaching is caused by vertical water ﬂow

    and takes nutrients down to lower soil layers, were water ﬂow

    decreases and nutrients accumulate. Plant cycling is based on

    nutrients taken up from and cycled back to the soil, which

    causes nutrients to deplete in the root zone and accumulate

    in the topsoil. Horizontal distribution of nutrients is mainly

    dependent on the plant distribution aboveground, leading to

    higher nutrient accumulation underneath canopies. Vertical

    distribution depends on the balance between leaching and plant

    cycling, which diﬀers strongly between nutrients. Low mobile

    nutrients with a prominent role in plant growth, such as

    phosphate and potassium, undergo high plant cycling, leading

    to topsoil accumulation. In contrast, mobile nutrients, such

    as nitrate and chloride, are subject to leaching leading to

    accumulation in deeper soils (Jobbágy and Jackson, 2001, 2004).

    The challenge for plants is to cope with this heterogeneous

    and sometimes contrasting distribution of nutrients and other

    resources. In agriculture, plant cycling is often reduced, due

    to harvesting of plant material, increasing leaching and loss of

    nutrients. To cope with this heterogeneity, plants can adapt their

    RSA to speciﬁcally forage those parts of the soils where nutrient

    availability is high.

    Recently, RSA changes upon a wide range of nutrient

    deﬁciencies have been mapped in Arabidopsis growing on agar

    plates (Gruber et al., 2013). Each deﬁciency led to a distinct

    response in RSA development, which is consistent with the

    fact that not all nutrients have the same accumulation pattern

    and thus ask for a diﬀerent response. For example, the readily

    available forms of the two most limiting nutrients, nitrate (NO3−)

    and phosphate (PO43−), have an almost opposite accumulation

    pattern in the soil (Jobbágy and Jackson, 2001). Whereas

    immobile phosphate accumulates in the topsoil, mobile nitrate

    quickly leaches to deeper soils. This challenges the plant to

    respond diﬀerently to a deﬁciency of these nutrients. Fortunately,

    the RSA responses to these deﬁciencies have been mapped

    extensively in both Arabidopsis and crop species, oﬀering us many

    insights in functional RSA development.

    Topsoil Foraging for Phosphate

    Phosphate is a building block of, for example, nucleic acids

    and membrane phospholipids. Because of the high phosphate

    demand of plants, limitation in phosphate has a strong eﬀect on

    plant growth (as reviewed in Péret et al., 2011; López-Arredondo

    et al., 2014). Eﬃcient uptake of phosphate is therefore essential.

    High plant cycling, in combination with low mobility, leads to

    accumulation of phosphate in the topsoil. To optimally forage the

    soil for phosphate, plants need to develop a shallow root system

    (as reviewed in Lynch and Brown, 2001). The RSA response

    to phosphate deﬁciency in Arabidopsis is well-characterized (as

    reviewed by Péret et al., 2011). A strong shift from main root

    growth to lateral root growth is observed, which leads to a short

    root with a high number of long laterals (Figure 3A; Williamson,

    2001; Linkohr et al., 2002; López-Bucio et al., 2002; Gruber et al.,

    2013). In addition, a strong proliferation of root hairs is observed.

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    FIGURE 3 | The RSA responds to abiotic stress in different ways. This ﬁgure illustrates
    for dicots how length, angle and number of primary (blue) and lateral

    roots (grey) change in response to phosphate deﬁciency (A), nitrate deﬁciency
    (B), drought (C) and salinity (D). The arrows indicate an either positive (to
    the right) or

    negative effect (to the left).

    These changes result in a shallow root system, optimal for topsoil

    foraging.

    For maize, a series of papers was published in which the value

    of certain root traits for phosphate acquisition was evaluated

    using a set of RILS distinctly diﬀerent in these root traits.

    Shallow rooting maize varieties showed increased net phosphate

    acquisition, corrected for possible higher phosphate investments

    (Zhu et al., 2005b). A big screen of 242 accessions of maize on

    high and low phosphate availability conﬁrmed the importance of

    root plasticity under low phosphate conditions (Bayuelo-Jiménez

    et al., 2011). Yield and biomass was increased for accessions with a

    higher number of nodal and lateral roots. In addition, dense root

    hair formation also correlated with higher biomass under low P

    conditions.

    Shallow root system development is a result of strong

    investment in lateral root growth. Zhu and Lynch (2004)

    conﬁrmed that in maize enhanced lateral root formation is

    beneﬁcial for net phosphate acquisition. In comparison to

    the primary root and other components of the root system,

    lateral roots are cheap in terms of phosphate use. Similar

    results were found for enhanced seminal root growth, which

    is especially important for phosphate acquisition during early

    seedling development (Zhu et al., 2006). Several studies show

    that strigolactones are key regulators of both root and shoot

    responses to the level of available phosphate (Koltai, 2011;

    Ruyter-Spira et al., 2011; Mayzlish-Gati et al., 2012; Matthys

    et al., 2016). The eﬀect of strigolactones on RSA depends on

    phosphate availability. Whereas strigolactones inhibit lateral root

    emergence and elongation and promote primary root elongation

    when phosphate is suﬃcient (Kapulnik et al., 2011a; Matthys

    et al., 2016), the opposite is observed when phosphate is depleted

    (Ruyter-Spira et al., 2011). Interestingly, a similar phosphate

    dependent eﬀect of ABA on lateral root development has recently

    been observed (Kawa et al., 2016). The contrasting eﬀect of

    strigolactones is a result of modulation of auxin distribution and

    sensitivity (Koltai et al., 2010; Ruyter-Spira et al., 2011; Mayzlish-

    Gati et al., 2012), both underlying the strong shift from primary

    to lateral root growth (López-Bucio et al., 2002; Nacry, 2005;

    Pérez-Torres et al., 2008a,b; Miura et al., 2011). Addition of the

    synthetic auxin NAA doubled expression levels of genes involved

    in the cell cycle speciﬁcally during phosphate starvation (Pérez-

    Torres et al., 2008b). Increased auxin sensitivity during phosphate

    starvation appears to be explained by increased expression of the

    auxin receptor TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1 (TIR1),

    leading to increased degradation of AUX/IAA and released

    repression on auxin response modules (Pérez-Torres et al.,

    2008a). Interestingly, strigolactones have been shown to be

    responsible for the increase of TIR1 expression during phosphate

    limitation (Mayzlish-Gati et al., 2012).

    The inhibition of primary root growth in Arabidopsis

    (Col-0) in response to phosphate starvation has been shown

    to be strong and irreversible (Sánchez-Calderón et al., 2005).

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    During phosphate starvation, primary root development changes

    drastically, shifting from indeterminate growth to determinate

    growth (Sánchez-Calderón et al., 2005; Kawa et al., 2016).

    Preceding this drastic shift, changes in the quiescence center

    are observed, suggesting an important role during phosphate

    starvation. Consistently, Svistoonoﬀ et al. (2007) show that

    speciﬁcally exposing the root cap to low phosphate is suﬃcient

    to induce growth arrest in the primary root. Mutants lacking

    determinate growth in low phosphate conditions show reduced

    activation of the phosphate starvation rescue system (Sánchez-

    Calderón et al., 2006). These ﬁndings suggest an important role

    for the root cap in sensing environmental conditions.

    During phosphate limitation, Arabidopsis develops a high

    number of long root hairs (Bates and Lynch, 1996). Compared

    to mutants lacking root hairs, wild type plants have a higher

    phosphate uptake resulting in more plant growth (Bates and

    Lynch, 2000). Gahoonia and Nielsen (1998) measured phosphate

    uptake of root hairs by providing the radioisotope 32P to root

    hairs of rye plants in the soil. The root hairs contributed

    to a substantial amount of 63% of total phosphate uptake.

    Consistently, a mutant of barley lacking root hairs took up half

    the amount of phosphate compared to the wild type (Gahoonia

    et al., 2001). Under low phosphate conditions, cultivars of barley

    with long root hairs are able to sustain high yields, whereas

    cultivars with short root hairs produce substantially less yield

    (Gahoonia and Nielsen, 2004). Interestingly, no disadvantage

    of root hair development under high phosphate availability is

    found for either Arabidopsis and Barley (Bates and Lynch, 2000,

    2001; Gahoonia and Nielsen, 2004). As for other root traits,

    strigolactones seem to play a major role in the regulation of the

    number and length of root hairs (Koltai et al., 2010; Kapulnik

    et al., 2011a,b; Mayzlish-Gati et al., 2012).

    Next to length and number of root components, the angle

    of the roots also determines whether a root system develops

    shallow or deep. Roots are able to sense gravity, allowing

    the main root to grow down into the soil, a response called

    gravitropism. Although lateral roots are also gravitropic, they

    typically show a gravitropic setpoint angle (GSA; Rosquete

    et al., 2013; Roychoudhry et al., 2013), resulting in non-vertical

    emergence from the main root (see also salinity and drought

    sections). Under low phosphate conditions, gravitropism could

    be expected to counteract development of a shallow root system

    ideal for topsoil foraging. In accordance, in common bean,

    development of a shallow root system depends on the ability to

    adjust the gravitropic oﬀset angle. This ability indeed correlated

    with its ability to cope with low phosphate conditions (Bonser

    et al., 1995). Subsequent investigation of RILs with contrasting

    root gravitropic oﬀset angles showed a strong correlation with

    phosphate acquisition and plant growth (Liao et al., 2004).

    Deep Rooting and Selective Root

    Placement for Nitrate

    In contrast to phosphate, nitrate is highly mobile in soils and

    is therefore prone to leaching. In environments where nitrate

    is limiting, deeper soil layers can often oﬀer nitrogen supplies.

    Consistently, availability of phosphate and nitrate has contrasting

    eﬀects on RSA. Low nitrate availability in general limits plant

    growth. However, low nitrate availability does not limit primary

    and lateral root elongation, enabling the root system to reach

    deeper layers of the soil (Figure 3B; Linkohr et al., 2002; Gruber

    et al., 2013). This shift in investment results in an increase

    in root:shoot ratio. For maize, a monocot species, reaching

    greater rooting depth requires the development of a lower

    number of crown roots. Maize genotypes with lower crown

    root number showed 45% greater rooting depth, which was

    accompanied with higher N acquisition (Saengwilai et al., 2014).

    The biggest diﬀerence in N acquisition was found in deeper

    layers, emphasizing the importance of a deep root system for

    nitrogen acquisition.

    Lateral root density is not aﬀected by homogeneous nitrate

    limitation. Interestingly, in a heterogeneous environment, a

    strong increase in lateral root density in nitrate patches is

    observed in both Arabidopsis and maize (Linkohr et al., 2002;

    Dina in ’t Zandt et al., 2015). When plants are exposed to nitrate

    patches, lateral root elongation rates outside the patches were

    strongly decreased, indicating a shift of investment of resources.

    Plants are thus able to selectively place their roots to eﬃciently

    forage the soil. The mechanism of utilization of heterogeneously

    distributed nutrients by selective placement of lateral roots in

    or near nutrient enriched patches is best studied for nitrogen.

    However, selective root placement for a wide range of nutrients

    was already illustrated in 1975. A limited part of the root system

    of barley was exposed to high concentrations of phosphate,

    nitrate, ammonium, and potassium (Drew, 1975). For all of these

    nutrients a strong proliferation of lateral roots in the zone of

    high availability was observed. Growth of lateral roots in other

    zones was strongly limited. This emphasizes the importance of

    investigating this response for other nutrients.

    The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 plays an important role in

    perceiving nitrate levels in the soil. The nrt1.1 mutant displays

    no increase in lateral root proliferation in nitrate rich patches

    (Remans et al., 2006a), while the RSA response to homogeneous

    nitrate limitation is not aﬀected in this mutant, indicating that

    this is not an eﬀect of reduced nitrate uptake. Interestingly,

    NRT1.1 has the ability to transport auxin and this transport is

    inhibited by nitrate (Krouk et al., 2010). Mounier et al. (2014)

    showed that in nitrate patches, nitrate inhibits auxin transport

    by NRT1.1 out of lateral root tips and primordia, leading to

    auxin accumulation and stimulation of lateral root growth.

    Outside these patches, nitrate levels are low and NRT1.1 prevents

    accumulation and thus lateral root growth.

    NRT1.1 has been shown to aﬀect expression of several

    downstream genes involved in nitrate starvation responses,

    including NRT2.1 (Muños et al., 2004). NRT2.1 is a major

    component of high-aﬃnity nitrate uptake in the root (Wirth

    et al., 2007). NRT1.1 and NRT2.1 seem to be responsible for

    repression of lateral root growth outside nitrate patches, based

    on their mutant phenotypes (Little et al., 2005; Remans et al.,

    2006b; Krouk et al., 2010). Nitrate starvation can trigger ethylene

    production, a phytohormone that inﬂuences root growth (Tian

    et al., 2009). NRT2.1, also induced by nitrate starvation, seems to

    stimulate ethylene production (Zheng et al., 2013). Conversely,

    ethylene inhibits NRT1.1 and NRT2.1 expression, possibly

    providing a negative feedback loop important for ﬁne tuning

    responses (Leblanc et al., 2008; Tian et al., 2009).

    DROUGHT: SEARCHING FOR WATER

    SUPPLIES

    Besides nutrient limitation, water limitation is the biggest driver

    of the yield gap. Mueller et al. (2012) have shown that in

    16% of the areas with a current yield gap bigger then 25%,

    improving irrigation can solely close the gap. In addition, for all

    investigated areas improving irrigation would decrease the gap.

    This illustrates the importance of water availability for plants.

    Plants need water for transport, structure and photosynthesis

    among other processes. Most crops have high water requirements

    and are poorly drought resistant. However, irrigation is already

    responsible for 70% of the total use of available freshwater (FAO

    and ITPS, 2015). The present focus of plant breeders therefore is

    on improving water use eﬃciency of crops.

    When water availability is limited, the soil osmotic potential

    decreases and plants are confronted with osmotic stress. Plants

    cannot take up water and sometimes even loose water to the

    soil. The high surrounding osmotic potential leads to loss of

    turgor, starting in the root. The combination of rapid sensing

    and signaling, followed by adjustments on both cellular and organ

    level, can enable the plant to limit water loss and survive drought

    stress (as reviewed in Robbins and Dinneny, 2015). Drought

    stress leads to distinct changes in RSA, both on whole-root system

    and sub-organ level.

    Whole-Root Level: Deeper Rooting for

    Water

    Water is generally stored in deeper soil layers, because the topsoil

    dries more quickly. Plants that develop deeper root systems will

    have access to water stored in these deeper layers. Among other

    traits, deeper rooting has been shown to be beneﬁcial for plant

    production and survival under water limiting conditions (as

    reviewed in Comas et al., 2013). For example, the generally deeper

    rooting mutant extremely drought tolerant1 (edt1) in Arabidopsis

    shows high drought tolerance (Yu et al., 2008). This is explained

    by the ectopic overexpression of the HD-ZIP transcription factor

    HDG11, which directly promotes the transcription of genes

    encoding cell wall loosening proteins. These proteins promote

    cell elongation in the root, leading to an extended root system (Xu

    et al., 2014). Interestingly, expression of HDG11 in other species

    such as rice, poplar and cotton, also confers drought tolerance

    (Yu et al., 2013, 2016).

    Reaching deeper soils requires a shift from investment

    in lateral roots to investment in axile roots (Figure 3C).

    Arabidopsis shows a strong inhibition of lateral root emergence

    and elongation when grown on agar medium containing an

    osmoticum, such as sorbitol or mannitol, mimicking osmotic

    stress (Deak and Malamy, 2005; Xiong et al., 2006). Importantly,

    Xiong et al. (2006) showed a possible link between inhibition of

    lateral root growth on agar and drought tolerance in soil. Mutants

    performing well under drought conditions in soil, showed high

    sensitivity to ABA leading to strong inhibition of lateral root

    length on agar media. In comparison, less tolerant mutants

    showed no inhibition of lateral root length. ABSCISIC ACID

    INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), enhanced by ABA during drought stress,

    can inhibit PIN1 expression, leading to decreased polar auxin

    transport and decreased lateral root formation (Shkolnik-Inbar

    and Bar-Zvi, 2010; Rowe et al., 2016). This mode of action of ABA

    provides a possible mechanistic explanation for the eﬀect of ABA

    on lateral root formation.

    Polar auxin transport by inﬂux and eﬄux carriers determines

    auxin distribution in the root, which is not only important

    for LR formation, but also for bending of plant organs by

    diﬀerentially aﬀecting cell elongation. This bending is essential

    for gravitropism of the main root. Positive gravitropism, growing

    in the direction of gravity, orientates the root downward and

    enables penetration of the soil. However, other root components,

    such as lateral, seminal and crown roots can display very diﬀerent

    growth angles, partly suppressing gravitropism. The angle of

    these roots strongly determines whether RSA develops shallow

    or deep. In lateral roots PINs determine auxin distribution

    and thus the GSA (Rosquete et al., 2013). The magnitude

    of the diﬀerence in auxin concentration between the upper

    and lower side of the lateral root determines how strong a

    lateral root will bend (Roychoudhry et al., 2013). As previously

    described, auxin transport is inhibited during drought stress

    due to the inhibition of PIN1 expression (Liu et al., 2015),

    which might facilitate increased downward bending of the

    roots.

    In several crop species increased downward bending of the

    roots is correlated with drought tolerance. In rice, a strong

    correlation between the angle of roots and drought tolerance is

    observed (Kato et al., 2006). High expression of the DEEPER

    ROOTING1 (DRO1) gene in rice, responsible for increased

    downward bending of the roots by altering the auxin distribution,

    results in maintained high yield under drought stress (Uga

    et al., 2013). This example indicates that adapting RSA, in this

    case both using genetic and transgenic approaches, can result

    in increased drought tolerance. Similar to rice, the angle of

    seminal roots in wheat cultivars also correlates with drought

    tolerance (Manschadi et al., 2008). Drought tolerant wheat

    cultivars develop seminal roots with a narrow angle, growing

    deeper into the soil.

    Sub-organ Level: Hydrotropism and

    Hydropatterning

    Although a strong vertical distribution pattern of water exists,

    soil heterogeneity in water content exists and sensing of available

    water is crucial for optimal water uptake. It has been shown

    that plants are able to partially repress gravitropism and grow

    toward water, the so-called hydrotropism response (as reviewed

    in Eapen et al., 2005; Takahashi et al., 2009; Cassab et al., 2013).

    To investigate hydrotropism in Arabidopsis, diﬀerent growth

    systems have been used, in which either salt solutions or agar

    with sorbitol created a gradient in osmotic potential and thus

    a gradient in water availability. Arabidopsis was able to redirect

    growth of its main root away from a low osmotic potential and

    thus low water availability (Takahashi et al., 2002; Kaneyasu et al.,

    Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org

    Koevoets et al.

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    2007; Moriwaki et al., 2013). This moisture-driven hydrotropic

    response has also been observed in other species including maize

    (Takahashi and Scott, 1991), cucumber (Mizuno et al., 2002), and

    pea (Takahashi and Suge, 1991; Takahashi et al., 1996).

    As described previously, the distribution of auxin, driven

    by polar auxin transport, has a central role in regulating

    bending of plant organs and response to gravity. Interestingly,

    hydrotropism seems to be independent from polar auxin

    transport, as the repression of inﬂux and eﬄux carriers of auxin

    do not inhibit the response (Kaneyasu et al., 2007). Recently,

    auxin distribution during hydrotropism was measured with the

    DII-VENUS SENSOR (Shkolnik et al., 2016). Indeed, during

    the ﬁrst 2 h of hydrotropic response, no change in auxin

    distribution was observed. In the presence of NPA, an inhibitor

    of auxin transport, hydrotropic bending was not inhibited. The

    involvement of auxin through changes in auxin sensitivity or

    biosynthesis remains ellusive due to contrasting results showing

    either positive, negative or no eﬀects of inhibition of auxin

    responses or sensitivity (Takahashi et al., 2002; Kaneyasu et al.,

    2007; Shkolnik et al., 2016).

    It has been shown that Arabidopsis roots can distinguish a wet

    from a dry surface and selectively favor development of roots in

    these wet places over development in dry places (Bao et al., 2014).

    These wet surfaces determine where new lateral root founder cells

    are formed. Deak and Malamy (2005) have shown that under

    dry conditions lateral root primordia develop at similar rates

    as under control conditions. These primordia can subsequently

    be rapidly induced in zones with high water availability. The

    combination of formation and emergence of primordia leads to

    speciﬁc root proliferation at sites of high water availability, so-

    called hydropatterning. This process seems to be independent

    of the major drought stress hormone, ABA (Bao et al., 2014).

    Further research on this new topic is required to provide more

    knowledge on how plant roots sense moisture and adjust RSA

    accordingly.

    SALINITY

    Salinity is a major and increasing problem for agriculture

    (Rengasamy, 2006). Most crop species are salt sensitive and

    grow poorly on salinized soils (Sairam and Tyagi, 2004; Munns

    et al., 2006; Munns and Tester, 2008). In 1992, the extent of

    salinity-aﬀected soils was estimated at 410 billion ha. Although

    an adequate mapping of the current extent of salinized soils is

    lacking, over 100 countries are confronted with soil salinization.

    On a yearly basis between 0.3 and 1.5 million ha of arable

    land are lost to salinization and another 20–40 million ha are

    strongly aﬀected by salinity (FAO and ITPS, 2015). Although

    some of these are naturally occurring saline soils, current

    observed salinization is often the result of irrigation practices.

    Irrigation in arid zones, accounting for approximately 40% of

    irrigation worldwide, mobilizes salts stored in the deeper soil

    layers (Smedema and Shiati, 2002). In addition, due to freshwater

    scarcity, an increased use of brackish irrigation increases salt

    levels even further. The increasing losses of arable land due to

    salinization ask for the development of salt tolerant crops.

    Similar to drought, salinity can cause problems due to the

    high osmotic potential in the soil, leading to osmotic stress. In

    addition, salinity aﬀects plant growth due to the toxicity of high

    sodium Na+ levels. Na+ toxicity especially causes problems in

    the shoot by inhibiting photosynthesis among other processes

    (Munns, 2002). Na+ is chemically similar to K+ and can interfere

    with processes in which K+ plays an essential role (Benito et al.,

    2014). The capacity to maintain a low Na+/K+ balance in the

    shoot has been shown to be closely linked to salt tolerance (Møller

    et al., 2009). Preventing Na+ transport to the shoot is thus

    very important. The root system is responsible for water uptake,

    accompanied by dissolved ions including Na+, and thus plays

    an essential role in preventing Na+ from entering the vascular

    system and reaching the shoot.

    Remodeling of the Root System during

    Salt Stress

    Salt has a distinct eﬀect on root growth (as reviewed in Galvan-

    Ampudia and Testerink, 2011). Although, low salt concentrations

    up to 50 mM can promote plant growth in Arabidopsis

    (Zolla et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011; Julkowska et al., 2014),

    higher salt concentrations have severe negative eﬀects. Both

    primary and lateral root growth is inhibited during salt stress

    (Figure 3D; Julkowska et al., 2014). In addition, lateral root

    number speciﬁcally decreases in the root zone developed after

    exposure to salt stress (Figure 3D; Julkowska et al., 2014). Most

    studies show no eﬀect of salt stress on lateral root density,

    indicating that the decrease in number of lateral roots is related

    to the inhibition of primary root growth (Julkowska et al., 2014).

    Within seconds after exposure to salt stress, plant signaling

    is activated. This early signaling leads to adjustments in plant

    growth (as reviewed in Julkowska and Testerink, 2015), starting

    with a quiescence of growth in all plant organs. The quiescence

    phase is caused by a temporary inhibition of mitotic activity,

    leading to lower cell division rates (West et al., 2004). After the

    quiescence phase, growth recovers again. However, growth rates

    only recover to a certain extent, because the inhibition of the cell

    cycle during the quiescence phase results in fewer cells in the

    meristem (West et al., 2004). In addition, mature cell length is

    smaller in salt stressed roots.

    Quiescence is induced by abscisic acid (ABA), which is

    rapidly up-regulated under salt stress due to the decrease in

    osmotic potential (Jia et al., 2002; Duan et al., 2013; Geng

    et al., 2013). ABA in general inhibits both gibberellin (GA) and

    brassinosteroid (BR) signaling (Achard et al., 2006; Gallego-

    Bartolome et al., 2012) and stress-induced reduction of growth

    has been shown to beneﬁt the plant (Achard et al., 2006). It is thus

    proposed that the quiescence phase is essential to induce changes

    to cope with salt stress. The quiescence phase is followed by a

    partial growth recovery, that is mainly guided by an increase in

    GA and BR levels (Geng et al., 2013).

    The length of the quiescence phase diﬀers strongly between

    root components. Whereas quiescence in the main root takes

    approximately 8 h, this phase can take up to 2 days in lateral

    roots (Duan et al., 2013; Geng et al., 2013). In a similar way, the

    recovery extent of diﬀerent organs diﬀers. Although overall an

    Koevoets et al.

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    inhibition of root growth is observed, there is a distinct diﬀerence

    between the eﬀects of salt on primary in comparison to lateral

    root growth. Julkowska et al. (2014) have shown that in Col-0

    the relative growth rate of the primary root was more strongly

    aﬀected than the growth rate of the lateral roots. This indicates

    that the RSA is remodeled during salt stress. The adaptive value

    of this remodeling with respect to salinity tolerance is still unclear

    and requires further research.

    In a screen of 32 Arabidopsis accessions, a ﬁrst indication

    for a relation between remodeling of RSA during salt stress

    and salt tolerance was found (Julkowska et al., 2014). The

    screen revealed four distinct growth strategies during salt stress,

    depending on the relative inhibition of the number of lateral

    roots, main root and lateral root growth rates. One of these

    strategies was correlated with a much lower Na+/K+ level in the

    shoot, indicating less Na+ uptake and thus a higher tolerance.

    This strategy is characterized by a strong inhibition of lateral root

    growth rates, while main root growth rates and number of lateral

    roots are much less aﬀected (Figure 3D).

    Besides remodeling of the root system during salt stress,

    plants also show reduced gravitropism under saline conditions

    (Sun et al., 2007). Galvan-Ampudia et al. (2013) showed that

    plants can speciﬁcally redirect growth away from higher salt

    concentrations, a response called halotropism. This response

    was observed in Arabidopsis, tomato and sorghum seedlings,

    both on agar media and in soil. Similar to gravitropism, auxin

    redistribution is central in regulating halotropism. Endocytosis

    of PIN2, an auxin eﬄux carrier, at the side of high salt

    concentrations, redistributes auxin in the root (Galvan-Ampudia

    et al., 2013). The redistribution of auxin is supported by auxin-

    induced expression of AUX1, an auxin inﬂux carrier (van den

    Berg et al., 2016). Both mathematical modeling and experimental

    data have shown that these processes, together with a transient

    PIN1 increase, are responsible for the root bending away

    from salt (Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2013; van den Berg et al.,

    2016).

    Part of the salinity response is also triggered by osmotic

    stress and shows overlap with drought responses. However,

    the changes in RSA show distinct diﬀerences. For example,

    main root growth is strongly promoted during drought,

    whereas it is inhibited during salt stress. It is not well-

    known whether the above described quiescence phase is

    also displayed during drought stress. Because the osmotic

    component of salinity is believed to underlie this response,

    it is worth investigating. For halotropism and hydrotropism,

    although similar responses, the underlying mechanisms seem

    to diﬀer. In contrast to halotropism, hydrotropism has shown

    to be independent of auxin transport (Kaneyasu et al., 2007).

    Halotropism is dependent on auxin distribution and occurs

    only in response to Na+ ions, indicating it is a speciﬁc

    response to high salinity (Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2013; Pierik

    and Testerink, 2014). For drought stress, the function of

    changes in RSA has been studied extensively, whereas salinity

    research has been more focused on the underlying mechanistic

    principles. In future research, studying the overlaps and

    diﬀerences between these stresses can beneﬁt knowledge in both

    areas.

    Most crop species are highly sensitive to salinity. Tomato

    serves as a model crop that is widely used to study how salt

    tolerance can be enhanced in crop species. For a wide range of

    vegetables, including tomato, grafting is a very eﬀective way to

    increase crop resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, without

    aﬀecting above ground characteristics (see also challenge 3 in

    section on crop selection). For several salt sensitive commercial

    tomato cultivars, grafting onto rootstocks of more tolerant

    cultivars has positive eﬀects on productivity when exposed to

    high salinity (Estañ et al., 2005; Martinez-Rodriguez et al.,

    2008). The Na+/K+ levels in the shoot (scions) indicated that

    the tolerant rootstocks prevented Na+ reaching the shoot,

    illustrating the importance of the root system for salt tolerance.

    Unfortunately, only little is known about RSA development of

    crops during salt stress. In rice, rye, and maize inhibition of

    root length has been observed under high salinity (Rodriguez

    et al., 1997; Rahman et al., 2001; Ogawa et al., 2006). Similar

    to Arabidopsis, maize shows a quiescence phase in response

    to exposure to high salinity, followed by recovery (Rodriguez

    et al., 1997). In rye, the reduction in root growth is related to a

    reduction in cell division and an increase in cell death (Ogawa

    et al., 2006). Further research on remodeling of the root system

    of crop species will be necessary to use our current knowledge in

    Arabidopsis to improve crop tolerance to salinity.

    FLOODING: ANAEROBIC STRESS

    Already 10% of cultivated land surface is so poorly drained that

    waterlogging, leading to anoxic conditions in the root zone,

    causes crop yield losses. Twenty percent of agricultural land in

    Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation and 16% in the USA

    are too wet for optimal plant functioning (Setter and Waters,

    2003). As climate change is expected to lead to more frequent

    heavy precipitation during the plant growth season in some areas,

    these problems will increase. Flooding and hypoxia impose an

    immediate and dramatic limitation for root functioning. Limiting

    the oxygen supply to root cells causes an almost instantaneous

    arrest of root growth (as reviewed in Gibbs et al., 1998). Switching

    from aerobic respiration to the glycolytic generation of ATP

    leads to a severe reduction in energy available for maintenance,

    growth and ion uptake. Of these three diﬀerent functions, growth

    takes 20–45% of ATP generated through respiration (Veen, 1981;

    van der Werf et al., 1988; Poorter et al., 1991; Scheurwater

    et al., 1998, 1999). Balancing the demand for energy with the

    reduced production through glycolysis could therefore also cause

    limiting root growth. Arrest of root growth could, however, also

    be caused by accumulation of products of anaerobic metabolism.

    A lethal drop in pH of the cytoplasm can occur when protons

    accumulate in the cytoplasm and the vacuole (Gerendás and

    Ratcliﬀe, 2002). In Phragmites australis addition of low molecular

    weight monocarboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, propionic

    acid, butyric acid and caproic acid, and sulﬁde, at concentration

    levels that have been measured in situ, arrested root elongation

    (Armstrong and Armstrong, 2001). As the rate of root elongation

    is one of the most important parameters determining nutrient

    uptake rate (Silberbush and Barber, 1983; Dunbabin, 2006),

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    ﬂooding-induced inhibition of root growth ultimately would lead

    to nutrient limitation and negatively impact the survival of the

    whole plant.

    One of the best-studied adaptations of plants to ﬂooding

    conditions is the formation of aerenchymatic tissue in the root,

    which provides an alternative pathway for the supply of oxygen

    to the root tissue (Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Gibberd et al.,

    2001; Rubinigg et al., 2002). This requires that new, well-adapted,

    adventitious roots are being formed (Visser et al., 1996). In these

    roots, axial oxygen loss can be kept to a minimum so that the

    root tip becomes a well-oxygenated micro-climate (Jackson and

    Armstrong, 1999). Most of the disadvantages for root metabolism

    imposed by the ﬂooding-induced hypoxic conditions are thereby

    ameliorated. In monocot plants the formation of new nodal roots,

    replacing the old seminal roots and often containing aerenchyma,

    can be stimulated, leading to superﬁcial rooting patterns (Rich

    and Watt, 2013). If plants are not capable of increasing their

    oxygen supply through aerenchymous conducts in the root or by

    placing new roots close to the soil surface where the oxygen level

    might be higher, survival of ﬂooding is unlikely.

    TEMPERATURE

    Temperature is a key abiotic factor involved in seed germination

    and subsequent root system development during early seedling

    establishment. The temperature of the soil ﬂuctuates by

    sinusoidal oscillations on a diurnal scale. However, depending

    on soil depth, changes in soil temperature are delayed and

    much lower in amplitude than variations in the atmospheric

    temperature (Walter et al., 2009). The root-zone temperature

    (RZT) thus ﬂuctuates daily, seasonally, and with soil depth

    (Füllner et al., 2012). Depending on the season and the time of the

    day, the temperature of the root environment can be signiﬁcantly

    diﬀerent than the atmospheric temperature experienced by the

    shoots. The RZT directly aﬀects root development, uptake and

    upward transport of water and nutrients (Aroca et al., 2001),

    phytohormone production (Ali et al., 1996; Veselova et al., 2005),

    which in turn aﬀect water status (Bloom et al., 2004), stomatal

    conductance (Dodd et al., 2000), photosynthesis (Hurewitz and

    Janes, 1983), biomass partitioning (Delucia et al., 1992; Engels,

    1994), leaf (Poiré et al., 2010), and shoot growth (Venema

    et al., 2008; Sakamoto and Suzuki, 2015). Plant species clearly

    diﬀer in their optimal temperature range for root development;

    e.g., oat 4–7◦C (Nielsen et al., 1960), wheat 14–18◦C (Porter

    and Gawith, 1999), pea 15–20◦C (Gladish and Rost, 1993),

    tomato 22–25◦C (Gosselin and Trudel, 1984), sunﬂower 25–

    30◦C (Seiler, 1998), and cotton 32–35◦C (Mcmichael et al., 1993).

    Root:shoot ratios usually increase under unfavorable RZTs as

    long as temperature limits for root development are not reached

    (Engels, 1994; Venema et al., 2008; Füllner et al., 2012). This

    adaptation in root:shoot ratio may overcome restrictions in water

    and nutrient uptake due to increased water viscosity and/or

    decreased root hydraulic conductance (Equiza et al., 2001; Aroca

    et al., 2012). Global climate change is likely to exacerbate plant

    abiotic stress in coming decades by increasing ﬂuctuations in soil

    temperature and (related) water availability (Lynch and Brown,

    2012). Breeding crops with a broader root-zone temperature

    optimum is therefore of signiﬁcant importance to improve future

    plant performance. Improved knowledge of the key regulators for

    RSA optimization would support these breeding eﬀorts.

    Temperature Effects on RSA

    The exposure of both mono- and dicot plant roots to

    temperatures below or above their optimum temperature

    generally decreases (i) primary root length, (ii) lateral root

    density (numbers of lateral roots per unit primary root length)

    and (iii) the angle under which lateral roots emerge from the

    primary root, whereas the average lateral root length is unaﬀected

    (Mcmichael et al., 1993; Seiler, 1998; Nagel et al., 2009).

    In addition, roots suﬀering from supraoptimal temperature

    stress start to initiate second and third order laterals (Pardales

    et al., 1999) and are characterized by an increased average

    root diameter (Qin et al., 2007). In general, the modulating

    eﬀect of sub- and supraoptimal RZTs on RSA development

    reduces the volume that roots may access for the uptake

    of water and nutrients. However, root temperature was kept

    spatially uniform in all these studies. Remarkably, monocot

    barley plants exposed to a vertical RZT gradient of 20–10◦C

    showed increased shoot and root dry masses of 144 and

    297%, respectively, and a 161% increase in root:shoot ratio

    compared with plants grown at a uniform RZT of 20◦C (Füllner

    et al., 2012). Barley exposed to the vertical RZT revealed

    also accelerated tiller formation. The higher root biomass of

    plants grown at the vertical RZT gradient was not the result

    of longer roots but was associated with a higher proportion

    of thicker roots. Additionally, root systems developed under a

    vertical RZT gradient were much stronger concentrated in the

    upper 10 cm of the soil substrate gradient and their N and

    C concentrations were signiﬁcantly lower than under uniform

    RZT conditions. These data clearly demonstrate that knowledge

    gained from experiments with uniform RZTs cannot simply

    be extrapolated to the ﬁeld where roots experience vertical

    temperature gradients.

    The temperature dependence of RSA development shows

    strong inter- (Mcmichael et al., 1993; Lee et al., 2009) and

    intraspeciﬁc variation (Seiler, 1998; Hund et al., 2007, 2008).

    The temperature plasticity of the RSA is most extensively

    studied in maize. In this monocot species, the total lateral root

    length correlated signiﬁcantly with improved photosynthesis-

    related traits and dry matter accumulation at suboptimal growth

    temperature (Hund et al., 2007). A high density of long lateral

    roots was therefore regarded as a promising trait to improve

    early seedling vigor at suboptimal soil temperatures (Hund

    et al., 2008). Nevertheless, breeding has to focus on optimizing

    RSA over a broad range of RZTs as roots also experience

    temperatures in the optimal- or even supraoptimal range during

    the entire growth season. At high (root-zone) temperatures the

    development of long axile roots is of greater importance than

    lateral roots to facilitate appropriate water uptake from the

    lower soil layers in times of drought stress (Hund et al., 2008).

    A schematic overview of general observed eﬀects of non-optimal

    temperatures on RSA and its adaptations to broaden the RZT

    range for optimal plant performance are presented in Figure 4.

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    FIGURE 4 | Schematic overview of the effect of root-zone temperature

    on plant performance and underlying general changes in RSA (brown).

    To broaden the temperature range for optimal plant performance (yellow),

    plants should invest in lateral root formation (suboptimal temperature range)

    and/or axile root length (supraoptimal temperature range). The adaptive value

    of these RSA changes are, respectively, an increased root surface area to

    improve resource uptake capacity and drought adaptation by penetration to

    lower soil layers.

    To optimize RSA over a broader temperature range, Hund

    et al. (2012) provided the prove-of-concept that hybrids of

    southern dent and northern ﬂint maize inbred lines, which

    contrast in temperature dependence of axile and lateral root

    elongation rates, showed improved rooting potential across the

    sum of all temperatures. Application of this heterosis eﬀect can

    lead to hybrids that can perform well in a broader range of

    temperature conditions, thereby improving the robustness of

    whole-plant performance.

    Temperature Modulation of Root

    Elongation

    The

    primary

    stunting

    eﬀect

    of

    sub-

    and

    supraoptimal

    temperatures on RSA is caused by inhibition of root elongation

    (Pahlavanian and Silk, 1988; Pritchard et al., 1990; Pardales et al.,

    1992; Gladish and Rost, 1993; Nagel et al., 2009). In Arabidopsis

    accessions, the relative decrease in root elongation rates after

    transfer from 21 to 10◦C were not signiﬁcantly correlated with

    the average temperature during the growing season of the speciﬁc

    ecotype, suggesting that primary root growth at 10◦C is not a key

    factor in adaptation to colder habitats (Lee et al., 2009). Within

    tomato, however, the relative inhibition of root elongation and

    root growth rates at low temperatures were indicative for the

    diﬀerence in chilling tolerance between domestic cultivars and

    high-altitude accessions of the wild tomato Solanum habrochaites

    (Zamir and Gadish, 1987; Venema et al., 2008). Dynamic

    changes in temperature severely aﬀect the elongation rate of

    root cells rather than the length of the elongation zone (Nagel

    et al., 2009). In the short-term (hours), inhibition in root cell

    elongation by low temperature is related to a decrease in the

    in vivo extensibility of the cell wall (Pritchard et al., 1990).

    Gravitropism experiments with Arabidopsis roots demonstrated

    that acute cold stress (4◦C) selectively inhibits the basipetal auxin

    transport due to blocking the intracellular traﬃcking of a subset

    of proteins that include auxin eﬄux carriers (PIN2 and PIN3).

    As a consequence, auxin accumulates to a level at which root

    cell elongation is inhibited (Shibasaki et al., 2009). When plant

    roots have enough time to acclimate to a constant low RZT

    (weeks), cell elongation rates increase again and the length of

    the elongation zone expands (Pahlavanian and Silk, 1988). This

    may explain the strong linear relationship between temperature

    and elongation rates of both primary and later roots directly

    after germination and its disappearance later on during seedling

    establishment (Aguirrezabal and Tardieu, 1996).

    Variation

    in

    root

    elongation

    rates

    among

    Arabidopsis

    accessions correlated at optimal temperature with the production

    rate of cells within the root meristem (Beemster et al., 2002). Cell

    production, in turn, was determined by variation in cell cycle

    duration and, to a lesser extent, by diﬀerences in the number

    of dividing cells. Cell production rates strongly correlated

    with the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDKA).

    Low temperature decreased the division potential of the root

    meristem in Arabidopsis by reducing both the meristem size and

    cell number (Zhu et al., 2015). The repression of the division

    potential of root meristematic cells at a suboptimal temperature

    of 16◦C could be ascribed to a reduced accumulation of auxin

    in the root apex. Long-term (7 days) exposure to 16◦C inhibited

    the expression of PIN1/3/7 and auxin biosynthesis-related

    genes suggesting that auxin transport and biosynthesis both

    contribute to the low-temperature mediated reduction of

    auxin accumulation in roots tips. Root length and meristem

    cell number of ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 1

    (arr1-3) and 12 (arr12-1) cytokinin signaling mutants were

    much less susceptible to low temperature than wild-type roots.

    This diﬀerence was related to higher PIN1/3 expression in the

    mutants, which in turn resulted in a less pronounced reduction

    in auxin accumulation. These data, together with the results

    obtained with the cytokinin signaling mutant ahp1-1 ahp2-1

    ahp3, strongly suggest the involvement of cytokinin signaling in

    the modulation of RSA development at low temperature (Zhu

    et al., 2015).

    High RZT (40◦C) reduced the elongation and cell production

    rate of Sorghum seminal roots with 14 and 26%, respectively,

    for every 2 days of exposure (Pardales et al., 1992). In

    contrast to low temperatures, the underlying inhibitory eﬀects

    of high temperatures and heat stress on root elongation are

    poorly studied. The limited information that is available in the

    literature excludes the involvement of altered IAA transport

    or levels (Gladish et al., 2000), but supports the involvement

    of increased ethylene levels (Qin et al., 2007). Inhibitors of

    ethylene biosynthesis partly alleviated the eﬀect of high RZT

    on root elongation, stomatal conductance and shoot water

    status, however, they failed in ameliorating the negative eﬀects

    on photosynthesis and biomass accumulation. This points to

    a non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis mediated by high

    temperature-induced changes in nutrient uptake (Qin et al.,

    2007).

    CROP SELECTION ON RSA: THE

    CHALLENGES

    This review presents a number of examples in which plasticity

    of RSA traits considerably impact a plant’s capability to cope

    with one or more abiotic stresses. These examples emphasize

    the great potential that selection on RSA traits holds for crop

    improvement. However, the aboveground focus of crop selection

    is not without reason. In this concluding section we will discuss

    three major challenges breeders face when applying selection for

    RSA in their crop improvement programs and possible ways to

    tackle these.

    Challenge 1: High Throughput

    Belowground Screening

    The most prominent challenge for crop selection on RSA is

    uncovering the hidden world of plant roots. Whether crops are

    grown in ﬁelds or in greenhouses, roots are usually grown in a

    substrate, which prevents easily screening their properties. The

    growth substrate also greatly aﬀects how roots develop. The

    currently most common method to investigate RSA, growth on

    agar medium, is very artiﬁcial. Most often roots grow in light,

    with an excess of sucrose, in 2D and the humidity inside the Petri

    dish is almost saturated. Eﬀort is taken to improve this system,

    for example by shielding the roots from light (Silva-Navas et al.,

    2015). Although agar media provide an easy, adequate and cheap

    method that can be used for research on Arabidopsis in the lab, its

    use in crop selection is not straightforward.

    In the last decade a wide range of new and improved methods

    to research roots in a more natural environment have been

    developed (as reviewed in Zhu et al., 2011; Downie et al., 2015;

    Judd et al., 2015; Kuijken et al., 2015). Most systems are based

    on either a transparent growth medium or a medium from which

    the roots can easily be removed without damage. Agar and other

    gel-like mediums are suited for imaging during growth, although

    the resistance of the medium inﬂuences root growth and the

    humidity in these substances is very high. A good alternative

    is hydroponics, in which the root is growing inside a nutrient

    solution (Tocquin et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2011; Le Marié

    et al., 2014; Mathieu et al., 2015). Hydroponics is also used in

    greenhouse culture, making it highly relevant for crop selection.

    This system also eases harvesting roots for diﬀerent purposes

    and measuring exudates of roots. However, roots develop very

    diﬀerently, because resistance is lacking and humidity and

    nutrients are dispersed homogeneously. In addition, a good

    supply of oxygen is essential to prevent oxidative stress. A third

    alternative which is also very promising for automated imaging

    is aeroponics (Zobel et al., 1976; Ritter et al., 2001). In this

    system roots are grown in water-saturated air created by for

    example spraying with water and nutrients. This system lacks

    any material to grow in, which eases imaging. However, without

    much resistance, roots grow very vast and can have problems

    extending their root system to the sides against gravity. Last,

    root systems can be grown inside soil, which is of course most

    realistic for ﬁeld crops and many greenhouse crops. However,

    non-destructive imaging inside soil asks for imaging methods

    that reach further than a simple camera. Several groups have

    recently reported the use of X-ray and MRI scans to image

    roots inside the soil (Mooney et al., 2012; Mairhofer et al.,

    2013; Metzner et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Although these

    methods are more expensive, they oﬀer great opportunities for

    automated imaging. An alternative method is GLO-Roots, based

    on luminescence genes expressed inside roots (Rellán-Álvarez

    et al., 2015). This system visualizes the root system through a

    thin layer of soil. For fundamental research labs, this is more

    feasible and also oﬀers the opportunities to image the expression

    of certain genes in the root system. For root breeding, this is less

    interesting, because the plants are genetically modiﬁed and grown

    in 2D systems.

    As more methods come available to study the root system

    and also methods are developed suitable for high-throughput

    screening of root systems, the need for good root image analysis

    software is growing. A wide range of root image analysis software

    exists (as reviewed in Lobet et al., 2013; Spalding and Miller,

    2013; Kuijken et al., 2015). These tools range from automated

    to non-automated. For a limited amount of data, non-automated

    software prevents mistakes and gives the user a lot of freedom.

    However, the analysis is very time consuming and is therefore

    not suited for large datasets. Automated software can analyze

    a large dataset rapidly, but especially in complex root systems

    the analysis is limited to global data such as rooting depth and

    width. In semi-automated software, such as SmartRoot (Lobet

    et al., 2011) and EZ-rhizo (Armengaud et al., 2009), the level of

    user interactions is greater to ensure a lesser degree of analysis

    errors. Again, this will be more time consuming for larger root

    systems. In addition, when observing very large root systems, it

    is even hard to separate roots by eye. Therefore, the development

    of improved methods of root image analysis has high priority for

    the ﬁeld.

    Above described methods are all suited for 2D images of

    root systems. When simplifying root growth to a 2D system,

    spatial orientation of roots gets lost. Therefore, new methods

    such as growing roots in gel cylinders (Iyer-Pascuzzi et al., 2010)

    and using X-ray to image through soil will oﬀer sophisticated

    opportunities to grow and image roots in 3D (as reviewed

    in Piñeros et al., 2016). Although only limited options for

    reconstructing and analyzing 3D images are currently available,

    it might eventually be easier to analyze 3D than 2D images,

    because overlapping and clumping together of roots will be

    much less common. Developing a good automated imaging

    analysis set-up of root systems can oﬀer great advancements in

    crop selection and would be an entirely feasible investment for

    breeding companies.

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    Challenge 2: Dealing with the Complexity

    of Interacting Stresses

    Although the complexity of the combination of diﬀerent biotic

    and abiotic stresses is not restricted to the root system, it does

    make selecting on RSA more challenging. The described RSA

    responses are mostly known for single stresses and some of the

    responses are very contrasting. A good example for this is that in

    drought-tolerant cultivars with a deep-rooting water-conserving

    phenotype, less root mass is available to forage for phosphorous

    at shallow depths (Lynch and Wojciechowski, 2015). Certain

    stresses tend to occur together often and therefore it might

    be useful to further investigate the speciﬁc RSA response to

    these conditions. A good example is salt stress and phosphate

    starvation, as phosphate ions tend to precipitate in saline soils

    and become unavailable to plants (Naidu and Rengasamy, 1993;

    Grattan and Grieve, 1998). Both stresses have contrasting eﬀects

    on several RSA traits and the inhibiting eﬀect of salt on

    lateral root development might even further limit phosphate

    uptake. Crucial in crop breeding aimed to optimize RSA is the

    availability of variation and plasticity in RSA, as observed among

    Arabidopsis accessions (Mouchel et al., 2004; Rosas et al., 2013;

    Ristova and Busch, 2014), related tomato species (Ron et al.,

    2013) and wheat varieties (Pound et al., 2013). Recently, Kawa

    et al. (2016) studied the natural variation in the response of

    330 Arabidopsis accessions to the combination of salinity and

    phosphate starvation. In general, responses to salt stress were

    favored and especially lateral root growth was strongly inhibited.

    However, not all accessions showed the same response and this

    natural variation was associated with 13 genetic candidate loci for

    integrating the plants’ response to combined stress (Kawa et al.,

    2016). For many crops, however, the natural variation in RSA

    is currently still underexploited. Moreover, we need to advance

    our understanding of the adaptive value of genetically determined

    diﬀerences in RSA on the level of crop performance, marketable

    yield and fruit quality in targeted root environments and growth

    conditions.

    Because the complexity of experiments and screenings

    increases with every additional variable, modeling can provide

    very useful tools to support research and breeding. A wide range

    of plant models on diﬀerent scales is available to the community.

    These models should now be integrated with a multiscale

    modeling approach (Band et al., 2012; Rellán-Álvarez et al., 2016)

    in which developmental processes, RSA, outside environmental

    factors and plant performance are connected. Current models,

    however, are often not easy to integrate. When developing

    a model, the general challenge is to make it comprehensive,

    widely applicable and simple. For models describing RSA, most

    are falling short in one of these requirements. Some are only

    applicable for a certain species or stage of life, which limits

    the use for crop systems. As soon as models tend to be more

    widely applicable or incorporate more conditions, they tend to

    become more complex and the number of parameters increases.

    This decreases the ease of interpretation and especially the ease

    of integration into a larger model (including soil and plant

    performance models). The last few years, a range of more simple

    models have been published. These models are often based on

    a few simple rules. For example, ArchiSimple bases root system

    development on the fact that the growth rate of a root depends

    on the thickness of the root (Pagès and Picon-Cochard, 2014;

    Pagés et al., 2014). By using a simple and widely applicable model,

    it will be possible to implement models of soil behavior and of

    plant productivity. Some of the root models have already been

    integrated with models for changes in the soil (as reviewed in

    Pedersen et al., 2010; Dunbabin et al., 2013; Van der Putten

    et al., 2013) and show to be very promising in predicting the

    responses of the root system. One example is the ROOTMAP

    model, which integrates soil-water-nutrient dynamics with root

    growth responses in a three dimensional system (Dunbabin et al.,

    2002). Simulations are based on a simple external supply/internal

    demand principle. The model has shown its use in simulating the

    eﬃciency of diﬀerent RSA types in both heterogeneous phosphate

    and nitrate supplies (Dunbabin et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2008).

    A good example of how such a model can provide valuable

    information is given by Chen et al. (2008), who show how the

    model can guide the eﬃcient placement of phosphorus fertilizer.

    In a similar way, this kind of model could guide in selecting a

    preferred RSA and potentially even predicting possibly involved

    processes.

    A model that integrates soil behavior, RSA and plant

    performance will oﬀer a lot of information to breeders. To

    conﬁrm whether a root system is advantageous under certain

    stresses as predicted by the model, RILS with contrasting root

    systems could be exploited (as illustrated in Liao et al., 2004;

    Zhu and Lynch, 2004; Zhu et al., 2005a). If indeed the predicted

    root system is advantageous, breeders could screen for this type

    of root system in a high throughput phenotyping system as

    described in the previous section. This screen can then be used

    for determining genes that are associated with this trait and

    can be used as targets for further selection. The model could

    also predict whether changing certain root system characteristics

    would negatively inﬂuence productivity. Of course, developing

    such a model is a major challenge still, but investments in

    developing a good model will be able to speed up crop selection

    and could model complex combinations of stresses.

    Challenge 3: Improving RSA without

    Compromising Yields

    Crop selection on aboveground traits has lead to high-yielding

    cultivars and crop selection for a certain RSA may come with

    costs. The root:shoot ratio is known to increase during almost

    every abiotic stress that has been discussed in this review. On

    the other hand, selection on RSA does not equal selection for a

    bigger root system. Our examples show shifts between diﬀerent

    root organs, rather than shifts in biomass partitioning between

    the shoot and the root. In this way, deeper rooting in rice, caused

    by expression of HDG11, confers drought tolerance without any

    yield penalty (Yu et al., 2013, 2016). However, unwanted side

    eﬀects of selection are not uncommon. An excellent tool to

    address this problem is to make use of grafting.

    Grafting is the process in which the root system (rootstock)

    of one plant is connected to the shoot (scion) of another (as

    reviewed in Warschefsky et al., 2016). This process naturally

    Koevoets et al.

    RSA Associated Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    occurs in some tree species (Mudge et al., 2009) and this

    phenomenon may have triggered the development of grafting

    in Asia where it is now used in agriculture for over 2000 years

    to improve plant production (Kubota et al., 2008). In woody

    perennial crops (Albacete et al., 2015; Warschefsky et al., 2016) as

    well as in annual vegetable crops (Schwarz et al., 2010; Albacete

    et al., 2015), the selection and breeding of suitable rootstocks

    oﬀers a powerful tool to sustain and expand the cultivation

    under suboptimal growth conditions (Gregory et al., 2013).

    Grafting has the advantage that not every cultivar needs RSA

    optimization separately, allowing improvement of rooting and

    (a)biotic stress tolerance of already existing elite cultivars. As

    such, grafting is considered as a surgical and fast alternative

    to breeding. Designing rootstocks for speciﬁc environments is

    becoming a feasible target to face future cultivation problems all

    around the world associated with global climate change (drought,

    salinization, occurrence of temperature extremes; Gregory et al.,

    2013). Important in this respect is to gain more knowledge of

    (i) the natural variation in RSA that exists within crops, and (ii)

    by what communication mechanisms the root(stock) modulates

    the shoot (scion) phenotype and performance, and visa versa

    (Warschefsky et al., 2016). In this way, grafting can rapidly

    advance our understanding of the adaptive value of diﬀerences

    in RSA on the level of shoot performance, marketable yield and

    fruit quality under targeted growth conditions.

    THE VALUE OF MODEL SPECIES

    A key aspect for engineering better performing crops via

    RSA optimization is improved understanding of the regulatory

    processes and underlying genetic components that regulate root

    growth. Root growth regulation, and its response to changing

    environmental conditions, is a highly complicated process that

    is controlled at many diﬀerent levels by complex actions of

    gene networks in both time and space. Advances in this area

    are merely derived from work in Arabidopsis (as reviewed in

    Wachsman et al., 2015; Slovak et al., 2016). It is expected

    that due to the increasing number of highly eﬃcient root

    phenotyping platforms, the use of GWAS for root traits, the

    increasing available functional genomics resources for roots, and

    the development of smart root model systems, much progress

    in our understanding of control mechanisms involved in root

    development will be achieved over the next 5–10 years.

    Although

    Arabidopsis

    is

    often

    studied

    under

    artiﬁcial

    conditions, it is these conditions that make it possible to

    investigate the partly discussed mechanistic and cellular base

    behind the observed RSA responses. For crop species only

    limited information on these processes is available. Interestingly,

    most plasticity in RSA responses overlaps between our model

    species and crops, even independent of diﬀerences between

    monocots and dicots. Sparsely investigated functionality of

    RSA in Arabidopsis supports the results found in crops and

    conversely sparsely investigated molecular insights in crops

    conﬁrmed results already established in Arabidopsis. Of course,

    not all mechanisms, responses and genes can be transferred from

    Arabidopsis to crops, but taken together the reviewed research,

    Arabidopsis proves to provide very valuable information for the

    development of crops able to withstand a wide range of abiotic

    stresses. This review stresses the importance of incorporating

    RSA into current crop selection, but we should not forget the

    wonderful tools we already have. Incorporating RSA into current

    crop selection also means incorporating Arabidopsis research

    into the current breeding pipeline, possibly even more then for

    aboveground traits.

    The participation of the general public in the research design, data collection
    and

    interpretation process together with scientists is often referred to as citizen
    science.

    While citizen science itself has existed since the start of scientiﬁc practice,
    developments

    in sensing technology, data processing and visualization, and communication of
    ideas

    and results, are creating a wide range of new opportunities for public participation
    in

    scientiﬁc research. This paper reviews the state of citizen science in a hydrological
    context

    and explores the potential of citizen science to complement more traditional ways
    of

    scientiﬁc data collection and knowledge generation for hydrological sciences and
    water

    resources management. Although hydrological data collection often involves advanced

    technology, the advent of robust, cheap, and low-maintenance sensing equipment

    provides unprecedented opportunities for data collection in a citizen science
    context.

    These data have a signiﬁcant potential to create new hydrological knowledge, especially

    in relation to the characterization of process heterogeneity, remote regions,
    and human

    impacts on the water cycle. However, the nature and quality of data collected
    in citizen

    science experiments is potentially very different from those of traditional monitoring

    networks. This poses challenges in terms of their processing, interpretation,
    and use,

    especially with regard to assimilation of traditional knowledge, the quantiﬁcation
    of

    uncertainties, and their role in decision support. It also requires care in designing
    citizen

    science projects such that the generated data complement optimally other available

    knowledge. Lastly, using 4 case studies from remote mountain regions we reﬂect
    on the

    challenges and opportunities in the integration of hydrologically-oriented citizen
    science

    in water resources management, the role of scientiﬁc knowledge in the decision-making

    process, and the potential contestation to established community institutions
    posed by

    co-generation of new knowledge.

    Keywords: citizen science, hydrological sensing, co-generation of knowledge, water
    resources management,

    poly-centric governance

    1. INTRODUCTION

    Citizen science refers to the participation of the general pub-

    lic (i.e., non-scientists) in the generation of new scientiﬁc

    knowledge. A large variety of approaches exist, ranging from

    community-based data collection, to soliciting contributions,

    to carrying out various scientiﬁc tasks with the help of large

    groups of people through use of the internet (i.e., crowd-sourcing,

    Dickinson et al., 2012).

    New developments in sensing technology (e.g., Hart and

    Martinez, 2006), data processing and analysis, and knowledge

    EARTH SCIENCE

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    communication are opening new pathways for citizen science.

    Inexpensive yet robust sensors now can allow amateurs to collect

    large volumes of data and document them with appropriate meta-

    data such as location and time. Information and communication

    technologies (ICT) facilitate the ﬂow of data and knowledge, both

    for uploading collected data to centralized databases, and for

    querying datasets using rich and tailor-made interfaces. Lastly,

    communication technologies such as cellular networks and the

    internet also can allow for a much more dynamic and interactive

    approach to the formulation of hypotheses, research design, data

    analysis, and knowledge generation.

    The provision of water resources is one of the most fundamen-

    tal ecosystem services for humanity. Hydrological science under-

    pins most decision-making on water resources and is the basis

    for assessing risks related to water such as ﬂoods and droughts.

    But despite its critical societal relevance, this area of science is

    characterized by an acute scarcity of data in both the spatial and

    temporal domains (e.g., Hannah et al., 2011), which contrasts sig-

    niﬁcantly with the heterogeneity and complexity of actual water

    management and governing processes. As such, it is pertinent to

    reﬂect upon the potential role that citizen science could play in

    the generation of new knowledge in relation to the water cycle

    and related ecosystem services, and the use of citizen science in

    decision-making.

    This paper therefore aims to provide a critical review of the

    available literature on citizen science in a context of hydrology,

    water resources, and wider ecosystem services management, and

    to seek and develop a new perspective on the major challenges

    and opportunities that may lie ahead. Section 2 explores the phi-

    losophy and motivations behind the citizen science approach.

    Section 3 reviews existing citizen science applications in hydrol-

    ogy and water resources sciences. This is followed by an overview

    of some of the major challenges and opportunities for citizen

    science for ecosystem services management and sustainable devel-

    opment (Section 4). Lastly, in Section 5, we illustrate the discussed

    concepts by means of four case studies from remote mountain

    regions in Peru, Ethiopia, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan, with different

    levels of citizen science activities and interests. In these regions,

    environmental pressures on ecosystem services are particularly

    acute and a lack of information on physical processes hinders

    the generation of relevant knowledge for adaptation. As a result,

    there may be a strong potential for citizen science to complement

    classic scientiﬁc knowledge generation and bring beneﬁt to local

    stakeholders.

    2. THE CONCEPT OF CITIZEN SCIENCE

    2.1. DEFINITIONS

    Citizen science is not an entirely new concept, but it is becom-

    ing increasingly popular in natural science research (Silvertown,

    2009). In broader terms, public involvement in science has

    also been referred to as civic science (Irwin, 1995; Kruger and

    Shannon, 2000), community science (Carr, 2004), and more

    recently, public participation in scientiﬁc research (Bonney et al.,

    2009; Shirk et al., 2012). The philosophy is also afﬁliated to

    concepts such as community-based monitoring (Whitelaw et al.,

    2003; Fry, 2011), community-based management (Keough and

    Blahna, 2006), and crowd-sourced data collection (Lowry and

    Fienen, 2013). What separates citizen science from less collabora-

    tive forms of public participation in scientiﬁc research is the ele-

    ment of an “active” engagement (Wiggins and Crowston, 2011, p.

    1); it is an approach whereby non-scientists are actively involved,

    to differing degrees, in the generation of new scientiﬁc knowledge,

    from which they also actively stand to beneﬁt either intrinsically

    (e.g., increased scientiﬁc literacy) or extrinsically (e.g., increased

    social capital).

    Citizen participation in science is a cross-cutting concept that

    has emerged from and across many disciplines. As a method-

    ology, it has been promoted for interdisciplinary research as it

    automatically fosters collective reﬂection (Wechsler, 2014). In

    the social development context, public participation as a strat-

    egy for achieving good governance and human rights has been

    embedded into mainstream discourse for decades (Gaventa and

    Barrett, 2012). Political economists also promote democratiza-

    tion of information to encourage debates and improve policy-

    making (Ostrom, 1990; Macknick and Enders, 2012). Recent

    developments in information science (e.g., remote-sensing, open-

    source software tools, cloud computing) have been central to

    the emergence of citizen science in ecology and biogeography

    (Silvertown, 2009; Dickinson et al., 2012), where citizen science is

    also prominently applied [e.g., Fernandez-Gimenez and Ballard,

    2008; Danielsen et al., 2009; Blossom, 2012; Stevens et al., 2013;

    Open Air Laboratories (OPAL), 2014; Paul et al., 2014]. In hydrol-

    ogy, the adoption has been relatively limited but is rapidly gaining

    momentum (see Section 3).

    2.2. MOTIVATION FOR ENGAGING IN CITIZEN SCIENCE

    Citizen science scholarship highlights the importance of citizen

    science in facilitating a better representation of local experiences

    and priorities. A strong motivation for the citizens i.e., the vol-

    unteers therefore is the scope that citizen science can offer for

    them to be part of the scientiﬁc process, and ultimately have a

    much broader role in decision making as part of a bottom-up,

    participatory process.

    This debate on citizen science is a long standing one, and

    its roots can be traced back to the growing mistrust of citizens

    about positivist science, especially in the aftermath of catastrophic

    failures of risk regulation (Freudenburg, 2003). For example, in

    the 1970s at Love Canal, at Three Mile Island, and at Wolburn,

    Massachusetts (to name a few prominent cases) citizens con-

    ducted their own “science” assessments to better understand the

    risks associated with their own exposure to toxics, in response to

    the discovery of toxic waste presence (Levine, 1982; Brown and

    Mikkelsen, 1990). Through a process that Brown (1992) coined as

    “popular epidemiology,” they exercised their own political power

    in science communication, and used their own scientiﬁc assess-

    ments to challenge expert opinion. An important outcome of this

    was that citizens involved in these assessments were able to assert

    their authority as knowledge brokers and to become more cen-

    trally involved in the planning of decisions that concerned the

    area where they lived and worked. The appropriate technology

    movement and approaches to participatory technology devel-

    opment that became popular in the 1970s also reached similar

    conclusions, highlighting the importance of citizens in the choice,

    design and delivery of technological development.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    Citizen science often emerges at the interface of political

    activism and volunteering. While on the outward they may

    come off as a hobby, motivational aspects are often complex.

    Volunteers’ involvement may be self-initiated as driven by an

    environmental concern, as well as scientiﬁc curiosity and a sense

    of fulﬁllment for being part of ﬁnding answers (Cohn, 2008).

    On the other hand, members of a community whose livelihood

    depends on their local environment (e.g., subsistence farmers in

    developing countries) may also seek scientiﬁc knowledge to form

    a better understanding of their environment, and further use this

    to gain political leverage in their community (Overdevest and

    Orr, 2004).

    Another strong motivational aspect of citizen science, but

    perhaps currently more from the professional scientists’ point

    of view, is about showcasing diversity, such as in terms of the

    ecologies as well as practices that people depend upon to sus-

    tain their livelihoods. In mountainous socio-ecological systems,

    which form the basis of the case study examples represented later

    in this article, the diversity of interactions between social and

    ecological changes vary signiﬁcantly not only across regions but

    also across communities. The case of Kyrgyzstan (Section 5.4)

    shows for example how communities are trying to adapt to,

    as well as comprehend, the change brought about in the after-

    math of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the particular

    economic and social restructuring process that subsequently fol-

    lowed. In the Nepalese context (Section 5.3), we see increas-

    ing interest by the citizens themselves to understand better the

    complexity of their own environments. In the light of this, it

    requires advocating that a stronger citizen involvement in infor-

    mation sharing and collection may ultimately lead to greater

    preparedness against abrupt change, and can potentially pro-

    vide an additional buffer for dealing with those shocks and

    stresses that are likely to be brought about as climate change

    and variability becomes exacerbated. Living with uncertainty

    and change therefore also presents new opportunities for citi-

    zens to become key actors in knowledge co-generation processes,

    actively contributing toward comprehending “fuzzy” science are-

    nas (i.e., climate change and hydrology) that are at present not

    just scientiﬁcally contestable, but at least to some extent unknown

    (Stirling et al., 2007).

    On the other hand, professional scientists and donors are

    also driven by a number of motives. Apart from purely scien-

    tiﬁc interest in the data collected and self-advancement, they

    may also be humanistic-altruistically motivated, for example in

    scientiﬁc outreach and education, promoting conservation, and

    improving societal conditions (Macknick and Enders, 2012).

    However, in spite of any goodwill on the side of the profession-

    als, volunteer motivations are highly dynamic, changing over time

    even if collective project goals remain constant (Rotman et al.,

    2012). Therefore, Rotman et al. (2012) suggests that particu-

    lar attention should be paid to ﬁrst contact between a citizen

    and the professionals, and also in the ﬁnal stage when volun-

    teers decide whether they will contribute to other initiatives.

    Interview studies in USA, Costa Rica and India found that moti-

    vations not only changed with time, but were also inﬂuenced

    by complex cultural and institutional settings. Speciﬁcally, Costa

    Rican projects beneﬁted from a national culture of environmental

    awareness and social responsibility, together with shallow hier-

    archical structures that encouraged regular mentoring and the

    building of trust between scientists and citizens (Rotman et al.,

    2014a). For citizen science projects to achieve sustained volun-

    teer participation, communication pathways between scientists,

    citizen scientists and non-participating community members

    need to be carefully considered. Attention needs to be paid to

    the clarity of training and the delivery of feedback throughout

    the project (Rotman et al., 2014a). If volunteers feel patron-

    ized or perceive that they are undervalued by professionals, the

    projects are likely to suffer from high attrition rates. This is

    likely to be of particular signiﬁcance in cultures where science

    and society are clearly demarcated (e.g., India, Rotman et al.,

    2014b).

    Research into collective intelligence suggests that bringing

    people together from diverse backgrounds promotes innovative

    thinking (Woolley et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is an oppor-

    tunity in the design of citizen science projects by means of

    citizen involvement to affect outcomes (Shirk et al., 2012) e.g.,

    the type of knowledge generated and the beneﬁts to be gained

    from it. Involvement of volunteers from multiple segments of a

    community can result in an improved relationship between dif-

    ferent institutional actors (Ridder and Pahl-Wostl, 2005), and

    this improves the prospects of future joint actions (e.g., con-

    tinued monitoring, planning and implementation of adaptation

    programs). However, the opposite outcome is equally probable—

    conﬂicts may arise from failures in communication or goals (a

    case in point is the Ethiopian case described in Section 5.2).

    Indeed, citizen science questions the classical divide between “sci-

    ence” as the knowledge producing process, and the “users of that

    knowledge,” such as communities who might want to partici-

    pate in “science” for educational purposes or to inform their

    actions/arguments with “true knowledge.” Instead, citizen sci-

    ence suggests a process of co-generation of knowledge, with a

    possible decentering of the central and key role of the scientiﬁc

    process in the knowledge production process. The complexity of

    social-ecological systems, their degree of inherent uncertainty and

    partially unpredictable interactions, may require a more interac-

    tive view on knowledge encounters and joint knowledge produc-

    tion in particular, in view of the creation of a sufﬁciently shared

    knowledge base to motivate adequately coordinated and coher-

    ent social action in poly-centric governance of ecosystem services

    (i.e., an evolving, emergent outcome of interactions between mul-

    tiple sources of governance in state, market or civic realms and

    at different scales of action, Ostrom and Cox, 2010). We begin

    to see traces of this polycentricity and the centrality of knowl-

    edge in ensuring its sustenance when we explore the intricate

    knowledge sharing mechanisms that have begun to form ties

    between upstream and downstream water user communities in

    the Peruvian case (Section 5.1). But inevitably this brings in inter-

    ests and power in terms of whose reality will prevail to support

    actions.

    2.3. LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT

    The broad range of citizen science activities yields different classi-

    ﬁcations or spectrum of models. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology

    initially proposed a continuum of research models, based on

    www.frontiersin.org

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 3

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    the extent of citizen-scientist collaboration across each stage

    of the scientiﬁc process. This included the scientiﬁc consulting

    research model, participatory action model, and representing

    the most inclusive approach, the adaptive citizen science model

    which adopts a central platform for an interactive feedback

    mechanism (Cooper et al., 2007). Bonney et al. (2009) later pro-

    posed three models: contributory, collaborative, and co-created

    projects. Shirk et al. (2012) sub-divides projects even further with

    additional contractual and collegial models at either end of the

    public involvement spectrum. There is a high parallelism to the

    Extreme Citizen Science (ExCiteS) framework, which separates

    them into crowd-sourcing, distributed intelligence, participatory

    science, and extreme citizen science (Seymour and Regalado,

    2014). Such schemes may be drawing inspiration from the debate

    about participation in development, e.g., Pretty’s (1995) typol-

    ogy of participation: with control over the process running from

    full external control to dialogue and full internal control. From

    a monitoring perspective, Danielsen et al. (2009) identiﬁed ﬁve

    types of protocols based on the relative involvement of citizens

    and scientists in design, data collection, interpretation and utiliza-

    tion. Wiggins and Crowston (2011) developed ﬁve (i.e., Action,

    Conservation, Investigation, Virtual and Education) citizen sci-

    ence typologies by focusing more on the organizational and

    macrostructural elements of project design and implementation.

    In all, the different models essentially describe the same contin-

    uum of engagement as well as the beneﬁt obtained by the public

    volunteers from the scientiﬁc research. There is more emphasis

    on building social capital (by training) and local adaptive capac-

    ity at the extreme end of this spectrum where the objective of

    public engagement is to improve transparency and accountabil-

    ity, and to encourage discourse, learning, and collective action

    between multiple stakeholders (da Silva Wells et al., 2013). This is

    complementary to the tendency now to move away from merely

    capitalizing on volunteers as a low-cost workforce but to involve

    them in the intellectual aspects of the science (Lakshminarayanan,

    2007; Conrad and Hilchey, 2010).

    3. CITIZEN SCIENCE IN HYDROLOGY AND WATER

    RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

    Given the advanced technology needed for monitoring many

    aspects of the water cycle, hydrology is not an evident sci-

    entiﬁc discipline for the application of citizen science. But

    the development of more robust, cheaper and lower mainte-

    nance sensing equipment creates new opportunities for data

    collection in a citizen science context. At the same time, the

    importance of water resources for human development, and

    the threats that emerge from environmental change, fresh-

    water contamination, population growth and other stressors

    (Milly et al., 2008; Hipsey and Arheimer, 2014; IPCC, 2014)

    highlight the need for novel approaches to both the gener-

    ation of new knowledge about the water cycle, as well as

    new insights as to how this knowledge can be used in water

    resources management that supports sustainable development.

    The next sections review existing citizen science applications and

    opportunities brought by new technology in hydrology, before

    exploring their relevance for water resources management in

    Section 4.

    3.1. LITERATURE REVIEW

    Table 1 summarizes our review of documented citizen science

    projects in hydrology and water resources. From this list, we draw

    several inferences. Firstly, the scope is rather limited to water

    quality monitoring, possibly due to the relative ease of conduct-

    ing measurements of water quality parameters and therefore also

    coordinating these activities at large scale that include training

    and distribution/sale of measurement kits. Secondly, there is a

    clear geographic bias, with activities primarily occurring in devel-

    oped countries. There are more than 1800 programs in the United

    States alone (Volunteer Water Quality Monitoring, 2014). These

    observations are not inconsistent with citizen science applications

    which are more advanced in other ﬁelds such as ecology and bio-

    geography. Thirdly, in all the reviewed cases except one, the level

    of involvement by non-scientists are limited to data gathering.

    This clearly represents only a small subset of the levels of engage-

    ment reviewed in Section 2.3. As a result, the full potential for

    problem-identiﬁcation, data co-creation, and a joint analysis and

    co-generation of actionable knowledge (fully explored in Section

    4) is not realized.

    3.2. PROBLEM DEFINITION, PROJECT DESIGN, AND EXPERIMENTAL

    SCIENCE

    One explanation for the limited depth of engagement by non-

    scientists as revealed in Section 3.1 may be the geographical

    bias toward wealthy regions, instead of in areas where socio-

    ecological problems have more serious consequences (Halkay, M.,

    2011). Indeed, especially in cases that aim for sustainable devel-

    opment and poverty alleviation, such as those presented further

    in this paper, there is a clear need for a more bottom-up, inclu-

    sive approach to the identiﬁcation of most pressing concerns for

    action, problem deﬁnition and project design (Srinivasan et al.,

    2013). The social objective of citizen science projects in wealthy

    regions more often is to increase awareness and scientiﬁc literacy,

    as opposed to developing regions where the goals are more related

    to enhancement of community well-being such as poverty allevi-

    ation (Gura, 2013). Such deﬁnition of objectives and priorities

    necessarily results from political and social processes of con-

    structing management narratives within speciﬁc frameworks or

    “epistemic communities,” consisting of “experts sharing a belief

    in a common set of cause-and-effect relationships as well as com-

    mon values to which policies governing these relationships will

    be applied” (Haas, 1989, p. 384). These processes in their turn will

    have an impact on data collection and knowledge generation, e.g.,

    the variables that will be monitored and the points of data collec-

    tion. As a result, it is important that the citizen science process

    takes explicitly into account these multi-stakeholder processes of

    constructing the problems and frameworks, rather than a belief

    in an “objective” or “neutral” scientist-initiated approach. The

    application of citizen science in a water resources management

    context is clearly in its infancy in this regard, and in need of the

    adaptation of existing and the development of new frameworks to

    move from a technocratic-expert view on decision-making sup-

    port toward a joint creation-knowledge exchange model. This is

    further discussed in Section 4.1.

    A second potential reason for the hitherto limited uptake

    of citizen science in water related sciences is the difﬁculty of

    conducting experiments. In experimental science, system vari-

    ables are manipulated and the resulting outcome is observed

    to improve the understanding of processes and cause - effect

    relations. Such experiments are promising in a citizen science

    context given the direct link between cause and effect and thus

    their potential educational value. However, in hydrology and

    water resources controlled experiments are difﬁcult and often

    risky to set up, not only because of the large variety of uncon-

    trolled boundary conditions (e.g., land use change, climate con-

    ditions), but also because of the potentially wide-ranging and

    irreversible effects of perturbations to the water cycle. Yet exam-

    ples exist. Section 5.2 discusses the implementation and success of

    a small-scale experimental approach to assess the effectiveness of

    restoration strategies in the Ethiopian uplands. In the Peruvian

    case (Section 5.1), such a controlled approach is not possible,

    and therefore a comparative analysis of land-cover types is used

    as a proxy (sometimes also known as a “trading-space-for-time

    approach” Singh et al., 2011). However, in other cases simulation

    experiments will be the only alternative to experiments (Beven

    et al., 2012, Section 3.5)

    3.3. MONITORING, DATA COLLECTION

    Hydrological data collection typically relies on technologically

    complex and expensive measurements. Additionally, because of

    the large temporal variability of the water cycle, hydrological data

    analysis requires repeated measurements such as long time series

    of hydrological states and ﬂuxes (e.g., precipitation, discharge).

    Classic hydrometric practice has often been conﬁned to the pro-

    fessional environment and tailored to the speciﬁc needs of ofﬁcial

    monitoring networks (Herschy, 2009). This contrasts with a cit-

    izen science approach to data collection, which may require the

    compromise of data quality due to the use of different equipment,

    less frequent sampling, and less trained workforce, and which

    may be ephemeral in nature (Cohn, 2008; Devictor et al., 2010).

    The design of the monitoring may need to be technically sim-

    pliﬁed, and the procedure uniﬁed, so consistent samples can be

    generated; additionally, inferences need to be made from a larger

    volume of potentially lower quality data, which requires a differ-

    ent approach to data analysis (Cohn, 2008). At the same time,

    new technological developments also provide new opportunities

    for citizen science based monitoring (Table 2).

    3.3.1. Precipitation

    The simple design and affordability of rain gauges makes them

    particularly suited for application outside the traditional mon-

    itoring environment. Electronic sensors such as tipping bucket

    switches allow for convenient automatization. Yet, rain gauge

    measurements are very sensitive to the local aerodynamic con-

    ditions (World Meteorological Organization, 1994), and non-

    standard locations or varying local conditions (e.g., undergrowth,

    vegetation blockage), thus affecting the quality and interpretabil-

    ity of measurements. Hence, in a citizen science context, it will be

    crucial to document properly the local setting of the rain gauge

    and to apply and/or develop robust quality control protocols. New

    sensor technologies have the potential to make precipitation mea-

    surements more affordable and less prone to errors. For instance,

    disdrometers are increasingly used in precipitation monitoring,

    and are both cheap and robust in their measurements (e.g.,

    Löfﬂer-Mang and Joss, 2000). Other, more experimental methods

    for precipitation measurements, such as cellular communication

    interference (Overeem et al., 2013), are under development and

    may eventually provide new possibilities for citizen involvement.

    3.3.2. Streamﬂow

    Streamﬂow measurements are complex by nature, because most

    methods are based on indirect measurements such as ﬂow veloc-

    ity, cross sectional area and/or river stage, which are subsequently

    converted into volumetric ﬂux (Herschy, 2009). Traditional water

    level monitoring is complex and requires extensive maintenance,

    and is further complicated by property laws, regulations and

    other legal issues. Nevertheless, cases of successful measurement

    of river level and ﬂow in a citizen science context exist, such as

    the Peruvian case (Section 5.1). At the same time, new meth-

    ods are emerging that are more compatible with citizen science

    approaches. For example, camera-based water level measure-

    ments have been shown to have a good relative agreement (within

    16%) with a traditional installation (Royem et al., 2012). These

    can be further improved by combination with emerging remote

    sensing methods, such as high-resolution digital elevation and

    Citizen participation in water quality monitoring is often lim-

    ited to the collection of data in the form of water samples, basic

    hydrochemical parameters, or other indicators (e.g., macroinver-

    tebrates) because of the specialized knowledge and/or equipment

    needed for more advanced analysis (Overdevest and Orr, 2004).

    Benchmarking studies of the accuracy of the data collected by

    citizen scientists have reported differing outcomes (Au et al.,

    2000; Nicholson et al., 2002; Canﬁeld et al., 2002; Shelton, 2013).

    Nevertheless, new sensing technologies open up perspectives for a

    wider range of data collection. Aquatic sensors increasingly incor-

    porate water quality related measurements such as temperature,

    dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity/salinity, pressure, redox

    potential, and pH, so there is already opportunities to automate

    the data collection for continuous sampling. An example of this

    under development is the WaterBot system that includes a Sensor

    that continuously measures temperature conductivity, a Gateway

    that relays this information using wiﬁ to a central data server,

    and a Wiewer that enables real-time observation (CREATE Lab,

    Carnergie Mellon University, 2014).

    3.3.4. Soil moisture

    Soil moisture measurements are increasingly automated, e.g.,

    by using time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors and related

    technology. Automated measurements are typically still less accu-

    rate for estimating actual volumes, and may suffer from speciﬁc

    technical limitations related to the range of soil conditions for

    which the sensor is useful operationally, such as variable appar-

    ent permittivity, and frozen soils. Yet, the measurements can

    be useful to capture moisture ﬂuctuations in the ground after

    precipitation events. The increasing affordability and robustness

    of the technology also allows for a broadening array of temporary

    and continuous uses, especially in an agricultural context, e.g.,

    irrigation.

    3.3.5. Vegetation dynamics

    In a hydrological context, vegetation dynamics are important for

    their impact on the distribution of hydrological ﬂuxes includ-

    ing interception of precipitation, canopy evaporation and surface

    runoff generation. Some of these ﬂuxes can be measured with

    above mentioned technologies such as rain gauges and soil mois-

    ture sensors. But the spatial interpolation of these processes, for

    instance in hydrological models, still relies on a limited num-

    ber of highly generalized vegetation parameterization (e.g., Clark

    et al., 2011). While remotely sensed methods for vegetation char-

    acterization are improving rapidly, there remains a need for ﬁeld

    veriﬁcation of vegetation types, spatiotemporal dynamics of veg-

    etation change, and aspects of ecosystem system stability, which

    cannot be observed through remote sensing. The use of acces-

    sible technologies such as geotagged photography may provide

    opportunities for stronger involvement of non-experts in data

    generation and local evaluation of remotely sensed products. Such

    data may even be sourced from public repositories of photographs

    if adequate metadata (e.g., location, time) are available.

    3.3.6. Water use

    While the abovementioned methods focus on the measurement

    of ﬂuxes that determine water availability, sustainable water

    resources management is often as much hindered by a lack of

    a proper characterization of water demand. Therefore, quantiﬁ-

    cation of abstraction volumes and other types of water use may

    play a crucial role in the optimization of water resource man-

    agement. Technology exists for the direct (e.g., water meters) or

    indirect (e.g., canal level) measurement of such ﬂuxes. The advent

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    of smart sensors allows for such measurements to be distributed

    and integrated in more complex analysis systems. However, con-

    ﬂicts, misuse, and data tampering may emerge if the role of water

    use data for example, in water allocation, becomes too direct.

    3.4. DATA TRANSMISSION AND PROCESSING

    Most hydrological measurements have a low temporal frequency

    (e.g., hourly rainfall, daily streamﬂow measurement) which facil-

    itates automatic transmission using internet or mobile phone

    connections. Even in remote regions such as mountains, mobile

    phone coverage is increasingly common. For instance, statis-

    tics of the (International Telecommunication Union, 2014) show

    that mobile phone penetration in countries such as the Kyrgyz

    Republic amounts to 92%. Even when mobile phone networks

    are not equipped for internet access, data transmission via daily

    text messages is a viable option. Telephone coverage in Nepal, a

    less developed country with extreme topographical variations, has

    crossed 70% of the population covering the whole country, out of

    which around 11% have access to internet. But low education lev-

    els and unavailability of data transmission in local language have

    limited its use in rural areas.

    As sensors become increasingly automated and easy-to-use,

    standards are emerging for interfaces that plug into a variety of

    devices such as mobile phones and home networks. Web-based

    services make it easy to connect devices and products with appli-

    cations to provide real-time control and data storage (Williams

    et al., 2011; Vitolo et al., in press). Data exchange standards such

    as the OGC Sensor Observation Service (e.g., Williams et al.,

    2011) and related assimilation methods facilitate the integration

    of data from citizen science with other data sources and process

    them in near-real time.

    Data robustness can be evaluated by comparing across sam-

    ples (Cohn, 2008), and it is possible for this quality-assurance

    procedure to be fully integrated in the real-time data collection.

    For explicit treatment of uncertainties, benchmarking studies of

    citizen science against conventional technologies/strategies could

    be completed before data collection commences, and examples of

    these are as discussed above in Section 3.3.

    Assimilation of uncertain data in hydrological simulation

    models is a well developed and active research ﬁeld (Beven, 2009).

    Yet, hydrological models still typically require speciﬁc, high-

    quality and long-term time series for calibration and validation,

    which may not be compatible with the distributed, temporary,

    and potentially lower-quality nature of citizen-science generated

    data. The integration of citizen science data with traditional data

    sources through interpolation or other merging techniques to cre-

    ate combined datasets may be one approach to solve this issue.

    For instance, methods to merge rain gauge data with satellite

    imagery to generate gridded precipitation products are well devel-

    oped (e.g., Shefﬁeld et al., 2006) and may highlight the value of

    short duration ground based measurements to locally calibrate

    large scale products.

    As for the calibration of hydrological models, Seibert and

    Beven (2009), among others, highlight the value of short-

    duration discharge time series for the calibration of hydrological

    models. Distributed measurements, even of short duration, may

    also be particularly useful for regionalization of hydrological

    models (Vandewiele and Elias, 1995; Parajka et al., 2005; Buytaert

    and Beven, 2009). Lastly, multi-objective calibration methods can

    address the issue of heterogeneous data availability of river basin

    modeling (e.g., Vaché et al., 2004; Parajka et al., 2007).

    For hydrological models to be incorporated in decision sup-

    port systems, modeling systems will need to represent the

    decision-making processes. Common methods include multi-

    agent system modeling, agent based modeling, and coupled

    human-environment system modeling (Gunkel, 2005; Srinivasan

    et al., 2013), among many others (e.g., Harrison et al., 2007;

    Matrosov et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). One particular value

    of this modeling approach for participatory data collection is

    in the integration of uncertainties, the treatment of incomplete

    data (Uusitalo, 2007), and the continuous updating of the model

    parameters with the incoming stream of data (Castelletti and

    Soncini-Sessa, 2007a).

    3.5. COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS, SCENARIO BUILDING, AND

    PARTICIPATORY MODELING

    Citizen science participation in data collection is probably the

    more straightforward type of engagement. A more fundamen-

    tal way to enhance citizens’ participation to the science pro-

    duction process is through joint analysis of the obtained data,

    which requires platforms for visualization and communication

    of results, joint scenario and hypothesis formulation, as well as

    data processing and hypothesis testing. Many relevant concepts

    and technologies have recently been developed in the context

    of science-supported decision support mechanisms (e.g., Olsson

    and Andersson, 2007; McIntosh et al., 2011).

    Visualization and communication ensures that scientiﬁc con-

    tent is comprehensible for the layperson, so that citizen scientists

    can directly gain from participation, which will also incentivise

    them for further engagement. This process is facilitated by the

    increasing availability of web-based technologies, which allow for

    rich, easy to update graphics potentially embedded in tailored

    applications and user experiences intended for a non-technical

    audience (so-called infographics, Spiegelhalter et al., 2011). Such

    systems improve communication outside the scientiﬁc discipline.

    Their interactive nature allows for feedback, commenting and

    rebuttal. The most immersive and interactive of such applications

    are sometimes referred to as Environmental Virtual Observatories

    (Beven et al., 2012; Buytaert et al., 2012), referring to the com-

    bined use of observed and virtually enhanced environmental data.

    But given the potentially very different nature and quality of

    citizen-science generated data, novel methods for data quality

    control, assimilation, and simulation will need to be developed.

    A major challenge in such applications is the communication

    of indirect observations and modeling results (e.g., interpolation

    and simulations), including their assumptions and uncertainties

    (Olsson and Andersson, 2007; Beven et al., 2012).

    Such virtual platforms also often provide a convenient and

    engaging platform for facilitating scenario building and hypoth-

    esis formulation, for instance as a graphical support for classic

    participatory scenario building (Andersson et al., 2008; Faysse

    et al., 2012). More advanced virtual approaches to scenario build-

    ing are simulation games (Le Bars and Grusse, 2008). An example

    of such approach is the Spatial Information Exploration and

    Frontiers in Earth Science | Hydrosphere

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 8

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    Visualization Environment (SIEVE, O’Connor et al., 2005), which

    employs a gaming engine for 3D visualization of geospatial data,

    which can be both raw (e.g., digital terrain) and modeling output.

    Their work focused on the visual communication, for example,

    by introducing a switch option between environments that are

    tailored toward experts vs. non-expert (“multiskilled environ-

    ment”). This approach assumes that a layperson connects better

    to the information that is visualized using textures (“realistic”)

    instead of symbols (“abstract”). Additionally, the environment

    allows for multi-way interaction via a chat window. This again

    enables joint-testing of new hypothesis (i.e., co-creation of new

    knowledge), even if the modeling is done ofﬂine by the only by

    the expert, who returns to report the outcomes of the experiment.

    A similar early experiment utilized the virtual environment

    of the local landscape projected in 3D on a large screen for an

    immersive experience (Stock and Bishop, 2005). Here, a group

    of people in the same physical location interact with this vir-

    tual environment using a handheld computer device, voting on

    different scenarios and varying degrees of land use changes that

    are more aligned with their local experience. The impact on

    water volumes and quality as associated with each land cover

    change as modeled by simple GIS-based models is also displayed.

    This system allows the simultaneous incorporation of traditional

    knowledge from multiple non-scientists and is a useful method

    to ﬁnding a point of agreement between the experts and non-

    experts in terms of the most relevant hypotheses (in the form of

    scenarios) to test.

    Yet, the most immersive collaboration between scientists and

    non-scientists is through joint data analysis aiming at hypothesis

    testing and knowledge generation. The most common approach

    to this is the use of participatory modeling (Castelletti and

    Soncini-Sessa, 2007b; Olsson and Andersson, 2007). In this pro-

    cess, actors from different backgrounds jointly construct a model

    of the system under study. The purpose of this process is often

    direct decision-making, but may extend to social learning (Hare,

    2011). In the latter case, models are used to facilitate sharing

    perspectives and to clarify arguments.

    Bayesian belief networks are often suggested as tools for

    participatory modeling, e.g., in the groundwater application of

    Henriksen et al. (2012). In this modeling approach, a system

    network is constructed that link various biophysical processes

    to environmental outcomes, and various decision scenarios can

    be explored to predict impact to the outcomes. Advantages of

    Bayesian networks include their conceptual simplicity, graphi-

    cal support, friendly semantics, and possibility for interaction

    among different actors (Castelletti and Soncini-Sessa, 2007a;

    Henriksen et al., 2007). The development of a Bayesian net-

    work representation of the system under study, either ofﬂine

    or online, may help in structuring the thinking process, iden-

    tifying causal relations, integrating different knowledge bases,

    and making assumptions and limitations of datasets and models

    more transparent (Henriksen et al., 2007; Olsson and Andersson,

    2007). Nevertheless, setting up successful participatory moni-

    toring activities requires not only strong buy-in from relevant

    stakeholders, the process itself is time-consuming and relies upon

    a high level of leadership and interpersonal skills (Henriksen et al.,

    2007).

    4. NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE USE

    OF CITIZEN SCIENCE IN SUSTAINABLE WATER

    RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

    If citizen science aims to be effective in producing positive effects

    on the governance of natural resources such as water, it needs

    to relate to the myriad of actors whose actions interact with

    the hydrological processes and who play a role in the explicit

    or implicit governance of the resources. Since the governance of

    natural resources in general, and water in particular, is inher-

    ently multi-scalar and polycentric (Ostrom and Cox, 2010), we

    cannot sufﬁce with a too simple technocratic model, where the

    “objective” expert-scientist (making use of citizens to co-generate

    data for the scientiﬁc models) provides the “real knowledge” to

    users-decision-makers. The relationships between “knowledge,”

    “scientiﬁc knowledge,” “decision-making,” and “actions” should

    be conceptualized differently, and more in line with ideas of

    polycentric, multi-scalar governance in complex social-ecological

    system (Ostrom and Cox, 2010).

    The concept of citizen science with the term “citizen” and

    its political connotations, suggests a political—as opposed to

    a technical-neutral—dimension, and it requires a decentering

    and different articulation of the scientiﬁc knowledge process

    within the broader social process of co-creation of sufﬁciently

    shared “actionable knowledge” that becomes the basis of changed

    “actions” within the management of resources. It is crucial to

    think about this process in terms of “knowledge encounters,” or

    even “battleﬁelds of knowledge,” where different bodies of knowl-

    edge and meaning, are vying with each other to make sense of

    complex reality, and strive to occupy a prominent place in the

    multi-scalar, poly-centric decision-making about the actions that

    affect livelihoods (also to be understood beyond a mere mate-

    rial content as sense-making for a “life one has reason to value”)

    and the use of the resources such as water about which sci-

    ence makes a knowledge contribution in interaction with the

    stakeholders. Of course, different from certain scientists, peo-

    ple are not hydrologists; they are not only interested in water,

    even when it might be of crucial importance to them. This also

    implies that the ideas and institutions that, respectively, inspire

    and guide the actions of people are usually not specialized, nor

    focused on particular issues. The inevitably reductionist approach

    of most scientiﬁc analysis, however, requires a focus on particular

    resources, and therefore also tends to look for, or contributes to

    the creation of specialized institutions for the governance of that

    particular resource. In practice, much of the relevant actions of

    citizens are however not inspired and determined by such specif-

    ically crafted institutions, but rather the outcome of a process

    of “bricolage” (Cleaver, 2002), an interactive encounter of exist-

    ing (multi-purpose) institutions (i.e., contributing to make sense

    of the life of people and not just of water or another ecosys-

    tem service) in which sensible ideas, rules and practices can

    -interactively- become incorporated in the received wisdom of

    existing societies (Hall et al., 2014).

    4.1. TOWARD A MODEL FOR JOINT KNOWLEDGE CREATION AND

    EXCHANGE

    The space for most productive collaboration is where citizens’

    and scientists’ questions overlap and where the mutual beneﬁt of

    www.frontiersin.org

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 9

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    actors can be optimized. Citizen’s questions can be quite different

    from those of professional scientists. Even in such conditions, citi-

    zen science projects may be successful if mutual beneﬁts outweigh

    the compromise of adjusting research questions to the interests

    of the other parties. From a professional scientist perspective,

    immediate beneﬁts will often consist of help with data collection

    and analysis with the aim of creating general knowledge, while

    for the involved citizens, immediate beneﬁts may result from the

    relevance of the gathered data for local issues.

    However, as argued above, citizen science may open perspec-

    tives for a more fundamental model of mutual beneﬁt, which

    relies on joint knowledge creation and exchange. Especially in

    the context of ecosystem services management, multiple forms

    of local or situated knowledge exist within rural communi-

    ties. These include traditional knowledge, i.e., intergenerational

    understanding of ecosystems and beliefs that condition ecosys-

    tem services (Berkes, 1993), as well as more recent situated

    understandings of ecosystem services and associated management

    practices (Robertson and McGee, 2003) and personal insights

    derived from individual experience (Fazey et al., 2006). Such

    local knowledge contrasts with more formalized scientiﬁc knowl-

    edge on ecosystem services, often generated by external agencies

    (including extension agencies, rural experts and researchers) and

    based on hypothesis building and testing. Connecting these dif-

    ferent forms of knowledge goes beyond the recording of data

    and requires sustained interaction between citizens and scientists

    such that scientiﬁc and local knowledge systems can enrich each

    other.

    Research on ecosystem services management conﬁrms the

    beneﬁts of knowledge exchange and knowledge co-generation,

    both within remote rural communities and between commu-

    nities and external agencies (Cundill and Fabricius, 2009).

    These include the production of hybrid (local/science), user-

    oriented knowledge, potentially enabling more efﬁcient and effec-

    tive resource use in remote rural areas (Berkes, 2009); greater

    community involvement within marginalized groups, leading

    to enhanced social capital (Cundill and Fabricius, 2010) and

    resilience (Lebel et al., 2010); and improved trust and reci-

    procity between external agencies and rural communities (Jodha,

    2005). Overall, several potential beneﬁts emerge from establish-

    ing forms of knowledge co-generation. The most direct outcome

    may be a better management and beneﬁt extraction from ecosys-

    tem services. Secondly, new knowledge can improve access of

    marginalized and excluded groups to ecosystem services. Lastly,

    the process of co-generating knowledge affords greater participa-

    tion by marginalized groups in the development of community-

    wide strategies and plans to access ecosystem services.

    The potential of citizen science to achieve such objective is

    strongly related to the nature of social action and governance of

    natural resources. The real world governance of natural resources

    is an evolving, emergent outcome of interactions between multi-

    ple sources of governance in state, market or civic realms and at

    different scales of action (Ostrom and Cox, 2010). Policy-oriented

    scientiﬁc activity in general, and the citizen science mode in par-

    ticular, cannot escape and will therefore need to engage actively

    in these interaction, which generate actionable knowledge in and

    for multiple arenas.

    Citizen science that aims to promote democratic inclusion of

    poorer groups in society can select problems that are primor-

    dially raised and framed by the concerns of these priority groups.

    Scientiﬁc knowledge (and scientiﬁc activity) about these prob-

    lems can then not only increase evidence-based understanding

    of these particular concerns, but also contribute to enhanced

    legitimacy of these issues within the local political arenas and con-

    tribute to balancing unequal power relations without being too

    optimistic or naïve about the possibilities to achieve substantial

    results. The link of the participative scientiﬁc activity with crit-

    ical concerns and explicit or implicit struggles in local political

    arenas will be an important source of motivation for local peo-

    ple to participate in the scientiﬁc knowledge generation process.

    We elaborate on some of the preconditions for this process in the

    following sections.

    4.2. LEGITIMACY OF THE GENERATED KNOWLEDGE

    If citizen science generated knowledge is to be used to sup-

    port decision-making, it is important to ensure that there is a

    strong foundation of trust and legitimacy among the involved

    actors, and to be attentive toward how those become effectively

    ascribed to different bodies of knowledge. This also implies a need

    to focus explicitly on discursive struggles within local decision-

    making arenas, as the construction of evidence-based “expert

    knowledge” can quickly become decontextualized inputs for the

    generation of certain policies and institutional logics molded by

    local power geographies (e.g., Büscher, 2012). Often in water

    resources related bureaucracies of the developing world (i.e.,

    where decision-making around hydrology, water resource man-

    agement and technology development tends to take place almost

    exclusively by scientists), it may be difﬁcult for citizen science

    accounts to feed into decision-making – that is, even when that

    knowledge is being collected through an institutionalized process

    (Birkenholtz, 2008; Mollinga, 2009). This is partly because it may

    not adhere to the same evaluation and validation criteria that

    scientiﬁc hydrological knowledge needs to adhere to or because

    of misalignment and contestation between what citizen knowl-

    edge is proposing and what is being proposed by the scientiﬁc

    knowledge in question (Fischer, 1993; Dunn et al., 2008).

    This apparent tension between classic scientiﬁc knowledge and

    citizen science highlights that questions around how knowledge

    is created and represented within a socio-institutional context

    are at least as important as the design and practice of collecting

    citizen-based evidence in the ﬁrst place. This issue of knowl-

    edge representation and legitimacy can be complex, for example,

    when citizen accounts rest primarily on tacit or experience-based

    accounts of context speciﬁc concerns. While this paper is focused

    more on the useful inputs of citizen science in hydrology, as

    opposed to processes of contestation and legitimacy per se, we

    recognize that in addition to questions about the characteristics

    of the citizen knowledge itself, we also have to ask how we can

    ensure that this kind of knowledge is likely to feed into demo-

    cratic institutional structures and has an equally meaningful and

    durable impact on deliberative decision-making processes, given

    that we also recognize that knowledge is political. In low-income

    countries where citizen based information may open opportu-

    nities for achieving a range of ecosystem service safeguards and

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    poverty alleviation outcomes, raising this question is particularly

    pertinent (Daw et al., 2011).

    4.3. IMPROVING CITIZEN ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING

    Citizen science’s democratic nature may promote a more equi-

    table form of decision-making by giving citizens more infor-

    mation about natural resources and allowing for meaningful

    contributions to discussions and policy-making (Bulkeley and

    Mol, 2003). The use of collective intelligence to refashion more

    traditional scientiﬁc practices can push the boundaries for under-

    standing and inventiveness using the ideas from a larger set of

    people, thus promoting inclusiveness (Seymour and Regalado,

    2014). However, in practice, inclusion may still be biased as vol-

    unteers in citizen science projects tend to be people who are

    interested in and committed to closer engagement with speciﬁc

    projects, or forms of scientiﬁc enquiry (Cohn, 2008). It may also

    appear that the outcome of participatory workshops, for exam-

    ple, are democratic, consensual conclusions by all participants,

    whereas in practice they often mainly represent the dominant

    mainstream views that are allowed to surface into the public

    arenas, thus transforming “participation” into a tyranny of the

    dominant and the mainstream. Similarly, although new technolo-

    gies can attract a large sector of the society, the exclusion of the

    remaining sector who are averse to them or lack the competency

    to learn them is not fully preventable (Newman et al., 2012).

    Thus, a signiﬁcant amount of outreach efforts is required to reach

    out to the segments of society for whom the project can have the

    most life-affecting outcomes.

    Furthermore, in a context of sustainable development, almost

    by deﬁnition (Bastiaensen et al., 2005), the poorer people will

    have difﬁculty to voice their concerns and even more to articu-

    late them to (scientiﬁc) outsiders. So more often than otherwise,

    we therefore expect that participative citizen science will address

    more mainstream concerns of the local majority, or even of small

    dominant local elites. But in view of the post-research application

    of scientiﬁc ﬁndings, this usually has the advantage to facilitate

    rallying more and more relevant local support to implement rec-

    ommendations through social action, while evidently risking to

    bypass critical concerns of disadvantaged groups and even to con-

    tribute to the deepening of their dispossession and exclusion. This

    constitutes a tricky, but often unavoidable dilemma in the imple-

    mentation of citizen science, and requires a careful analysis of

    the social interface between the citizen science practices and the

    learning and struggle in local political arenas. By no means, how-

    ever, does this dilemma reduce the potential contribution that

    science and citizen science can make to local bricolage toward

    better governance.

    4.4. FEEDBACK LOOPS IN THE UPTAKE OF CITIZEN SCIENCE BASED

    KNOWLEDGE IN DECISION-MAKING

    Being locally relevant and legitimate is a precondition for citizen

    science-based knowledge to be useful for decision-making. But

    to ensure knowledge uptake, the link between citizen science and

    decision-making needs to be clear and transparent. This link can

    be understood in terms of feedback loops at different levels, and is

    probably most promising when it is multi-functional across these

    different levels. At the individual level, an immediate feedback

    loop depends on the relevance and usefulness of the informa-

    tion collected by the citizen scientist for his or her individual

    decision-making. This depends also on technical possibilities or

    design features such that the individual citizen scientist can actu-

    ally read out, understand and record the information rather than

    just passing on unaccessible or unintelligible bits. Another feed-

    back loop is possible at the level of collective decision-making, be

    that national, regional or local, e.g., when a water user association

    relies on information collected by one or some of its members to

    take decisions about the distribution of irrigation water. Lastly, yet

    another feedback loop is possible when scientists are involved in a

    process of knowledge co-generation, where they combine locally

    collected data by citizen scientists with other existing datasets to

    add value to that information, and make the results accessible for

    individual and collective decision-making arenas.

    4.5. FOSTERING LONG-TERM CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT

    Involving citizens from the start has the potential to enhance

    the prospects that the knowledge generated will be locally rel-

    evant of its long-term sustainability, especially if the setup is

    interweaved within existing institutional structures and if the

    connection to local societal beneﬁt exists (Danielsen et al., 2005).

    An ideal outcome would be that the most underprivileged sec-

    tions of the community have a sense of ownership over the

    system being collaboratively set up and can attune it toward

    answering questions that concerns them. For this to be real-

    ized in practice however, each knowledge and valuation system

    would need to be understood as legitimate in its own right, even

    when citizen- and science-based knowledges are pursued sepa-

    rately (Tengö et al., 2014). In pluralizing knowledge systems for

    water resource management, one must also remain attentive to

    the power relationships which inﬂuence cooperation and learning

    between disparate knowledge systems (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2007).

    Toward this end, it is fundamental to acknowledge that there will

    always be power issues when connecting different branches of sci-

    ence with citizen-derived knowledge (Agrawal and Gibson, 1999;

    Keeley and Scoones, 2000; Karpouzoglou and Zimmer, 2011).

    Thus, despite existing opportunities in hydrology for identifying

    areas of complementarity between different knowledge systems,

    it is essential to remain attentive to the fact that there are always

    aspects of each knowledge system that cannot be fully trans-

    lated into each other, partly because of the different approaches

    that exist (within disciplines and across different knowledge sys-

    tems) to generate, validate or award legitimacy to knowledge

    (Schweizer, 1998; Martinez-Alier, 2014).

    A different kind of institutional support is necessary to fos-

    ter the kind of dialogue across different knowledge perspectives.

    This may imply, for instance, that research funding includes sup-

    port for the development of strong interpersonal connections in

    more open knowledge arenas (Cornell et al., 2013). Without these

    connections any efforts to address the important perspectives of

    citizens are likely to appear piecemeal or biased by the established

    scientiﬁc disciplines and “epistemic communities,” and institu-

    tional norms toward the validation of knowledge in research

    programmes.

    In practice however, a more pragmatic approach may be

    needed. For instance, experience from the Tana Lake case study

    www.frontiersin.org

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    (Section 5.2) learns that unlike citizen science in developed coun-

    tries where volunteering is a pastime activity, in developing coun-

    tries, the citizen observers very often derive their income from

    their engagement. The concept of volunteering and sending data

    to a central point is not very well established, and it may be

    necessary to employ people at local wages, to incentivise partic-

    ipants while the value of their participation in and the outcome

    of the monitoring activity are still uncertain to them. However,

    one must be aware of the danger of “motivation crowding-out,”

    i.e., the fact that monetary or in-kind payments (i.e., extrin-

    sic motivation) for “socially-expected behavior” can crowd out

    more intrinsic behavior (originally treated in more psychology-

    related and economics literature; e.g., Frey, 1997) and future

    social motivations.

    5. CASE STUDIES

    In this last section, we present 4 geographically dispersed case

    studies with either active citizen science initiatives or local inter-

    est in setting up such activities. They serve as an illustration

    to the viability and relevance of the concepts reviewed above.

    The cases are located in remote mountain environments, which

    are typically environments that combine fragile and understud-

    ied natural systems with accelerated environmental change and

    vulnerable populations that are strongly reliant on ecosystem

    services. In such a context, it is pertinent to investigate the

    potential of more inclusive methods to generate knowledge on

    improved uses of ecosystem services that supports sustainable

    development and improves human well-being. The discussion

    focuses particularly on:

    • The motivation and level of engagement by the non-scientists,

    • The type of data monitored, and potential for participatory

    modeling and knowledge exchange,

    • The legitimacy of the generated knowledge,

    • The sustainability of the citizen science activity,

    • Potential uptake in decision making/resource governance.

    5.1. PERUVIAN ANDES

    Andean water resources are extremely variable in time and space.

    This is most notable on the Paciﬁc side of the Peruvian Andes,

    where annual rainfall varies from virtually no precipitation at

    sea level around the city of Piura (except for El Niño years),

    to 1500 mm at 3500 m altitude (Figure 1). Humid air masses

    originating from the Amazonian region pass the Huancabamba

    depression and penetrate a few tens of kilometers into the basins

    of the Chira and Piura rivers on the Paciﬁc slopes of the Andes.

    The water that drains to the Paciﬁc side of the Andes through

    Citizen science for hydrology

    this mechanism is of vital importance to small-scale as well as

    industrial-scale agriculture in the desert plains in several thou-

    sands hectares irrigation schemes such as San Lorenzo, Alto

    Piura and Bajo Piura. A new project of diverting a tributary of

    the Amazon, the Huancabamba river, through a trans-Andean

    tunnel, toward new desert lands, is currently under construction.

    Despite the economical importance of these irrigated lands

    and the crucial dependence on highland hydrology, attention for

    highland conservation was marginal until recently and knowledge

    of the highlands hydrology, including basic parameters such as

    rainfall input is very limited. However, in the Quiroz river sub-

    catchment, local stakeholders have now established a common

    platform to discuss beneﬁt sharing mechanisms in the catch-

    ment. These stakeholders include upstream subsistence farmers,

    downstream agrobusinesses and smaller farmers depending on

    irrigated agriculture in the desert, water authorities, and regional

    environmental authorities. This platform is in urgent need of rele-

    vant information that can feed into discussions and negotiations.

    Key information needs are current surface water availability and

    its spatiotemporal variability, as well as the potential impact of

    changing land uses in the upper catchment. The case is one of sev-

    eral that are accompanied by the “Incubator of Mechanisms for

    Retribution for Ecosystem Services,” an initiative of the Ministry

    of Environment of Peru.

    As a result of these drivers, the highlands of Piura have

    pioneered in citizen science-based hydrological monitoring led

    by a regional NGO (Consortium for Sustainable Development

    of the Andean Ecoregion, CONDESAN). The initiative for

    Hydrological Monitoring of Andean Ecosystems (iMHEA in

    Spanish, CONDESAN, 2014), was established in 2009 (Célleri

    et al., 2010). The network focuses on pairwise catchment

    monitoring to identify the hydrological impacts of land-use

    change, and the beneﬁts of restoration activities. At present,

    it consists of 20 catchments in the tropical Andes (Venezuela

    to Bolivia), including 5 catchments in the Piura highlands

    (Figure 2). Monitored variables are rainfall and streamﬂow,

    in some sites complemented with meteorological variables to

    of the iMHEA monitoring network in the Peruvian Andes.

    calculate reference evapotranspiration. Field monitoring is per-

    formed by non-specialist/non-researcher staff, but regular capac-

    ity strengthening events are organized by a coordinating NGO

    with support from regional and international scientists. In the

    case of the Rio Quiroz catchment, the monitoring is operated

    by an NGO, which acts as facilitator for the discussion platform,

    in close collaboration with the upland municipalities that are

    interested in quantifying the water they are “offering.”

    The case is a clear example of a bottom-up initiative emerg-

    ing from a local awareness about the need for better information

    on ecosystem services, and facilitated by the availability of cheap

    and robust technology (electronic rain gauges and water level

    sensors). As such, it has obvious potential to inﬂuence negotia-

    tion processes and decision-making in the catchment. This con-

    trasts with information that originates in the standard national

    hydrometeorological network operated by the national hydrome-

    teorological ofﬁce (SENAMHI), which does not reach the remote

    upland areas that are key for water supply, but is also not focused

    on the speciﬁcity of the water yield and regulation of speciﬁc

    ecosystems and land use regimes. Additionally, local actors ﬁnd

    difﬁcult to access and expensive.

    While the long-term sustainability of the initiative is difﬁcult

    to assess given its short time span, the local buy-in provides it

    with a stronger legacy compared to traditional, external sources

    of information. Identiﬁed bottlenecks toward increased uptake of

    the generated information include the need for data processing,

    quality control, visualization and the development of modeling

    systems for scenario analysis and prediction.

    5.2. LAKE TANA BASIN, ETHIOPIA

    Livelihood security in the rural area around Lake Tana, Ethiopia

    is strongly dependent on local ecosystem services generated from

    the land and the land cover. Rapid population increase has led

    to rapid land use and land cover change (Moges et al., 2014),

    and current management of the land providing ecosystem ser-

    vices such as food, feed, and fuel for the current generation is

    unsustainable. The increase in cultivated land, combined with

    traditional practices such as plowing land continuously and along

    the slopes, causes land degradation including hardpan forma-

    tion and a decreasing soil depth. The degrading resources in turn

    hamper the ability of the land to provide further essential ecosys-

    tem services such as groundwater recharge and carbon ﬁxation.

    To minimize such degradation, and to maintain the produc-

    tive capacity of the land, various natural resources management

    options have been developed by the central government and

    implemented locally under governmental directive. These prac-

    tices are usually ineffective in increasing short term and long term

    beneﬁts, and in some cases these practices accelerated the decrease

    in poverty alleviating ecosystem services.

    A main problem is the disconnect between the governmental

    or donor recommended practices and what farmers are will-

    ing to maintain voluntarily without governmental interventions.

    For instance, government agencies recommend the installation of

    60 cm deep and 30–40 cm wide swales on the contour to intercept

    excess rainfall and to allow it inﬁltrate into the subsoil. In contrast,

    the indigenous soil conservation practice is to plow small 10–

    15 cm furrows just off the contour to transport the excess rainfall,

    which ponds temporarily over slowly permeable layer. This mini-

    mizes erosion by preventing long rills going down the slope. This

    dichotomy in practices, and the resulting lack of local buy-in,

    often results in poorly implemented land-management practices

    that increase erosion and land degradation (Mitiku et al., 2006)

    despite the fact that upland and gully erosion in the watersheds

    are well understood (Tebebu et al., 2010). Another large source of

    erosion are gullies that form in the periodically saturated lower

    lands. Rehabilitation of these gullies has not been very successful

    in the past, mainly because there is little experience and farmers

    have not been involved.

    Nevertheless, a citizen science experiment in the upper Birr

    catchment has shown promise in addressing this issue that fails to

    be addressed at a governmental level (Ayele et al., 2014, Figure 3).

    The study initiated local collaboration, by ﬁrst discussing with

    the religious leaders and local respected elders, and later with

    local village farmers about some ideas for restoring gullies. The

    religious leaders, local elders and farmers were originally skep-

    tical and hesitant, as they believed these gullies were created by

    God as a punishment for their wrongdoings. Only after they

    were shown photos of other rehabilitated gullies and two farmers

    were brought to visit a rehabilitated gully, that an agreement was

    reached for them to start a trial on one location. Twenty farmers

    of the community and surrounding farmers agreed to contribute

    labor and wood to fence for the protection of the gully and share

    equally the produced grass at the end of the rainy season. They

    also set a ﬁnancial punishment for anyone who allowed their

    animal into the enclosed gully. Following this agreement, a meet-

    ing was organized with the local community, religious leaders,

    administrators, extension workers, and the village expert to share

    responsibilities. Nevertheless, the process was not always smooth.

    Grass grew well in the gully after closure during the rainy season,

    but then a conﬂict emerged when the 20 farmers whose land sur-

    rounded the gully refused to share the resulting beneﬁts, i.e., the

    grass produced on the protected area. The conﬂict was resolved

    by the elders in the village by having the 20 farmers apologize and

    FIGURE 3 | Discussing ecosystem degradation resulting from farmers

    whose land surrounding the rehabilitated gully being unwilling to

    share the grass in the Tana Lake Region, Ethiopia.

    sign a promissory note to contribute labor and wood in the next

    program to rehabilitate on the second village’s gully (Figure 3).

    Clearly the success of this program was due to capitalizing on

    the informal decision process. Although the formal decision mak-

    ing process is strongly centralized following the decision from

    regional and federal administrators, an informal decision mak-

    ing process exists in parallel, and is centered around the the elders

    and clergymen whose authority is very well respected. Therefore,

    any new knowledge generated within the community, particularly

    with the key community representatives such as local elders and

    religious leaders, can be easily received if channeled by/through

    these ﬁgures. One could also argue that the farmers’ willingness

    to participate is the conviction, due to the trust in their elders,

    that there is something for them to gain.

    A key element in this process is the reconciliation of views

    rather than falsication of a particular view. Gully creation is the

    result of a combination of human activities and natural causes

    such as soil instabilities (i.e., external factors). Elders explain the

    external factors from a religious perspective but both perspec-

    tives acknowledge that part of the erosive process is inevitable,

    yet that impacts should be minimized. To achieve this, the reli-

    gious leaders preached to the community on Sunday that God

    sends a messenger (the researcher) to give a solution. As a result,

    they requested the community to give help to the researcher for

    rehabilitating gully.

    The case illustrates that a collaborative engagement in a citizen

    science experiment is achievable in the context of an Ethiopian

    farmers community, and how citizen-science generated results

    can have on dynamics of ecosystem management and beneﬁt.

    Tailoring the design to local decision-making processes improved

    the relevance and legitimacy of the results, and thus their assimi-

    lation. At the same time, it shows the potential risks and pitfalls of

    altering local balances of resource use. Lastly, despite the straight-

    forward experimental design, the use of educational material such

    as photos helped in setting up the experiment and creating local

    buy-in.

    5.3. UPPER KALIGANDAKI BASIN, NEPAL

    The Upper Kaligandaki basin is located in the Mustang district

    of the Trans-Himalayan region of Nepal, bordering the Tibet

    Autonomous Region of China to the northeast. The Mustang

    district has a population of around 15,600 inhabitants, and a lit-

    eracy rate of 57%. It is the the driest region of Nepal, with an

    annual precipitation under 200 mm/year. The local communities

    are mostly agro-pastoralists, cultivating barley, wheat, potato and

    buckwheat in isolated areas close to the river, and raising yak,

    sheep, and goat.

    Traditionally, water resources were exclusively used for irrigat-

    ing croplands (through canals) and managed by cooperative man-

    agement practices among local communities (Messerschmidt,

    1986). More recently, there are competing demands from

    domestic use, hydropower generation and cultural signiﬁcance

    (National Trust for Nature Conservation, 2008). Furthermore,

    there is an increasing water stress due to changes in snow-

    fall and rainfall. The available water resource became highly

    contested resource among individuals, communities and social

    groups (National Trust for Nature Conservation, 2008). To adapt

    with the changing environment, they have developed sophis-

    ticated methods of crop cultivation and water harvesting that

    allows them to cope and sustain their livelihoods (often with little

    or limited government inﬂuence, Chapagain and Bhusal, 2013).

    For example,

    two adjacent

    communities,

    Phalyak and

    Dhakarjong, used to share a common stream by dividing total

    ﬂow into parts, using a wooden trunk with equal opening spaces

    placed in the stream bed (Figure 4). This was in practice for

    several decades but also created disputes and misunderstandings

    among communities. According to a senior community member

    (aged 88 years), the problems were: (i) small debris often blocked

    or altered the ﬂow at respective openings, (ii) some community

    members deliberately changed the water ﬂow manually to get

    more water into their side, and (iii) the wooden structures were

    usually difﬁcult to ﬁx at the stream bed and continued washed

    away by occasional ﬂash ﬂoods. This pushed local people to ﬁnd a

    better sharing mechanism, and the stream is now diverted in days

    turn—3 days for Phalyak and 2 days for Dhakarjong. This sharing

    practice seems more sustainable as it is operating smoothly.

    Despite a high level of creativity in their response to change,

    there remain concerns being voiced by farmers about the direc-

    tion of future trajectories of change. The ﬁrst phase of research

    in Mustang has explored for example aspects of farmer per-

    ceived climate change. In this context, farmers have referred to

    signiﬁcant changes in local hydrological processes including dis-

    appearances of small lakes and water reservoirs, as well as changes

    in glacier composition. Farmers further recognize the long term

    implications of changing climate dynamics for their livelihoods

    and potential risks that these may present for their agricultural

    based economies. Perhaps because of this we perceive great inter-

    est by the farmers themselves to work together with natural and

    social scientists to develop a better sense of their surrounding and

    and the impact of emerging socio-economic and environmental

    drivers upon their livelihoods. There are indications that this can

    only work as a two-way dialogue and knowledge co-generation

    process between scientists and local communities. Insights into

    local experiences can furthermore facilitate the formulation of

    a more contextually speciﬁc understanding of change on the

    basis of a more balanced representation of citizen and expert

    knowledge.

    In recognition of the data scarcity and high uncertainties, there

    is evidence of policy making acknowledging the fact that new

    understanding and potential solutions can be achieved through

    wider public participation. One example is the involvement of

    volunteers in the collection of hydrological and meteorological

    data since the establishment of hydrological and meteorological

    services in Nepal. Although the volunteers receive a monthly wage

    from the Nepalese Hydrology and Meteorology Ofﬁce, it is very

    small (the price of a cup of tea) and do not form a part of income

    contribution.

    Little is known about the precise mechanisms that motivate

    volunteers to contribute to data collection, though it is clear

    that complex range of factors are involved. This may include for

    example a sense of national pride, since these volunteers per-

    ceive that they are helping the Nepalese meteorological authorities

    to collect basic data. Recently, the successful implementation of

    community-based ﬂood warning system on the West Rapti, Babai,

    and Karnali Rivers in Nepal has also demonstrated that there is an

    ample scope of saving lives and properties in an inexpensive man-

    ner if the government organizations work with non-government

    organizations, and communities (Practical Action, 2008/2009).

    Thus, citizen science approaches (or people’s participation) in

    water resources monitoring/management could become a useful

    alternative to address many challenging issues for water resource

    management practices in a high mountainous region of Nepal.

    5.4. NARYN REGION, KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

    The Naryn region in Kyrgyzstan covers a remote mountainous

    watershed in the Central Tien Shan range in Central Asia. While

    for many centuries this area was inhabited mainly by Kyrgyz

    herders following traditional resource use patterns, in the Soviet

    era collectivized state farms were established. As these farms were

    specialized in livestock production, all arable land was used for the

    production of fodder crops to feed a variety of livestock, mainly

    sheep, goats, and cattle. Within the collective farms, specialized

    employees were given instruction by educated pasture, cropland

    and water management specialists from academic institutions,

    and supported with well-equipped infrastructure to monitor cli-

    mate, river runoff and pasture land conditions. However, despite

    training and equipment, since the 1980s Soviet scientists reported

    increasing pasture degradation attributed mainly to overuse of the

    natural resources (Kerven et al., 2012).

    As aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan

    faced another restructuring process, with consequent major polit-

    ical and societal upheavals. Moving from a planned economy to a

    market-based economy through the 1990s, privatization and land

    reforms led to a signiﬁcant redistribution of assets such as crop-

    land, livestock and state farm equipment. Simultaneously there

    was a drastic increase in poverty following independence due

    to economic factors and changes in livelihoods (United Nation

    Development Programme, 2011/2012). Additionally, the majority

    of families became very dependent on subsistence farming, with

    livestock as the primary source of household income. This major

    socio-economic transition was accompanied by deterioration of

    the transport and irrigation networks and the environmental

    monitoring infrastructure, matched also by inadequate collabora-

    tion and data-sharing among institutions involved henceforth in

    more localized (decentralized) decision-making. This trend has

    continued to the present, however the patterns and drivers of

    degradation have changed over time. Ongoing climate change is

    Citizen science for hydrology

    further exacerbating the above challenges and is impacting nat-

    ural resources, leading to higher frequencies of natural disaster

    occurrence.

    From a perspective of water availability and management,

    the main challenges in Naryn include limited public investment,

    high inter-sectoral competition (e.g., hydropower vs. irrigation),

    scarcity due to shortage and waste, and increasing occurrence

    of upstream/downstream tensions. Regarding water shortage and

    related resource management, a dual strategic response is gen-

    erally adopted: increasing irrigation water availability with con-

    struction and rehabilitation of infrastructure, and strengthening

    and improving water governance institutions. Current develop-

    ment projects in the region mostly address the organization of

    water administration including the promotion and institutional

    development of water users associations (WUAs), improvement

    of water allocation mechanisms among farmers and between vil-

    lage WUAs, and the promotion of technical improvements for

    more efﬁcient water use.

    At present there is little opportunity or local capacity in

    rural areas of Naryn to monitor water resources. However, a

    participatory citizen science approach is promising for such a

    data scarce region – and could be used proﬁtably not only to

    ﬁll data and information gaps, but also to work collaboratively

    with pastoral communities to generate relevant management-

    oriented knowledge. The use of citizen science can help provide

    a mobilizing and empowering effect within the community if

    appropriate motivational factors are clearly identiﬁed. Through

    development of long-term partnerships and joint elaboration of

    key research questions or problems to address, both scientists

    and community members may value such collaborative work and

    together develop participatory processes to monitor water ﬂow

    and collect relevant environmental data, and to collaborate in

    data processing, analysis, knowledge generation, and transparent

    monitoring. Local motivation for participation in joint work is

    likely to include both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including

    both personal development and curiosity as well as an anticipa-

    tion of future economic advantages. Finding an inclusive research

    approach that reconciles traditional (“pre-Soviet”) and modern

    knowledge types presumably will be another signiﬁcant factor

    for the acceptance and successful application of citizen science in

    the top-down, “expert”-oriented decision-making legacy that still

    remains in Kyrgyzstan. Furthermore, the effective application of

    citizen science for knowledge generation is likely to depend on

    identifying and working alongside unique innovative individuals

    who are willing to consider and trial new collaborative manage-

    ment approaches. From a technical perspective, a variety of new

    mobile tools and instruments, e.g., for canal runoff measurements

    or precipitation monitoring, are now available at low cost and

    can easily be used even by inexperienced community partners or

    students from nearby colleges.

    There are, however, some challenges to the uptake of cit-

    izen science as a community-endorsed concept. Of particular

    importance is the persistence of a “Soviet mindset.” While citi-

    zen science has a potential to overcome entrenched legacies by

    empowering communities to engage in the creation and pro-

    duction of “their own” relevant knowledge, this participatory

    approach to science faces challenges due to many people in

    transitional post-Soviet contexts still tending to rely on external

    expertise rather than developing their own capacity. Some ben-

    eﬁciaries of the current social status quo – often former (Soviet

    era) elites – may also have an interest in preserving their sta-

    tus and privileges. Yet in the democratizing Republic there is

    generally a sustained growth of local people’s involvement in

    governing processes, even though sometimes there remain (or

    are increases in) asymmetric power relations that complicate the

    development of strong civil institutions and consensual decision

    making. Additionally, as a result of recent changes in national

    pasture legislation, there is a potential for increased village-level

    engagement in the development of pasture management plans.

    Individual herders thus have increasing opportunity to make their

    own natural resource management decisions, as well as to be rep-

    resented on village pasture management committees. Thus, in

    the context of recent socio-political development in the Kyrgyz

    Republic, despite some continuing legacy of Soviet times, there

    are clear opportunities for the emergence of citizen partnerships.

    As part of a UK-funded Ecosystem Services for Poverty

    Alleviation (ESPA) project, community meetings have now taken

    place over several months along with the collection of baseline

    information (e.g., regional maps, demographic datasets) for the

    research team to better understand the social-ecological system

    in Naryn. Through this process, several ecosystem services have

    been identiﬁed including the provision of grassland forage, fod-

    der, livestock products such as milk and wool, water for irrigation,

    water ﬂow regulation, soil erosion control, biodiversity and car-

    bon sequestration. All these ecosystem services beneﬁt or impact

    directly on pastoral livelihoods, and nearly all are related to the

    water cycle. From this perspective, the project team deems it to

    be a sensible hypothesis that the legitimacy of local knowledge

    will be increasingly recognized and its uptake into local decision-

    making will increase during the process of production of new

    local knowledge about water and related environmental variables

    with engaged community members. The process of identifying

    topics of common interest and speciﬁc questions deemed to be

    of local signiﬁcance is on-going.

    6. CONCLUSIONS AND CHALLENGES

    Despite being an intrinsic part of the scientiﬁc discovery and

    knowledge generation process, the concept and potential of cit-

    izen science in itself only recently received increasing scientiﬁc

    attention. New technological developments are supporting novel

    and more efﬁcient methods for data collection and process-

    ing, visualization and communication. These opportunities make

    reﬂecting upon the challenges and opportunities of citizen sci-

    ence, especially in a context of managing natural resources and

    leveraging them for human well-being, timely and relevant. This

    is particularly the case for water resources, which is often one

    of the most fundamental ecosystem services and a signiﬁcant

    bottleneck for sustainable development and poverty alleviation.

    Our review of technologies reveals a large potential for increasing

    involvement of citizens in data collection because of the availabil-

    ity of inexpensive, robust and highly automated sensors, and the

    possibility to combine them with powerful environmental models

    to create rich and interactive visualization methods. But in order

    to leverage citizen science for water resources management and

    Citizen science for hydrology

    poverty alleviation, we identify the following major research and

    implementation challenges.

    • Scientists’ perceptions: Although met with enthusiasm in some

    quarters, citizen science is still seen as a rather vague term in

    much of the scientiﬁc community. If value and validity of citi-

    zen science continues to be poorly communicated, such ambi-

    guity has the potential to damage the reputation of researchers,

    and ultimately, discourage innovation. We suggest that, whilst

    it is important to remain optimistic about the potential of citi-

    zen science, limitations need to be reﬂected by setting realistic

    goals that minimize disappointment if projects fail to deliver

    (Riesch and Potter, 2014).

    • Problem deﬁnition: Given the multi-level nature of decision-

    making and conﬂicting interests of managing scarce natural

    resources, there is a need to understand better how resource

    management issues can be deﬁned in a transparent and deliber-

    ative process that favors the inclusion of traditionally marginal-

    ized and resource-poor actors. Even participatory approaches

    have a tendency to introduce bias in the participation process,

    which can only to some extent be used to alleviate (and, if not

    applied properly, may reinforce) this bias.

    • Resource intensity: Despite the potential to distribute the

    effort among multiple actors, citizen science is human-resource

    intense, especially in the need for coordination among actors

    and the need for adequate training and education, and main-

    taining an acceptable level of participation in the project (Gura,

    2013).

    • Technology: While evolving quickly, the technology underpin-

    ning citizen science requires further scientiﬁc effort. Ensuring

    that technological applications are affordable, user friendly,

    reliable, compatible, and versatile will be vital for their uptake

    (Silvertown, 2009; Royem et al., 2012, among others). However,

    the selection of technology, if effective, would contribute to an

    empowerment of local communities to take charge and deliver

    for themselves some solutions to particular needs (Newman

    et al., 2010).

    • Communication and exchange of knowledge: Citizen science

    results need to be presented in a way that little to no tech-

    nical knowledge should be required to enable interpretation

    (Royem et al., 2012). A further consideration is that sharing

    data and opening up to a larger scientiﬁc audience of their

    local environment may cause some apprehension (Seymour

    and Regalado, 2014). Furthermore, communication of results

    needs to be done carefully to avoid making impressions that

    can potentially become a permanent misunderstanding.

    • Legitimacy and polycentric governance: Governance of natu-

    ral resources in general, and water in particular, is inherently

    multi-scalar and poly-centric (Ostrom and Cox, 2010). The

    citizen science concept clearly shows the deﬁciencies of the

    technocratic model of knowledge generation. Therefore, it is

    a useful environment to explore the political—as opposed to a

    technical-neutral—dimension. This requires a decentering and

    different articulation of the scientiﬁc knowledge process within

    the broader social process of co-creation of sufﬁciently shared

    actionable knowledge that becomes the basis of changed actions

    within the management of resources.

    \ of investments in the agricultural sector has increased by\n80%. The goal of\
    \ these investments is to achieve productivity growth of at least 70% by 2050\
    \ [1] to meet\nthe increased needs of the population of the Earth considering\
    \ the fact that the area under cultivation\nwill decrease. Emerging technologies\
    \ such as Internet of Things (IoT) can provide signiﬁcant potential\nin Precision\
    \ Agriculture and Smart Farming, enabling the long-term increase in productivity\
    \ [2].\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) paradigm offers a new perspective for precision\
    \ agriculture enabling the\nreal- time and site speciﬁc management of the cultivated\
    \ ﬁelds. In IoT-based Smart farming, a system\nis built for monitoring the crops\
    \ targeting in the automation of various important farming operations\nsuch as\
    \ monitoring of the growth, irrigation process, application of fertilizers, disease\
    \ detection, etc.\nIn this context, technologies such as IoT can assist in the\
    \ acquisition of real-time information from the\nagricultural ﬁelds. This information\
    \ can be timely processed and exploited to support critical decisions\nregarding\
    \ the management of the crops.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349; doi:10.3390/info10110349\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/information\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n2 of 26\nRemote sensing\
    \ is generally considered one of the most important technologies for Precision\n\
    Agriculture and Smart Farming. It is commonly used for monitoring cultivated ﬁelds,\
    \ providing\neffective solutions for Precision Agriculture in the last 35 years\
    \ [3]. Remote sensing can monitor many\ncrops and vegetation parameters through\
    \ images at various wavelengths. In the past, remote sensing\nwas often based\
    \ on satellite images [4,5] or images acquired by using manned aircraft in order\
    \ to\nmonitor vegetation status at speciﬁc growth stages. However, satellite imagery\
    \ is often not the best\noption because of the low spatial resolution of images\
    \ acquired and the restrictions of the temporal\nresolutions as satellites are\
    \ not always available to capture the necessary images. In addition, it is often\n\
    required to wait long periods between acquisition and reception of images. In\
    \ addition, environmental\nconditions, such as clouds, often hinder their reliable\
    \ use. Considering the use of manned aircrafts,\nusually it results in high costs,\
    \ and many times it is not possible to carry out multiple ﬂights to obtain\nmore\
    \ than a few crop images.\nThe development of UAV-based remote sensing systems\
    \ have taken remote sensing and Precision\nAgriculture (PA) one step further.\
    \ The use of UAVs to monitor crops offers great possibilities to acquire\nﬁeld\
    \ data in an easy, fast and cost-effective way compared to previous methods. UAV-based\
    \ IoT\ntechnology is considered as the future of remote sensing in Precision Agriculture.\
    \ UAVs’ ability to ﬂy\nat a low altitude results in ultra-high spatial resolution\
    \ images of the crops (i.e., a few centimeters).\nThis signiﬁcantly improves the\
    \ performance of the monitoring systems. Furthermore, UAV-based\nmonitoring systems\
    \ have high temporal resolution as they can be used at the user’s will. This enhances\n\
    the ﬂexibility of the image acquisition process. In addition, UAVs are a lot simpler\
    \ to use and also\ncheaper than manned aircrafts. Moreover, they are more efﬁcient\
    \ than the ground systems as they can\ncover a large ﬁeld in a short amount of\
    \ time and in a non-destructive way, which is very important.\nUAVs are not a\
    \ recent technology since the ﬁrst attempt to construct a powered UAV was recorded\n\
    in 1916 [6]. UAVs were initially exploited for military purposes; however, in\
    \ recent years, their use has\nrapidly expanded to other types of applications\
    \ (commercial, scientiﬁc, agricultural, etc.). The wider\nuse of UAVs was led\
    \ by the technology advancements and the miniaturization of the associated\nhardware\
    \ during the 1980s and 1990s.\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are now very commonly\
    \ used in remote sensing applications\nfor Precision Agriculture. Equipped with\
    \ sensors of different types, UAVs can be exploited to identify\nwhich zones of\
    \ the crops need different management, e.g. some kind of input. This gives the\
    \ farmers the\nability to react on time in any problem detected. UAS can be used\
    \ in a plethora of different applications\non Precision Agriculture, such as health\
    \ monitoring and disease detection, growth monitoring and\nyield estimation, weed\
    \ management and detection, etc. As the use of UAVs in PA applications is very\n\
    frequent in the last years and it is considered the future of remote sensing,\
    \ it is a ﬁeld that draws a\nlot of attention. Thus, several reviews exist for\
    \ their application in Precision Agriculture and Smart\nFarming. Most of the reviews\
    \ focus mainly on the different types of applications that UAVs can have in\n\
    agricultural crops [7–12] or environmental monitoring in general [13]. In [14],\
    \ the authors reviewed the\nhyperspectral imagery and the techniques used in these\
    \ cases. Maes et al. [15] focused on the suitability\nof the different available\
    \ sensors for each application, providing with important perspectives for the\n\
    use of UAVs in PA. However, this work does not review the techniques used for\
    \ exploiting the acquired\ninformation. In addition, a survey that discusses the\
    \ use of Deep Learning in agricultural data has\nbeen conducted [16].\nTo the\
    \ best of the authors knowledge, a review focusing also on the most frequently\
    \ used\ntechniques exploiting and processing UAV imagery from agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ is currently missing from\nthe literature, despite its necessity. We believe\
    \ that it is very important mainly because the absence of a\nstandardized workﬂow\
    \ is one of the major drawbacks that affects the wider use of UAV systems in\n\
    commercial PA applications. This fact results in the adoption of a variety of\
    \ heterogeneous procedures\nand methods by different researchers, for the same\
    \ goal. This results to not always having the best\noutcome. Furthermore, we believe\
    \ that a study reviewing the most recent works is of paramount\nimportance, as\
    \ it is a research area that is advancing really quickly. In this work we extend\
    \ [17],\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n3 of 26\nreviewing the most recent studies\
    \ about UAV-based applications for PA, focusing on the most common\ntechniques\
    \ applied on UAV imagery in recent works to monitor crop ﬁelds in Precision Agriculture.\n\
    The goal is to identify the most used sensors and practices for each type of application.\n\
    To properly perform a review on UAV applications in Precision Agriculture, we\
    \ formulated the\nfollowing research questions (RQs):\n1.\nWhich are the different\
    \ types of UAV applications in Precision Agriculture? In this research\nquestion,\
    \ we aim to explore the current trends in the application of UAVs in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nThe initial goal of UAVs in their early application in agriculture\
    \ was to derive direct image-based\nproducts.\nNowadays, this has changed, and\
    \ the applications of UAVs in agriculture are\nintelligence-based oriented products\
    \ that process images and provide informed decision-making\napplications to the\
    \ farmers. In this question, we provide a thorough description of the different\n\
    types of applications that UAVs can support based on the different operational\
    \ needs of\nagriculture ﬁelds.\n2.\nWhat types of crops are monitored by UAV systems?\
    \ In this research question, our target is\nto record the different types of crops\
    \ that have been monitored so far with the help of UAVs.\nAdditionally, we provide\
    \ general information regarding the geographical distribution of these\ncrops,\
    \ their size and the different stages of growth where monitoring can take place.\
    \ By answering\nthis research question, we can identify how the different characteristics\
    \ of each crop and its life\ncycle affect the use of UAVs.\n3.\nWhich UAV system\
    \ technologies are adopted in Precision Agriculture?\nIn this research\nquestion,\
    \ we identify the system characteristics of UAV-based applications for Precision\n\
    Agriculture. By answering this question we can locate the speciﬁc UAV types and\
    \ sensors\nthat can be used for monitoring crops.\n4.\nWhat types of data can\
    \ be acquired by UAVs? In this research question, we record the different\ntypes\
    \ of data that can be acquired by UAVs based on the sensor technology employed.\
    \ We also\nprovide a review of the advantages and disadvantages of the different\
    \ types of data that can be\ngathered with the help of different sensors based\
    \ on the associated cost and the types of the ﬁeld\noperations applied.\n5.\n\
    Which data processing methods can be used to exploit the agricultural data acquired\
    \ by UAVs?\nIn this research question, we identify the methods that are used for\
    \ image analysis in agricultural\ncrops. We distinguish between three types of\
    \ data processing methods that can be used alone or\ncomplementary so as to gain\
    \ insights regarding a ﬁeld namely: (a) Photogrammetric techniques;\n(b) Machine\
    \ Learning techniques; and (c) Vegetation Indices.\nTo answer these research questions,\
    \ we reviewed 100 recent papers [18–117] published during the\n2017–2019 period.\n\
    The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic\
    \ UAV-based applications\nfor Precision Agriculture, including the types of crops\
    \ being monitored, the application domains and\nthe UAV technologies being used\
    \ for Precision Agriculture purposes. In Section 3, we focus on the\nbasics of\
    \ UAV-based data acquisition and the types of sensors used. Section 4 discusses\
    \ the most\nused image processing methods that stood out in the literature: the\
    \ photogrammetry techniques, the\nvegetation indices calculation and machine learning.\
    \ Next, Section 5 focuses on the limitations in the\nuse of UAVs for Precision\
    \ Agriculture. Finally, Section 6 discusses the results of the review and make\n\
    some concluding remarks.\n2. UAV-Based Monitoring of Crops\nIn this section, we\
    \ introduce the applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture, along with the\n\
    types of crops being monitored and the UAV technologies adopted.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 349\n4 of 26\n2.1. Types of UAV Applications in Precision Agriculture\n\
    To date, UAV technologies have been successfully employed in a variety of applications\
    \ for\nPrecision Agriculture such as site-speciﬁc herbicide applications, water\
    \ deﬁciency identiﬁcation,\ndetection of diseases, etc. Using the information\
    \ acquired by the UAVs several decisions can be made\nto handle the problem(s)\
    \ detected and/or optimize harvesting by estimating the yield.\nThe most common\
    \ applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture, as recorded in the literature,\n\
    are the following:\n•\nWeed mapping and management [70,98]\n•\nVegetation growth\
    \ monitoring and yield estimation [48,65,87]\n•\nVegetation health monitoring\
    \ and diseases detection [46,77]\n•\nIrrigation management [64,118]\n•\nCorps\
    \ spraying [89,95]\nAmong the most popular application of UAVs in Precision Agriculture\
    \ is Weed mapping.\nWeeds are not desirable plants, which grow in agricultural\
    \ crops and can cause several problems.\nThey are competing for available resources\
    \ such as water or even space, causing losses to crop yields\nand in their growth.\
    \ In addition to the problems in the growth of the crops, weeds can cause problems\n\
    at harvesting. The use of herbicides is the dominant choice for weed control.\
    \ In conventional farming,\nthe most common practice of weed management is to\
    \ spray the same amounts of herbicides over the\nentire ﬁeld, even within the\
    \ weed-free areas. However, the overuse of herbicides can result in the\nevolution\
    \ of herbicide-resistant weeds and it can affect the growth and yield of the crops.\
    \ In addition,\nit poses a heavy pollution threat to the environment. In addition,\
    \ the above practice signiﬁcantly\nincreases the cost. To overcome the above problems,\
    \ in Precision Agriculture practices, Site-Speciﬁc\nWeed Management (SSWM) is\
    \ used. SSWM refers to the spatially variable application of herbicides\nrather\
    \ than spraying them in the whole ﬁeld. In this context, the ﬁeld is divided into\
    \ management\nzones that each one receives a customized management, as usually\
    \ weed plants spread through only\nfew spots of the ﬁeld. To achieve this goal,\
    \ it is necessary to generate an accurate weed cover map for\nprecise spraying\
    \ of herbicide. UAVs can gather images and derive data from the whole ﬁeld that\
    \ can\nbe used to generate a precise weed cover map depicting the spots where\
    \ the chemicals are needed:\n(a) the most; (b) the least; or (c) they should not\
    \ be applied at all.\nUAVs are also frequently used for Monitoring the growth\
    \ of the vegetation and providing\nestimation regarding the yield. The lack of\
    \ means for systematically monitoring the progress of\ncultivation is considered\
    \ as one of the major obstacles to increasing the agricultural productivity\n\
    and quality. This problem is also compounded by the variability of weather conditions\
    \ that alter the\nmicro-climate of crops jeopardizing the agricultural production.\
    \ Regular collection of information\nand visualization of crops using UAVs, provides\
    \ increased opportunities to monitor crop growth\nand record the variability observed\
    \ in several parameters of the ﬁeld. Many recent works focus on\nmonitoring the\
    \ biomass and nitrogen status of the crops along with yield estimation. Biomass\
    \ is the\nmost common crop parameter, which together with information related\
    \ to nitrogen content can be\nused to determine the need for additional fertilizer\
    \ or other actions. In addition, the information\nacquired by the UAVs can be\
    \ used for the creation of three-dimensional digital maps of the crop, and\nfor\
    \ the measurement of various parameters, such as crop height, distance between\
    \ rows or between\nplants, and the index Leaf Area Index (LAI). UAVs offer the\
    \ potential to systematically collect crop\ninformation, therefore farmers can\
    \ plan in a controlled manner the crop management, use of inputs\n(e.g., use of\
    \ nutrients), timing of harvesting and soil and yield pathogens, or even identify\
    \ possible\nmanagement errors.\nUAVs are also used to monitor vegetation health.\
    \ Crop health is a very important factor that\nneeds to be monitored, as diseases\
    \ in crops can cause signiﬁcant economic loss due to the reduced yield\nand the\
    \ reduction of quality. Crops should be monitored constantly to detect the diseases\
    \ in time and\navoid spreading problems. Traditionally, this task is performed\
    \ by human experts directly in the ﬁeld.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n5 of 26\n\
    However, this can be very time consuming, as it can require months to inspect\
    \ an entire crop preventing\nthe potentials of “continuous” monitoring. Another\
    \ common disease control method is the application\nof pesticides in certain dates.\
    \ Such a strategy incurs a high cost and also increases the likelihood of\nground\
    \ water contamination as pesticide residues in the products. In Precision Agriculture,\
    \ site-speciﬁc\ndisease control takes place. PA practices adopt a decision-based\
    \ disease management strategy, in which\nautomated non-destructive crops disease\
    \ detection plays a very important role. Disease detection\nis feasible as diseases\
    \ induce changes in biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the crops.\n\
    UAV-based data processing technologies use crop imaging information to identify\
    \ changes in plant\nbiomass and their health. Therefore, diseases can be detected\
    \ in their early stages enabling farmers\nto intervene in order to reduce losses.\
    \ In this context, UAVs can be used in the two different stages\nof disease control:\
    \ (a) at the initial stage of infection by collecting crop health relevant information,\n\
    during which UAVs can detect a possible infection before visual indications appear\
    \ and map the size of\nthe infection to different parts of a culture; and (b)\
    \ during the treatment of infection when farmers can\nuse UAVs for targeted spraying\
    \ as well as for accurately monitoring the course of their intervention.\nCrop\
    \ irrigation management is a very important area of application of UAV technologies\
    \ in\nPrecision Agriculture. Currently, 70% of the water consumed worldwide is\
    \ used for the irrigation of\ncrops [119,120], a fact that highlights the need\
    \ for precision irrigation techniques. Precision irrigation\ntechniques can improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of water use, so that the resource is applied effectively: (a)\
    \ in\nthe right places; (b) at the right time; and (c) in the right quantity.\
    \ The detection of the areas where\nmajor irrigation is needed can help the farmers\
    \ to save time and water resources. At the same time,\nsuch precision farming\
    \ techniques can lead to increased crop productivity and quality. In the context\n\
    of precision agriculture, the ﬁeld is divided in different irrigation zones, to\
    \ precisely manage the\nresources. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles incorporating\
    \ suitable sensor types makes it possible\nto identify parts of a crop that need\
    \ more water. At the same time, the above technologies allow for the\nproduction\
    \ of specialized maps that illustrate the morphology of the soil, thus supporting\
    \ the more\nefﬁcient irrigation planning of each crop separately.\nAn application\
    \ of UAVs in precision agriculture that is more rarely met is Crop spraying. The\
    \ main\nspraying equipment used in conventional farming are the manual air-pressure\
    \ and battery-powered\nknapsack sprayers. However, these conventional sprayers\
    \ can cause major pesticide losses. In addition,\nthe operators need to be present\
    \ when spraying, which leads to exposure of the operators. In addition,\nit may\
    \ be time-consuming to spray the entire ﬁeld, which is not only limiting the resources\
    \ but also can\nlead to not-timely spraying. In this manner, UAVs can be useful\
    \ due to the lower operator exposure\nand improved ability to apply chemicals\
    \ in a timely and highly spatially resolved manner. The use\nof precision systems\
    \ for measuring distances allows UAVs to follow the morphology of the ground,\n\
    keeping their height constant. Therefore, an aircraft has the ability to spray\
    \ the appropriate amount\nof herbicide spatially, adjusting both its height and\
    \ the amount it sprays depending on the crop site\nin which it is located. Crop\
    \ spraying is particularly important in cases where diseases have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ where it is important to reduce pesticide use without affecting crop yield.\
    \ In conclusion,\nUAV-based systems can make a decisive contribution to crop spray\
    \ management.\nIn addition to the common applications mentioned above, UAVs have\
    \ also been used for soil\nanalysis [108,112], cotton genotype selection [48],\
    \ mammal detection [24], and assessment of soil\nelectrical conductivity [66].\n\
    2.2. Types and Properties of Crops Monitored by UAV-Based Systems\nIn the recent\
    \ years, UAV technologies have been employed to monitor a variety of different\
    \ types\nof crops, located in several countries all over the world. UAV applications\
    \ in Precision Agriculture\nhave been carried out in 29 different countries. The\
    \ majority of applications are located in economically\ndeveloped countries, with\
    \ the US and China standing out. Lately, however, the applications in Europe\n\
    have increased as well.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n6 of 26\nRegarding the different\
    \ types of crop species that can be monitored with the help of UAVs, more\nthan\
    \ 30 different species were identiﬁed. Among the most common crop species monitored\
    \ by UAV\ntechnologies are Maize, Wheat, Cotton, Vineyards, Rice and Soya. In\
    \ addition, we observe that these\ntechnologies have been used to monitor crops\
    \ with completely different characteristics, such as olive\ntrees and rice crops.\n\
    Another observation is that the monitoring of crops can take place during the\
    \ different stages\nof growth, even at the early ones before being able to draw\
    \ inferences from soil characteristics.\nThe purpose of constant and continuous\
    \ monitoring of crops at different stages of development\nis to record various\
    \ factors that may affect the ﬁnal performance of crops, as well as to evaluate\n\
    the effectiveness of actions taken to address problems identiﬁed at an earlier\
    \ stage of development.\nRegarding the size of the crops monitored we observe\
    \ in this review that it is possible:\n•\nTo monitor large ﬁelds (>10 ha), where\
    \ data are collected from all areas.\n•\nTo monitor small farms or small parts\
    \ of a ﬁeld.\n•\nTo monitor areas of great heterogeneity. This is achieved by\
    \ using a UAV equipped with automatic\npilot systems and ground-level sensors.\n\
    2.3. UAV System Technologies\nAn Unmanned Aerial System that applies to Precision\
    \ Agriculture usually includes the following\nkey elements [121]:\n•\nOne or more\
    \ UAVs: Flying vehicles that have no operator on their spindle but operate either\n\
    autonomously or remotely.\n•\nA Ground Control Station (GCS): It is a computer\
    \ that either communicates with the UAV Control\nSystem or controls and monitors\
    \ the UAV directly. The GCS monitors information related to the\nﬂight of the\
    \ UAV. The user has the ability to receive data relevant to the ﬂight of the aircraft,\
    \ but\nalso data recorded by the sensors that support the ﬂight (i.e., ground-based\
    \ sensors or sensors\nembedded in the aircraft). In addition, the GCS contains\
    \ the software required for the processing\nof data acquired by the UAV and the\
    \ extraction of the information needed by the system operator\nfor the crop monitoring.\n\
    •\nUAV Control System (UAV CS): It is used to control the UAV. It can be either\
    \ a two-way data\nlink, such as a remote control, or a built-in computer (usually\
    \ with a built in GPS). The UAV CS\nincludes the ﬂight control system and/or the\
    \ autopilot system, which controls the operation of\nthe UAV. This system receives\
    \ and processes data from the autopilot or ﬂight control system for\nthe proper\
    \ operation of the UAV. It usually contains sensors to monitor the ﬂight properties,\
    \ such\nas sensors for measuring distance from ground, air force, etc. The control\
    \ system has the ability to\nprocess information from sensors to correct any problems\
    \ that may arise, and to communicate\nwith the GCC wireless and in real time by\
    \ sending and receiving the necessary information.\n•\nSensors for data acquisition:\
    \ They are cameras intended to collect the information needed. The\nnext section\
    \ provides a detailed presentation of possible ways of collecting information\
    \ and the\ntechnologies exploited. In the case that UAVs are not intended to collect\
    \ information but are used\nfor another purpose, such as spraying, the sensors\
    \ are replaced with the necessary components.\nFocusing on the UAV technologies\
    \ being used for PA, the types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles can\nbe divided into\
    \ ﬁve basic categories, based on their design characteristics (see Figure 1).\n\

    (a) Fixed-wing (eBeeTM) [23]; (b) helicopter (Hornet Maxi) [122]; (c) octocopter\
    \ [25];\n(d) blimp [123]; (e) ﬂapping-wing (SmartBird) [122]; and (f) parafoil-wing\
    \ (Tetracam) [90].\n1.\nFixed-wing: These are unmanned planes with wings that\
    \ require a runway to take off from\nthe ground or a catapult. This type of UAVs\
    \ has high endurance as well as the ability to\nﬂy at high speeds. In addition,\
    \ ﬁxed-wing UAVs have the ability to cover large areas on\neach ﬂight and can\
    \ carry more payload. However, they are more expensive than the other\ntypes.\
    \ In the works reviewed, 22% used ﬁxed-wing UAVs. One type of ﬁxed-wing UAVs that\n\
    has not been identiﬁed in the reviewed literature, but is a very promising technology,\
    \ is the\nsolar-powered UAVs [124]. Solar-powered UAVs offer signiﬁcantly increased\
    \ ﬂight times because\nthey exploit and store the sun’s energy during the day.\
    \ This is the reason that they are preferred\nfor long-endurance operations.\n\
    2.\nRotary-wing: The rotary-wing UAVS, also called rotorcrafts or Vertical Take-Off\
    \ and Landing\n(VTOL), offer the advantages of steady ﬂying at one place while\
    \ keeping the maneuverability\nattribute. These features are useful for many different\
    \ types of missions. However, they cannot\nﬂy at very high speed or stay in the\
    \ air for a long time. They are generally the most widely used\nUAVs in all kinds\
    \ of applications, but especially in Precision Agriculture. One reason for this\n\
    is the fact that they present lower cost compared to the other types of UAVs.\
    \ In addition, this\ntype of UAVs is suitable when the monitored crops are not\
    \ very large, which is usually the case.\nA UAV of this type may be:\n•\nAn unmanned\
    \ helicopter: They include main and tail rotors such as conventional helicopters.\n\
    Overall, 4% of the works used this type.\n•\nMulti-rotor: This category includes\
    \ rotary-wing UAVs with four or more rotors (quadcopter,\nhexacopter, octocopter,\
    \ etc.). These aircraft are generally more stable in ﬂight than unmanned\nhelicopters.\
    \ Overall, 72% of the works used this type.\n3.\nBlimps: This type of UAV is lighter\
    \ than air, has high endurance, ﬂies at low speeds and is\ngenerally larger in\
    \ size compared to the other types. Their manufacturing characteristics allows\n\
    them to remain in the air even in the event of a total loss of power, while being\
    \ considered\nrelatively safe in the event of a collision. Usually, they are not\
    \ used in Precision Agriculture\napplications. In the recent works reviewed, no\
    \ application was found using this type of UAVs.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n\
    8 of 26\n4.\nFlapping wing: These UAVs are very small and they have ﬂexible, shaped\
    \ little wings inspired by\nthe way birds and insects ﬂy. They are not often used\
    \ in Precision Agriculture as they require\nhigh energy consumption due to their\
    \ size. No work was found in the literature review using\nthis type of UAVs.\n\
    5.\nParafoil-wing. Usually aircrafts of this type have one or more propellers\
    \ at the back in order to\ncontrol the course of their ﬂight, but at the same\
    \ time for harnessing the power of the air to ﬂy\nwithout consuming much energy.\
    \ They are also capable of carrying a larger payload. They are\nnot usually exploited\
    \ for PA applications. Only 2% of the works analyzed use this type.\nIn addition\
    \ to the above classiﬁcation, UAVs can also be categorized according to their\
    \ size [121].\nHowever, the categorization used in this study is more common,\
    \ as it takes into account more factors\naffecting the performance of UAVs and\
    \ their use in Precision Agriculture.\nThe majority of the recent works in Precision\
    \ Agriculture use multi-rotor UAVs. This is mainly\ndue to the fact that in most\
    \ applications the area under consideration is not very large. For this reason,\n\
    it is not necessary to use UAVs with high speed and the ability to cover large\
    \ areas in a few ﬂights, such\nas ﬁxed-wing UAVs. Thus, rotary-wing aircraft are\
    \ preferred because of the following advantages:\n•\nEasy to operate\n•\nSlower\
    \ speeds\n•\nAbility to maneuver\n•\nRelatively low cost\nThese advantages provide\
    \ greater opportunities for collecting information from crops through\nimaging,\
    \ which is the main use of UAVs in vegetation monitoring. In cases where the monitoring\
    \ area\nis relatively large, ﬁxed-wing aircraft are preferred, which enable the\
    \ monitoring of the entire area in a\nshort time.\n3. UAV Data Acquisition\nEquipped\
    \ with specialized sensors, UAVs are becoming powerful sensing systems that\n\
    complement the IoT-based techniques. The role of the sensors is to capture images\
    \ of high-spatial and\ntemporal resolution, which can assist in monitoring many\
    \ different characteristics of the vegetation.\nA variety of different types of\
    \ sensors can be used in an agricultural UAV depending on the different\ncrop\
    \ parameters that should be monitored [9]. However, the needs for low payload\
    \ capacity and the\nutilization of small platforms pose several limitations on\
    \ the selection s of the sensor(s) to be used.\nThe main criteria that the sensors\
    \ have to meet are the low weight, the low energy consumption\nand the small size.\
    \ Of course, all of the above must be combined with the ability to capture high\n\
    resolution images.\nModern commercial on-board sensors complying with the above\
    \ restrictions that are used for PA ,\nmainly belong to the following four types:\n\
    •\nVisible light sensors (RGB)\n•\nMultispectral sensors\n•\nHyperspectral sensors\n\
    •\nThermal sensors\nIn addition to the above types of sensors, other types of\
    \ sensors can be used, such as laser\nscanners, also mentioned in the literature\
    \ as light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Laser scanners\nare a well-established\
    \ technology used extensively for environmental sciences, however they are\nmostly\
    \ used for terrestrial scanning. Airborne laser scanning has been exploited since\
    \ 1994 [125], when\ncommercial systems became available. However, they were not\
    \ widely used in the studies reviewed,\nmainly due to the increased cost compared\
    \ to other types of sensors used for data acquisition [84].\nEach sensor type\
    \ can monitor different characteristics of the vegetation, such as the color and\n\
    texture of vegetation or the geometric outline of the crops. In addition, some\
    \ sensors can measure\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n9 of 26\nthe radiation in certain\
    \ wavelengths. The data acquired by these sensors can be further processed to\n\
    monitor plant biomass, vegetation health, soil moisture and other important crop\
    \ characteristics at the\ndifferent growth stages. Figure 2 presents examples\
    \ of the main types of sensors used.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 2. Examples of\
    \ sensors used by UAVs for PA: (a) thermal sensor [103]; (b) RGB sensor [59];\n\
    (c) multispectral sensor [26]; and (d) hyperspectral sensor [88].\n•\nVisible\
    \ light sensors (RGB): RGB sensors are the most frequently used sensors by UAV\
    \ systems\nfor Precision Agriculture applications. They are relatively low cost\
    \ compared to the other types\nand can acquire high resolution images. In addition,\
    \ they are easy to use and operate and they\nare lightweight. In addition, the\
    \ information acquired requires simple processing. The images\ncan be acquired\
    \ in different conditions, on both sunny and cloudy days, but a speciﬁc time frame\n\
    is required based on weather conditions to avoid inadequate or excessive exposure\
    \ of the image.\nConsidering the drawbacks of these sensors, the main disadvantage\
    \ is the fact that they are\ninadequate for analyzing a lot of vegetation parameters\
    \ that require spectral information in the\nnon-visible spectrum. They are commonly\
    \ used in tandem with the other types of sensors.\n•\nBy using multispectral or\
    \ hyperspectral imaging sensors, UAVs can acquire information about\nthe vegetation’s\
    \ spectral absorption and reﬂection on several bands. Spectral information can\n\
    be signiﬁcantly helpful in assessing a lot of biological and physical characteristics\
    \ of the crops.\nFor example, unhealthy parts of the crops can be discriminated\
    \ in an image, as visible radiation\nin the red channel is absorbed by chlorophyll,\
    \ while near infrared (NIR) radiation is strongly\nreﬂected. Thus, even if it\
    \ is not yet visible in the red channel, it can be identiﬁed by the information\n\
    in the NIR channel. Spectral information can be used to calculate several vegetation\
    \ indices and\nmonitor several crop characteristics based on them.\nMultispectral\
    \ and hyperspectral sensors are frequently used, despite their higher costs. However,\
    \ a\ndrawback of these sensors arises from the fact that it is required to apply\
    \ more complex\npre-processing methods in order to extract useful information\
    \ from the captured images.\nThe pre-processing procedure of spectral images often\
    \ contains the radiometric calibration,\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n10 of 26\n\
    geometric correction, image fusion and image enhancement. The main difference\
    \ between\nmultispectral and hyperspectral sensors is the number of bands (or\
    \ channels) that each sensor\ncan capture and the width of the bands. Multispectral\
    \ sensors capture 5–12 channels while\nhyperspectral images can usually capture\
    \ hundreds or thousands bands, but in a narrower\nbandwidth. Although in the recent\
    \ works studied multispectral sensors are used a lot more\nfrequently than hyperspectral\
    \ because of their lower cost, hyperspectral technology seems to have\na lot of\
    \ potential and is considered as the future trend for crop phenotyping research\
    \ [9].\n•\nThermal infrared sensors capture information about the temperature\
    \ of the objects and generate\nimages displaying them based on this information\
    \ and not their visible properties. Thermal\ncameras use infrared sensors and\
    \ an optical lens to receive infrared energy. All objects warmer\nthan absolute\
    \ zero (−273 ◦C/−459 ◦F) emit infrared radiation at speciﬁc wavelengths (LWIR\
    \ and\nMWIR bands) in an amount proportional to their temperature. Hence, thermal\
    \ cameras focus\nand detect the radiation in these wavelengths and usually translate\
    \ it into a grayscale image for\nthe heat representation. Many thermal imaging\
    \ sensors can also generate colored images. These\nimages often show warmer objects\
    \ as yellow and cooler objects as blue. This type of sensors\nis used for very\
    \ speciﬁc applications (e.g., irrigation management). As a result, they are not\n\
    frequently used in PA applications of UAV systems that focus on monitoring other\
    \ characteristics\nof the crops.\nIn the image acquisition by UAVs, it is typical\
    \ to acquire several overlapping images of the\ncrops. In the most cases they\
    \ capture both front and side overlapping images. This is desired as the\noverlapping\
    \ images can be used for the construction of 3D models and/or orthophotos of the\
    \ crops, as\nthe next section discusses. The rate of the overlap depends on the\
    \ type of the application. The front\noverlap usually ranges 60–95% while the\
    \ side overlap ranges 40–95% to generate three-dimensional\nmodels and 25–40%\
    \ for other uses.\nIn addition, the altitude of the UAV ﬂights varies according\
    \ to the application and spatial accuracy\nof the information we want to collect.\
    \ The distance between the target (crop) to be visualized and the\nUAV plays an\
    \ important role in determining the detail of the information acquired. This is\
    \ something\nthat depends on both the sensors and the resolution they offer. In\
    \ the majority of cases, depending on\nthe purpose of the application, the spatial\
    \ resolution of the photographs is between 0.5 cm/pixel and\n10 cm/pixel.\nQuite\
    \ often, RGB sensors are modiﬁed to acquire information about the radiation in\
    \ other bands\ntoo, usually the Near Infrared (NIR) or the Red Edge (RE) band.\
    \ This approach is observed when\nthe stakeholders want to avoid the higher costs\
    \ of buying multispectral cameras. This is achieved by\nreplacing one of the original\
    \ optical ﬁlters with one that enables the perception of near-infrared channel,\n\
    resulting often in a hybrid (e.g., NIR-RGB) sensor. The visible channel that is\
    \ no longer captured by\nthe modiﬁed RGB sensor is often captured by using another\
    \ embedded RGB sensor. The use of both\nmultispectral and visible sensors was\
    \ observed in many cases [22,23,27,31,33,49,50,55,56,61,65,69,72,\n87,103,107,113,117].\n\
    4. UAS Data Processing\nThis section focuses on the data processing techniques\
    \ utilized to analyze the UAV imagery. To be\nmore precise, we discuss the different\
    \ ways the information UAVs capture can be exploited to study\ndifferent vegetation\
    \ features. The most common features that can be monitored with UAV-based\nremote\
    \ sensing for Precision Agriculture are presented in Table 1:\nInformation 2019,\
    \ 10, 349\n11 of 26\nTable 1. Crop features that can be monitored with UAVs.\n\
    Crop Features\nVegetation\nbiomass [22,103]\nnitrogen status [22,99,103,110]\n\

    \ use of specialized sensors, UAVs can acquire information for various features\
    \ of the\ncultivated ﬁeld. However, as mentioned above, there is still no standardized\
    \ workﬂow or well\nestablished techniques to follow for analyzing and visualizing\
    \ the information acquired. The most\ncommonly used image processing methods y\
    \ to analyze UAV imagery for Precision Agriculture\npurposes are the following:\n\
    •\nPhotogrammetry techniques: Photogrammetry regards the accurate reconstruction\
    \ of a scene or\nan object from several overlapping pictures. Photogrammetric\
    \ techniques can process the 2D data\nand establish the geometric relationships\
    \ between the different images and the object(s), obtaining\n3D models. To construct\
    \ the 3D models, photogrammetry requires at least two overlapping\nimages of the\
    \ same scene and/or object(s), captured from different points of view. These kind\
    \ of\ntechniques can be used for extracting three-dimensional digital surface\
    \ or terrain models [37,40,43]\nand/or orthophotos [50,55]. UAV low-altitude data\
    \ acquisition enables the construction of 3D\nmodels with a much higher spatial\
    \ resolution compared to other remote sensing technologies\n(such as satellites).\
    \ However, the collection of many images is required to have information for\n\
    the entire ﬁeld under study. Thus, in most cases, it is necessary to collect many\
    \ overlapping\nimages to construct Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the crops\
    \ and/or create orthophotos\n(also referred to as orthomosaics). The 3D models\
    \ and the orthophotos include information about\nthe 3D characteristics of the\
    \ crops based on the structure of the vegetation (e.g., the vegetation\nheight,\
    \ the canopy, the density, etc.) and can be very useful for applications that\
    \ can exploit only\nRGB imagery. The works reviewed showed that photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are very commonly\nused in all types of applications as they are\
    \ also required to create vegetation indices maps.\nIn addition, the 3D information\
    \ they include is very important and is often used in tandem with\nother techniques.\n\
    •\nMachine learning methods: Machine Learning (ML) has been used to process the\
    \ data acquired,\nfor prediction and/or identiﬁcation purposes, with great results\
    \ in many domains, such as medical\nsystems [126,127], marketing [128], biology\
    \ [129], etc. Machine learning techniques are often\nbeen applied in Precision\
    \ Agriculture to exploit the information from the large amount of data\nacquired\
    \ by the UAVs. ML is able to estimate some parameters regarding the crop growth\
    \ rate,\ndetect diseases or even to identify/discriminate objects in the images.\
    \ Machine learning usage\nhas increased a lot recently due to the fast advancements\
    \ taking place especially in the deep\nlearning ﬁeld.\n•\nVegetation Indices calculation:\
    \ Vegetation Indices (VIs) are one of the most popular products\nof remote sensing\
    \ applications for Precision Agriculture.\nThey use different mathematical\ncombinations/transformations\
    \ of at least two spectral bands of the electromagnetic spectrum,\ndesigned to\
    \ maximize the contribution of the vegetation characteristics while minimizing\
    \ the\nexternal confounding factors. They can deliver reliable spatial and temporal\
    \ information about the\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n12 of 26\nagricultural crops\
    \ monitored. In most cases, many VIs are extracted and used to draw conclusions.\n\
    They can be calculated based on information of either each photograph individually\
    \ or after the\nproduction of orthophotos depicting the whole crop. Calculating\
    \ vegetation indices may serve\nin the identiﬁcation of useful crop characteristics,\
    \ such as biological and physical parameters of\nthe vegetation.\nSince the processing\
    \ of data may be time consuming, several software tools and techniques have\n\
    been developed to enable faster data processing. The most commonly adopted software\
    \ solutions in\nthe works reviewed to support and accelerate the data analysis\
    \ procedure are summarized in Table 2.\nIn addition to the software tools referenced\
    \ in the table, there are several other promising software\ntools that can assist\
    \ in the data analysis process, such as Erdas Imagine [130], eCognition [131],\
    \ and\nPixelWrench 2 [132].\nTable 2. Most common software tools used in the literature\

    \ for the calculation of the vegetation indices from\nmultispectral data\nMATLAB\
    \ [35,100]\nApplied mainly for the calculation of vegetation indices. It can also\
    \ be\nexploited for other image processing methods\nPix4D [29,35,55]\nThe most\
    \ commonly used tool. It can be used for calculating VIs and/or\nconstructing\
    \ of 3D models and orthomosaics\nIn the following subsections, we provide the\
    \ details of the three most commonly used data\nprocessing techniques to analyze\
    \ data acquired from UAV ﬂights in the agricultural domain.\n4.1. Photogrammetric\
    \ Techniques\nPhotogrammetric techniques are mainly be applied for the construction\
    \ of orthomosaics and/or\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs) in order to exploit\
    \ the 3D information regarding the vegetation.\nAs mentioned above, this can be\
    \ done by acquiring many overlapping images of the agricultural crops\nmonitored.\
    \ The advancements in computer vision and photogrammetric techniques have lead\
    \ to many\ndifferent techniques and algorithms that are able to match large numbers\
    \ of overlapping images and\ndetect common objects and scenes in them. The images\
    \ are processed by applying aerial triangulation\nand adjusting camera orientation.\
    \ Computer vision methods are used for matching the overlapping\nimages and the\
    \ common characteristics. To achieve object tracking as well as to identify the\
    \ scale and\nthe orientation of a particular image; in some cases, Ground Control\
    \ Points (GCPs) are being used.\nGCPs distributed in the cultivated ﬁeld can be\
    \ identiﬁed within the overlapping images: (a) to link the\nimages; and (b) to\
    \ identify the coordinates of each image and its slope. However, recent advancements\n\
    have made this redundant, as many techniques can be used without GCPs, with similar\
    \ precision.\nThe construction of the 3D Digital Elevation Models can provide\
    \ to the producer information\nabout the altitude of the earth surface, the natural\
    \ and artiﬁcial objects/structures on the surface, the\ndensity of the vegetation,\
    \ and their growth, among others. There are two types of DEMs used:\n•\nThe Digital\
    \ Terrain Model (DTM) represents the altitude of the surface of the Earth, i.e.,\
    \ of the\nterrain. These models do not take into account either artiﬁcial or natural\
    \ (e.g., trees, vegetation,\nbuildings) objects that exist in the ﬁeld. DTMs just\
    \ present the elevation of the bare Earth. Figure 3\nshows a Digital Terrain Model\
    \ from Ronchetti et al. [79].\n•\nThe Digital Surface Model (DSM) represents the\
    \ altitude of the surface that is ﬁrst encountered by\nthe remote sensing system\
    \ (i.e., when the aerial image captures the top of a building, tree, the\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 349\n13 of 26\nvegetation etc.). Hence, the elevation model generated\
    \ includes the elevation of the bare Earth\nalong with artiﬁcial and natural objects\
    \ that may exist in the ﬁeld.\nThe DEMS constructed can be exploited either for\
    \ the extraction of 3D information directly\nor to construct orthomosaics of the\
    \ crops. An orthoimage, orthomosaic or orthophoto is an aerial\nphotograph that\
    \ is orthorectiﬁed (i.e., geometrically corrected). Thus, the scale of the constructed\n\
    image is uniform. As a result, the ﬁnal orthophoto has the same lack of distortion\
    \ as a map. In contrast\nwith a simple aerial image of a ﬁeld, an orthophoto can\
    \ be used to measure true distances as it contains\nthe 3D characteristics of\
    \ the crops.\nThe use of photogrammetry techniques have the following procedure:\
    \ create point cloud\nrepresentations of the 3D surface and either combine all\
    \ objects into a single Digital Elevation Model\nor use the DEMs to generate an\
    \ orthophoto. The most commonly used set of algorithms for this\npurpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [133]. The main advantage of SfM is that it does not require\n\
    any information regarding the camera parameters or the environmental settings.\n\
    (a)\n(b)\nFigure 3. (a) A Digital Terrain Model [79]; and (b) a Digital Surface\
    \ Model [109].\nPhotogrammetric techniques are commonly used in all types of applications\
    \ as they are also\nrequired for constructing the vegetation indices maps. Photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are used in the\nmajority of recent works (93%) to exploit and extract\
    \ information regarding the 3D characteristics of\nthe crops. However, photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are in most cases used to compliment other types of\ndata processing\
    \ methods.\n4.2. Using Machine Learning\nMachine Learning (ML) and Data Mining\
    \ methods are widely used in PA to exploit the\ninformation acquired by the UAVs.\
    \ Taking into account the large amounts of data collected from\nagricultural ﬁelds,\
    \ machine learning can be applied to enhance the performance of UAV-based systems\n\
    for PA, by extracting knowledge for several parameters of the vegetation. ML is\
    \ used in many cases\nand for different purposes. Both unsupervised and supervised\
    \ learning techniques are being exploited,\nvia clustering, classiﬁcation and\
    \ regression methods.\nRegression methods are widely used in UAV applications\
    \ for PA for a variety of purposes.\nRegression has been used to estimate spectral\
    \ vegetation indices by analyzing data acquired from RGB\nimages [35], presenting\
    \ generally good results. Additionally, regression has been used to examine the\n\
    correlation of some vegetation indices with vegetation features such as nitrogen\
    \ [22,38,99], leaf are\nindex [36,103], and biomass [22,36,103]. For this purpose,\
    \ both linear (simple and multiple) regression\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n14\
    \ of 26\nand nonlinear regression methods have been used. In a comparison of different\
    \ regression algorithms,\nfor estimating leaf nitrogen content, Random Forests\
    \ presents the best results among 14 algorithms,\nwith the coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ (R2) being up to 0.79 [38]. Regression methods are also used\nto predict crop\
    \ water status, by using information derived from RGB, multispectral and thermal\n\
    sensors [64,92,104]. In this context, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks present generally\
    \ good results (R2 up\nto 0.87 by using and information from some spectral bands).\n\
    Classiﬁcation methods are also very commonly used for weed mapping [18,33,44,73,106,111]\
    \ and\ndisease detection [46,77,97]. The most popular and precise classiﬁcation\
    \ techniques are the Artiﬁcial\nNeural Networks (ANNs) family [18,44,73,104] and\
    \ the Random Forest algorithm [22,38,49]. These\nalgorithms directly use the RGB\
    \ colors, the intensity, spectral information or other features derived\nfrom\
    \ the image acquired. In some cases, data about the neighborhood of each pixel\
    \ are also considered.\nApart from the above data, classiﬁcation algorithms can\
    \ also use vegetation indices as features in\nthe model to achieve higher accuracy.\
    \ In general, ANNs present higher accuracy, compared to other\nclassiﬁcation algorithms,\
    \ that reaches up to 99% for weed mapping in some cases [98]. The accuracy\nof\
    \ the method depends on the type of the crops monitored [73] as expected. Convolutional\
    \ Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), is among the most used family of algorithms. CNNs belong\
    \ to deep learning\nalgorithms that have been proved to be very effective in object\
    \ detection in large datasets.\nThe use of Deep Learning (DL) in Precision Agriculture\
    \ applications is a recent, modern and\npromising technique, having increasing\
    \ popularity. Deep learning techniques extend typical ML by\nadding more complexity\
    \ into the derived models. DL techniques transform the data using various\nfunctions\
    \ that allow data representation in a hierarchical way, through several levels\
    \ of abstraction.\nAdvancements and applications of Deep Learning into other domains\
    \ indicate its large potential.\nAs indicated in [16,134], the use of Machine\
    \ Learning and more particular Deep Learning will be even\nmore widespread in\
    \ the next years.\nA very common application of Machine Learning methods in PA\
    \ is Object Based Image Analysis\n(OBIA). The purpose of OBIA is to discriminate\
    \ objects within agricultural images obtained from\nUAVs [32,43].\nIn contrast\
    \ to traditional pixel-based image classiﬁcation, which classiﬁes each\npixel,\
    \ OBIA groups small pixels together into vector objects. With the higher spatial\
    \ resolution\nof UAV imagery, pixel-based classiﬁcations have become much less\
    \ effective.\nThat is due to\nthe fact that the relationship between the pixel\
    \ size and the object size has changed signiﬁcantly.\nTherefore, object-oriented\
    \ classiﬁcation methods are increasing in popularity. They use segmentation\n\
    methods to divide the image pixels into homogeneous segments/groups. Then, these\
    \ segments/objects\nare arranged into classes based on their geometric, spectral,\
    \ textural and other characteristics.\nOBIA is usually composed of two main steps:\n\
    1.\nImage segmentation\n2.\nFeature extraction and classiﬁcation\nThese methods\
    \ are exploited to recognize and detect weeds or discriminate different species\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld. A detailed review of algorithms and challenges for OBIA, from\
    \ a remote sensing perspective,\nwas reported by Hossain and Chen [135].\n4.3.\
    \ Vegetation Indices\nVegetation Indices (VIs) have been widely used in remote\
    \ sensing applications for Precision\nAgriculture. They are considered to be very\
    \ effective for monitoring the growth and health of crops\nin qualitative and\
    \ quantitative vegetation analysis [25,29,30]. Vegetation Indices are based on\
    \ the\nabsorption of electromagnetic radiation by the vegetation.\nThey are mathematical\
    \ transformations of the absorption and scattering in different bands of\nthe\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum. The reﬂectance in several bands is affected by parameters\
    \ such as\nvegetation biochemical and physical properties, environmental effects,\
    \ soil background properties,\nmoisture content, etc. The understanding of the\
    \ spectral behavior of the vegetation is fundamental\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n\
    15 of 26\nto remote sensing applications to monitor various vegetation features\
    \ (e.g., biomass [22], nitrogen\nstatus [19,22], vegetation health [46], etc.)\
    \ It has been shown that certain VIs are signiﬁcantly related\nwith different\
    \ parameters of the vegetation.\nSimple Vegetation Indices that can combine RGB\
    \ information and some spectral bands such as\nNIR and RE have signiﬁcantly improved\
    \ the ability to detect green and healthy vegetation. Several VIs\nhave been developed,\
    \ as different environments have their own complex characteristics, which needs\n\
    to be taken into account when using a Vegetation Index. Thus, each VI has its\
    \ own speciﬁc combination\nof the reﬂectance in different bands, in order to detect\
    \ vegetation. Hence, its VI is suitable for speciﬁc\nuses. The main concept is\
    \ to combine the reﬂections of different bands to decrease the “noise” from\n\
    external factors (e.g., sensors calibration, lighting, atmosphere, soil properties,\
    \ etc.). For example, as\nmentioned in the previous section, visible radiation\
    \ to the red is absorbed by the chlorophyll while the\nradiation in the NIR band\
    \ is strongly reﬂected. In this way, vegetation can be discriminated by the soil\n\
    in an image. In way, unhealthy vegetation can also be detected.\nVegetation Indices\
    \ that are based on the radiation in the Red and NIR channels, such as the RVI\n\
    or the NDVI index, are designed to increase the contrast between the vegetation\
    \ and the soil. The\nrelationship between the reﬂections of the two zones allows\
    \ the elimination of disturbances by factors\nthat affect the radiation of each\
    \ zone in the same way.\nThe effort to model the biophysical parameters of vegetation\
    \ has led to the creation of several\ndifferent vegetation indices [136–139].\
    \ The vegetation indices can be divided into two main categories:\n1.\nVegetation\
    \ Indices based on multispectral or hyperspectral data. Most of the developed\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices use multispectral and/or hyperspectral information that\
    \ can combine several bands.\n2.\nVegetation Indices based on information from\
    \ the visible spectrum. Several VIs in the visible\nspectrum have been developed\
    \ and are widely used due to the high cost of multispectral and\nhyperspectral\
    \ sensors.\nA list of the most used vegetation indices is presented in Table 3.\
    \ For the interpretation of\nthe following formulas, the following abbreviations\
    \ represent the reﬂection in the respective color\nor spectrum:\n•\nR: Red (620–670\
    \ nm)\n•\nG: Green (500–560 nm)\n•\nB: Blue (430–500 nm)\n•\nNIR: Near Infrared\
    \ (720–1500 nm)\n•\nRE: Red Edge (670–720 nm)\nConcerning the multispectral vegetation\
    \ indices, one of the ﬁrst well-known indices was Ratio\nVegetation Index (RVI).\
    \ This index enhances the contrast among vegetation and soil. However, it is\n\
    sensitive to the optical properties of ground. The best known and most widely\
    \ used vegetation index\nis the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\
    \ which is the evolution of RVI and is calculated\nby the visible and near infrared\
    \ light reﬂected from the vegetation. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation\nreﬂects\
    \ more visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\
    \ growth and health\nof many agricultural crops. It is based on absorption in\
    \ Red due to chlorophyll and reﬂectance in NIR.\nRVI and NDVI are calculated as\
    \ shown in Table 3.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n16 of 26\nTable 3. Most used vegetation\
    \ indices.\nVegetation Index\nAbbreviation\nFormula\nVegetation Indices derived\

    Several other VIs have been developed based on NDVI. NDRE uses the method of NDVI\
    \ to\nnormalize the ratio of NIR radiation with Red Edge (RE) radiation. The same\
    \ applies for GNDVI with\nNIR and Green (G) bands.\nFigure 4 shows examples of\
    \ crop maps constructed from information of spectral VIs (NDVI and\nNDRE) in different\
    \ growth stages. We can see that the difference in the maps while the vegetation\n\
    grows is quite clear.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.\nVegetation indices maps of crops in\
    \ different growth stages [29]:\n(a) NDVI maps;\nand (b) NDRE maps\nFocusing on\
    \ the VIs extracted from RGB images, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) and Normalized\n\
    Difference Index (NDI) are the most used indices. ExG is based on the assumption\
    \ that plants display\na clear high degree of greenness, and soil is the only\
    \ background element. Thus, it is calculated\nby doubling the radiation in the\
    \ Green channel minus the radiation in Red and Blue channels.\nNDI was proposed\
    \ to separate plants from soil and residue background images, using only green\
    \ and\nred channels.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n17 of 26\nAlthough the VIs that\
    \ use information in the visible light can be useful for crop monitoring,\nthey\
    \ cannot provide information for several parameters of the vegetation and also\
    \ they are sensitive\nto working environment properties such as the atmosphere,\
    \ lighting, etc. Hyperspectral remote\nsensing is expected to be the future trend\
    \ in crop monitoring and this is mainly because it allows the\ndevelopment of\
    \ new bands combination of vegetation indices. In many cases, it has been proved\
    \ that\nhyperspectral vegetation indices are less sensitive to saturation, change\
    \ in viewing/lighting geometry,\nand atmospheric contamination. The combination\
    \ of new bands can eliminate noise from the working\nenvironment and in the same\
    \ time exploit the information of certain bands and extract information for\n\
    more biophysical features of the vegetation.\n5. Limitations in the Use of UAVs\
    \ for Precision Agriculture\nAlthough the use of UAVs for PA is expanding there\
    \ are several limitations that prevent their\nwider use. The absence of a standardized\
    \ workﬂow leads to the adoption of ad-hoc procedures for\ndeploying PA applications,\
    \ a fact that discourages the relevant stakeholders. In addition, as PA requires\n\
    data-intensive procedures for the exploitation of the images acquired, skilled\
    \ and expert personnel\nis usually needed. This means that an average farmer may\
    \ need training or even been forced to hire\nexperts to assist with the image\
    \ processing, which may be costly. This fact may prohibit the adoption\nof UAV\
    \ technologies from individual farmers with only a few and small agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds.\nThe high investment cost to purchase the Unmanned Aerial System is another\
    \ prohibitive factor.\nProducers with larger cultivated areas and higher proﬁt\
    \ rates are able to use more sophisticated,\nhigh-cost systems, though this is\
    \ not the case for the majority of the ﬁelds in Europe. There were\n10.5 million\
    \ agricultural holdings in the EU in 2016, two-thirds of which were less than\
    \ 5 hectares in\nsize, as shown in the Eurostat survey [140].\nAnother drawback\
    \ stems from UAV technology limitations. Most commercial UAVs have a short\nﬂight\
    \ time, ranging from 20 min to 1 h, covering a very restricted area at every ﬂight.\
    \ UAVs that can\noffer longer ﬂight time are relatively expensive. In addition,\
    \ the effective use of UAVs is prone to\nclimatic conditions. For example, on\
    \ a very windy or rainy day, the ﬂight should be postponed.\nAs the use of UAVs\
    \ for agriculture purposes is considered to be commercial, UAV ﬂights should\n\
    also adhere to the related legislation and national rules. However, the EU regulations\
    \ [141,142] for the\nuse of UAVs will replace national rules from July 2020. In\
    \ practice, these regulations report that, once\nan UAV pilot has received the\
    \ appropriate authorization, he/she will be allowed to freely use UAVs in\nthe\
    \ EU. The EU legislation will cover all types of possible UAVs operations, fostering\
    \ the development\nof innovative applications (e.g., for PA).\nThe EU regulations\
    \ consider three categories of operations:\n1.\nOpen category: Operations in this\
    \ category do not require authorization or pilot license.\nThis category is limited\
    \ to operations: in visual line of sight (VLOS), up to 120 m ﬂight height and\n\
    performed with UAVs compliant with some technical requirements deﬁned.\n2.\nSpeciﬁc\
    \ category: This is the second level of operations, which covers operations that\
    \ are not\ncompliant to the restrictions of the open category and are considered\
    \ “medium risk” operations.\nOperators must perform a risk assessment (using a\
    \ standardized method) and deﬁne mitigation\nmeasures. Operations involving UAVs\
    \ of more than 25 kg or not operated in VLOS will typically\nfall under this category.\
    \ The technical requirements for this category depend on the speciﬁc\nauthorized\
    \ operation.\n3.\nCertiﬁed category: This category is considered high risk and\
    \ includes operations involving large\ndrones in controlled air-spaces. Rules\
    \ applicable to this category will be the same as for manned\naviation. This category\
    \ does not concern the use of UAVs for Precision Agriculture.\nTaking into account\
    \ the rapid developments in UAV technology and the sensors use in PA,\nthe cost\
    \ of the Unmanned Aerial Systems will be reduced in the near future. Practical\
    \ limitations,\nsuch as the short ﬂight time, are also expected to be solved by\
    \ the advancements in technology.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n18 of 26\nThese\
    \ improvements will ensure that farmers can reap more from the use of UAVs for\
    \ remote sensing\nin Precision Agriculture.\n6. Discussion and Conclusions\nIn\
    \ this work, we review 100 recent applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture.\
    \ We present the\nmost frequent applications, the UAV types used and the Unmanned\
    \ Aerial systems architecture for\nPA. Then, we focus on the most used sensors\
    \ for monitoring the crops and the processing methods\nexploiting UAV imagery.\
    \ We show that UAVs can have several applications, however monitoring crop\ngrowth\
    \ is the one that stands out. The following three main processing techniques stand\
    \ out in the\nliterature for exploiting the information acquired:\n1.\nPhotogrammetry\
    \ techniques are used to construct Orthophotos or DEMs from the overlapping\n\
    images acquired. They are used in most of the applications to create vegetation\
    \ maps considering\nseveral characteristics; however, they are also used standalone\
    \ mainly when only RGB sensors\nare available, to exploit the 3D characteristics\
    \ of the vegetation.\n2.\nMachine Learning methods can be used to monitor several\
    \ different characteristics of the crops.\nThey can exploit RGB and/or multispectral/hyperspectral\
    \ images. A very frequent technique\nexploited in the literature is the Object\
    \ Based Image Analysis.\n3.\nVegetation Indices use combinations of the reﬂection\
    \ of several bands obtained by RGB or spectral\nsensors. They are proved to be\
    \ most effective when multispectral or hyperspectral information is\nused. They\
    \ have been used in many recent studies. They have been proved to be very effective\
    \ in\nmonitoring various parameters of the crops, by using different combinations\
    \ of spectral bands.\nIn Figure 5, we present some statistics for the use of sensors\
    \ and processing methods for the\ndifferent applications.\nFigure 5. The use of\
    \ sensors and processing techniques in the different UAVs applications.\nWe can\
    \ observe that there is no standardized workﬂow in most cases and different techniques\n\
    are used to exploit UAV-acquired information for the same type of application.\
    \ For example, looking\nat the sensors and techniques used for monitoring the\
    \ health of the crops, we can see that it is\nrelatively premature. Disease detection\
    \ is mainly applied through temporal analysis of the vegetation’s\ngrowth. However,\
    \ multispectral and hyperspectral sensors seem to have great potential in this\n\
    context. An approach using multispectral sensing technologies could reliably deliver\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, discriminating healthy and unhealthy portions of the vegetation.\
    \ In such an approach, the\nfarmer could locate the “weak” corps ﬁeld areas and\
    \ take timely decisions to save the parts of the crop\nproduction that seem unhealthy.\n\
    On the contrary, considering weed mapping, we can see that some studies use machine\
    \ learning\ntechniques to detect weeds, mainly OBIA, while others use the 3D characteristics\
    \ of the crops though\nDEMs, VIs or other processing methods. Weed detection with\
    \ UAVs based on object-based image\nanalysis seems to be at an advanced stage\
    \ and can be used for site-speciﬁc weed management. We can\nsee that machine learning\
    \ techniques are exploited in 62.50% of the applications that used RGB sensors\n\
    and in all the applications with multispectral sensors.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 349\n19 of 26\nFocusing on UAV-based growth monitoring, many different methods\
    \ are really promising but it\nseems that their integration in a standardized\
    \ workﬂow can improve its applicability and efﬁciency.\nGrowth monitoring and\
    \ yield prediction is most commonly performed with the use of RGB (30%)\nand multispectral\
    \ (59%) sensors. The information acquired is exploited for estimating the density\
    \ of\nproduction and the biomass. The ﬁndings of this review appoint that combining\
    \ information coming\nfrom Vegetation Indices with the 3D characteristics of the\
    \ crops coming from RGB images can improve\nthe accuracy of growth and yield estimation\
    \ methods.\nIn contrast with the above, the use of UAV systems for irrigation\
    \ management is closer to\na standard workﬂow, which involves the use of thermal\
    \ and/or multispectral sensors to monitor the\nneeds of water of different parts\
    \ of the crops. Equipped with thermal sensors, the Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles are\
    \ able to detect possible deﬁciencies in the irrigation of different sites. This\
    \ information\ncan be processed through photogrammetry techniques into a single\
    \ high-resolution vegetation map,\nhighlighting the stressed areas. A map in this\
    \ context can be constructed though the use of some VIs\nwhen multispectral imagery\
    \ is used. Thus, a map such as this can support the producers to apply\nVariable\
    \ Rate Irrigation (VRI) applications.\nFunding: This research was co-funded by\

    crop model Article Open access 14 February 2024 Introduction Climate change, drought,
    and the overexploitation of water resources have led to declines in freshwater
    storage in many vital agricultural regions1, raising concerns surrounding the
    future of food and water security2,3. Irrigation constitutes the largest use of
    freshwater globally4,5, and many regions will need to decrease their agricultural
    water use while maintaining high levels of production to ensure a sustainable
    food and water supply as the population grows6. Proposed options for reducing
    water use include leaving lands fallow, switching to less water-intensive crops,
    adopting water-saving farming practices such as deficit irrigation, and improving
    irrigation efficiency7,8. However, any approach to reducing agricultural water
    use depends on the challenging task of characterizing the amount of water crops
    consume9. While it is possible to monitor volumes of water withdrawn for irrigation,
    this is a poor proxy for the amount of water crops consume through evapotranspiration
    (ET)10. Only some irrigation water results in ET: the rest remains in the system
    as runoff or recharge, though this proportion can vary widely depending on topography,
    climate, soil type, and farming practices11. Agricultural ET, or the increase
    in ET that irrigated agriculture brings, is therefore a critical measure in that
    it represents the amount of water that is actually “consumed” by agriculture.
    This water leaves the watershed entirely as it is evaporated from the soil and
    transpired by crops4. Since agricultural ET represents agricultural water consumption,
    it is key for gauging the potential of fallowing, crop switching, or other farming
    practices to save water12. When compared to total irrigation amounts, agricultural
    ET can also be used to highlight the fraction of irrigation withdrawals that do
    not effectively result in consumptive use13. While this water stays in the system
    and therefore may continue to provide beneficial uses14, it also does not achieve
    its original purpose of contributing to crop growth. Therefore, agricultural ET
    can help calculate irrigation efficiency and identify unnecessary irrigation water
    withdrawals from surface or groundwater reservoirs13. Two methodological challenges
    prevent agricultural ET from being monitored at scale. First, simply measuring
    total ET at scale is a challenge. Second, even when measures of ET are available,
    it is difficult to separate agricultural ET from the total10,15. To measure total
    ET, eddy covariance flux towers are highly accurate for monitoring ET at a single
    location16. However, they are expensive and thus sparse, and they are designed
    to measure ET over uniform vegetation, which is not reflective of complex agricultural
    landscapes17. In the absence of ET measurements, theoretical water demand can
    be simulated based on climate and crop type18,19. Although such tools are helpful
    for water demand planning20, theoretical water demand represents the ET of a crop
    whose water demands are fully met. Therefore, these are likely to overestimate
    actual ET. Additionally, these simulated estimates exclusively reflect variations
    in water demand influenced by factors incorporated into the model, which are often
    limited to crop type and climate21. Therefore, analyses based on these models
    are constrained to examining these specific factors, neglecting other critical
    drivers of ET such as farming practices. Given the scarcity of in situ data and
    the inherent constraints of simulated estimates, accurately gauging total ET at
    scale remains a significant challenge. Addressing the second challenge, even when
    accurate ET measurements are available, isolating agricultural ET from total ET
    is difficult. This step is key for water management, since the resulting metric
    represents the increase in ET attributable to agriculture. To do so, one must
    estimate the naturally-occurring ET that would occur in the absence of irrigated
    agriculture (for example, if the land were left fallow). Most often, this naturally-occurring
    ET is assumed to be equal to precipitation19,22. However, there may be temporal
    lags between precipitation and resulting ET, some precipitation may not result
    in ET at all, and ET may also be supplemented by other sources of water, such
    as near surface groundwater. Together, these challenges leave us with limited
    measurements of ET and no empirical estimates of agricultural ET at large scales,
    inhibiting our ability to form evidence-based water management policies that accurately
    reflect crop water use and potential water savings in agriculture. Recent advances
    in the remote sensing of ET unlock new avenues for research into agricultural
    water consumption. Numerous algorithms for estimating ET using land surface temperature
    and other remote sensing inputs have been validated specifically for use in agricultural
    settings23,24. These advancements have allowed researchers to empirically study
    total ET in agricultural settings25,26. However, despite high-resolution maps
    of ET in agricultural landscapes25,27, the challenge of isolating agricultural
    ET from total ET has been limited to studies in extremely arid regions where irrigation
    is the only source of water available to plants28. Here, we develop a framework
    for measuring agricultural ET at sub-field scales. We use remote sensing to determine
    total ET and combine it with machine learning to estimate naturally-occurring
    ET. First, we retrieve satellite-based remotely sensed total ET estimates from
    the 30m, monthly OpenET ensemble data24 available in the western United States
    starting in 2016. Second, since we can use these same OpenET estimates to directly
    observe naturally-occurring ET over fallow lands, we train a gradient boosting
    algorithm to predict ET over fallow lands. We use information on topography, soil
    quality, climate, and spatial and temporal coordinates as predictors. We then
    use the model to retrieve naturally-occurring ET over all active agricultural
    fields, which we subtract from the remotely-sensed ET to calculate agricultural
    ET. We apply this methodology to calculate agricultural ET across California’s
    Central Valley, one of the world’s most water-stressed and agriculturally productive
    regions29. We use these maps of agricultural ET to calculate the water consumption
    of different crop types, as well as to calculate variability in agricultural ET
    within crop types. These insights allow us to evaluate different strategies that
    have been proposed to save water under the Sustainable Groundwater Management
    Act (SGMA)7, which mandates that all water basins in California reduce groundwater
    pumping to sustainable levels by 204030. Specifically, we compare the ability
    of fallowing, crop switching, and other farming practices to save water by reducing
    agricultural ET. Additionally, we calculate irrigation efficiency to assess the
    potential to reduce irrigation withdrawals without decreasing agricultural ET.
    In the wake of groundwater pumping cutbacks of 20–50% under SGMA7, this work will
    guide water managers in enacting water savings and help predict which land use
    changes are likely to ensue. Results Estimating agricultural ET We calculate agricultural
    ET by retrieving the total ET observed over agricultural areas and subtracting
    naturally-occurring ET (Fig. 1). While total ET estimates are retrieved directly
    from OpenET, we simulate naturally-occurring ET by training a gradient boosting
    regressor to predict the ET observed by OpenET over fallow lands. Our model simulating
    naturally-occurring ET achieves an R2 of .87 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of
    35.5 mm per year (Supplementary Fig. 1). We use a test set made up of 2 km2 held-out
    areas (about four times the area of a large agricultural field in the Central
    Valley). We do not find that error is structured across either space (Supplementary
    Figs. 2 and 3) or time (Supplementary Fig. 4). Fig. 1: Estimates of annual agricultural
    evapotranspiration (ET) over active agricultural lands in California’s Central
    Valley. a Total ET is remotely sensed and is retrieved from OpenET. b Naturally-occurring
    ET is an estimate of the ET that would be present if the agricultural lands were
    fallow, and is predicted using machine learning. c Agricultural ET is the difference
    between total and naturally-occurring ET, and represents our estimate of the ET
    caused by agriculture, and therefore the water that would be conserved if the
    land were fallow instead of cropped. The variations in agricultural ET across
    the landscape suggest that different fields can have vastly different abilities
    to conserve water. OpenET provides ET data at the scale of 30 m; all figure panels
    here show ET resampled to 70 m resolution for computational efficiency and to
    better match average field size. Full size image Variation in agricultural ET
    within and across crop types We leverage the significant variability in agricultural
    ET observed across the Central Valley (Fig. 1) to analyze the factors driving
    these variations. Crop type, which is commonly cited as an important variable
    explaining differences in agricultural ET19, explains 34% of the variation in
    estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (4), Supplementary Fig. 5). In Fig. 2, we show
    the water intensity of different crop groups (Supplementary Note 7). Deciduous
    fruits and nuts are some of the highest consumers at 625 mm per year (582–668
    95% CI) (Fig. 2), particularly almonds at 715 mm per year (651–778 95% CI) (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Conversely, grain and hay crops consume only 141 mm per year (111–171
    95% CI). These broad variations in the water consumption of different crop types
    align with previous work estimating crop water demands (Supplementary Note 1,
    Supplementary Fig. 6) and suggest that substantial water savings may be possible
    with crop switching. Fig. 2: Variations in annual agricultural evapotranspiration
    (ET) across and within crop groups. Mean agricultural ET by crop group (blue fill
    and 95% CI) is the average difference between total ET (black outline) and naturally-occurring
    ET (cream fill). All measures are summed across the year, leading to naturally-occurring
    and total ET estimates that include water consumption occurring outside of the
    growing season. While we find significant differences in mean agricultural ET
    across crop groups, the gray box plots also show a broad spread in agricultural
    ET within crop groups (box plots show 0.5, 0.25. 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles).
    Full size image However, the majority of the variation remains unexplained by
    crop type (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 5). This within-crop variability is not
    uniform for different crops: crops such as deciduous fruits and nuts tend to have
    large variances, whereas rice has a very small variance. For example, pistachios
    have the most variability with an interquartile range (IQR) of 664 mm per year
    over the whole state. Conversely, rice has an IQR of only 122 mm per year (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Part of the large variability in agricultural ET for deciduous fruits
    and nuts can be explained by orchard age: young orchards consume significantly
    less water than more mature ones (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7).
    Climate, topography, and soil quality explain an additional 6% of within-crop
    variation. However, substantial within-crop variation remains, indicating that
    some of these differences may be due to variations in farming practices. This
    would suggest that reducing water consumption without switching crops may be feasible,
    which we explore in the next section. The water-saving potential of different
    management strategies The variability of agricultural ET both within and between
    crops allows us to evaluate the water saving-potential of different management
    strategies. Here, we compare the effect of three scenarios on reducing agricultural
    ET in groundwater sub-basins across the Central Valley: 1. Crop switching: Substitute
    high-ET crops for the median water-consuming crop (Eq. (6)). 2. Farming practices:
    Keep the same spatial allocation of crops, but reduce agricultural ET of high
    consumers to the median, crop-specific, consumption level (Eq. (7)). 3. Fallowing:
    Fallow the 5% of lands with the highest estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (8)). Because
    it would not be realistic to prescribe farmers in different contexts to consume
    similar amounts of water, we calculate crop-specific agricultural ET and within-crop
    variation at the level of groundwater sub-basins. We additionally control for
    differences in climate, topography, and soil type before conducting the scenarios.
    To account for the effects of orchard age, we remove orchards that have been bearing
    fruit for 5 years or less or that are in their last year of production (Supplementary
    Fig. 7). We find that each of these scenarios return similar reductions in overall
    water consumption of around 10% (Fig. 3). Since crops with high agricultural ET
    are heavily favored in most sub-basins and therefore the median crop usually has
    a high agricultural ET, crop switching only results in a 9.9% reduction in agricultural
    ET. In order to achieve greater water savings, crops would need to be switched
    to less popular crops with lesser water demands: switching all crops to the lowest
    consuming crop in a sub-basin results in a 93.8% reduction in agricultural ET.
    While strategies that do not require a change in land cover type are less commonly
    cited as a water management approach, we find that reducing high consumers to
    their crops’s median consumption level yields similar water savings of up to 11.3%.
    Fallowing does, however, remain the most effective way to reduce agricultural
    ET. We find that leaving a mere 5% of land fallow results in a 9.3% consumption
    reduction, comparable to the savings afforded by crop switching and within-crop
    scenarios which by definition affect up to 50% of lands. Fig. 3: The percent reduction
    in agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) driven by various management scenarios.
    a Savings accrued by substituting high-ET crops for the median water-consuming
    crop in a sub-basin. b Water savings without changing land cover by reducing agricultural
    ET of high consumers to the median, crop- and sub-basin-specific, consumption
    level. c Water savings from fallowing the 5% of lands with the highest estimated
    agricultural ET. Full size image Irrigation efficiency While fallowing, crop switching,
    and other farming practices highlight opportunities to decrease agricultural ET,
    we also find opportunities to diminish runoff and deep percolation during conveyance,
    on-farm management, or application (Fig. 4). On average, we find that irrigation
    in the Central Valley is 61.8% (54.0–69.7%) efficient, similar in magnitude to
    what theoretical estimates predict (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 8).
    The large disparity in efficiency between northern and southern counties is, however,
    more pronounced than theoretical estimates (Supplementary Fig. 8). As a result,
    there may be limited potential to decrease water withdrawn for irrigation in the
    south which achieves efficiencies as high as 80%. The particularly low efficiencies
    in the northern counties, however, suggest a large potential to decrease irrigation
    water withdrawals without affecting agricultural ET. Fig. 4: Irrigation efficiency
    across the counties of the Central Valley. a Irrigation efficiency is calculated
    by dividing agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) (gridded data) by USGS county-level
    reports of irrigation amounts (blue polygons). For the calculation, agricultural
    ET is averaged to the county level to match the spatial scale of the irrigation
    data. Additionally, irrigation is displayed in volumetric units (teragrams), but
    is divided by county-level cropland area to be in units consistent with agricultural
    ET prior to the calculation. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted
    at the point of use, rather than the water’s point of origin. b The resulting
    county-level irrigation efficiency estimates vary widely across the Central Valley,
    with particularly low efficiencies in the northern counties. Full size image Discussion
    By empirically quantifying crop water consumption at sub-field scales, we contribute
    to characterizing agriculture’s hydrological effects and evaluate the ability
    of different management strategies to mitigate this impact. To overcome the methodological
    challenges associated with estimating agricultural ET, we leverage recent advances
    in remotely sensed ET and use machine learning to generate a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual. The fine scale variability in agricultural ET we uncover allows
    us to analyze the drivers of these differences and simulate the potential for
    different management practices to save water, including under-explored ones like
    adjusting farming practices. Additionally, when comparing agricultural ET to total
    water withdrawn for irrigation, we find substantial opportunities for improvements
    in irrigation efficiency in the northern counties of the Central Valley. High-resolution
    maps of agricultural ET can therefore guide our understanding of how agriculture
    and management can affect water resources in California and other water stressed
    agricultural regions globally. Accurate agricultural ET measures are crucial to
    characterize anthropogenic impacts on the hydrological cycle31 and enact effective
    water management18,32. Previously, agricultural ET has been estimated by (i) simulating
    crop water demand based on crop type and climate and (ii) removing naturally available
    water by subtracting precipitation19,22. However, both of these steps embed assumptions
    that can lead to significant biases. For (i), simulated crop water demand may
    not adequately represent the field characteristics or farming practices of a given
    location13. For example, water demands are not necessarily always met, meaning
    water consumption may be overestimated33,34,35. In line with this, while we generally
    find good agreement with crop water demand simulated by the CalSIMETAW model21,
    we do find that agricultural ET estimates are significantly smaller (Supplementary
    Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 6). For (ii), using precipitation to proxy for naturally-occurring
    ET fails to account for precipitation being lost as runoff, temporal lags in when
    precipitation is transpired, and alternative natural sources of water such as
    shallow groundwater. We find that the bias between our estimates and CalSIMETAW
    estimates increases when precipitation, rather than naturally-occurring ET, is
    used to represent baseline amounts of available water. This can be explained by
    the seasonal mismatch between precipitation and naturally-occurring ET: although
    annually there is more precipitation than naturally-occurring ET, precipitation
    mainly occurs in the winter when it is unavailable to most crops. Because using
    precipitation as a proxy for naturally-occurring ET does not account for moisture
    that remains in the soil by the time the growing season begins, this inflates
    simulated estimates of crop water demand. Our use of remotely sensed ET estimates
    and our ability to estimate naturally-occurring ET therefore allows us to more
    accurately characterize agricultural ET. High-resolution, empirical estimates
    of agricultural ET additionally open up the possibility to investigate differences
    in agricultural ET beyond what is attributable to crop type, which we find only
    accounts for 34% of the variation. These within-crop variations can be substantial
    for many crops: the difference in agricultural ET of a pistachio field from the
    75th to the 25th percentile is the same as the water that could be saved from
    fallowing an alfalfa field. Such broad variability is consistent with findings
    from studies comparing total ET across crops during the growing season25,26. Even
    after adjusting for variability attributable to field characteristics, orchard
    age, and climate, we find that these variations could translate to substantial
    water savings without requiring a change in crop type. Unfortunately, a lack of
    high-resolution data on field-scale farming practices and yields inhibits further
    analysis of specific practices driving agricultural ET variation and their economic
    implications. However, prior literature from experimental plots or particular
    locations suggests that mulching36, conservation tillage37, deficit irrigation33,34,35,
    and improved irrigation scheduling and technologies38 all have potential to limit
    agricultural ET. These practices may prove advantageous relative to costly strategies
    like crop-switching or fallowing, though more detailed cost-benefit analyses are
    necessary to determine the suitability of various interventions in specific contexts39.
    Such water saving farming practices are not mentioned in the plans drafted by
    SGMA water managers7. This is possibly due to a lack of conclusive research on
    the potential of such strategies to effectively decrease agricultural ET without
    significant effects on yield or operation cost. Spatial data on the use of these
    different practices would allow researchers to take full advantage of our high-resolution
    agricultural ET estimates and study their water-saving and economic benefits.
    In situ assessments of crop-specific water consumption and other variations in
    agricultural ET enable us to model potential water savings across diverse management
    scenarios. In addition to previously mentioned scenarios based on farming practices,
    we also investigate more traditionally studied strategies, such as crop switching
    and fallowing. Consistent with prior studies relying on crop water demand simulations,
    our research suggests that transitioning to crops with lower water requirements
    is an effective conservation strategy. However, accruing substantial water savings
    requires embracing less popular crops like grains and hay20. The feasibility of
    increasing production of these crops in the Central Valley is uncertain due to
    high labor and operational costs20. Furthermore, any form of crop switching entails
    expenses related to the adoption of new knowledge, technologies, and market adjustments40,41.
    Consequently, the viability of a significant shift towards less water-demanding
    crops, and its alignment with market expansion, remains uncertain20. Therefore,
    our findings support the notion that extensive fallowing or land retirement may
    be essential to achieve substantial reduction targets in areas with severe overdrafts42,43.
    Considering the risk of increased dust from unused land, repurposing such areas
    for habitat restoration, flood water capture for groundwater replenishment44,
    solar energy production, or sustainable industrial development45 could mitigate
    the economic impacts of land retirement for both farmers and local communities.
    Detailed agricultural ET maps like the ones generated for this study can help
    determine the scale of land repurposing needed and identify priority areas for
    such initiatives under different constraints, including existing water rights46.
    Finally, we find a significant opportunity to improve irrigation efficiency, especially
    in the northern part of the Central Valley where we find lower irrigation efficiency
    than previously expected (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7). This implies
    that farmers in these areas could potentially reduce their irrigation water usage
    without negatively impacting agricultural ET and, consequently, crop growth. Although
    this finding is consistent with management strategies that focus on boosting irrigation
    efficiency7, it is important to recognize that such improvements may not automatically
    lead to water savings at the watershed level14. This is because water not consumed
    in irrigation processes does not always exit the watershed but can instead be
    reabsorbed into groundwater reservoirs or surface water bodies for later reuse.
    Conversely, water that is evapotranspired, which constitutes the ‘efficient’ part
    of irrigation, is completely removed from the watershed14. Hence, paradoxically,
    increasing irrigation efficiency could reduce water availability if it is not
    matched by a decrease in the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation. To prevent
    an unintended increase in water consumption, managers could use agricultural ET
    maps to monitor and control water use as improvements in irrigation efficiency
    are implemented. This study has some important limitations. Most notably, due
    to a lack of data on farming practices, it is difficult to ascertain whether the
    variation in within-crop agricultural ET that we estimate is indeed due to farming
    practices. When conducting our management scenarios, we account for the effects
    of climate, soil quality, topography, and orchard age. We additionally conduct
    the scenarios at the level of small groundwater sub-basins rather than across
    the entire valley to account for any additional regional environmental differences
    we are unable to otherwise account for. However, variance stemming from error
    in our agricultural ET estimates or from mislabeled crop types could contribute
    to observed within-crop variation in agricultural ET. We minimize error from mislabeled
    crop types by using the most accurate crop data available in California which
    boasts an accuracy of 97.6%47. Additionally, the OpenET ensemble model has been
    extensively validated24,48, and our machine learning model has an R2 of .87. We
    estimate that these sources of error are responsible for only 11% of the variance
    in our yearly agricultural ET estimates (Supplementary Note 4). Nevertheless,
    the water-saving potentials we calculate for both the fallowing and farmers practice
    scenarios should be interpreted as upper bound estimates. Another important limitation
    of this study stems from the limited data available on water withdrawn for irrigation
    which is needed to calculate irrigation efficiency. Since irrigation data are
    not available over the same years as agricultural ET, we use the average of the
    two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, a drought year and non-drought year, to
    calculate irrigation efficiency. To ensure that our results are robust to year-to-year
    variations in agricultural ET and irrigation use, we calculate irrigation efficiency
    using all the possible combinations of years (Supplementary Fig. 9). Though we
    do find significant variations based on the irrigation year used in some counties,
    we consistently find low irrigation efficiencies in the north and higher ones
    in the south. Irrigation data with better spatial and temporal resolution would
    improve estimates of irrigation efficiency calculated using this method. We have
    shown how highly resolved agricultural ET estimates can improve our understanding
    of anthropogenic impacts on the hydrologic cycle and guide water management by
    quantifying the potential of different water-saving strategies. In California,
    our findings suggest that irrigated agriculture increases ET less than previously
    estimated, and we find that managers may not need to rely as heavily on changes
    in land cover as currently proposed to achieve significant water savings. Because
    our method for estimating agricultural ET is based entirely on remote sensing
    and machine learning, it remains cost effective and has the potential to be used
    globally, especially as global ET datasets become increasingly available49. This
    work can help refine our understanding of agriculture’s effect on water resources
    and help managers achieve water-saving goals in water-stressed agricultural landscapes
    across the globe. Methods Agricultural ET We define agricultural ET as the difference
    between total ET over an agricultural parcel and the ET that would have been,
    had that parcel been fallow land instead (Eq. (1)). This definition recognizes
    that not all ET over agricultural lands, during the growing season or otherwise,
    can necessarily be attributed to agriculture. Such a definition is particularly
    useful from a management perspective, since it denotes the decrease in ET, or
    water savings, that one might expect if agriculture were to cease. $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{tot}}}}}}}}}-{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{nat}}}}}}}}}\\end{array}$$
    (1) where ETag is agricultural ET, ETtot is the total ET over an agricultural
    parcel, and ETnat is the counterfactual ET that would occur naturally, were the
    same land fallow. We note that another, theoretically distinct counterfactual
    could be constructed to represent ETnat: ET if the land were undisturbed, natural
    land rather than fallow. We elect to simulate ET over fallow lands since it allows
    us to predict the potential water savings from fallowing, which has a management
    relevant interpretation. Total ET estimates We construct ETtot from OpenET ensemble
    data, available at a monthly time step from 2016-2021. This data is calculated
    as the average output of six different ET models estimated using Landsat data24.
    The data have been corrected for biases in ET resulting from data only being available
    during cloudless overpasses and have been extensively evaluated over a broad variety
    of land covers48. While they are published at a 30m scale, we resample to 70m
    to improve computational efficiency since this is well below the average size
    of an agricultural field in the Central Valley. Calculation of a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual using machine learning We estimate naturally-occurring ET for
    all agricultural pixels using a gradient boosting regressor trained on data from
    fallow lands. We choose a gradient boosting regressor due to its high flexibility
    in learning non-linear relationships and proven performance on tabular datasets
    relative to other regressors50. We retrieve the locations of fallow fields in
    the Central Valley from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) statewide crop
    mapping dataset over available years: 2016, 2018, and 2019. Pixels that are within
    the top 5% ET during July-September are removed due to some implausibly high numbers
    during these months that suggest mislabeling of an active agricultural pixel as
    fallow. While we believe that this data cleaning step is important to ensure an
    unbiased training set, omitting this step does not significantly change our main
    findings (Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Figs. 10–12). We additionally find
    that our findings do not change when training our model on data that are marked
    fallow by both the DWR dataset and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) (Supplementary
    Note 6, Supplementary Figs. 13–15). We predict naturally-occurring ET based on
    latitude and longitude, the month and year, as well as a broad set of additional
    variables describing topography (elevation, aspect, slope, topographic wetness
    index), soil quality (California Storie Index), and climate (Potential ET). The
    latitude, longitude, and month and year indicators are included to capture the
    spatial and temporal patterns in ET underlying the densely distributed fallow
    fields in our dataset. However, the inclusion of an indicator variable for each
    year in our model limits our analysis to 2016, 2018, and 2019, as these are the
    only years for which we have available land cover data. Nevertheless, given that
    ‘year’ contributes a mere 3% to our model’s predictive capability (see Supplementary
    Fig. 17), it may be considered non-essential for future research in this area.
    Including additional predictors in our model presents two benefits. First, they
    can improve the model’s predictive power. For example, we find that Potential
    ET contributes greatly to the model’s final predictions (Supplementary Fig. 17).
    Other variables are important to include because they can help correct for systematic
    differences between the fallow lands used to train our model and the active agricultural
    lands we apply the model to. Such differences could arise from farmers selecting
    lands to be fallowed due to their inherently lower productivity, which would negatively
    bias our estimates of counterfactual naturally-occurring ET in locations actively
    being cropped today. To assemble these predictor variables, we retrieve topographic
    information from the USGS National Elevations Database, soil quality information
    from the California Storie Index in the the USDA’s gSSURGO and STATSGO2 datasets,
    and Potential ET from the hPET global dataset51. To validate our naturally-occurring
    ET model, we split our dataset, reserving 60% for training, 10% for validation,
    and 30% for testing. In order to ensure that nearby and therefore very similar
    pixels are not present across multiple splits, we group our splits by 2 km2 squares,
    four times the size of a large agricultural field in the Central Valley. The entire
    dataset is made up of over 16 million pixels populating 8180 distinct 2 km2 regions.
    We set aside 4908 of these 2 km2 clusters for training, amounting to nearly 10
    million pixels. The testing split is composed of 2454 clusters. We tune hyperparameters
    using 100 iterations of a threefold randomized search cross-validation on an unclustered
    subset of our dataset. Randomized search cross-validation is similar to grid search
    cross-validation, but only reaches a random subset of the possible hyperparameter
    combinations to improve computational efficiency. We manually set the minimum
    number of samples required to split a node to 200 and the minimum number of samples
    required at each leaf node to 100 to account for the large size and spatial clustering
    of the dataset. Because we carry out our analyses using yearly estimates of agricultural
    ET, we validate our model on yearly estimates of naturally-occurring ET. Only
    fallow lands from the test data split are used in any subsequent analyses on fallow
    lands. Analysis After computing agricultural ET for all fields across the Central
    Valley following Eq. (1), we report a variety of statistical summaries and conduct
    scenarios manipulating the spatial distribution of agricultural ET. In order to
    ensure our analyses only capture variations across space, we aggregate our observations
    of agricultural ET to a yearly timestep and control for variation across years
    before beginning this analysis. To do so, we calculate an “adjusted” agricultural
    ET for each pixel by removing the difference between the mean agricultural ET
    for that year and the overall sample mean agricultural ET from the original agricultural
    ET calculation, as follows: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}-(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}-\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}})$$
    (2) where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) is the agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, ETp,y is the original
    agricultural ET, \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}\\) is the mean agricultural
    ET in year y across all pixels and \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}\\) is
    the mean agricultural ET across all pixels and years. Regressions To calculate
    point estimates and confidence intervals for the overall mean agricultural ET
    (Eq. (3)), the mean agricultural ET by crop group or crop type (Supplementary
    Note 7), or the mean agricultural ET by county (used to calculate irrigation efficiency)
    (Eq. (4)), we conduct a series of regressions with the following format: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\epsilon
    }_{p,y}$$ (3) $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={\\beta }_{p,y}\\times
    {{{{{{{{\\rm{Group}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p,y}}}}}}}}}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}$$ (4)
    where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) represents agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, α is a coefficient
    indicating the mean agricultural ET across all samples, Groupp,y represents a
    vector of dummy variables indicating which crop (for crop comparisons shown in
    Figs. 2 and S5) or county (for irrigation efficiency calculations shown in Fig.
    4; county does not vary by year) observation p, y falls into, βp,y is a corresponding
    vector of coefficients indicating the average agricultural ETs for each crop or
    county group, and ϵp,y is an error term. Standard errors are calculated using
    75 km clusters, as determined by plotting a variogram of the spatial autocorrelation
    in agricultural ET (Supplementary Fig. 16). The aggregate crop group (Fig. 2)
    and detailed crop type (Supplementary Fig. 5) are each assigned using the same
    DWR land cover data used to determine fallow status. In addition to using regression
    to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals, regression allows us to
    calculate the proportion of variation that is explained by a set of variables.
    This is because the R2 corresponds to the fraction of variation explained by the
    regression. We use this to assess the % variation explained by crop type, using
    Eq. (4), as well as that explained by climate, topography, and soil quality: $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\beta
    }_{p,y}\\times {X}_{p,y}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}\\end{array}$$ (5) where α is the intercept,
    Xp,y is a vector of variables including PET, elevation, aspect, slope, TWI, and
    soil quality, βp,y is a vector of coefficients for each variable in Xp,y, and
    ϵp,y is an error term. Management scenarios We conduct three scenarios in which
    we manipulate agricultural ET to mimic land management changes and report the
    decrease in overall agricultural ET within groundwater sub-basins across the Central
    Valley. Eq. (6) is a crop switching scenario (cs) where pixels with agricultural
    ET values above those of the median crop in a given sub-basin are replaced with
    that median crop. Eq. (7) is a farming practice scenario (fp) where pixels with
    agricultural ET values above crop and sub-basin-specific mean values are replaced
    with that crop and sub-basin mean. Finally, Eq. (8) is a fallowing scenario (fal)
    which replaces all pixels with agricultural ET values above the sub-basin-specific
    95th percentile with a value of zero agricultural ET. $${{{{{{{{\\rm{Savings}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{cs}}}}}}}}}=1-\\frac{\\mathop{\\sum
    }\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}\\min ({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b},{{{{{{{\\rm{Median}}}}}}}}{({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b})}_{b})\\left.\\right)}{\\mathop{\\sum

    0,\\quad &\\,{{\\mbox{otherwise}}}\\,\\end{array}\\right.}{\\mathop{\\sum }\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{i}}$$
    (8) where ETi is the adjusted agricultural ET for observation i, ETc,b is the
    average agricultural ET for crop type c in groundwater sub-basin \\(b,{{{{{{{\\rm{Median}}}}}}}}{({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b})}_{b}\\)
    is the median ETc,b in sub-basin b, and ET.95,b is the 95th percentile of agricultural
    ET in sub-basin b. To ensure that the water savings identified in our scenarios
    result from factors that can be influenced by management interventions, we account
    for orchard age, climate, and other physical characteristics of the land. To account
    for orchard age, we remove young orchards that are have been bearing fruit for
    5 or less years, or old orchards that are going to be removed within the next
    year (Supplementary Note 2). Because we are only able to label orchard age in
    this way for all orchards in year 2019 (the DWR crop type data we use are only
    available starting 2014), we exclusively use 2019 for this part of the analysis.
    Since we are only using one year, we do not adjust the water use according to
    the year like we do for the other analyses. To account for differences in climate
    and other characteristics inherent to the land, we control for potential ET, soil
    quality, topographic wetness index, elevation, aspect and slope using linear regression
    (Eq. (5)). Irrigation efficiency We define irrigation efficiency as the proportion
    of irrigation water that results in agricultural ET, and is thus consumed by agriculture
    (Eq. (9)). To determine amounts of water withdrawn for irrigation, we retrieve
    county level irrigation water use data from the USGS National Water Information
    System. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted at the point of use,
    rather than the water’s point of origin. These data are gathered every five years
    with the most recently available data from 2015. Because there is no match for
    the years of available irrigation data and our agricultural ET estimates from
    2016, 2018, and 2019, we use the two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, which represent
    a non-drought year and a drought year, respectively. $${{{{{{{\\rm{IRRIGATION}}}}}}}}\\,{{{{{{{\\rm{EFFICIENCY}}}}}}}}=\\frac{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\\rm{Irrigation}}}}}}}}}$$
    (9) where ETag is agricultural ET (Eq. (1)) and Irrigation is the water withdrawn
    for irrigation. ETag and Irrigation must be in matching units, either volumetric
    or depth. We calculate both in mm per year. We assume all active agricultural
    lands in the Central Valley are irrigated and calculate the average agricultural
    ET in mm per year over active agricultural lands in each county. To also retrieve
    average irrigation amount across irrigated lands in a county in mm per year, we
    divide the volume of irrigation water by the average area of irrigated land in
    each county. Because some counties are not fully encompassed within the Central
    Valley, we assume that irrigation in a given county is evenly distributed over
    irrigated lands within and outside of the Central Valley. Data availability The

    accurately estimates IWU and incorporates theory-guided module to reveal implicit
    irrigation signal 1 Introduction Irrigation is a critical agricultural practice
    essential for crop growth and enhancing grain production. It also accounts for
    over 70% of the world''s freshwater withdrawal (Siebert et al., 2015). In China,
    irrigated croplands constitute approximately 50% of the total cropland area but
    contribute significantly, contributing to about 75% of the nation''s total grain
    output (C. Zhang et al., 2022). This highlights the substantial impact of irrigation
    on China''s agricultural landscape and places considerable demands on its limited
    freshwater resources (Kang et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2015). Recent studies suggest
    that unsustainable water use, where water consumption exceeds local renewable
    capacity, has accounted for 66% of China''s irrigation water use (IWU) (Rosa et
    al., 2019). Moreover, as irrigation involves direct human intervention in the
    natural water cycle, adopting unsound irrigation practices can detrimentally affect
    the regional ecological environment. These practices can lead to adverse consequences
    such as groundwater depletion and land salinization (W. Liu et al., 2022; J. Wu
    et al., 2013). Therefore, accurate IWU estimation is pivotal not only for sustainable
    water resources management and food security but also for assessing the profound
    environmental impact associated with human irrigation practices (Fisher et al.,
    2017). The conventional approach of obtaining IWU relies heavily on statistics
    provided by irrigation district management departments, which demand considerable
    manpower and material resources due to the diversity of irrigation schemes, infrastructure,
    and crop types across regions (X. Li et al., 2020). Recent advancements in satellite
    sensors have facilitated the use of remote sensing technology to obtain irrigation-related
    variables such as evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation, offering a potential
    avenue for large-scale IWU estimation (AghaKouchak et al., 2015; Y. Chen et al.,
    2019). Various approaches have emerged to estimate IWU. Brocca et al. (2013) proposed
    the SM2RAIN algorithm, which calculates the total water entering irrigated farmland
    based on the water balance equation and then estimates IWU by subtracting local
    precipitation. However, reliance on rainfall data presents reliability challenges
    at a large scale. S. V. Kumar et al. (2015) and Zaussinger et al. (2019) integrated
    microwave soil moisture (SM) products and modeled SM products without an explicit
    irrigation scheme to capture irrigation signals through product residuals. Yet,
    limitations such as coarse resolution and data gaps in SM products constrain the
    effectiveness of this method. Moreover, these theory-based methods often rely
    on energy balance models or water balance models to quantitatively describe the
    complex relationships between IWU and related variables, leading to significant
    uncertainty in IWU estimation. Recent researcher has proposed methods to mitigate
    uncertainty by integrating multisource products (K. Zhang et al., 2022; Zohaib
    & Choi, 2020), but these theory-based methods remain constrained by model limitations
    and data gaps. Machine learning (ML) stands as a promising avenue for IWU estimation,
    offering an alternative to theory-based methods by leveraging historical data
    to discern underlying patterns and rules, rather than explicitly modeling physical
    relationships between variables (Reichstein et al., 2019). The application potential
    of ML in hydrology and agriculture has been extensively explored. For example,
    as early as 1995, the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in simulating
    rainfall-runoff processes was demonstrated (Hsu et al., 1995). Similarly, other
    ML methods such as Random Forest (RF) have been utilized in hydrology and agriculture
    to predict various factors such as yield, fertilizer requirements, and pesticide
    usage (Everingham et al., 2016; Sherafatpour et al., 2019). Despite these advancements,
    there has been limited exploration of ML''s potential for IWU estimation. One
    challenge is selecting the most suitable ML model, given the multitude of models
    developed over decades, each with specific advantages. One potential solution
    is integrating results from different ML approaches. For instance, Fleming et
    al. (2021) employed multi-model averaging to integrate water supply forecasts
    in the western US from six different supervised learning algorithms, demonstrating
    the benefits of multi-model ensemble techniques. In addition to multi-model averaging,
    Bayesian approaches are increasingly recognized for their ability to harmonize
    information from observations and diverse outcomes generated by various ML models
    (Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2021). Within the Bayesian framework, this amalgamation
    produces a probability distribution of ensemble members, offering a perspective
    for multi-model ensemble. Furthermore, the aforementioned theory-based IWU estimating
    approaches provide several theory-guided knowledges that reflect irrigation information.
    While ML is primarily data-driven, incorporating these theory-guided knowledges
    into ML models may enhance their effectiveness (Karpatne et al., 2017). On the
    other hand, high-quality data sets with high spatiotemporal resolution are required
    for all existing methods. However, current remote sensing products could not fully
    meet these requirements due to factors such as satellite orbit and sensor performance
    (Dorigo et al., 2010). Prevalent surface soil moisture (SSM) products such as
    Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and ESA CCI suffer from coarse spatial resolution
    and data gaps, leading to considerable uncertainty in IWU estimation (Y. Y. Liu
    et al., 2012). Consequently, there is a pressing need to explore effective data
    filling methods to enhance the usability of these SSM products (K. Liu et al.,
    2023). Similarly, data sets associated with ET models, such as MODIS (Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), pose their own challenges. Data gaps and
    the temporal synthesis of provided data at 8-day intervals present substantial
    obstacles for methods reliant on daily data (Cammalleri et al., 2013). To address
    these constraints, there is growing recognition of the value of process-based
    ET models. Models like the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Penman-Monteith-Leuning
    (PML) offer the capability to quantify intricate spatiotemporal dynamics of thermal
    and water processes (Yao et al., 2013). However, it is essential to note that
    thermal-based ET models, notably Surface Energy Balance System and surface energy
    balance algorithm for land (SEBAL), demonstrate remarkable accuracy in irrigation
    croplands (Ma et al., 2012). Their sensitivity to changes in surface temperature
    and SM makes them suitable for regions where irrigation significantly alters the
    surface energy balance (Knipper et al., 2018). Within irrigated croplands, these
    models excel in capturing the precise impact of irrigation practices on ET, surpassing
    the capabilities of some conventional methods. Given these considerations, addressing
    the demand for higher-quality data sets related to irrigation variables emerges
    as a matter of utmost urgency. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework that
    integrates data-driven models with theory-guided strategies to calculate China''s
    IWU for three staple cereal crops. Leveraging high-resolution time series remote
    sensing data, our framework drives a range of ML methods, augmented by the integration
    of Bayesian mechanism. The main objectives of our study are threefold: (a) to
    generate high resolution time series of ET and SSM using remote sensing data sets;
    (b) to assess the effectiveness of theory-guided data-driven models in estimating
    IWU across different crops in China; and (c) to evaluate the uncertainty associated
    with the proposed model. 2 Study Region and Study Design 2.1 Study Region Our
    study focuses on the Chinese mainland, a vast region comprising 31 provinces,
    characterized by complex crop planting structures and cropping intensity (Piao
    et al., 2010). The staple cereal crops cultivated in this region are wheat, rice,
    and maize, collectively contributing to over 90% of the total grain output (Luo
    et al., 2020). Figure 1a illustrates the geographic distribution of these crops.
    Rice cultivation is predominant in the humid regions of South and Central China,
    with some cultivation also observed in Northeast China. In contrast, wheat and
    maize are primarily grown in the relatively arid regions of North China. Additionally,
    a substantial portion of croplands in these regions practices multi-cropped, such
    as maize-wheat rotation, which is prevalent in the North China Plain. Figure 1b
    presents the proportions of reported IWU for three cereal crops across provinces.
    Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Study region. (a) Distribution of 12
    stations along with the cultivation regions of three cereal crops. The dark blue
    region represents areas where maize and wheat rotation are prevalent. (b) Proportion
    of irrigation water use for the three cereal crops in each province. (c) Distribution
    of the Aridity index across the study region. To evaluate the performance of the
    proposed method across diverse climatic regions, we categorized the study area
    into four sub-regions based on the Aridity index (Figure 1c). These sub-regions,
    delineated using natural breaks (Jenks), comprise the Arid region (AI < 0.22),
    Semi-Arid region (0.22 < AI < 0.53), Semi-Humid region (0.53 < AI < 0.96), and
    Humid region (AI > 0.96). 2.2 Study Design The proposed hybrid framework for estimating
    IWU comprises three main components (Figure 2): theory-based processes implementation,
    data-driven models establishment and integration, and performance analysis. Figure
    2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flowchart of the proposed framework. The primary
    objective of estimating IWU using ML is feature selection. IWU is defined by the
    generalized water balance formula as the residual between ET, drainage (D), soil
    water storage dynamic (dSM), and precipitation (P) for each time step (t) (Y.
    Chen et al., 2019; C. Zhang & Long, 2021): (1) Applying theory-guided strategies
    to these variables could yield features that better capture irrigation signals.
    Part 1 of our framework employs two theory-guided strategies to enhance irrigation
    information within SM data: converting the original SM data into its logarithmic
    form (details in Section 12) and extracting SM residuals (details in Section 13).
    The outputs of Part 1 are three theory-guided features related to SM: lnSSM, lnRZSM,
    and soil moisture residuals (ResSM). These features, along with precipitation
    and ET, constitute all the features utilized in this study. Subsequently, Part
    2 of our framework utilizes these features and reported IWU to drive five ML models
    and generate corresponding IWU estimations (details in Section 14). Furthermore,
    the Bayesian three-cornered hat (BTCH) approach is applied to integrate the IWU
    estimations generated by the five ML models (details in Section 15). Part 3 of
    our framework primarily focuses on performance analysis. To verify the applicability
    of our proposed framework, we estimated the IWU at field stations based on the
    same process, but replacing satellite data with field measurements. The uncertainty
    analysis includes multiple error sources potentially affecting model performance,
    such as the quality of remote sensing products and the number of training samples.
    To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed theory-guided strategies, we designed
    an ablation experiment to observe model performance without these strategies.
    We also compared the results between our work and two previous theory-based IWU
    estimating studies. 3 Materials and Methods 3.1 Data Set A variety of remote sensing-derived
    products were collected to establish and evaluate national IWU, including precipitation,
    ET, and SM. A distribution and phenology data set were used to filter these remote
    sensing products temporally and spatially. Among these gridded data sets, SM was
    initially processed as the average value during the annual phenological period,
    while precipitation and ET were treated as cumulative values. After temporal filtering,
    these parameters were spatially accumulated to match the distribution of the three
    cereal crops. Field measurements from stations were collected to validate the
    accuracy of these products. Multiple sources of products were introduced to assess
    the potential uncertainty associated with satellite-derived products on a large
    scale. Detailed information regarding these data sets can be found in Table 1.

    Ministry of Water Resources Annual City level 3.1.1 Precipitation We used the
    Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data set during 2003–2013 as a crucial
    element in our model. The accuracy and applicability of the GPM data set in hydrological
    field have been extensively verified (Tan & Duan, 2017). This half-hourly 0.1°
    × 0.1° data set, generated using the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for
    GPM (IMERG) algorithm, combines precipitation estimates from satellite retrieval
    and ground precipitation gauge data (Hou et al., 2014). To evaluate the potential
    impact of product uncertainty on our model, we incorporated two additional precipitation
    data sets, that is, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the new
    fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis of ECMWF (ERA5). The TRMM data set, a
    predecessor of GPM, employs sensors similar to those on the GPM satellite, including
    the Microwave Imager and Precipitation Radar. Provided at a 3-hourly temporal
    resolution and a spatial resolution of 0.25°, this data set integrates data from
    TRMM satellite instruments and external sources, such as Defense Meteorological
    Satellite Program (DMSP), using the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis
    (TMPA) algorithm (Pombo and de Oliveira, 2015; Wolff et al., 2007). ERA5, released
    by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, is the latest reanalysis product with
    higher spatial-temporal resolution (0.1° and hourly) (Jiang et al., 2021). 3.1.2
    Evapotranspiration Accurate estimation of ET is crucial for efficient agricultural
    water management, yet current algorithms face challenges at a continental scale,
    especially across diverse climatic conditions. To address this, we used various
    satellite observations to produce a 1-km daily ET data set using the SEBAL. The
    SEBAL model has shown exceptional accuracy and adaptability, requiring minimal
    ground-based data (Tang et al., 2013). In irrigated croplands, where water application
    alters the surface energy balance, temperature and moisture variations are pronounced.
    SEBAL effectively captures these variations by considering key energy components
    such as incoming solar radiation, outgoing longwave radiation, sensible heat flux,
    and latent heat flux, crucial for ET estimation. Details on generating the daily
    ET data set with SEBAL on the Google Earth Engine platform can be found in Laipelt
    et al. (2021). This study used MODIS data (i.e., surface albedo, surface temperature,
    and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) and meteorological data from
    the ERA5 as model driving input. Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter
    for ET calculation in the SEBAL model; nevertheless, it is generally constrained
    by missing or unreliable pixels. To address this, we applied a spatiotemporal
    regression strategy to gap-fill missing values in MODIS daily data, according
    to the studies of K. Liu et al. (2022). Specifically, we employed a RF model to
    capture the nonlinear relationship between LST and explanatory variables (i.e.,
    NDVI, elevation, slope, aspect and land surface emissivity) and used geographically
    weighted regression to calibrate the residuals derived from the RF model. We obtained
    two additional ET products for verification and uncertainty analysis. The first
    is MODIS ET, which utilizes a vegetation index model to estimate ET using metrics
    such as leaf area index (LAI) and meteorological inputs including vapor pressure
    deficit (Mu et al., 2011). This product provides a global 1 km ET data set with
    an 8-day temporal resolution. The second product, PML-V2 (Penman-Monteith-Leuning,
    Version 2), developed by Y. Zhang et al. (2019), integrates a coupled diagnostic
    biophysical model with the Penman-Monteith equation. It offers a spatial resolution
    of 500 m and an 8-day temporal resolution, accessible via the Google Earth Engine
    platform. 3.1.3 Soil Moisture Satellite-derived SSM products are often hindered
    by missing observations and coarse spatial resolution (Kovačević et al., 2020;
    Peng et al., 2023). To address these issues, we generated a time series of daily
    SSM with full spatial coverage at a spatial resolution of 1-km. Initially, we
    utilized a proven gap-filling method, as employed in previous studies (K. Liu
    et al., 2023), to fill missing data within the 25-km ESA CCI SSM product using
    satellite observations and a ML algorithm. Subsequently, we downscaled the gap-filled
    SSM data from 25- to 1-km resolution using the RF algorithm, integrating remote
    sensing data sets, digital terrain characteristics, and climatic variables, as
    described by H. Zhang et al. (2022). Given that irrigation modules are typically
    absent in reanalysis products, we obtained SM products from the ERA5 data set
    to identify irrigation information. The ERA5 SM product comprises three layers
    (0–7, 7–28, and 28–100 cm), with the first layer considered as SSM and the root
    zone soil moisture (RZSM) calculated as a weighted average across all three layers.
    3.1.4 Distribution and Phenology of Three Cereal Crops The study utilized phenological
    data from ChinaCropPhen1km, a data set developed by Luo et al. (2020), providing
    precise phenological information for rice, maize, and wheat in China. Covering
    the period from 2000 to 2015, this data set offers a 1 km gridded resolution.
    It integrates Global Land Surface Satellite LAI products with the Optimal Filter-based
    Phenology detection approach. The data set includes detailed pixel-level information
    on key phenological dates, such as heading, intermediate, and maturity dates,
    expressed in terms of the day of the year. 3.1.5 Reported Irrigation Water Use
    and Irrigated Area The city-level reported IWU and the irrigated area during 2003–2013
    were sourced from the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources (Zhou et al., 2020).
    This data set includes annual records of IWU and irrigated area for 341 cities,
    categorized into various crops, including rice, maize, wheat, vegetables, and
    fruits. The spatial distribution of the average value and trend of reported IWU
    for three cereal crops during 2003–2013 can be found in Figure S1 in Supporting
    Information S1. While this data set is considered reliable for reflecting actual
    IWU and irrigated area, it is derived through statistical methods and may not
    perfectly align with actual water amounts due to losses during transmission (K.
    Zhang et al., 2022). In our modeling approach, we did not directly use reported
    irrigated area as an input variable. Instead, we relied on ChinaCropPhen1km data
    for spatial parameter accumulation due to its practical advantages, such as accessibility
    and real-time availability. The reported irrigated area primarily served to evaluate
    the accuracy of ChinaCropPhen1km rather than actively influencing our modeling
    process. 3.1.6 Data Set for Verifying at Field Stations Field measurements were
    primarily obtained from two sources, that is, eight stations from the global network
    of eddy covariance sites (FLUXNET) and 34 stations from the Chinese Ecosystem
    Research Network (CERN). The geographical distribution of these stations is depicted
    in Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1. FLUXNET operates a global network of
    flux towers that utilize the eddy covariance method to measure energy flux components,
    including latent and sensible heat (Wilson et al., 2002). We collected half-hourly
    measurements of latent heat flux from eight FLUXNET stations and converted them
    into estimates of ET using the energy balance principle. CERN, established to
    monitor China''s ecological conditions, comprises ecological stations across various
    ecosystems, such as forests, croplands, and grasslands (Wang et al., 2016). From
    34 CERN stations, we obtained SM field measurements, with a measurement frequency
    ranging from 4 to 10 days. These measurements were acquired using the neutron
    probe method, a non-invasive technique known for its convenience, precision, and
    minimal impact on soil structure. Typically, measurements cover multiple soil
    depths, from 10 cm to approximately 200 cm. SSM was derived from measurements
    at the 10 cm depth, while RZSM was calculated as the weighted average of depths
    ranging from 10 to 100 cm. To assess the performance of the hybrid model, we selected
    12 cropland stations within CERN, providing a broader range of field measurements
    beyond SM. These measurements include irrigation water intensity (unit: mm), ET,
    and SM from 2008 to 2014. Precipitation data for these stations were obtained
    from nearby meteorological stations. Further details of these 12 cropland stations
    are provided in Table 2. Table 2. Description of the Cropland Field Stations Site

    Drainage, crucial for calculating IWU, depends on the interplay between saturated
    hydraulic conductivity and soil pore size distribution. The natural logarithm
    transformation of SM content is a well-established technique in hydrological studies,
    simplifying the complex relationship between SM and saturated hydraulic conductivity,
    as described by the Mualem-Van Genuchten equation (Text S1 in Supporting Information
    S1). By utilizing the natural logarithm of SM, we linearized the connection between
    SM and hydraulic conductivity, facilitating the modeling of drainage processes
    in soils with varied pore size distributions. This approach aligns with previous
    research, such as Zhao et al. (2010), which identified a significant logarithmic
    correlation between SM and the soil evaporation transfer coefficient. Additionally,
    literature on eco-hydrologic dynamics supports our approach by highlighting the
    non-linear relationship between plant root water uptake intensity and SM, consistent
    with macroscopic root water uptake models (R. Kumar et al., 2013; Shankar et al.,
    2012). In practical application, we substituted the original data set with logarithmic
    representations of surface soil moisture (lnSSM) and root zone soil moisture (lnRZSM).
    lnSSM was derived from satellite data, while lnRZSM was computed from the ERA5
    product, chosen for its superior performance in capturing root zone conditions.
    To validate the robustness of this transformation, we conducted an evaluation
    using 7 years of field measurements (2008–2014) from 12 cropland stations. As
    depicted in Figure 3, the logarithmic forms of SM and IWU reveal a discernible
    relationship at these field stations. This empirical observation emphasizes that
    an increase in soil water content moderates the interaction between IWU and SM,
    particularly in complex soil environments. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    surface soil moisture and (b) root zone soil moisture at field stations. The blue
    line with shading represents the regression line and prediction interval, while
    the cyan shading indicates the confidence interval. 3.3 Extraction of Soil Moisture
    Residual Caused by Irrigation This study introduces a strategy to infer irrigation
    activities by leveraging a robust metric—the bias between satellite-observed and
    modeled SM. This bias, stemming from seasonal hydrological variations during dry
    periods, provides valuable insights into detecting irrigation practices (Zohaib
    & Choi, 2020). First, we exploited the sensitivity of satellite sensors to large-scale
    irrigation, enabling the detection of variations in topsoil moisture and identification
    of irrigation events (Lawston et al., 2017; X. Zhang et al., 2018). Second, we
    addressed a significant gap in traditional global land surface models, such as
    the Global Land Data Assimilation System (Rodell et al., 2004) and Modern-Era
    Retrospective analysis (Woollen et al., 2011), which often neglect the incorporation
    of irrigation as a hydrological process. We combined a satellite-derived SM data
    set with the ERA5 SM product to extract ResSM associated with irrigation practices.
    Daily precipitation data was used to determine irrigation periods. We ranked daily
    precipitation values greater than zero each year in ascending order and identified
    an appropriate percentile in this ranked data set to delineate the irrigation
    period (i.e., rain-free period), when irrigation events may occur. Periods below
    this threshold were classified as non-irrigation periods. To validate the use
    of precipitation in determining irrigation periods and selecting an appropriate
    threshold, we collected daily precipitation data for 12 cropland CERN stations,
    along with precise records of irrigation dates. If daily precipitation on the
    irrigation day fell below the selected threshold, it indicated that the designated
    irrigation period covered an irrigation event. The choice of threshold value significantly
    affects the coverage of irrigation events within the designated period. Higher
    thresholds encompass more irrigation events but also extend the temporal duration
    of the irrigation period. In this study, we opted for a threshold ranked at the
    twentieth percentile, striking a balance between covering a substantial portion
    of irrigation events (over 80%) and minimizing the rate of increase in irrigation
    event coverage as thresholds rise (Figures S3 in Supporting Information S1). ResSM
    could be theoretically obtained by integrating the difference between the observed
    data set and the ERA5 product during the irrigation period: (2) where N represents
    the number of days within the irrigation period. signifies the observed SM product,
    which may originate from in-situ data or satellite-derived product. denotes the
    ERA5-based SM product after calibration. Considering the systematic discrepancies
    between these two data sources, we conducted a calibration process, leveraging
    the non-irrigation period for alignment. (3) (4) where represents the original
    ERA5 SSM product during the non-irrigation period, while and denote the observed
    SSM products for the non-irrigation and irrigation periods, respectively. The
    parameters Bias and y were determined through the least squares method. 3.4 Establishment
    of Machine Learning Model In this study, we utilized five distinct parameters
    as features to drive a ML model. These parameters, that is, precipitation, ET,
    lnSSM, lnRZSM, and ResSM, play essential roles in shaping irrigation dynamics
    from both natural and human perspectives (X. Zhang et al., 2022). Precipitation
    and ET act as indicators of natural water replenishment and dissipation within
    croplands. Meanwhile, lnSSM and lnRZSM provide critical information about soil
    water storage, vital for understanding moisture availability for crops. Particularly,
    ResSM quantitatively reflects the intensity of human irrigation activities (Zaussinger
    et al., 2019). To utilize these features effectively, we employed a suite of five
    ML models, each with unique strengths: RF, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support
    Vector Machines (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and ANN. RF and XGB, developed
    by Breiman (2001) and T. Chen and Guestrin (2016) respectively, are ensemble learning
    algorithms that use bagging and boosting strategies to mitigate data anomalies.
    SVM, a powerful algorithm, is employed for regression tasks by identifying hyperplanes
    that minimize prediction error while maximizing the distance between support vectors
    and hyperplanes (Smola & Schölkopf, 2004). MLR establishes a straightforward linear
    regression function between the target label and multiple input features, making
    it easy to implement. ANN consists of interconnected neurons with continuously
    updated weights, facilitated by a backpropagation algorithm. While ANN excels
    in handling complex nonlinear relationships, it is often criticized for its reduced
    interpretability (Elnashar et al., 2020). A more detailed description of these
    five models can be found in Text S2 in Supporting Information S1. We first estimated
    the IWU at field stations to verify the applicability of ML approaches. We iteratively
    selected one year''s field measurements from 2008 to 2014 as the test set, while
    using the remaining data as the training set (the flowchart can be found in Figure
    S4 in Supporting Information S1). Cross-validation was then conducted to optimize
    hyperparameters, with details provided in Table S1 in Supporting Information S1.
    The performance of our framework was assessed across multiple years. We then extended
    the ML approaches to estimate IWU for three staple cereal crops at a national
    scale, focusing on city-level granularity. Similarly, we alternated one year''s
    data from 2003 to 2013 as the test set, using the remainder as the training set.
    3.5 Ensemble Based on Bayesian Three-Cornered Hat (BTCH) Method We employed a
    BTCH approach to construct an ensemble of IWU predictions by combing outputs from
    the five ML methods mentioned earlier. This method is recognized for its robustness
    in integrating diverse models seamlessly without requiring any prior assumptions
    (He et al., 2020). Unlike certain integration methods that rely on measured data,
    such as Bayesian model averaging, BTCH stands out for its simplicity. It operates
    solely based on the similarity between predicted sequences from different models,
    making it a straightforward and effective approach. Moreover, BTCH ensures that
    ensemble predictions leverage the strengths of individual models while mitigating
    their respective limitations, optimizing overall predictive performance. The BTCH
    method consists of two main components: the classic TCH segment for assessing
    model uncertainty and the Bayesian segment for weighing each model''s contribution.
    More detailed information about TCH and BTCH can be found in Text S3 in Supporting
    Information S1. 3.6 Analysis Metrics The evaluation metrics used in this study
    include root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation
    coefficient (R), coefficient of determination (R2) and a modified version of Kling-Gupta
    Efficiency (KGE″) (Clark et al., 2021). Mathematical formulas for these metrics
    are detailed in Text S4 in Supporting Information S1. Additionally, we conducted
    permutation-based importance analysis to discern the impacts of various parameters
    on our model. This procedure involves selecting a feature, randomly reordering
    its values within the data set, recalculating predictions, and evaluating the
    difference between the new and previous results. Substantial differences indicate
    higher importance scores for the feature, while minor differences indicate lower
    importance. 4 Results 4.1 Accuracy of Daily ET and SSM Data Set We generated high-quality
    data sets of ET and SSM during 2003–2013 using multiple remote sensing data sets,
    ML techniques, and process models. The spatial distribution and accuracy of these
    data sets are depicted in Figure 4. Both ET and SSM data sets exhibit a consistent
    geographical pattern, with values gradually decreasing from southeast to northwest.
    Furthermore, these data sets provide extensive spatial coverage, particularly
    in the sparsely vegetated northwest inland regions, surpassing that of existing
    mainstream products like MODIS ET and ESA CCI SSM (K. Liu et al., 2023; Xu et
    al., 2019). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Evaluation of daily evapotranspiration
    (ET) and surface soil moisture (SSM) data sets. (a) Spatial distribution of average
    ET and SSM products during 2003–2013. (b) Accuracy metrics evaluated with field
    observations. Figure 4b illustrates that the R values of our daily ET and SSM
    data sets are 0.537 and 0.664, respectively. Specifically, the daily ET product
    perform better in semi-humid and humid regions compared to semi-arid and arid
    regions. It effectively prevents overestimation in arid regions due to reduced
    sensitivity to meteorological inputs and utilization of surface thermal characteristics
    (Laipelt et al., 2021; K. Liu et al., 2022). Compared to ESA CCI SSM, our reconstructed
    product not only demonstrates enhanced accuracy but also offers better spatial
    resolution and coverage (K. Liu et al., 2023). Verification results show that
    the arid region achieves the highest accuracy, characterized by maximum R and
    minimum RMSE and MAE, followed by semi-humid and humid regions, with the semi-arid
    region ranking last. Overall, considering the inherent spatial heterogeneity of
    field measurements, the accuracy of these two daily products remains at an acceptable
    level. 4.2 Evaluation of IWU at Field Stations Verifying the proposed method at
    field stations before scaling it up is essential since field measurements provide
    actual data. As shown in Figure 5a, among the five selected explanatory factors,
    ET exhibits the highest importance across all five ML models, emphasizing its
    critical role in the hydrological cycle (X. Wu et al., 2015). The importance of
    the other explanatory factors varies among the models. For example, while precipitation
    holds the second-highest importance in the SVM model, it is less crucial in the
    MLR model. Such variations are expected due to the distinct structures of ML models,
    leading them to select features using different strategies (Meng et al., 2022).
    Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Verification of model applicability
    at field stations. (a) Permutation-based importance of explanatory factors. The
    error line represents the standard deviation of 2008–2014. (b) Scatter plots of
    reported irrigation water use (IWU) and predicted IWU in each year. The number
    after the “±” represents the standard deviation of 2008–2014. Figure 5b exhibits
    the specific estimation precision of the five ML models and the BTCH integration
    models. Multi-year metrics reveal that BTCH shows the most satisfactory performance,
    with the highest R2 and KGE″, as well as the lowest RMSE and MAE among all models.
    Among the remaining models, RF, SVM, and ANN all exhibit acceptable accuracy,
    while XGB and MLR show relatively lower performances. Collectively, these results
    highlight the feasibility of estimating IWU using the proposed method, especially
    considering the modeling challenges posed by the spatial heterogeneity of field
    stations. 4.3 Evaluation of IWU at the City Level Figure 6 displays the importance
    of explanatory factors at the city level by extending the proposed method to the
    national scale. Similar to the models at field stations, the emphasis on various
    explanatory factors varies inconsistently among different ML models. The importance
    of lnSSM and lnRZSM at the national scale has increased compared to field stations,
    while the significance of ET shows the opposite trend, particularly in the MLR
    model. This shift may be attributed to the broader spatial impact of soil water
    storage dynamics. Regarding different crops, the distribution of permutation-based
    importance remains consistent between rice, wheat, and maize within the same model.
    For example, in the XGB model, all three cereal crops assign the highest importance
    to lnSSM (0.4, 0.39, and 0.39, respectively), while paying less attention to lnRZSM
    (0.09, 0.12, and 0.1, respectively). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Permutation-based importance of explanatory factors at the city level. The error
    line represents the standard deviation of 2003–2013. Figure 7 displays the spatial
    distribution of predicted IWU at the city level. Geographically, the spatial patterns
    of estimates from each model remain largely consistent on a national scale. High
    IWU estimates for rice are clustered in the Lower-and-Middle reaches of the Yangtze
    River and the eastern coastal areas, while high IWU estimates for wheat and maize
    are concentrated in the North China Plain. However, the estimates of different
    models still show some discrepancies at a local level. Figure 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Spatial patterns of average irrigation water use estimates in
    2003–2013 using different models. (a) Rice, (b) wheat, and (c) maize. Figure 8
    compares the predicted IWU from each model with the reported IWU for the three
    cereal crops. Rice exhibits the highest estimation accuracy, with R2 ranging from
    0.78 to 0.83 across the six models (average of 2003–2013), followed by wheat (0.68–0.76)
    and maize (0.53–0.64). Consistently, the KGE″ also indicates decreasing accuracy
    in the order of rice, wheat, and maize. Despite rice''s higher RMSE and MAE compared
    to the other crops, its estimation is considered the most reliable due to the
    higher irrigation needs for rice cultivation (Yin et al., 2022). Among the models,
    the BTCH method consistently yields the most robust results, with metrics ranking
    highest among the six models and exhibiting stable interannual errors. For instance,
    in rice, BTCH achieves the lowest RMSE, the second lowest MAE, the highest R2
    and a moderate KGE″. While the RF model also performs well in rice, it shows larger
    interannual errors than BTCH. These results highlight the excellent integration
    capability of the BTCH method. However, the performance of other ML models varies
    across different crops. The MLR model performs best in maize but ranks second
    to BTCH in rice and wheat. The SVM model performs well in rice but poorly in maize.
    Combining Figure 7, these results manifest the feasibility of using ML method
    for large-scale IWU estimation. Our study also shows the feasibility of using
    ML model varies with the environmental context. Nevertheless, the BTCH method
    effectively integrate these models to achieve more robust estimations (Shangguan
    et al., 2023). Additionally, we compared BTCH with an equal weighting approach
    (Table S2 in Supporting Information S1), affirming that BTCH delivers superior
    performance. The weights assigned by BTCH to various models (Table S3 in Supporting
    Information S1) tend to favor more accurate models, reducing systematic errors
    and resulting in higher weights. However, random errors also affect simulation
    results, leading to weights that may not perfectly correlate with model accuracy.
    Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Metrics of six models at the city level.
    The box-plots represent the interquartile range (box), mean and median (diamond
    and line within the box) of 2003–2013. Figure 9 illustrates model accuracy across
    various climatic regions, revealing differences in reported IWU averages for the
    three cereal crops based on aridity levels. Rice exhibits higher IWU requirements
    in humid regions compared to arid ones, resulting in elevated RMSE and MAE values
    for rice estimation in humid areas. However, there is no significant variance
    in the R2 and KGE″ values for rice across different climatic regions, suggesting
    minimal impact of aridity levels on the model''s performance in estimating rice
    IWU. Conversely, wheat and maize consistently demonstrate reduced RMSE, MAE, and
    average reported IWU with increasing humidity levels. Higher R2 and KGE″ for wheat
    are observed in semi-arid and semi-humid regions, with similar trends observed
    for maize. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Metrics of Bayesian three-cornered
    hat with respect to dryness level. The bar and error line respectively represent
    the average and standard deviation of 2003–2013. Collectively, these IWU estimation
    biases result from a combination of climate-related fluctuations, crop-specific
    attribute, and the suitability of remote sensing products across different regions.
    Wheat and maize are sensitive to the local climate conditions, significantly affecting
    the accuracy of our estimation approach. In contrast, rice, thriving in humid
    conditions, maintains consistent performance across diverse climatic regions.
    This consistency may stem from the unique requirements of rice cultivation. Rice
    farmers often employ measures to preserve a humid planting environment, even in
    arid regions, through natural or artificial irrigation. As a result, while rice
    cultivation spans various climatic zones, the climate variations at the individual
    farm level may be less pronounced. Moreover, the quality of remote sensing products
    varies across climate regions, influencing IWU estimation accuracy. Our method
    tends to perform less effectively for wheat and maize in arid regions, largely
    due to the limited accuracy of ET products in such environments. Rice consistently
    outperforms wheat and maize, demonstrating greater drought resistance compared
    to wheat. Wheat performs well in semi-arid and semi-humid regions, with similar
    performance observed for maize. Variable importance analysis across different
    climate scenarios further supports these conclusions (Figure S5 in Supporting
    Information S1). We analyzed the total national IWU using both reported data and
    predicted data (after BTCH aggregation) from 2003 to 2013, as shown in Figure
    S6 in Supporting Information S1. Among the three cereal crops, the total reported
    IWU for rice and maize demonstrates a noticeable upward trend, with only a few
    years showing decreased IWU. Conversely, the total reported IWU for wheat displays
    a fluctuating pattern with a slight overall upward trend, though statistically
    insignificant. The predicted results mirror these overall trends, indicating the
    capability of the proposed framework to capture the interannual variability of
    IWU. 4.4 Model Uncertainty Analysis Both ET and precipitation are crucial factors
    in estimating IWU (K. Liu et al., 2019). To assess the impact of different products
    on model performance, we replaced the original input parameters at each time step
    with various alternatives, including MODIS ET, PML ET, ERA precipitation, and
    TRMM precipitation. The spatial patterns of these products can be found in Figures
    S7 and S8 in Supporting Information S1. Additionally, the spatial patterns of
    average IWU estimates (derived from BTCH) for the years 2003–2013 using different
    ET and precipitation products are presented in Figure S9 in Supporting Information
    S1. Figure 10 illustrates the effects of substituting different products on model
    performance, revealing noticeable changes, particularly across different crops.
    When replacing the original ET input (SEBAL ET) with MODIS ET or PML ET, a decline
    in model performance is observed for rice and maize. Conversely, both ET products
    decrease RMSE while increasing R2 in wheat. However, the mean relative change
    is negligible, with values below 3% for RMSE and less than 1% for R2 and KGE″,
    indicating that substituting the ET products may not substantially affect IWU
    estimation in wheat. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Changes in model
    performance (Bayesian three-cornered hat) due to different evapotranspiration
    (ET) or precipitation products, compared to using SEBAL ET and Global Precipitation
    Measurement precipitation products. The box-plots represent the interquartile
    range (box), mean and median (diamond and line within the box) of 2003–2013. Comparing
    the original precipitation products (i.e., GPM) to TRMM precipitation, TRMM appears
    more suitable for estimating IWU in maize. This is evidenced by decreased RMSE
    and MAE, as well as increased R2 and KGE″. Both precipitation products show similar
    relative changes in rice, but deteriorated metrics suggest that the GPM precipitation
    product is more suitable for rice IWU estimation compared to ERA and TRMM. However,
    replacing the precipitation product does not obviously improve or worsen the model''s
    performance in the case of wheat, as the relative changes between the two precipitation
    products are ambiguous. In general, our initial ET product proves more conducive
    to model performance compared to MODIS ET and PML ET. While the uncertainty in
    precipitation products affects model accuracy, none of the individual products
    demonstrate a clear advantage over the others. Moreover, substituting ET and precipitation
    products does not fundamentally alter model performance (mean relative change
    <5%), highlighting the robustness of our proposed method. We further examined
    the impact of these products on model performance across different climatic regions
    (Figures S10 and S11 in Supporting Information S1). Changes in model performance
    remain within a stable range (<10%). However, there are specific scenarios with
    significant fluctuations that require attention, such as the choice of ET products
    when modeling wheat IWU in humid regions and the selection of precipitation products
    when modeling maize IWU in arid regions. Our study also reveals an interesting
    aspect of ML model performance: an asymmetry in its predictive capabilities. Specifically,
    the ML model excels in accurately capturing intermediate IWU values but tends
    to underestimate high values within the IWU range. This observation suggests that
    while the model effectively captures the dominant factors contributing to IWU,
    it may overlook subtle signals crucial for representing extreme IWU values, particularly
    those that are exceptionally high. There is no discernible pattern in the residuals
    of different ML models (Figures S12 and S13 in Supporting Information S1). However,
    all models exhibit a common pattern where overestimation or underestimation is
    most pronounced in the high reference IWU range with sparse samples. Such asymmetrical
    performance appears to be a common characteristic shared among various ML models.
    This phenomenon can be attributed, at least in part, to the limited availability
    of data pertaining to extreme regimes. The scarcity of data points in the high
    IWU range may hinder the ML model''s ability to adequately learn and generalize
    patterns associated with extreme values. The number of samples may also affect
    the performance of ML models and Bayesian methods. To clarify this issue, we varied
    the numbers of samples used to train ML model or generate BTCH weights. The results
    (Tables S4 and S5 in Supporting Information S1) indicate that the number of samples
    (IWU simulations provided by different ML models) does not significantly affect
    the integration capability of the BTCH method. However, overall model performance
    tends to decrease as the number of samples (reference IWU and related factors)
    decreases. This decrease in performance may stem from the challenge posed by small
    sample sizes, which can hinder the ML model from capturing complex patterns in
    the data, leading to inadequate fitting (K. Chen et al., 2020). 5 Discussions
    This study introduced two processes to enhance the detection of irrigation-related
    information. First, we addressed the potential nonlinear relationship between
    SM and IWU by transforming the original remote sensing SM product into its logarithmic
    form. Second, we developed a robust parameter called ResSM, intended to capture
    differences between satellite-based and reanalysis-based SM products in detecting
    irrigation events, particularly during rain-free periods. A similar study is discussed
    in S. V. Kumar et al. (2015), which validated the capability of remote sensing
    data sets to identify irrigation signals through a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, comparing
    remote sensing SM with model-generated SM. While traditional approaches typically
    employed the extracted information as a parameter in water balance equations (Zohaib
    & Choi, 2020), our strategy involved incorporating ResSM as a feature to drive
    the ML model. To assess the effectiveness of these theory-guided mechanisms, we
    compared the model''s performance under different scenarios: one where the original
    SM was used instead of the natural logarithmic-transformed SM, and another where
    ResSM was excluded from the model. These scenarios were compared to the initial
    model that incorporates both mechanisms. As demonstrated in Figure 11, omitting
    these two physics-based processes generally results in increased RMSE and MAE
    for all three cereal crops, accompanied by decreased R2 and KGE″. This change
    is particularly pronounced in the case of maize but less conspicuous in rice and
    wheat. The discrepancy can be attributed to rice and wheat already achieving relatively
    satisfactory metrics compared to maize, making significant improvements more challenging.
    Our results indicate that these theory-guided strategies enhance the model''s
    performance. Converting the original SM into its logarithmic form led to a 1%
    and 4% improvement in KGE″ for rice and maize, respectively. However, for wheat,
    there was a 0.1% decrease in KGE″, primarily observed in arid regions, suggesting
    that the logarithmic transformation may be less suitable for such areas. Additionally,
    including ResSM resulted in a 0.4%, 0.7%, and 2% increase in KGE″ for rice, wheat,
    and maize, respectively. It''s worth noting that we employed a simple linear model
    to correct the systematic deviation between satellite and reanalysis products.
    Future research could explore advanced correction methods and utilize typical
    reanalysis data sets such as the China Meteorological Administration Land Data
    Assimilation System (CLDAS) to enhance the accuracy of ResSM data extraction.
    The reliability of our IWU estimation is substantiated by comparing our results
    with those of two earlier studies (Y. Chen et al., 2019; K. Zhang et al., 2022)
    (Figure S14 in Supporting Information S1). This comparison reveals a general consistency
    between our study and prior research. Notably, regions characterized by high IWU,
    such as Xinjiang, Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu, consistently emerge as areas with
    high irrigation intensity. Figure 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Mean relative
    change in Bayesian three-cornered hat metrics when excluding the soil moisture
    residuals feature or replacing lnSM with original soil moisture, in comparison
    to the initial model incorporating physical mechanisms. Previous studies (C. Zhang
    & Long, 2021; K. Zhang et al., 2022; Zohaib & Choi, 2020) focusing on IWU estimation
    often treated all crops as a single category due to challenges in discerning irrigation
    signals among different crops based on hydrological mechanisms. The irrigation
    area data used in these studies might not adequately distinguish between various
    types of croplands. To overcome these limitations, our research focuses on estimating
    IWU for three staple cereal crops in China, leveraging phenological information
    to extract parameters with higher precision. However, while ChinaCropPhen1km data
    set excels in monitoring phenological event, its capacity to differentiate the
    spatial distribution of crops is somewhat limited (Luo et al., 2020). To gauge
    the potential uncertainty associated with the ChinaCropPhen1km data set, we analyzed
    the cultivated area in each city as determined by the data set and compared it
    to the reported irrigated area provided by the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources.
    Figure 12 illustrates the results, revealing a strong linear relationship between
    the cultivated area calculated by ChinaCropPhen1km and the reported irrigated
    area, with a r of 0.82, 0.88, and 0.77 for rice, wheat, and maize, respectively.
    However, the cultivated area calculated by ChinaCropPhen1km generally exceeded
    the reported irrigated area, possibly due to the inclusion of rain-fed cropland
    in the data set. Since ML methods often employ standardized preprocessing of parameters,
    the impact of this overestimation of irrigated area may be mitigated. These findings
    suggest that the ChinaCropPhen1km data set performs reasonably well overall and
    enables crop-specific IWU estimation. Figure 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Comparison between reported irrigated area and cultivated area calculated from
    ChinaCropPhen1km, with the black line representing the linear regression fitting.
    Our study aims to estimate IWU using ML methods, emphasizing its viability across
    different crops and on a large scale. Unlike traditional hydrological approaches
    reliant on complex physical relationships, ML methods offer improved robustness
    and transferability by avoiding the need for such elusive connections. Among the
    ML methods we investigated, the BTCH integration method emerges as particularly
    promising, demonstrating its potential within model ensembles. In addition to
    its integration capabilities, the BTCH method excels in harmonizing data from
    multiple remote sensing products, thereby reducing uncertainty (J. Liu et al.,
    2021; Shangguan et al., 2023). Given the uncertainty associated with multisource
    precipitation and ET products in our study, employing the BTCH method to synthesize
    these data sources could further enhance the accuracy of our model. Due to the
    limitations of the available reported IWU data at the city level, seamlessly extending
    our proposed method to the pixel level may pose challenges. Future efforts will
    concentrate on bridging this gap by integrating ML models with traditional hydrological
    methods, aiming to extend ML approaches to a finer pixel level. Additionally,
    with the rapid advancements in deep learning networks, exploring the application
    of more sophisticated models like the Long Short-Term Memory model could prove
    valuable, given its promising performance in simulating time series data (Cao
    et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2016). 6 Summary and Conclusions This study presents
    a hybrid framework for estimating the IWU of three staple cereal crops in China.
    Using ML techniques, we generated a high-quality time series data set for daily
    ET and SSM. Subsequently, we transformed the original SM into its logarithmic
    terms and extracted a novel irrigation-related parameter based on differences
    in detecting irrigation events between remote sensing SM products and reanalysis
    SM products. By coupling theory-guided strategies with ML techniques, the proposed
    framework accurately estimated IWU at both station-specific and national scales,
    with the BTCH method proving to be the most robust among the six models explored,
    demonstrating exceptional ensemble ability. Incorporating two physics-based processes
    effectively highlighted implicit irrigation information within SM data, enhancing
    overall model performance. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed
    framework for estimating IWU for staple cereal crops in China. The performance
    of our hybrid framework varied with regional dryness levels. We observed higher
    accuracy in estimating IWU for wheat and maize in semi-arid and semi-humid regions,
    while rice IWU estimation remained insensitive to humidity variations. In other
    words, wheat and maize showed greater sensitivity to dry conditions compared to
    rice, posing challenges in applying the framework in northern arid regions where
    wheat and maize dominate crop production. Additionally, we found that model accuracy
    was impacted by uncertainty in ET and precipitation products. Our daily SEBAL
    ET product demonstrated better applicability compared to MODIS and PML ET products.
    However, the effect of multisource precipitation products varied across different
    crops. These uncertainties did not compromise the model''s accuracy fundamentally,
    with the mean relative change consistently less than 5%. Overall, our hybrid framework
    for estimating IWU holds promise in addressing food security and promoting socio-economic
    stability, especially amidst mounting population growth and increasing food demand.
    Given prevailing water scarcity issues in China, such as groundwater depletion
    in the North China Plain due to prolonged overexploitation (Bai et al., 2022),
    our study offers valuable insights for effective water resource management. Furthermore,
    the proposed strategies hold potential for broader application beyond China''s
    borders, with future endeavors focusing on enhancing the framework and exploring
    its applicability on a global scale. Acknowledgments This study was supported

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    in sub-saharan africa Infrastructure limitations and access to technology One
    of the significant constraints in leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa is the limited infrastructure and lack
    of access to technology [111,112]. Many rural areas in the region lack reliable
    electricity supply, internet connectivity, and adequate communication networks
    necessary for the seamless functioning of smart irrigation systems. The absence
    of basic infrastructure hampers the deployment and operation of advanced technologies
    such as sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing platforms. Additionally, the
    high cost of technology acquisition and maintenance further restricts the access
    and adoption of 4IR solutions for smart irrigation in the region. Governance and
    policy challenges Governance and policy challenges pose significant obstacles
    to the effective utilization of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation in sub-Saharan
    Africa [111,113,114]. Fragmented regulatory frameworks, and a lack of coordination
    among different stakeholders hinder the integration of these technologies into
    existing irrigation systems. The absence of clear guidelines on data management,
    privacy, and security also creates uncertainties and inhibits the widespread adoption
    of 4IR technologies. It is crucial to establish comprehensive governance frameworks
    and supportive policies that address data governance, privacy concerns, interoperability

  description: Accurate reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) estimation is essential
    for agricultural water management, crop productivity, and irrigation systems.
    As the standard ET0 estimation method, the Penman-Monteith equation has been widely
    recommended worldwide. However, its application is still restricted to comprehensive
    meteorological data deficiency, making the exploration of alternative simpler
    models for acceptable ET0 estimation highly meaningful. Concerning the aforementioned
    requirement, this study developed the novel deep learning model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM),
    which incorporates Multi-Head Attention mechanism (MA), Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM) as intricate
    relationship processor, feature extractor, and regression component, to estimate
    ET0 based on radiation-based (Rn-based), humidity-based (RH-based), and temperature-based
    (T-based) input combinations at 600 stations during 1961–2020 throughout China
    under internal and external cross-validation strategies. Besides, through a comparative
    evaluation among MA-CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM, Multivariate Adaptive
    Regression Splines (MARS), and empirical models, the result indicated that MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    achieved superior precision, with values of Determination Coefficient (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe
    efficiency coefficient (NSE), Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE), Root Mean
    Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ranging 0.877–0.972, 0.844–0.962,
    0.129–0.292, 0.294–0.644 mm d−1, 0.244–0.566 mm d−1 for internal strategy and
    0.797–0.927, 0.786–0.920, 0.162–0.335, 0.409–0.969 mm d−1, 0.294–0.699 mm d−1
    for external strategy. Specifically, Rn-based MA-CNN-BiLSTM excelled in the temperate
    continental zone (TCZ) and mountain plateau zone (MPZ), while RH-based MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    yielded best precision in others. Furthermore, the internal strategy was superior
    to external strategy by 2.74–106.04% for R2, 1.11–120.49% for NSE, 1.41–40.27%
    for RRMSE, 1.68–45.53% for RMSE, and 1.21–38.87% for MAE, respectively. In summary,
    the main contribution of the present study is the proposal of a novel LSTM-type
    ET0 model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) to cope with various data-missing scenarios throughout
    China, which can provide effective support for decision-making in regional agriculture
    water management.

    Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a pivotal role in Earth''s water cycle, exerting
    profound effects on ecological and agricultural water management (Ma et al., 2023).
    However, the direct ET measurements are severely limited to enormous expenses
    and technical complexities (Gonzalez et al., 2023). As an alternative solution,
    the crop coefficient approach was proposed to quantify ET, and Penman-Monteith
    (PM) equation has been strongly recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) as a standard reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0)
    model (Allen et al., 1998). Nevertheless, the application of PM is constrained
    by its heavy reliance on numerous meteorological variables (Lu et al., 2023).
    Therefore, it becomes imperative to investigate simpler methods to estimate ET0
    accurately with fewer data requirements. During the last few decades, numerous
    researchers have made efforts to establish simpler empirical ET0 methods using
    fewer meteorological variables, such as temperature-based (T-based), radiation-based
    (Rn-based), and humidity-based (RH-based) models, which provide viable alternatives
    to the PM equation (Kim et al., 2023, Valipour et al., 2023). Furthermore, the
    various types of empirical ET0 models have extensive applications, exhibiting
    substantial accuracy variations (Su et al., 2022). In addition, numerous research
    indicates that their applicability and accuracy are further influenced by geographical
    and climatic conditions due to their unilateral assumptions and simplified structure
    (Liu et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2021b). Thus, exploring and developing high-accuracy
    ET0 estimation models using limited meteorological variables is imperative, particularly
    in China with diverse geographical and complex climatic zones. With the rapid
    advancements of computer technology recently, estimating ET0 has been recognized
    as a complex nonlinear regression problem that can be addressed through various
    artificial intelligence models (AI models), including traditional machine learning
    models (TML) and deep learning models (DL) (Yaseen et al., 2019). Despite TML
    models having achieved successful application in this field, DL models performed
    better with multiple hidden layers and possess the capability to capture intricate
    nonlinear relationships between ET0 and meteorological variables (Fan et al.,
    2021b). However, the characteristics of time-series problem are insufficiently
    considered by most AI models, and historical meteorological information has not
    been fully utilized to solve the problem of ET0 estimation (Hua et al., 2019,
    Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Notably, the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) was
    specially developed to handle long time-series problems using the “memory cell”
    structure and four gate control mechanisms as the most famous main-stream DL model,
    which can selectively retain or forget historical information to capture long-term
    patterns and trends (Guo et al., 2023, Mandal and Chanda, 2023, Niu et al., 2023).
    Although the classical LSTM model has been widely applied in the fields of ET0
    estimation, it still suffers from challenges related to long-term dependencies
    and overfitting in practical applications (Datta and Faroughi, 2023, Yan et al.,
    2023). Remarkably, several LSTM-type variants have been proposed to tackle these
    limitations. Regarding structure refinements in the LSTM model, Joseph et al.
    (2023) developed the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model by incorporating the forward
    and backward propagation layer for wind speed prediction. Another variant pattern
    of LSTM involves coupling multiple modules to harness their unique strengths (Wan
    et al., 2023, Yao et al., 2023, Zha et al., 2022). Based on the Convolutional
    LSTM model (CNN-LSTM), Elmaz et al. (2021) predicated the indoor temperature predictions
    in Belgium, demonstrating superior performance over LSTM. Furthermore, it is noteworthy
    that the successful introduction of the Attention mechanism enables LSTM to concentrate
    on data segments relevant to the current task during the modification of LSTM
    (Ren et al., 2021). Evolving from the foundation of the attention mechanism, the
    Multi-Head Attention (MA) mechanism significantly enhanced modeling capabilities,
    effectively captured stronger long-range dependencies, and adaptability to multi-modal
    data (Lin et al., 2020, Niu et al., 2021). Moreover, the MA mechanism could allow
    LSTM to concentrate on different segments of the input sequence and acquisition
    interrelationships simultaneously, which facilitates the capture of long-range
    dependencies and global contextual information within the input sequence (Niu
    et al., 2021). Thus, it has been widely regarded as a pivotal highlight in LSTM
    modifications which hold significant practical value in addressing diverse complex
    sequence modeling problems. However, the technology of comprehensively integrating
    these excellent improvement patterns into LSTM for addressing multi-dimensional
    nonlinear regression problems has not yet emerged hitherto. In addition to the
    specific characteristic of the model itself, data preprocessing has a significant
    impact on the estimation results, which includes input selection and dataset partition
    (Choubin and Malekian, 2017). Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh (2020) once conducted highly
    appreciated research that various pre-processing techniques were applied to determine
    inputs for Support Vector Regression. In addition, another acceptable approach
    to selecting meteorological inputs is to align with empirical ET0 models to evaluate
    AI models under the same data deficiency scenario (Feng et al., 2016, Maroufpoor
    et al., 2020). Furthermore, the accuracy, reliability, and generalization of model
    heavily rely on available data, which relates to the dataset partition (Maier
    et al., 2023, Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020). Typically, the proportion between
    the train and test dataset was recommended as 4:1 or 3:2 (Addor and Melsen, 2019,
    Jiang et al., 2022), However, the specific proportion of the partitioning method
    leads to inefficient data utilization, and the partitioning bias and contingency
    significantly affect the reliability and stability (Martí and Gasque, 2010). Since
    larger training datasets bring more robust and accurate performance, an alternative
    but beyond approach for data-splitting is cross validation, where models are trained
    and tested on multiple data subsets, enabling each available data can be used
    for both development and validation at least once (Craven and Wahba, 1978). Generally,
    the cross validation method mainly includes internal and external cross validation
    strategies that split the entire dataset from a temporal and spatial perspective,
    respectively (Shiri et al., 2014). The internal strategy provided efficient data
    utilization forms for local feature estimation when there are only single sites
    or significant differences between sites (Roy and Saha, 2022). Notably, although
    the internal strategy generally excels in accuracy performance due to data-similarity
    characteristics at the same site, the external strategy brings better generalization
    and transferability (Fan et al., 2018, Mehdizadeh, 2018). Furthermore, the external
    strategy is particularly important when the local data is not available as input
    at the research station. Similarly, Mohammadi et al. (2020) also concluded that
    the nearby station can be used for temperature estimation at the desired station.
    Since both strategies have advantages and disadvantages due to different application
    values and scenarios, it is necessary to simultaneously employ them for testing
    ET0 models. Thus, the concern is justified regarding the comparison between internal
    and external strategies impute to the complex climatic regions of China, which
    is still not systematically studied nationwide. China boasts a world-leading population
    and agricultural scale as a developing country, but outdated water resource management
    significantly hampers agricultural productivity, food security, and sustainable
    development. In addition, the meteorological stations of China are extremely insufficient
    in contrast to complex climate conditions. As of 2022, China has approximately
    2000 National Meteorological Stations as low as two stations per 104 km2. There
    are only 90 stations observe solar radiation since 1994, but almost all have long-term
    historical data on air temperature and humidity (Fan et al., 2019). Given substantial
    disparities in climatic conditions and data across China, it is imperative to
    develop a highly precise, exceptionally adaptable, and readily accessible ET0
    model under internal and external cross validation strategies. Hence, the primary
    objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to analyze the spatiotemporal variations
    of average air temperature (Ta), sunshine duration (n), precipitation (Pre), relative
    humidity (RH), wind speed at 2 m (u2), and ET0; (2) to develop an LSTM-type ET0
    model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM), which incorporates Multi-Head Attention mechanism (MA),
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network
    (BiLSTM) as intricate relationship processor, feature extractor, and regression
    component; (3) to carry out a national-scale evaluation of empirical, MARS, LSTM,
    BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, and MA-CNN-BiLSTM models with limited meteorological inputs
    in estimating ET0 across four climatic zones of China; (4) to analyze the spatial
    accuracy of the highly recommended ET0 models utilizing incomplete meteorological
    inputs under internal and external cross validation strategies. Finally, this
    study could provide the best-recommended ET0 estimated method for agricultural
    water management under various meteorological data deficiency scenarios in the
    different climatic regions of China. Literature review reveals that the AI-based
    models have been extensively applied to estimate ET0, but the LSTM-type models
    which comprehensively consider structural modification, multi-module coupling,
    and attention mechanism have been rarely reported in this field. The main contribution
    of the present study is the proposal of a novel LSTM-type ET0 estimation model
    (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) to cope with various data-missing scenarios in different climatic
    zones of China. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description and data collection
    China is divided into four climatic zones based on temperature, precipitation,
    and altitude (Fan et al., 2018), including the temperate continental zone (TCZ),
    mountain plateau zone (MPZ) temperate monsoon zone (TMZ), and subtropical monsoon
    zone (SMZ) (Song et al., 2011). In the TCZ, MPZ, TMZ, and SMZ, the average annual
    precipitation values are 269 mm, 382 mm, 585 mm, and 1320 mm, respectively, while
    the corresponding average annual pan evaporation values are 2148 mm, 1883 mm,
    1475 mm, and 1545 mm. And the corresponding average altitude is 912 m, 4236 m,
    288 m, and 611 m in these zones, respectively (Fan et al., 2018, Xing et al.,
    2023b). The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) has collected daily meteorological
    data, including maximum air temperature (Tmax), average air temperature (Ta),
    minimum air temperature (Tmin), air relative humidity (RH), sunshine duration
    (n), wind speed at 2 m (u2), precipitation (Pre) and atmospheric pressure (P),
    which has maintained strict quality control measures to ensure the precision and
    reliability of the observed meteorological data (Fan et al., 2021a, Shu et al.,
    2022). This study obtained the daily meteorological data in 600 stations from
    CMA during 1961–2020, with 90 stations in TCZ, 50 stations in MPZ, 175 stations
    in TMZ, and 285 stations in SMZ (Fig. 1). Additionally, the data underwent further
    quality control based on the methods described by Liu et al. (2009) and Fan et
    al. (2018), as well as the average rate of omissions in this dataset was 1.5%
    (Table S1 offers specific details regarding the 600 meteorological stations).

    Penman-Monteith equation Based on the FAO-56, the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation
    was employed for computing reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) in the following
    formula (Allen et al., 1998): (1) where Δ and γ represent the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure function and the psychometric constant, kPa ℃−1; Rn and G refer
    to the net radiation and soil heat flux density, MJ m−2 d–1; Ta represents the
    average air temperature, °C; u2 is the wind speed at 2 m, m s−1; es and ea represent
    the saturation and actual vapor pressure, kPa. 2.3. Empirical ET0 models In order
    to analyze the performance of simplified empirical ET0 models in substituting
    PM, the present study employed the Priestley-Taylor (radiation-based), Romanenko
    (humidity-based), and Hargreaves-Samani (temperature-based) to estimate ET0 in
    four climatic zones of China. Their detailed information is presented as follows.
    Priestley-Taylor model: Priestley and Taylor (1972) proposed the physically-based
    Priestley-Taylor model (PT), expressed as follows: (2) where λ is the latent heat
    of vaporization that changes the unit of solar radiation from MJ m−2 day−1 to
    mm day−1; aPT refers to empirical parameters, which were initially set as 1.26.
    Romanenko model: Romanenko (1961) introduced the representative aerodynamic model
    for estimating ET0, expressed as follows: (3) where aRom was initially set as
    4.5. Hargreaves-Samani model: The widely applied Hargreaves-Samani model (HS)
    was proposed by Hargreaves and Samani (1985), expressed as follows: (4) where
    aHS and bHS were initially set as 0.0023 and 0.5, respectively. 2.4. Multivariate
    Adaptive Regression Splines Friedman (1991) proposed a data-driven Multivariate
    Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) model, which reveals hidden non-linear patterns
    in datasets and presents regression equations to estimate response variables by
    combining simple linear regressions (Chen et al., 2022b). Furthermore, MARS involves
    forward and backward steps. Specifically, the forward step incorporated a substantial
    quantity of the basis functions, resulting in the generation of a complex over-fitted
    model. Subsequently, MARS prunes basis functions that may have less impact on
    the estimation process in the backward step (Mehdizadeh et al., 2019). In this
    study, we chose MARS as the representative of the traditional machine learning
    model, and its mathematical formulation can be described as follows: (5) (6) where
    y is the dependent variable estimated by the MARS; a0 and am represent the two
    parameters of the basis function; km denotes the number of divisions of the basis
    function; M refers to the number of the basis functions; the value of Skm is constrained
    to either + 1 or − 1, serving as an indicator of the polarity of the step function;
    v(k,m) and tm represent the risk factors and threshold of each basis function,
    respectively; q is the power of basis function; denotes the basis function. Since
    Friedman and Roosen (1995) pointed the maximum number of basis functions and maximum
    degree of interactions were primary user-specified hyperparameters that impact
    the performance of MARS, this study tuned them using the grid search method according
    to Fan et al. (2019). Specifically, the maximum number of basis functions and
    maximum degree of interactions were set as 45 and 6 in this study, respectively.
    Moreover, the optimum MARS model was selected based on the lowest value of the
    generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion, which can be expressed as follows:
    (7) where yi is the target output; f(xi) represents the estimated output; n is
    the number of the dataset; and C(M) is the penalty function which is expressed
    as: (8) where d is the penalty for each basis function. 2.5. Deep learning models
    This study compared the accurate performance of the developed novel deep learning
    model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) to the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), Bidirectional
    Long Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Bidirectional Long
    Short-Term Memory network (CNN-BiLSTM) for ET0 estimation using Rn-based, RH-based,
    and T-based incomplete meteorological input combinations in accordance with the
    independent variables utilized in the three types of empirical ET0 models across
    China. 2.5.1. LSTM model The LSTM model, proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber
    (1997), represents a new type of Recursive Neural Network (RNN) designed to grasp
    enduring dependencies in sequences through feedback connections. The fundamental
    essence of the LSTM model resides within its basic memory cell which introduces
    multiple gating mechanisms, comprising the input gate, forgetting gate, update
    gate, and output gate (Xie et al., 2020). These “gates” govern the information
    flow, empowering the model with the ability to judiciously disregard, retain,
    and convey information. Fig. 2 illustrates the basic memory cell architecture.

    Fig. 2. Basic memory cell within the Long Short-Term Memory network. Notes: It,
    Ft, Ut, Ot, St, Y, σ, and tanh represent input gate, forget gate, updated gate,
    output gate, cell state, output variable, sigmoid activation function, and hyperbolic
    tangent activation function, respectively. The input gate determines whether the
    input value should be utilized to update the current memory block state, contributing
    to the adaptive acquisition and information retention for LSTM. (9) (10) where
    It is the input gate; σ and tanh represent the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
    activation functions, respectively; Ut represents the update gate; W and b represent
    the corresponding weight and paranoid vector, respectively; and Yt represents
    input and output values, respectively. The forget gate distinguishes between which
    prior information to discard and which to retain, thus managing long-term dependencies.
    (11) where Ft is the forget gate. The update gate enables LSTM to effectively
    balance the impact of recent and previous information during sequence data processing,
    thereby enhancing its proficiency in capturing patterns and dependencies within
    sequences. (12) where Ut is the update gate; St is the memory cell state. The
    output gate employs the sigmoid function to decide which would be conveyed through
    the model. (13) (14) where Ot is the output gate. This study iteratively tuned
    the LSTM hyperparameters using the Grid Search method, and the learning Rate,
    Batch Size, Dropout, regularization method, and the number of hidden units were
    set as 0.001, 32, 0.1, L1-regularization, and 128, respectively. Consistent with
    Mehdizadeh et al. (2019), the present study chose Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
    as the fitness function. 2.5.2. MA-CNN-BiLSTM model The present study proposed
    a novel deep learning model denoted as MA-CNN-BiLSTM, which not only improves
    the original LSTM structure but also couples CNN and MA modules, with the primary
    objective of estimating ET0. Specifically, it combines the ability of CNN to capture
    local features and the capability of BiLSTM to learn long-term dependencies as
    well as temporal dynamics within inputs, while also incorporating the strengths
    of the MA mechanism to process intricate relationships. Furthermore, MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    encompasses three key components. The initial component is the CNN layer that
    employs convolutional operations for pattern and feature detection across various
    positions, thus effectively capturing the inherent local features and structures
    within input data. Subsequently, the MA mechanism layer, constituting the second
    component, further enhances the extraction of diverse features and relationships.
    Besides, this layer comprises multiple attention heads, wherein each head is adept
    at focusing on different segments of the input sequence and learning their relationships,
    which contributes to the capture of long-range dependencies and global contextual
    information within the input sequence. Finally, the third component is the BiLSTM
    layer which is proficient in capturing the context and enduring dependencies within
    input variables through forward and backward propagation. Hence, MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    is capable of effectively extracting features from different levels and perspectives,
    thereby precisely capturing contextual information. The following section offers
    a brief introduction to the CNN layer, MA layer, and BiLSTM layer. The structure
    for MA-CNN-BiLSTM is illustrated in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image

    coefficients; represents the output result of the first convolution layer; represents
    the output result of the second convolution layer; represents the output of the
    first pooling layer; represents the output of the second pooling layer; represents
    the offset term of the convolution kernel of the first convolution layer; represents
    the weight item of the first convolution layer; represents the offset term of
    the convolution kernel of the second convolution layer; represents the weight
    item of the second convolution layer; ReLU represents the activation function;
    Q, K, and V represent the query, key, and value, respectively; Softmax, Contact,
    and Linear represent the normalization, concat, and linear function, respectively.
    (1) Convolutional Neural Network Layer. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    was initially proposed by Lecun et al. (1998) as a feed-forward neural network
    that integrates convolutional computations (Dong et al., 2022, Lin et al., 2022,
    Yao et al., 2023). The standard CNN architecture consists of the input layer,
    convolutional layer, activation function layer, pooling layer, and output layer.
    It centers on convolving input data with convolutional kernels of diverse weights
    within the convolutional layers, facilitating the extraction of inherent data
    features. For the input matrix X = [x1, x2,…, xn] at time node t (t = 1, 2, …,
    T) can be expressed as Xt = , and the first convolution layer can be calculated
    as follows: (15) (16) where represents the output result of first convolution
    layer; ReLU represents the activation function; represents the offset term of
    the convolution kernel of first convolution layer; represents the weight item.
    Maximum pooling was selected by the first pooling layer, which can reduce the
    network complexity and retain the main features after convolution. The expression
    for the output result of the first pooling is as follows: (17) where represents
    the output result of first pooling layer; is the vector in the output of the first
    convolution layer, d1 ∈ m1. After the second convolution, the eigenvector can
    be obtained from the output result of the first pooling layer, which is expressed
    as follows: (18) where is the offset term of the convolution kernel in the second
    convolution layer; is the weight item. The output result of the second pooling
    layer is calculated as follows: (19) where is the output of the second pooling
    layer; is the vector output of the second convolution layer, d1 ∈ m1. Finally,
    the output eigenvector after twice convolution and pooling can be expressed as
    follows: (20) (2) Multi-head Attention mechanism. Multi-head attention (MA) is
    the variant of the attention mechanism that could assign diverse weights to distinct
    positions or segments during the processing of sequential data (Li et al., 2018).
    Besides, it allows the model to simultaneously focus on the different information
    from unknown representation subspaces. In addition, the MA mechanism relies on
    the Scaled Dot Product Attention calculation part to obtain the attention weights
    and the reconstructed attention matrix, which operates on queries (Q), keys (K),
    and values (V). The expression is as follows: (21) where dk is the key dimensionality;
    the softmax is a normalization function that is applied to obtain an attentional
    weight matrix. Subsequently, the MA mechanism acquires the attention representation
    from each head and connects the alternation results that are fed into the feedforward
    layer for further computation. Specifically, the attention function is executed
    in parallel with the projected versions of each Q, K, and V to produce the output
    values (Fu et al., 2024, Zhang and Wang, 2023). These values are concatenated
    by the Concat function and projected again to obtain the final value. The expression
    is as follows: (22) (23) where , , and are weight matrices; is weight matrix utilized
    within linear output function; the headi is the attention value of the ith head.
    (3) Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network Layer. The bidirectional Long
    Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM) Layer incorporates the bidirectional recurrent
    framework into LSTM, which facilitates the bidirectional processing of sequences
    of data (Joseph et al., 2023). Besides, it can effectively learn and capture dependencies
    in both forward and backward directions, whereas LSTM is confined to learning
    dependencies merely in the forward direction (Bottieau et al., 2023). The BiLSTM
    layer possesses the capability to integrate two hidden layers into a unified output.
    The iterative computation of forward ( ) and backward ( ) layer output sequences
    involves utilizing forward and reverse inputs, respectively. Subsequently, the
    obtained outputs (utp) are amalgamated before advancing to the next layer, following
    the formula provided below: (24) This study iteratively tuned the MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    hyperparameters using the Grid Search method, which is an automated hyperparameter
    optimization method that can comprehensively search for the optimal combination
    of hyperparameters for machine learning models in the solution space (Fan et al.,
    2019, Fayed and Atiya, 2019, Qu et al., 2021). In the CNN layer, the number of
    convolutional layers and filters were set as 2 and 16, respectively. Besides,
    the size of the kernel in the convolutional layer was set as 3 × 3, the size of
    pooling operations was set as 2 × 2, and the type of pooling layer was Average-Pooling.
    In the MA mechanism layer, the number of heads and dropout rate were set as 6
    and 0.3. In the BiLSTM layer, the hyperparameters in the forward and backward
    layers were tuned in the same manner as described for the LSTM above. Moreover,
    the RMSE was employed as the fitness function for the MA-CNN-BiLSTM model. 2.6.
    Model implementation Considering that the existing simplified empirical ET0 methods
    mainly include Rn-based, RH-based, and T-based models, this study built three
    types of meteorological input combination aligned with the independent variables
    of corresponding empirical models to evaluate the AI-based ET0 models under the
    same data-deficiency scenario in four climatic zones of China. The input combinations
    and abbreviations for AI models are depicted in Table 1. Table 1. Input meteorological
    variable combinations and abbreviations for Artificial Intelligence models employed
    in this study. Type Model Input variables MARS LSTM BiLSTM CNN-BiLSTM MA-CNN-BiLSTM

    Convolutional bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network, respectively; Tmax,
    Tmin, and Ta are maximum, minimum, and average temperature, respectively, °C;
    n is the sunshine duration, hours; RH is the relative humidity. This study adopted
    both internal and external K-fold cross validation strategies for the implementation
    of empirical and AI models as follows: (1) During the process of internal cross
    validation strategy, the 60-year dataset (1961–2020) of each meteorological station
    was partitioned into five identical segments, where one segment (12 years) was
    allocated for validation whereas the other four segments (48 years) were for development
    (training/calibration). (2) During the process of external cross validation strategy,
    the stations within the same climatic zone were partitioned into two subsets based
    on the “leave-one-out” method (Shiri et al., 2015), where one station was used
    for validation whereas others were for development. Ultimately, the average value
    of multiple validation results served as the assessment criteria for ET0 models.
    Besides, this study employed the Partial Least Squares method (PLS) for parameter
    calibration of empirical models under internal and external K-fold cross validation
    strategies, respectively, and the final results can be roughly considered as the
    temporal and spatial recommended values. 2.7. Model evaluation In this study,
    we accepted the calculated values by the FAO-PM equation as the benchmark since
    it is generally considered the most standard ET0 calculation method worldwide
    (Dong et al., 2022, Fan et al., 2021a, Feng et al., 2016, Martí et al., 2015,
    Xing et al., 2023b). Furthermore, this study employed six statistical accuracy
    indicators to comprehensively evaluate the estimation performance of the different
    ET0 models, including the Determination Coefficient (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency
    coefficient (NSE), Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE), Root Mean Square Error
    (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Global Performance Indicator (GPI), which
    can be expressed as follows: (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) where xi and are the
    daily ET0 values computed using PM equation and corresponding mean values at the
    i-th time step, respectively; yi and are the daily ET0 values obtained by the
    other model and the corresponding mean values at ith time step; GIj refers to
    the normalized value of R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively; GImedian
    denotes the median of the GIj; m denotes the number of statistical indicators;
    To calculate R2 and NSE, the value of αj is assigned 1, whereas, for RRMSE, RMSE,
    and MAE, it is assigned − 1. Using the GPI, the different ET0 models were ranked
    in terms of their overall accuracy. 3. Results 3.1. Spatiotemporal variations
    of meteorological features Fig. 4 presents the spatial distributions and temporal
    trends in the average annual values of Ta, n, Pre, RH, u2, and ET0 in China from
    1961–2020. To be specific, Fig. 4a shows that the averaged annual Ta generally
    increased from north to south, ranging from − 1.8 ℃ to 24.4 ℃. Temporally, Ta
    exhibited an increasing trend, with significant increasing trends, increasing
    trends, significant decreasing trends, and decreasing trends at 572, 21, 2, and
    5 stations, respectively. Conversely, the spatially averaged annual n decreased
    from north to south with values of 1010 − 3478 h (Fig. 4b). Temporally, n displayed
    a decreasing trend, with significant increasing trends, increasing trends, significant
    decreasing trends, and decreasing trends at 17, 58, 409, and 116 stations, respectively.

    ▲, ▼, △, and ▽ represent significant increasement (P < 0.05), significant decreasement
    (P < 0.05), general increasement, and general decreasement, respectively. Fig.
    4c-d indicates that the spatially averaged annual Pre and RH increased from north
    to south, ranging from 17 − 2273 mm and 30 − 87%, respectively. Temporally, Pre
    showed an increasing trend, with 67 stations displaying significant increasing
    trends, 302 stations displaying increasing trends, 14 stations displaying significant
    decreasing trends, and 217 stations displaying decreasing trends. Conversely,
    the RH exhibited a decreasing trend, with significant increasing trends, increasing
    trends, significant decreasing trends, and decreasing trends at 41, 103, 276,
    and 180 stations, respectively. Fig. 4e illustrates that the highest averaged
    annual u2 values occurred in the northeast and northwest, whereas the lowest values
    occurred in the southwest, ranging from 0.52 − 5.46 m s−1. Temporally, u2 showed
    a decreasing trend, with significant increasing trends, increasing trends, significant
    decreasing trends, and decreasing trends at 50, 50, 413, and 87 stations. Moreover,
    the highest averaged annual ET0 values were observed in the northwest, whereas
    the lowest values were observed in the northeast and southwest, ranging from 560 − 1646 mm
    (Fig. 4f). Temporally, ET0 displayed a decreasing trend, with significantly increasing
    trends, increasing trends, significant decreasing trends, and decreasing trends
    at 97, 150, 159, and 194 stations, respectively. 3.2. Accuracy performance of
    radiation-based models For the empirical models, this study used the PLS method
    to locally calibrate their parameters at 600 stations in four climatic zones of
    China, as listed in Table 2. As shown in Table 3, Table 4, the median values of
    R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE by calibrated PT under internal cross validation
    strategy were 0.613–0.809, 0.594–0.761, 0.318–0.529, 0.725–1.299 mm d−1, and 0.620–1.193 mm
    d−1, respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 5 illustrates the boxplots of R2, NSE, RRMSE,
    RMSE, and MAE values acquired by different Rn-based ET0 models to investigate
    accuracy disparities between empirical and AI models under internal strategy.
    Notably, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 was proven to be the best Rn-based ET0 model throughout
    China, with the R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE ranging 0.932–0.972, 0.912–0.962,
    0.129–0.200, 0.294–0.442 mm d−1, and 0.244–0.363 mm d−1, respectively. Compared
    to other Rn-based models, the corresponding improvement values by MA-CNN-BiLSTM1
    ranging 1.15–52.57% for R2, 1.01–53.62% for NSE, 11.45–62.16% for RRMSE, 12.33–65.99%
    for RMSE, and 11.83–69.55% for MAE, respectively. Despite all LSTM-type models
    performing better than MARS and PT, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 was improved most by 13.64–52.57%
    for R2, 15.44–53.62% for NSE, 44.89–62.16% for RRMSE, 50.01–65.99% for RMSE, and
    48.71–69.55% for MAE, respectively. In addition, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 was superior
    to other LSTM-type models by 1.15–14.15% for R2, 1.04–15.95% for NSE, 11.45–43.91%
    for RRMSE, 12.33–46.45% for RMSE, and 11.83–45.02% for MAE, respectively. Besides,
    the results also illustrate that the BiLSTM performed better than the original
    version of LSTM, while BiLSTM was further significantly improved by the CNN module.
    Compared to original LSTM, the CNN-BiLSTM and BiLSTM were improved by 5.27–10.02%
    and 2.02–5.75% for R2, 5.75–10.76% and 2.18–6.33% for NSE, 16.70–28.26% and 4.13–20.42%
    for RRMSE, 20.35–26.91% and 9.74–17.17% for RMSE, and 18.94–29.11% and 4.19–19.46%
    for MAE, respectively. Table 2. The calibrated parameters of empirical models

    plots of daily ET0 values estimated by the PM equation against Rn-based models
    across four climatic zones in China. As shown in Fig. 6, the external Rn-based
    LSTM-type models exhibited a lower dispersion degree compared to the external
    MARS and PT models. In this case, the calibrated “aPT” was 1.512, 0.937, 1.100,
    and 1.315 in TCZ, MPZ, SMZ, and TMZ, respectively (Table 2). Similar to the results
    under internal strategy, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 achieved the best performance among
    external Rn-based ET0 models throughout China, and R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE
    values ranged 0.905–0.926, 0.883–0.920, 0.162–0.224, 0.409–0.585 mm d−1, and 0.294–0.396 mm

    NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE were 4.21–55.28%, 4.02–97.89%, 14.45–68.57%, 14.30–70.15%,
    and 7.09–74.15%, respectively, compared to other external Rn-based models. Besides,
    the external CNN-BiLSTM1 and BiLSTM1 were superior to original LSTM1 by 6.41–11.57%
    and 3.13–6.74% for R2, 7.18–12.12% and 1.56–6.59% for NSE, 18.63–24.85% and 8.99–13.74%

    validation strategies across four climatic zones. Furthermore, the T-based AI
    models exceeded the empirical model, and T-based LSTM-type models outperformed
    the T-based traditional machine learning model (MARS). 3.5. Cross–comparison among
    different types of ET0 models under two strategies Conducting the cross-comparison
    analysis among three types of ET0 estimating models is deemed necessary, as each
    one presents apparent advantages and disadvantages in different climatic conditions.
    Regarding the internal strategy, the accuracy of Rn-based outperformed RH- and
    T-based models in TCZ and MPZ by 1.51–14.40% for R2, 1.17–15.82% for NSE, 4.17–41.63%
    for RRMSE, 3.52–37.91% for RMSE, and 4.62–38.38% for MAE, respectively (Table
    3). Wherein internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 obtained the best performance, with the corresponding
    values ranging 0.957–0.972, 0.949–0.962, 0.129–0.147, 0.294–0.383 mm d−1, and
    0.244–0.309 mm d−1 in R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. Meanwhile,
    internal RH-based models exhibited better accuracy than internal Rn- and T-based
    models by 2.61–23.40% for R2, 1.13–21.28% for NSE, 3.69–46.04% for RRMSE, 2.53–50.58%
    for RMSE, and 2.65–54.98% for MAE in SMZ and TMZ, respectively (Table 4). Specifically,
    internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 gained the best precision in these zones, leading to the
    corresponding values ranging 0.960–0.962, 0.930–0.948, 0.158–0.182, 0.318–0.395 mm
    d−1, and 0.254–0.300 mm d−1 in R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. According
    to above results, internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM1, MA-CNN-BiLSTM2, and MA-CNN-BiLSTM3
    were the corresponding highly recommended Rn-, RH-, and T-based models, and their
    spatial distribution of specific statistical indexes was depicted in Fig. 11.
    Notably, internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 demonstrated a relatively good performance across
    China, except for certain areas with lower accuracy, including the northwestern
    of SMZ and southeastern of TMZ (Fig. 11a-e). Combined with sunshine duration spatial
    distribution in Fig. 4b, it can be inferred that internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 achieved
    higher accuracy in areas with long sunshine duration. Furthermore, internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM2
    showed lower accuracy in the northeastern TCZ and middle MPZ, but higher accuracy
    in the southeastern SMZ and southwestern TMZ (Fig. 11f-j). Considering the spatial
    distribution of RH in Fig. 4d confirmed that the internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 performed
    less accurately in the areas of MPZ, TCZ, and SMZ with lower RH, whereas showed
    a reverse trend in TMZ. In addition, internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM3 showed a decrease
    in accuracy from northeastern to southwestern (Fig. 11k-o). Taking into account
    the Ta spatial distribution in Fig. 4a, it can be deduced that the internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM3
    had inferior accuracy in the area of TCZ and MPZ with lower Ta, whereas the opposite
    trend was observed in SMZ and TMZ. Download : Download high-res image (730KB)

    and MA-CNN-BiLSTM3 (Temperature-based) under internal and external cross-validation
    strategies throughout China, respectively. Concerning the external strategy, Rn-based
    models exhibited superior accuracy than other types in TCZ and MPZ by 3.09–92.94%
    for R2, 2.57–114.83% for NSE, 1.85–39.71% for RRMSE, 1.93–39.63% for RMSE, and
    2.94–43.32% for MAE, respectively (Table 5). wherein external MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 demonstrated
    best performance, with median values of 0.908–0.926, 0.901–0.920, 0.162–0.202,
    0.409–0.585 mm d−1, and 0.294–0.396 mm d−1 for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE,
    respectively. Conversely, external RH- outperformed Rn- and T-based models by
    1.64–17.72% for R2, 2.62–35.79% for NSE, 1.74–43.13% for RRMSE, 1.26–41.17% for
    RMSE, and 1.78–43.37% for MAE in SMZ and TMZ, respectively (Table 6). In particular,
    external MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 achieved highest precision within these zones, as evidenced
    by corresponding values ranging 0.913–0.927, 0.909–0.918, 0.171–0.207, 0.458–0.518 mm
    d−1, and 0.328–0.359 mm d−1 for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. Furthermore,
    according to Fig. 11p-t, the accuracy of external MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 exhibited a gradual
    decrease from central area to northeast and southwest. When considering sunshine
    duration spatial distribution (Fig. 4b), it can be inferred that external MA-CNN-BiLSTM1
    achieved higher precision in areas with the long sunshine duration of MPZ, while
    at TCZ, SMZ and TMZ were opposite. Meanwhile, the accuracy of external MA-CNN-BiLSTM2
    increased from northwest to southeast (Fig. 11u-y). The observed spatial distribution
    of RH in Fig. 4d provides evidence that external MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 exhibited lower
    accuracy in areas characterized by lower RH. Besides, external MA-CNN-BiLSTM3
    demonstrated higher accuracy in northeast and central areas of China, with superior
    performance in TMZ and SMZ than others (Fig. 11z-ad). Given the evident accuracy
    discrepancies among the ET0 models utilizing internal and external K-fold cross
    validation strategies, a cross-comparison analysis is deemed necessary. To be
    specific, the Rn-based models under internal strategy exhibited superior accuracy
    compared to those under external strategy, with improvements of 2.74–15.12%, 1.11–36.25%,
    1.41–32.54%, 1.68–38.53%, and 13.27–33.31% for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE,
    respectively (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Agree with the Rn-based models,
    the corresponding improvements in RH-based models ranged 3.56–45.39% for R2, 1.32–54.65%
    for NSE, 2.13–40.27% for RRMSE, 1.77–43.81% for RMSE, and 6.09–38.87% for MAE,
    respectively (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Similarly, the internal T-based
    models were superior to external ones by 3.11–106.04%, 1.65–120.49%, 1.86–37.74%,
    2.25–45.53%, and 1.21–36.23% for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively.
    In summary, when considering internal and external strategies simultaneously,
    Rn-based models showed higher accuracy in TCZ and MPZ, while RH-based models performed
    better in SMZ and TMZ. Specifically, MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 excelled in TCZ and MPZ, whereas
    MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 yielded better performance in others. Moreover, it is worth noting
    that three types of models demonstrated higher accuracy under internal strategy
    than external strategy. 4. Discussions 4.1. Reasons for accuracy discrepancies
    among different types of ET0 models Given the limited applications of PM, researchers
    have developed different types of models as alternatives to estimate ET0 and tested
    them globally, including empirical models that are based on nonlinear relationships
    between meteorological variables and ET0, the TML employs statistical patterns
    derived from meteorological variables to ET0, as well as the DL that utilize neural
    networks to learn complex mappings between meteorological variables and ET0. In
    the field of DL, LSTM has gained widespread attention due to the introduction
    of four crucial gating units, namely the input gate, forgetting gate, update gate,
    and output gate, which enable LSTM to effectively preserve and propagate useful
    information in long time-series data (Datta and Faroughi, 2023, Dong et al., 2023,
    Xing et al., 2023a, Xing et al., 2022b). However, there exist considerable accuracy
    discrepancies among different models due to structures. In this study, LSTM had
    a better ET0 estimation accuracy under internal and external strategies than MARS
    and empirical models by 1.19–118.35% for R2, 2.53–114.07% for NSE, 2.72–50.01%
    for RRMSE, 3.57–54.06% for RMSE, and 2.96–53.89% for MAE, respectively (Table
    3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Consistently, Chen et al. (2020) conducted a comparative
    analysis of ET0 estimation accuracy between empirical models, TML, and DL, leading
    to the conclusion that LSTM achieved the best performance. This is mainly attributed
    to the fact that the DL, particularly LSTM, possesses a multi-layer neural network
    structure for progressive extraction and features combination between meteorological
    variables compared to empirical models and TML, thereby effectively capturing
    nonlinear relationships within the data (Pratama and Wang, 2019). Additionally,
    LSTM exhibits outstanding performance in managing long time-series data, showcasing
    the ability to autonomously extract features from meteorological variables while
    combining them across multiple time steps. It also can automatically adapt parameters
    based on meteorological variables, thereby enabling LSTM to demonstrate robust
    effectiveness across diverse environmental and geographical conditions. Therefore,
    owing to LSTM''s enhanced nonlinear modeling proficiency, adeptness in managing
    time series data, automated feature extraction, and adaptability to diverse conditions,
    it surpasses empirical models and MARS in ET0 estimation. However, LSTM still
    encounters challenges such as overfitting and gradient vanishing, prompting researchers
    to propose various LSTM-type variants to address these limitations (Valipour et
    al., 2023, Yan et al., 2023, Zhu and Xie, 2023). Besides, this study presented
    that the performance of CNN-BiLSTM and BiLSTM was better than LSTM, wherein CNN-BiLSTM
    outperformed BiLSTM. Consistently, Yin et al. (2020) showed that BiLSTM exhibited
    superior performance in ET0 estimation, with ranging 0.159–0.323 mm d–1 for RMSE,
    0.039–0.089 mm d–1 for MAE, 0.943–0.992 for Pearson''s correlation coefficient,
    and 0.982–0.988 for NSE, respectively. Zhu and Xie (2023) displayed that CNN-BiLSTM
    achieved superior performance in PM2.5 forecasting, yielding an R2 of 0.94. Longjam
    et al. (2023) demonstrated the efficacy of CNN-BiLSTM in accurately discerning
    the authenticity of handwritten signatures. Specifically, the BiLSTM improves
    the structure of the original LSTM by incorporating two directional hidden layers,
    one propagating forward and the other backward, thereby enabling the simultaneous
    utilization of both past and future information (Xiong et al., 2023). Moreover,
    it not only improves the original LSTM structure but also couples a CNN module
    by considering CNN-BiLSTM, enabling CNN to extract local features and efficiently
    transmit them to BiLSTM, thus enhancing the capture of both local and global features
    (Yang et al., 2021a). Furthermore, the parameter sharing and pooling operations
    within convolutional layers contribute to reducing model parameters, consequently
    mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the convolutional operations
    of CNN accommodate inputs of varying scales, rendering CNN-BiLSTM more flexible
    and applicable across diverse dimensions and sizes of input data (Wang et al.,
    2019). Hence, despite the superior performance of CNN-BiLSTM over BiLSTM, they
    have emerged as a highly effective tool among the LSTM-type variants in ET0 estimation.
    Furthermore, while there are several advantages associated with CNN-BiLSTM, its
    application is constrained by the potential redundancy in feature representation,
    where certain features extracted by CNN are still processed by BiLSTM, resulting
    in duplicated feature information (Lin et al., 2022, Zhou et al., 2022). To address
    these limitations and enhance model performance, incorporating the attention mechanism
    provides a sensible approach that allows models to focus on relevant segments
    of input data, reducing reliance on redundant information (Han et al., 2023).
    Datta and Faroughi (2023) also demonstrated that the accuracy of MA-LSTM outperformed
    LSTM in predicting soil moisture, improving RMSE by 23.53–54.21%. Nevertheless,
    the attention mechanism typically focuses on a single aspect of input data, potentially
    constraining their performance (Zhang et al., 2019). Consequently, the multi-head
    attention mechanism (MA) has been developed based on the foundation of the attention
    mechanism, which enhances model representational capacity by simultaneously computing
    multiple attention heads in parallel, enabling the model to better capture interrelationships
    and dependencies among input data (Essa and Abdelmaksoud, 2023). Therefore, this
    study integrated the advantages of the MA, CNN, and BiLSTM, resulting in the development
    of the novel MA-CNN-BiLSTM model, which modifies the original LSTM structure and
    synergistically integrates MA and CNN modules. Additionally, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    achieved the highest precision among the employed models in this study under internal
    and external K-fold cross validation strategies, with the corresponding values
    ranging 0.797–0.972 for R2, 0.786–0.962 for NSE, and 0.129–0.335 for RRMSE, 0.294–0.969 mm
    d−1 for RMSE, and 0.244–0.699 mm d−1 for MAE, respectively (Table 3, Table 4,
    Table 5, Table 6). To be specific, the CNN layer is utilized for extracting local
    features and structural information from the input data. Additionally, the MA
    mechanism allows the model to establish weighted connections between different
    parts of the input data, enabling the model to better process intricate relationships,
    thereby facilitating an understanding of the global structure and patterns (Bin
    et al., 2019). Furthermore, the MA is capable of learning multiple distinct points
    of focus, contributing to the enhancement of data representation learning. Each
    attention head can specialize in different aspects of the features, enabling the
    model to better discriminate between diverse information present in the input
    data. Moreover, the utilization of the MA mechanism permits the model to concurrently
    consider information from multiple attention heads, mitigating the risk of overfitting.
    Each head can concentrate on different facets of the data, thereby reducing the
    potential for excessive fitting to specific samples (Lin et al., 2020). Ultimately,
    the BiLSTM layer is employed to capture temporal dependencies in long time-series
    data, simultaneously considering both past and future information. Hence, through
    integrating the advantages of the Multi-Head Attention mechanism, MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    accomplishes a comprehensive improvement in model performance, establishing itself
    as an efficient model for ET0 estimation. To summarize, while LSTM demonstrates
    excellent performance in ET0 estimation due to the “gate” structure than empirical
    models and TML, the BiLSTM further modifies the limitations of LSTM by introducing
    the bidirectional structure. Moreover, this study enhances the feature extraction
    capability and automatic focus adjustment of BiLSTM by integrating CNN and MA.
    Therefore, the novel proposed MA-CNN-BiLSTM model, which incorporates the MA,
    CNN, and BiLSTM as the intricate relationship processor, feature extractor, and
    regression component, respectively, can be recommended as a reliable approach
    to addressing high-dimensional nonlinear time series problems and holds significant
    potential for applications in other domains. 4.2. Reasons for accuracy discrepancies
    among ET0 models using different inputs In addition to the influence of model
    structures, the different input meteorological variables combinations of models
    hold considerable significance during the ET0 estimation process. As the most
    crucial energy source within the atmospheric system of Earth, solar radiation
    plays a pivotal role in regulating and driving the process of evapotranspiration
    (Gleeson et al., 2020). Numerous studies have reported that the Rn–based models
    with input combination exhibited superior performance than other models. To be
    specific, Ahmadi and Javanbakht (2020) found that Rn-based outperformed T-based
    models in ET0 estimation, demonstrating improvements of 12.11–45.87%. Consistently,
    the Rn-based demonstrated superior accuracy than RH-based and T-based models under
    both internal and external strategies in TCZ and MPZ, with improvements ranging
    1.51–92.94% for R2, 1.17–114.83% for NSE, 1.85–41.63% for RRMSE, 1.93–39.63% for
    RMSE, and 2.94–43.32% for MAE, respectively (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table
    6). In regions characterized by intense solar radiation, such as TCZ and MPZ,
    the ET0 is predominantly controlled by available solar radiation energy (Jiang
    and Zhu, 2023). Besides, the Rn-based model can accurately describe the energy
    transfer and conversion process, thereby enhancing ET0 estimation (He et al.,
    2017). Therefore, the superiority of the Rn- over T- and RH-based models is evident
    in TCZ and MPZ. However, apart from solar radiation, RH also exerts an influence
    on the rate of evaporation. Numerous prior research has demonstrated that RH-based
    models achieved superior performance in ET0 estimation. Ferreira et al. (2019)
    demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models by 7–24% when incorporating the
    RH variable for ET0 estimation in Brazil. Bashir et al. (2023) found that the
    RH-based ANN surpassed the T-based ANN by 34.86%. In this study, RH- exhibited
    superior performance compared to Rn- and T-based models under both internal and
    external strategies in SMZ and TMZ, exhibiting improvements by 1.64–23.40%, 1.13–35.79%,
    1.74–46.04%, 1.26–50.58%, and 1.78–54.98% for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively
    (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). This result can be attributed to the significant
    water vapor exchange leading to high humidity but relatively weak solar radiation
    in SMZ and TMZ, where RH stands as the predominant factor influencing ET0 (Fan
    et al., 2016). Additionally, RH exhibits significant variability within these
    zones. Hence, the superior accuracy of models employing RH-based input combinations
    compared to T-based and RH-based models becomes apparent in SMZ and TMZ. Moreover,
    despite the superior accuracy exhibited by Rn-based and RH-based models over T-based
    models in prior research, it should be noted that the availability of Rn and RH
    data is relatively limited compared to temperature data across various regions.
    Consequently, T-based models remain extensively utilized worldwide. Bellido-Jiménez
    et al. (2020) found that the accuracy of AI models utilizing T-based inputs exhibits
    superior performance for ET0 estimation in Spain. Feng et al. (2017b) discovered
    that the T-based Extreme Learning Machine exhibited superior performance in ET0
    estimation compared to T-based Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and
    HS models, achieving RRMSE of 0.198, MAE of 0.267 mm d–1, and NSE of 0.891. Similarly,
    this study showed that the internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM3 demonstrated superior accuracy
    within TMZ compared to its performance in the other three zones, yielding R2,
    NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE values of 0.921, 0.901, 0.208, 0.491 mm d−1, and 0.396 mm
    d−1, respectively (Table 4). Besides, the accuracy of external MA-CNN-BiLSTM3
    in SMZ and TMZ surpassed that of the model in TCZ and MPZ, achieving the corresponding
    values ranging 0.868–0.872 for R2, 0.851–0.869 for NSE, 0.269–0.301 for RRMSE,
    0.671–0.779 mm d−1 for RMSE, and 0.494–0.578 mm d−1 for MAE, respectively (Table
    5, Table 6). These findings can be attributed to higher temperatures and relatively
    weak solar radiation in TMZ and SMZ, highlighting the prominent influence of temperature
    as a primary driver of evapotranspiration. Thus, due to the relatively easy accessibility
    and higher accuracy of temperature data in many regions, the application of T-based
    ET0 models is more widespread. To summarize, Rn-based models achieved the best
    ET0 estimates in TCZ and MPZ, while RH-based models were better in other zones,
    which implies that the accuracy and reliability of ET0 models are highly dependent
    on meteorological inputs. It is worth noting that the selection about the types
    of input variables is a crucial process that requires comprehensive consideration
    of multiple factors, including geographical environment, data availability, and
    correlations. 4.3. Advantages and disadvantages between two cross validation strategies
    In the estimating ET0 process, besides model structures and input combinations,
    the model validation strategy also exerts a significant influence on estimation
    accuracy. The cross validation strategy is widely applied for assessing model
    performance, including internal cross validation strategy and external cross validation
    strategy, both of which play pivotal roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities
    (Roberts et al., 2017). Besides, the accuracy of models based on both internal
    and external cross validation strategies exhibits considerable variability. Feng
    et al. (2017a) compared RF and GRNN models for estimating ET0 under both internal
    and external cross validation strategies and found that internal Random Forests
    (RF) and GRNN outperformed external RF and GRNN models by 4.71–21.87%. Xing et
    al. (2022a) reported that the internal Deep Belief Network-Long Short-Term Memory
    network (DBN-LSTM) exhibited superior accuracy compared to the external DBN-LSTM,
    with an improvement ranging from 3.03–5.59%. Similarly, the Rn-, RH-, and T-based
    models using internal strategy displayed superior accuracy compared to those using
    external strategy in this study, with improvements of 2.74–106.04% for R2, 1.11–120.49%
    for NSE, 1.41–40.27% for RRMSE, 1.68–45.53% for RMSE, and 1.21–38.87% for MAE,
    respectively (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Obviously, the internal strategy
    employs the same dataset for both training and validation compared to the external
    strategy, yielding a more stable estimate performance that is less susceptible
    to dataset variations. Besides, internal strategy enhances dataset utilization
    and contributes to reducing model overfitting by conducting multiple validations
    on distinct validation subsets within the same dataset (Hao et al., 2020). Hence,
    assessing the applicability of ET0 models using the internal strategy has the
    potential to fill data gaps and offer managers a practical alternative when utilizing
    fewer meteorological observation data, thereby enhancing decision-making accuracy
    in scenarios involving data scarcity. Moreover, despite the aforementioned advantages
    of the internal K-fold cross validation strategy, the application of the external
    K-fold cross validation strategy is extensively widespread (Shao et al., 2013).
    Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated that external DL, TML, and empirical models yielded
    in estimating ET0, with variations in RMSE ranging from 0.502–0.964 mm d–1, respectively.
    Mehdizadeh et al. (2017) estimated daily dew point temperature (Tdew) using meteorological
    data from the adjacent station, and they found that the meteorological data of
    the adjacent station can be used to predict Tdew. Martí et al. (2015) found that
    the external Gene Expression Programming (GEP) model achieved better accuracy
    for estimating ET0 in Spain, displaying RMSE and MAE ranging from 0.235–0.744 mm
    d–1 and 0.097–0.285 mm d–1, respectively. Identically, the ranges for external
    models were 0.336–0.927 for R2, 0.300–0.920 for NSE, 0.162–0.698 for RRMSE, 0.409–1.869 mm
    d−1 for RMSE, and 0.295–1.505 mm d−1 for MAE in this study, respectively (Table
    5, Table 6). Apparently, given that the model is trained on a subset while validated
    on a different one, the external cross validation strategy safeguards against
    any information leakage from validation set into training process, which mitigates
    the concern of overestimated model performance stemming from improper data processing.
    Besides, it also enables accurate evaluations of model performance on the absent
    dataset, ensuring a reliable assessment for the generalization capability of models
    (Breve et al., 2023). Particularly in China with diverse geographical and climatic
    conditions, there are only 629 nationwide meteorological stations that possess
    comprehensive historical observational meteorological data due to equipment malfunctions
    and external disruptions, with the spatial distribution of these stations being
    uneven. Therefore, the application of external strategy is necessary to verify
    the appropriateness of ET0 models in regions lacking complete historical meteorological
    observation data. To summarize, the Rn-, RH-, and T-based ET0 models using internal
    strategy presented superior accuracy compared to those using the external strategy,
    which highlights the crucial role of cross validation strategy as a key technique
    for developing excellent ET0 estimation models and underscores its importance
    in model evaluation, data utilization, and mitigating overfitting. 4.4. Analysis
    of uncertainties, limitations, and applications It is widely acknowledged that
    all models are subject to uncertainties and limitations (Refsgaard and Henriksen,
    2004). Despite the quality of meteorological data bringing uncertainty to ET0
    models during development (Cui et al., 2023), the selection of input variables
    significantly impacts the estimates by AI models impute to complex drive-response
    relationships (Xing et al., 2022a, Xing et al., 2023c). In addition, the lengths
    of training and testing datasets also exerted an inevitable impact on the generalization,
    robustness, and accuracy of the non-linear model (Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020).
    Beyond that, while the novel LSTM-type model developed based on sophisticated
    structure-enriched functionality, it also brings potential system errors and cumulative
    errors. Meanwhile, the hybrid structure of multiple models results in numerous
    hyperparameters, which became the main sources of uncertainties for the MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    model. Moreover, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM model demands substantial computational resources
    and runtime, thereby introducing difficulties concerning operational efficiency
    and maintenance. Another main methodology uncertainty is that the DL models are
    frequently regarded as “black boxes” owing to the complex structures and nonlinear
    transformations inherent, thereby there are potential challenges of interpretability
    and transparency to DL models (Tjoa and Guan, 2021). Through analyzing the sources
    of uncertainty in estimation results, it is revealed that the present study is
    mainly limited by the lack of preprocessing methods for input selection. We highly
    appreciate Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh (2020), who successfully determined the optimal
    input combinations for the SVR-based ET0 model using pre-processing approaches
    in Iran. Besides, Ahmadi et al. (2021) proposed the τ Kendall and entropy as pre-processing
    techniques to discern the effective climatic parameters for AI models. We sincerely
    agree that the above operation is necessary for improving the estimation accuracy
    of AI models, which this study did not touch on this field regretfully. Moreover,
    even if this study adopts the cross validation strategy to build the ET0 models,
    the fixed ratio between the training and testing sets is still limited to the
    research result, without considering the potential performance of other values.
    We also admire the research conducted by Hossein Kazemi et al. (2020) that different
    temporal data partitioning scenarios were assessed for ET0 estimation with machine
    learning techniques in arid regions. Moreover, the present study merely focuses
    on the accuracy performance of different ET0 models, without considering their
    operating efficiency and model complexity (Wang and Liu, 2006). Despite the aforementioned
    uncertainties and limitations, the main contribution of the present study is the
    proposal of a novel LSTM-type ET0 estimated model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) to cope with
    various data-missing scenarios in different climatic zones of China, which can
    provide scientific support for decision-making in agricultural water resource
    management. By combining accurate ET0 estimates and crop coefficient (Kc), agricultural
    practitioners can formulate appropriate irrigation strategies based on actual
    water requirements (ET) to mitigate water wastage and prevent overexploitation
    of land resources (Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020, Yan et al., 2021). In addition,
    it is believed that its effective simulation can contribute to research on ecosystems,
    climate change, and environmental protection because the ET0 is a major component
    of the Earth''s water cycle (Ahmadi et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2022a, Ferreira
    and da Cunha, 2020). Regarding the MA-CNN-BiLSTM possesses excellent robustness
    in solving time series problems by incorporating the MA, CNN, and BiLSTM as the
    intricate relationship processor, feature extractor, and regression component,
    there is a reasonable prospect that it would adapt to similar fields such as financial
    issues, meteorological disasters, and runoff prediction, etc. 5. Conclusions and
    future works This study conducted a comprehensive assessment of the performance
    accuracy for MA-CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM, MARS, and three empirical
    models with limited meteorological data under internal and external k-fold cross
    validation strategies for ET0 estimation during 1961–2020 in four climatic zones
    of China, respectively. Based on the results and discussions, the main conclusions
    could be summarized as follows: (1) The MA-CNN-BiLSTM exhibited the highest accuracy
    in estimating ET0 using limited meteorological input combinations under both internal
    and external strategies in four climatic zones of China, with median values ranging
    0.797–0.972 for R2, 0.786–0.962 for NSE, and 0.129–0.335 for RRMSE, 0.294–0.969 mm
    d−1 for RMSE, and 0.244–0.699 mm d−1 for MAE, respectively. Besides, based on
    GPI, the accuracy of ET0 models can be ranked from best to worst: MA-CNN-BiLSTM,
    CNN-BiLSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM, MARS, and empirical models. (2) Under incomplete meteorological
    input combinations, the Rn-based demonstrated superior accuracy than RH-based
    and T-based models under both internal and external strategies in TCZ and MPZ,
    with improvements ranging 1.51–92.94% for R2, 1.17–114.83% for NSE, 1.85–41.63%
    for RRMSE, 1.93–39.63% for RMSE, and 2.94–43.32% for MAE, respectively. In contrast,
    RH-based outperformed Rn-based and T-based models in SMZ and TMZ, achieving improvements
    by 1.64–23.40%, 1.13–35.79%, 1.74–46.04%, 1.26–50.58%, and 1.78–54.98% for R2,
    NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. Specifically, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM with
    Rn-based input combination excelled in TCZ and MPZ, while the MA-CNN-BiLSTM with
    RH-based input combination yielded the best performance in other zones. (3) The
    Rn-based, RH-based, and T-based models demonstrated higher accuracy when employing
    the internal cross validation strategy in comparison to the external strategy,
    with improvements values ranging 2.74–106.04% for R2, 1.11–120.49% for NSE, 1.41–40.27%
    for RRMSE, 1.68–45.53% for RMSE, and 1.21–38.87% for MAE, respectively. Nevertheless,
    employing external strategy carries higher practical importance, as it yields
    accuracies ranging from 0.336–0.927 for R2, 0.300–0.920 for NSE, 0.162–0.698 for
    RRMSE, 0.409–1.869 mm d−1 for RMSE, and 0.295–1.505 mm d−1 for MAE across the
    three types of models, respectively. Through the limitation discussion of model
    implementation and research method, we would propose the pre-processing approaches
    to analyze the importance of variables and construct input combinations of the
    model to expand the application value of AI models in the field of ET0 estimation
    using incomplete data (Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020). In addition, the introduction
    of different temporal data partitioning methods and model complexity index may
    be another important future work to improve the accuracy and robustness of the
    novel developed model in this study. Considering the substantial applications
    of this study, future research will be also conducted to enhance ET0 estimation
    by integrating meteorological data, satellite remote sensing data, and ground
    observation data. Future research could investigate the impacts of geospatial
    distribution and spatiotemporal dynamics on ET0 models, thus enabling more precise
    forecasting of ET0 trends across varying regions and periods. In the future, there
    will be potential to combine AI and empirical models to enhance both the interpretability
    and reliability of ET0 estimation, with a primary focus on constructing more physically
    meaningful models for a comprehensive understanding of ET0 fluctuations. Moreover,
    we believe that the application of the MA-CNN-BiLSTM should not be limited to
    ET0 estimation, but has broad prospects in fields such as new energy development,
    meteorological disaster prevention, and ecological environment protection, which
    was also one of our long-term work plans. Supplementary data Table S1 Basic information

    The outcomes of the analysis demonstrate that the Random Forest Regressor model
    exhibits superior predictive performance. The results imply that a holistic approach,
    encompassing diverse environmental factors and crop growth stages, could result
    in more precise and dependable millet yield predictions. These results mark a
    leap forward in crop yield prediction for data-poor regions, paving the way for
    more accurate and efficient agricultural management. By emphasizing the critical
    role of detailed, spatio-temporal data, this work substantially enhances model
    precision, informing targeted strategies to boost yields. This advancement stands

    regionsYield Prediction 1. Introduction Improving agricultural production is the
    key to reducing food insecurity in developing countries (Christiaensen and Martin,
    2018). Not only does agriculture provide food, but also it is a large source of
    employment. In Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 80% of rural households’ income relies
    on the agricultural industry (Davis et al., 2017). However, this major source
    of income and employment is threatened by environmental stressors such as climate
    change, supply-chain disruptions, and global crises such as COVID-19 that caused
    most developing countries to continue to experience food insecurity (Endris et
    al., 2021; Bedeke, 2022). Climate change and variability have caused most developing
    countries to experience food insecurity in the past few decades due to over-dependence
    on rainfed agriculture (Bedeke, 2022). Meanwhile, adopting Climate Smart Agricultural
    (CSA) interventions can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of climate change
    (Lipper et al., 2014, Okolie et al., 2022). Among these interventions, drought
    and flood monitoring and forecasting systems can help understand the magnitude
    and timing of water shortages. The aforementioned systems hold promise in supporting
    decision-makers with vital information to refine national and regional plans to
    mitigate the consequences of extreme environmental events (UN-Environment, 2017).
    However, these interventions alone are insufficient for a precise assessment of
    food insecurity (Sidikjonovich, 2023). This is because they only provide an indirect
    correlation between water imbalance effects and agricultural yield. On the other
    hand, direct yield estimation methods, which assess the effects of extreme climatic
    events on crop yield, can provide a more effective basis for policymakers when
    considering alternative strategies to tackle food insecurity (Ren et al., 2008,
    Glauber et al., 2021). Yield estimation can be accomplished through several means.
    Conventional forecasting systems heavily rely on field observations such as rainfall
    and temperature data obtained through weather stations or in-situ sensors (Bastiaanssen
    and Ali, 2003). Owing to their science-based physiological explanatory ability,
    process-based models provide the most transparent forecasting systems; however,
    they are data-intensive, rely heavily on field observations, and generally, are
    costly to deploy, operate, and maintain at the national scale (Li et al., 2015).
    Especially in data-scare regions, process-based models are constrained by the
    lack of ground observation to verify their performance. Hence, a vast majority
    of studies in recent years have shifted toward the use of remote sensing data
    for crop yield prediction for different purposes and at different scales (Ilyas
    et al., 2023, Singh and Das, 2022, Khaki et al., 2021). As technology advances,
    remotely sensed products have proved to be reliable, easily accessible, and uniformly
    available even in the most remote areas. The use of recently developed remote
    sensing satellite imagery allows the production of high-resolution data, which
    is readily available and not constrained by geographical or environmental factors.
    This approach overcomes the limitations inherent in traditional data acquisition
    processes that can be hindered by such parameters (Sui et al., 2018). As these
    products continually improve in quality and frequency, there is a high probability
    that the predictability of forecasting models using these products can revolutionize
    agricultural and water resources management (Sheffield et al., 2018). Traditional
    remote sensing-based yield estimation techniques typically rely on a single parameter
    extracted from satellite images to construct a correlation between said parameter
    and crop yield (Panek and Gozdowski, 2020, Lopresti et al., 2015, Meroni et al.,
    2013). Nevertheless, recent research has started to integrate multiple parameters
    in an effort to establish a more comprehensive correlation between these aggregated
    parameters and crop yield (Muruganantham et al., 2022). For instance, Kern et
    al. (2018) formulated a highly precise crop yield prediction model based on multiple
    linear regression for four primary crops in Hungary: winter wheat, rapeseed, maize,
    and sunflower. The parameters encompassed average nitrogen application, temperature
    extremes (minimum and maximum), mean vapor pressure deficit, monthly average Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, average monthly soil moisture levels,
    and potential prediction timeframe. However, traditional linear regression models
    are not effective for all types of crops and regions. Therefore, Cheng et al.
    (2022) leveraged data-driven methods to mitigate this limitation in predicting
    winter wheat yield. The model incorporated factors such as Sentinel-2 and ZY-1
    02D remote sensing images, the greenness vegetation index, and the water index.
    In conclusion, to enhance the accuracy of yield prediction utilizing multi-spectral
    imagery, the integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial dimensions has been
    studied in crop yield estimation research (Qiao et al., 2021). Despite these improvements
    in crop yield estimations, many of these methods have been created for developing
    countries with limited scalability to other regions. In addition, the predictability
    of some previous studies is undermined by incomplete datasets attributable to
    adverse weather conditions. However, advancements in technology have yielded new
    satellite imagery products that can help bridge gaps in data while concurrently
    furnishing more precise and higher-resolution information. Therefore, our goal
    in this study is to use technological advancement in remote sensing to estimate
    crop yield in data-scared regions such as Senegal. The problem is further aggravated
    due to a lack of reliable ground observation data that is usually aggregated at
    a large scale, such as the department (administrative unit) level. In order to
    address these challenges, the following objectives should be considered: 1) examining
    the sensitivity of remotely sensed products to crop yield variabilities in different
    regions and 2) developing the regional crop yield predictive models. The novelty
    of this work is the contribution of sub-seasonal and unaggregated crop information
    in order to improve the overall model predictability in case of data scarcity
    in developing regions of the world. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area This
    study is Senegal, a country in West Africa. Senegal has a dry tropical climate,
    with an average annual rainfall of about 1200 (mm) in the south and about 300
    mm in the arid zones. Between 1991 and 2020, the mean annual temperature was about
    28.91 degrees Celsius (World Bank Group, 2021). The soil type is primarily sandy,
    which allows crops like millet, sorghum, corn, and groundnuts to grow very well
    in most of its agricultural departments. Rice is also grown well in the irrigated
    areas of Senegal. With slightly over 3 million hectares of arable land nationwide,
    only about 2% is irrigated (Global Yield Gap Atlas, 2016). Senegal’s agriculture
    sector is very significant, as it takes up about 43% of the country’s total area,
    contributes about 17% to the GDP, and offers employment to about 70% of its population
    (Feed The Future, 2015). Millet production, like the production of other cereals,
    experiences yearly variability influenced by diverse weather patterns and economic
    pressures (Debieu et al., 2018, Kane et al., 2016). However, as of 2016, millet
    had emerged as the second-largest contributor to the national food production
    system, following groundnuts, and accounting for roughly 20% of the total agricultural
    activities (Feed The Future, 2015). Furthermore, in 2018, it accounted for 30%
    of all cereal production in the country (Kane et al., 2023). 2.2. Modeling overview
    Our research proposes three hypotheses to enhance the accuracy of millet yield
    prediction. The first hypothesis suggests that incorporating soil moisture-based
    indices derived from high-resolution satellite-based soil moisture retrievals
    can improve the prediction. The second hypothesis suggests that a prediction model
    based on individual stages of millet growth will be more effective than a model
    based on the average of all stages. Lastly, we hypothesize that accounting for
    the area of millet production at the department level during different growth
    stages can improve the overall model predictability. To test these hypotheses,
    we introduce a modeling procedure, which is presented schematically in Fig. 1
    and briefly explained in the following section. Download : Download high-res image

    Crop yield is affected by both spatiotemporal and physiographical variables. Therefore,
    in the first step, we obtained remotely sensed data on temperature, soil moisture,
    precipitation, as well as vegetation cover to develop different spatiotemporal
    variables. We also utilized physiographical variables derived from a combination
    of remote sensing and ground observations data pertaining to soil characteristics.
    These variables were used to perform Predictive and Exploratory Analysis. Thirty
    eight variables, collected from all Senegal departments, went through an initial
    series of checks to examine their interdependency, validity, and correlation with
    crop yield through the preprocessing stage. This information is then fed to a
    series of machine learning (ML) and nested cross-validation techniques to identify
    the most robust model. In the next step, we are performing variable reduction
    strategies to reduce the burden of future data collection and improve computational
    time. Variables are systematically reduced to identify the best combination of
    variables for the optimal ML model. Finally, the optimal model is subjected to
    permutation importance analysis to determine the significance of each feature.
    This involves shuffling the values of each feature in the validation dataset and
    comparing the model’s performance on the shuffled and original datasets. The importance
    scores of each feature are averaged over multiple iterations for a more reliable
    estimate. 2.3. Data input 2.3.1. Crop yield data Five-year (2016 – 2020) crop
    yield data for millet were obtained for 43 departments in Senegal (Vieira Junior
    et al., 2023). Millet production is predominantly in the western region, with
    the highest production in the southwest and the lowest in the north (Fig. 2.a).
    Fig. 2.b shows the millet production zones clustered using k-means method and
    the country’s average yield value of 43 departments (Fig. 2). The planting period
    of millet across the country ranges from June to July; this is the period between
    the beginning and end of the planting exercise. August is the main growing period
    of millet in Senegal; this is the period that the crop attains most of its vegetative
    growth and achieves maximum canopy cover. The harvesting of millet ranges from
    September to November; this is the period when the crop is removed from the field
    (FAO, 2020). The harvesting period seems spatially longer than the planting and
    growing periods because millet can be harvested from the time the grains mature
    while the crop is still using water and nutrients for its growth-producing fresh
    grains until the crop stops growing and loses water-producing dry grains. Download

    average yield. 2.3.2. Spatiotemporal and physiographical variables The following
    remote sensing products were employed to assess the impact of various environmental
    stressors on crop productivity at different stages of development. The source
    and further details of these remote sensing products are presented in Table 1
    and section A1.0 of the Supplementary Materials. Also, since the reported yield
    data was at the department level while remote sensing data have varying spatial
    scales, it was necessary to upscale the remote sensing products to the department
    level. The upscaling was achieved by averaging all cells of a department using
    the ArcGIS version 10.8.1 zonal statistic tool. Additionally, the remote sensing
    data was only extracted for areas with agricultural land use. Then, all indices
    were calculated/extracted for three millet development stages: planting (June-July),
    growing (August), and harvesting (September to November) periods (FAO, 2020).
    In summary, eight remote sensing products were utilized to estimate yield during
    the planting, growing, harvesting, and development seasons, resulting in 38 predictor
    variables. Table 1. Remote sensing products used for the yield prediction. Index

    The remotely sensed products and observation data used in this study are generally
    categorized into spatiotemporal and physiographical groups (section A1.0 of the
    Supplementary Materials). The spatiotemporal variables were carefully selected
    to capture the environmental stressors that change over time and space. Meanwhile,
    the physiographical variables are limited to those that represent local conditions.
    2.3.3. Data analysis 2.3.3.1. Bias correction After conducting an extensive analysis
    of crop cultivation in every department of Senegal between 2016 and 2020, we found
    that multiple crops were grown in the same department and could not be differentiated
    during data acquisition. As a result, the remotely sensed data, particularly the
    NDVI, which measures the reflectance of vegetation in a given area, did not distinguish
    millet from other crops. This led to elevated NDVI readings, even during millet
    harvesting periods, which were attributed to other crops grown in the same department
    as millet. Moreover, the growing vegetation could have influenced soil moisture
    readings, which are essential in calculating the WDI. To reduce the margin of
    error, we identified the exact size of the cultivated area where millet was grown
    in each department and established a Bias Correction factor (Tables S1 to S3).
    By considering only the area in which millet is grown, we can more accurately
    compute the WDI with respect to the planting, growing, and harvesting periods.
    This correction factor will improve the accuracy of similar calculations and provide
    a more precise understanding of the agricultural conditions in Senegal. 2.3.3.2.
    Exploratory analysis: spatiotemporal and physiographical variable analysis We
    aim to investigate the individual effects of spatiotemporal and physiographic
    variables on millet crop yields as well as the relationships between these variables
    using Spearman’s rank correlation and linear mixed effects model, as they have
    different strengths and weaknesses. With Spearman’s rank correlation, we examined
    the correlation between all remote sensing indices and crop yield to understand
    their annual variabilities. Meanwhile, we statistically identified the most relevant
    indices to crop yield regardless of temporal variability with the linear mixed
    effects model. By investigating the independent effects of these factors, we can
    better understand how they influence millet crop yields. Data were analyzed using
    the R statistical software (R Core Team, 2022). We employed a linear mixed effects
    model to test the effect of independent variables (WDI, SMI, GDDI, VI, SMDI, SRI3,
    SPI3, DSI, sand content, silt content, clay content, nitrogen content, SOC, and
    rainfall erosivity (during the planting, growing, and harvesting stages of plant
    growth) on millet yield using the package ‘lmerTest” (Kuznetsova et al., 2017).
    Independent variables were considered fixed effects, and departments and years
    were considered random effects. All independent variables were continuous, and
    we standardized the variables (mean centered at 0 and standard deviation of 1)
    because the means of some variables were different by many orders of magnitude,
    leading to scaling issues. Model residuals were assessed visually by plotting
    model residuals against predicted values to assess constant variance, and the
    responses were log-transformed to meet the model assumption. Additionally, a QQ-plot
    was used to visually evaluate the normality of the model residuals, and it was
    found that the model satisfied the assumptions of normality. Outliers were identified
    using the function outlierTest (Fox and Weisberg, 2019). Significant mean shifting
    studentized residuals were identified based on Bonferroni adjusted p values and
    were removed from the model. Next, a backward elimination stepwise regression
    was used to identify candidate predictors of millet yield using package “stats”
    (R Core Team, 2022). Starting with the current model including all predictors,
    one predictor was dropped at a time, and AIC values were computed for each model.
    The candidate model with the lowest AIC was used as a final model. Partial residuals
    plotted against each significant predictor suggested that higher-order polynomial
    regression was unnecessary. Each significant predictor of millet yield was then
    categorized into four different categories based on quantiles to assess mean differences
    in millet yield. The model with categorical predictors was subjected to ANOVA.
    Post hoc mean separation tests were performed on significant predictors based
    on tukey adjusted p values at the alpha level of 0.05 using the “emmeans” package
    (Lenth et al., 2023). Finally, back-transformed estimated marginal means are reported.
    2.3.3.3. Predictive analysis: crop yield estimations In this task, we aimed to
    predict millet yield using the spatiotemporal and physiographical features dataset.
    The task started with preprocessing, in which we applied MinMax, Robust, Standard,
    and Power Transformer scaling methods, respectively, to the input and output variables
    to ensure that the differences would not influence our model in the scale of the
    features (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Then, to find the best hyperparameters for
    the ML models and to evaluate their performance, we used nested cross-validation
    with the following configurations: 1) Inner cross-validation loop: This loop is
    responsible for selecting the best hyperparameters for the model and 2) Outer
    cross-validation loop: This loop is responsible for estimating the model’s performance.
    We divided the dataset into multiple, equally-sized folds (in our case, 5). In
    each iteration of the loop, one of these folds was set aside as “test set,” while
    the remaining folds were used for training the model. This process was repeated
    until each fold had been used as the test set once. The average performance across
    all iterations provided an unbiased estimate of the model’s performance. For each
    iteration in the outer loop, we performed another cross-validation process on
    the training data (again using 5 folds). This time, however, we used a grid search
    to try different combinations of hyperparameters for our ML models. The hyperparameter
    combination that resulted in the best average performance was chosen as the best
    set of hyperparameters for that iteration. After finding the best hyperparameters
    using nested cross-validation, we trained the model on the entire dataset and
    saved it for further model evaluation. We compute the error indexes, including
    the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the coefficient of determination
    (R2), Root mean Square Error (RSME), the normalized root mean squared error by
    variable range (nRMSE), and Willmot’s index of agreement (d) for each iteration
    of the outer loop and then average them for evaluating the model performance.
    We repeat the above-mentioned procedure to select the best unbiased model among
    eight regression models for millet yield prediction. The models that we selected
    with their hyperparameter configurations are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison

    permutation importance analysis Permutation importance is a method for assessing
    the relative significance of features in a ML model by quantifying the change
    in model performance when a particular feature’s values are randomly shuffled
    (Breiman, 2001). The underlying principle is that if a feature is crucial, scrambling
    its values should significantly impact the model’s performance, while shuffling
    an insignificant feature should have minimal or no effect. In some cases, an increase
    in model performance after shuffling a feature’s values may occur, indicating
    that the feature introduces noise to the model, thereby degrading its performance.
    Overall, this technique offers an intuitive way to comprehend the importance of
    each feature in a model by directly examining the consequences of shuffling the
    feature values on the model’s performance. Herein, we employ the Scikit-learn
    library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) to compute permutation importance. Using the
    fitted ML model, we evaluated each feature by randomly shuffling its values and
    then assessing the model’s performance on the shuffled dataset with the same scoring
    function utilized during model training and cross-validation. Subsequently, the
    change in performance is compared to that of the original performance. This process
    was repeated ten times for each feature, and the average performance change was
    calculated and reported as feature importance. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Explanatory analysis: spatiotemporal and physiographical variable analysis 3.1.1.
    Assessing the effect of temporal variability on the relationship between crop
    yield and remote sensing indices using Spearman’s rank correlation The Spearman’s
    Rank correlation coefficients between millet yield and different spatiotemporal
    and physiographical variables for all departments in Senegal are presented in

    image Fig. 3. Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient analysis of millet yield
    and spatiotemporal/physiographical variables across departments in Senegal. 3.1.1.1.
    Planting indices Specific planting indices, namely WDI, SMI, and GDDI, were discovered
    to have a negative impact on millet crop yield due to increased water demands,
    unsuitable vegetation conditions, elevated temperature, and significant soil moisture
    deficits during planting. However, the remaining planting indices exhibited inconsistent
    trends, indicating complex relationships that require further investigation. This
    inconsistency was especially noticeable in 2016 and 2020, which corresponded to
    the rainy planting period as indicated by drought indices. Waterlogging can result
    in yield reduction in some millet species due to disruptions in nutrient uptake
    and gas exchange (Matsuura et al., 2016). 3.1.1.2. Growing indices The association
    between millet crop yield and different growing indices is more intricate and
    diverse than planting indices. Certain indices primarily exhibit a negative correlation
    with crop yield (namely WDI, SMI, and GDDI), whereas others manifest irregular
    patterns, and a few are predominantly positively linked. These findings imply
    that the impact of these indices on crop yield throughout the growing period is
    contingent on specific contextual factors and other pertinent variables. 3.1.1.3.
    Harvesting indices During the harvesting period, there was a lack of a discernible
    p trend in the indices’ correlation. Nonetheless, WDI and SMI exhibited a robust
    negative correlation in the earlier and later years, indicating that increased
    values of these variables could have resulted in reduced yields. This timeframe
    corresponds to the dry harvesting season, as evidenced by the presence of negative
    drought indices. Millet exhibits inherent drought tolerance, and its yield can
    increase with temperature; nonetheless, extreme drought conditions can adversely
    affect its yield (Lee et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2018). Additionally, all drought
    indices (DSI, SMDI, SPI3, and SRI3) displayed a considerable positive correlation
    in 2018 and 2019, implying that elevated values of these variables could have
    contributed to high millet yields. 3.1.1.4. Physiographical indices The correlation
    coefficients between various physiographical indices and millet yield showed fluctuating
    trends from 2016 to 2020 that are harder to explain as the values of these indices
    are constant during the study period. This suggests that it is crucial to account
    for spatiotemporal variations alongside physiographical indices when characterizing
    the anomalies and fluctuations in millet yield. Over the period of three years
    (2018–2020), various indices, such as clay and silt content, soil organic carbon,
    and rainfall erosivity, exhibited predominantly negative correlation coefficients.
    However, there was an exception with sand, which demonstrated a general increasing
    trend between 2016 and 2019, followed by a decrease in 2020. 3.1.1.5. Overall
    summary The study shows that the relationship between indices and millet crop
    yield is complex and varies depending on the stage of crop development. Overall,
    the correlations vary from − 0.56 (Planting SMI) to + 0.40 (Harvesting SRI3).
    However, regardless of the growth stage, all variables describing crop water demands
    (WDI, VI, SMI, and GDDI) are negatively correlated with yield. In contrast, all
    drought indices (DSI, SMDI, SPI3, and SRI3) are positively correlated with millet
    yields indicating no drought conditions. Nonetheless, when examining the temporal
    trends, the results show the occurrence of both wet and dry years during the study
    period. The physiographical parameters are negatively correlated with yield except
    for the sand content. Meanwhile, the temporal element adds more complexity and
    inconsistent trends. Therefore, additional analysis is required to enhance the
    comprehension of these relationships, accounting for other influential factors
    and adopting modeling techniques that accommodate complex and nonlinear relationships.
    3.1.2. Assessing the relationship between crop yield and remote sensing indices
    using Spearman’s rank correlation Stepwise regression through backward elimination
    following a linear mixed effect model showed that VI, GDDI, SPI3, and SRI3 in
    the planting period, VI in the growing period, WDI, VI, SMI, GDDI, SMDI, SPI3,
    and SRI3 in the harvesting period, and rainfall erosivity and soil organic carbon
    unvarying of time had a significant effect on millet yield (Table S4). Below is
    the yield prediction model with the lowest AIC in which 78.6% of the variation
    in the millet yield was explained by the following equation (Eq. 1): (1) ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ
    ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ where, all variables were modeled as predictors, and the
    year and department were modeled as random effects. j and k are department and
    year, respectively; N is a normal or Gaussian distribution, α is a random effect
    representing the effect of the department (j) or year (k) on yield, ꞵ is the model
    coefficient, μ is the mean value of the random effects, and δ2 is unaccounted
    variation, which is the overall variance of the random effects not explained by
    the model. In general, some indices have a positive relationship with planting
    SPI3, growing VI, harvesting WDI, harvesting SRI3, and Rainfall Erosivity. In
    contrast, others have a negative relationship, like planting VI, planting GDDI,
    planting SRI3, harvesting VI, harvesting SMI, harvesting GDDI, harvesting SMDI,
    harvesting SPI3, and SOC. The results of our analysis of variance indicate that
    certain variables have a strong correlation with millet yield. Specifically, during
    the planting period, SPI3 and SRI3, and during the growing period, VI, as well
    as SOC, showed a significant correlation with millet yield at the 0.1% significance
    level. SPI3 values above the median indicate above-average precipitation, while
    high SRI3 values indicate high hydrologic runoff, suggesting the absence of drought
    according to both indices. In addition, we observed that high values of planting
    SPI3 and harvesting SRI3 were associated with higher values of millet yields;
    however, the confidence interval for planting SPI3 (0.43 – 1.33) is wider than
    the confidence interval for growing VI (0.15 – 0.50), demonstrating greater uncertainty
    in the effect of planting SPI3 on millet yield. The planting period is crucial
    for millet as it includes plant emergence and early stages of development when
    adequate moisture is necessary for germination and early growth (Nivedita, 1992).
    The young plants are sensitive to dry spells, and high levels of runoff can cause
    erosion, making them fragile. Our findings align with Fall et al. (2021), who
    reported that very high precipitation could cause crop damage when associated
    with runoff, which explains why high values of SRI could be associated with low
    yield, as very high precipitation may have resulted in high surface runoff which
    could easily erode germinating plants. We also found that VI, derived from NDVI,
    had a strong correlation with millet yield during the growing period (August),
    consistent with Fall et al. (2021) and Panek and Gozdowski (2020), who reported
    the highest correlation between NDVI and cereal yield during the early stages
    of crop development. Our findings indicate a relationship between SOC levels and
    millet yields, with moderate SOC levels being associated with higher millet yields.
    Conversely, elevated SOC levels are correlated with reduced millet yields. This
    observation is in agreement with Oldfield et al. (2019), who reported a decline
    in maize yield when SOC concentrations exceeded 2%. The consistency between these
    studies underscores the potential influence of SOC on crop productivity and the
    importance of optimizing SOC levels for various crop types (Oldfield et al., 2019).
    3.2. Predictive analysis: crop yield estimations 3.2.1. Predictive crop yield
    model selection Table 3 outlines the performance of different machine learning
    models evaluated for predicting millet yield with all available remote sensing
    data employed in this study. The nested cross-validation revealed that linear
    models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic
    Net Regression, had moderate predictive power, with Lasso Regression outperforming
    the others with an R2 score of 0.22. Also, the K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
    algorithm performed poorly, suggesting a potential need for future engineering
    or extensive training with better data in these models. Gradient Boosting and
    Support Vector Machine slightly improved, with R2 scores of 0.14 and 0.17, respectively.
    This improvement hints at the benefits of sequential learning and kernel methods,
    yet their moderate scores indicate that the current hyperparameters or data size
    may not suffice, and further data or broader hyperparameter exploration could
    improve outcomes. On the other hand, the Random Forest model stood out, which
    achieved an average R2 score of 0.25 and an RMSE of 0.59. Known for its robustness
    to data variability and ability to capture nonlinear relationships, we selected
    Random Forest as our preferred model for further analysis based on these performance
    metrics. This is also aligned with previous studies, where the Random Forest Regressor
    model performed its robustness in predicting cotton yield (Prasad et al., 2021),
    wheat yield (Jeong et al., 2016), and soybean yield (Sakamoto, 2020). Table 3.

    3.2.2. Predictive crop yield model implementation and evaluation of its performance
    Table 4 and S5 present the results of the Random Forest Regressor models, which
    were trained using different sets of independent variables. The models’ performance
    was evaluated using several statistical indices, including NSE, R2, d, RMSE, and
    nRMSE. The best model was selected based on the highest NSE, R2, and d values
    and the lowest RMSE and nRMSE values. According to these criteria, the best model
    was identified as the one using all independent variables except Department, Harvesting,
    Total, Growing, Physiographical, and Planting SMI, VI, and GDDI (Fig. 4a). This
    model exhibited the highest NSE (0.831), the lowest RMSE (0.308) and nRMSE (0.077),
    and the highest R2 (0.831) and d (0.942) values. Conversely, the worst-performing
    model used all independent variables except Bias Correction factor and Department
    (Fig. 4b), which had the lowest NSE (0.730), the highest RMSE (0.391) and nRMSE
    (0.098), and the lowest R2 (0.730) and d (0.896) values. The exclusion of certain
    variables, including Department, Harvesting, Total, Growing, Physiographical,
    and some climate-related variables (SMI, VI, and GDDI) during the planting period,
    improved the Random Forest performance model. These variables may have had less
    influence on the response variable, or their exclusion may have reduced multicollinearity
    or noise in the data (Schroeder, 1990; Senaviratna and Cooray, 2019). However,
    these findings are dataset-specific and may not necessarily apply to other crops
    and regions. Table 4. The best-performing Random Forest Regressor models for different

    predicted vs. actual millet yield for (a) the best- and (b) worst-performing Random
    Forest Regressor models. Meanwhile, the relatively lower statistical indices associated
    with the average-performing Random Forest Regressor models (refer to Table S5)
    could suggest the presence of other influential factors, currently unaccounted
    for or unidentified, that significantly impact millet yield predictions. These
    factors may not be entirely observable or quantifiable through the remote sensing
    products employed in this study. 3.2.3. Understanding the key predictors for millet
    crop yield using permutation importance analysis Fig. 5 illustrates the relative
    significance of the independent variables contributing to the optimal performance
    of the Random Forest Regressor model. The prominence of the WDI within the optimal
    model underscores the pivotal role of water availability in crop production, particularly
    during the planting phase. This suggests that any alterations in water accessibility,
    whether instigated by climatic extremes, farming management practices, or other
    elements, could profoundly affect millet yields. Singh and Das (2022) also found
    that WDI affected crop yield significantly (Singh and Das, 2022). However, soil
    fertility variations and pervasive striga infestations contribute to significant
    fluctuations in millet production across Asia and Africa (Singh et al., 2017).
    The Bias Correction factor emerged as the second most influential variable. This
    high ranking infers substantial variability in millet cultivation areas across
    different departments, a factor of paramount importance when production data is
    only available in aggregated forms, such as at departmental or district levels.

    Fig. 5. The relative importance of independent variables in the overall performance
    of the optimal Random Forest Regressor model. The combined contribution of the
    indices related to drought and flood conditions (Planting SMI, Planting SPI3,
    Planting DSI, Planting SRI3, and Planting SMDI) accounts for approximately 49%
    of the variance, thereby signifying the substantial impact of extreme events on
    millet yield. Moreover, incorporating SPI3 and SRI3, representing precipitation
    and runoff data over three months, insinuates that recent climatic conditions
    during the planting phase can significantly influence overall crop yields. This
    is in line with other studies that have used these indices, SPI specifically,
    to monitor or predict yield (Mohammed et al., 2022, Tigkas et al., 2018). This
    underlines the necessity of incorporating temporal dynamics into agricultural
    modeling and planning. Consequently, identifying these crucial periods could aid
    in planning interventions or mitigation strategies to optimize yield. In summary,
    these findings emphasize the intricate nature of agricultural yield predictions,
    which are influenced by a multitude of interconnected environmental factors. They
    further underscore the necessity of maintaining comprehensive, spatially and temporally
    explicit data pertaining to these factors to enhance the precision and applicability
    of these predictive models. 4. Conclusion In this study, a systematic examination
    was conducted employing various spatiotemporal remote sensing data to construct
    a millet crop yield forecast model for Senegal using traditional statistical methods
    and more advanced approaches like machine learning based on five-year aggregated
    data at the departmental level. The key findings and subsequent steps are outlined
    as follows: • During the millet planting period, the availability of water has
    a substantial influence on the total crop yield. Consequently, remote sensing
    parameters that capture these factors, such as WDI, emerged as the highest-ranking
    variable in the predictive crop yield model. • The Bisa Correction factor’s relevance
    was underscored by its position immediately following WDI in terms of its ability
    to account for variabilities in crop yields. The emergence of this new Bisa Correction
    factor is encouraging and warrants additional investigation and validation across
    various regions and crop types. • Extreme weather events explain by different
    Severity Index (e.g., DSI) during the planting stage, capture around 50% of millet
    yield. • This study demonstrates the importance of integrating soil moisture-based
    indicators, considering distinct phases of millet development, considering production
    regions at the departmental level, and applying bias correction factors to enhance
    the accuracy of crop yield forecasts. This research focused on forecasting millet
    yields in Senegal, but subsequent studies could broaden the analysis to encompass
    additional crops and locales. Since various crops respond differently to extreme
    weather conditions, exploring these relationships across a spectrum of crops could
    enhance the creation of diverse crop yield prediction models. Moreover, examining
    various regions that experience distinct climate patterns would shed light on
    how well the study’s results apply to different settings and the overall applicability
    of the findings. Moreover, by incorporating socioeconomic information into crop
    yield forecasting models, we can uncover other factors that influence yield fluctuations
    and provide data-driven recommendations for policymaking to bolster food security.

  description: Groundwater storage and depletion fluctuations in response to groundwater
    availability for irrigation require understanding on a local scale to ensure a
    reliable groundwater supply. However, the coarser spatial resolution and intermittent
    data gaps to estimate the regional groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA) prevent
    the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GARCE-FO)
    mission from being applied at the local scale. To enhance the resolution of GWSA
    measurements using machine learning approaches, numerous recent efforts have been
    made. With a focus on the development of a new algorithm, this study enhanced
    the GWSA resolution estimates to 0.05° by extensively investigating the continuous
    spatiotemporal variations of GWSA based on the regional downscaling approach using
    a regression algorithm known as the geographically weighted regression model (GWR).
    First, the modified seasonal decomposition LOESS method (STL) was used to estimate
    the continuous terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA). Secondly, to separate
    GWSA from TWSA, a water balance equation was used. Third, the continuous GWSA
    was downscaled to 0.05° based on the GWR model. Finally, spatio-temporal properties
    of downscaled GWSA were investigated in the North China Plain (NCP), China's fastest-urbanizing
    area, from 2003 to 2022. The results of the downscaled GWSA were spatially compatible
    with GRACE-derived GWSA. The downscaled GWSA results are validated (R = 0.83)
    using in-situ groundwater level data. The total loss of GWSA in cities of the
    NCP fluctuated between 2003 and 2022, with the largest loss seen in Handan (−15.21
    ± 7.25 mm/yr), Xingtai (−14.98 ± 7.25 mm/yr), and Shijiazhuang (−14.58 ± 7.25
    mm/yr). The irrigated winter-wheat farming strategy is linked to greater groundwater
    depletion in several cities of NCP (e.g., Xingtai, Handan, Anyang, Hebi, Puyang,
    and Xinxiang). The study's high-resolution findings can help with understanding
    local groundwater depletion that takes agricultural water utilization and provide
    quantitative data for water management.

    require understanding on a local scale to ensure a reliable groundwater supply.

    Keywords North China PlainGRACEGWSASTLGWRDownscaling 1. Introduction In many arid
    and semi-arid countries, groundwater provides social and environmental development;
    yet, excessive groundwater extraction, brought on by drought and high-water demand
    for domestic and agricultural use, has turned into a global problem (Famiglietti,
    2014; Richey et al., 2015; Long et al., 2015; Long et al., 2016; Khorrami and
    Gunduz, 2019; Arshad et al., 2020). Due to the GRACE satellite''s advantages,
    the identification of GWSA depletion has been successfully carried out throughout
    the world in the past 18 years (Zhao et al., 2019; Fok and Liu, 2019; He et al.,
    2020; Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021a; Zhang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2022). Compared
    to the suggested worldwide water availability baseline (1700 m3/person/year),
    the North China Plain (NCP) has significantly lower available water resources
    per person (910 m3/year), groundwater has significant importance in the agriculture
    and economy of NCP. The agricultural irrigation needs in NCP rely on groundwater
    more than 40 % (HRWCC, 2003–2020). With the recent rapid urbanization and agricultural
    expansion, issues resulting from excessive groundwater use, such as groundwater
    depletion, deterioration, and surface deformation, have become critical issues
    (Cai, 2008; Gong et al., 2018; Khorrami et al., 2023b; Amiri et al., 2023). For
    the assessment of changing climate and the sustainable usage of water resources,
    a precise understanding of the spatiotemporal aspects of water storage variation
    is essential (Rodell et al., 2007; Tapley et al., 2019). To provide crucial information
    for decision-makers and managers of water resources, groundwater has to be quantified
    and mapped. The lack of gauged stations makes it difficult to manage the dynamic
    changes in groundwater storage using in-situ data. Typically, water-level changes
    in monitoring wells and computed storage coefficients form the basis of in-situ
    assessments of groundwater storage variability. Our capacity to comprehensively
    characterize the regional groundwater fluctuations is hampered by the intrinsic
    constraints of in-situ observations, although they are the only source for verifying
    the auxiliary data (Abhishek and Kinouchi, 2021). Unreliable data formatting across
    mechanical and human monitoring wells, as well as the high expenses of installation
    and maintenance, are additional issues (Chen et al., 2016; Abhishek and Kinouchi,
    2021). Additionally, when converting the groundwater level to groundwater storage
    data, uncertainties associated with specific yield or specific storage arising
    from the aquifer features are inevitable (Bierkens, 2015). The most accurate method
    for calibrating and validating satellite and hydrological models'' data is to
    measure the in-situ water levels, which makes them a potential metric for applications
    such as water security. Particularly in places with limited measurable data, GRACE
    is a reliable tool to track variations in total water storage at large-scale,
    which includes ice, snow, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater with an
    acceptable level of accuracy (Famiglietti, 2014; Ran et al., 2021; Yang et al.,
    2020). GRACE TWSA has offered a supplement to GWSA over large regions. To assess
    the depletion of groundwater conditions in the Mississippi River basin and India,
    Rodell et al., 2007, Rodell et al., 2009 extracted the GWSA variations based on
    GRACE data. GRACE has so far been extensively used for a variety of purposes,
    including groundwater assessment (Feng et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2015; Tangdamrongsub
    et al., 2018), immense flooding event estimation (Han et al., 2021a, Han et al.,
    2021b), reservoir influencing mass transportation (Ran et al., 2019), evapotranspiration
    estimation (Long et al., 2014), and exposure of land subsidence (Wang et al.,
    2017; Tangdamrongsub et al., 2019). The GWSA in the NCP has been the subject of
    other comparable investigations. Huang et al. (2015) found that shallow GWSA was
    declining more at the rate of 45.6 ± 6.8 mm/yr in comparison to deep GWSA (16.9
    ± 3 mm/yr) in the NCP from 2003 to 2013. GRACE data have also been used to access
    a trend of 38 ± 1 mm/yr increase in groundwater depletion between 2013 and 2016
    (Zhao et al., 2019). Vast North China was found to have a GWSA declining trend
    of 16.8 to 27.2 mm/yr (Moiwo et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017).
    Furthermore, Tang et al. (2013) calculated depletion of groundwater ranged from
    14.0 to 8.4 mm/yr in North China from 2003 to 2011 while taking the effects of
    water diversion, reservoir regulation, and coal transport into account. The long-term
    (1971–2015) decreasing trend of GWSA 17.8 ± 0.1 mm/yr in the NCP was computed
    using GRACE and in-situ groundwater data (Gong et al., 2018). After combining
    GRACE mascon outputs from several datasets, Zhao et al. (2019) estimated that
    GWSA is decreasing at the rate of 38.0 ± 1 mm/yr in NCP from 2013 to 2016. Despite
    these outcomes, the application of this method to long-term hydrological changes
    is still constrained by various shortcomings such as missing months and the gap
    between GRACE and GRACE-FO (Sun et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021b;
    Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021b). GRACE was decommissioned in June 2017; nevertheless,
    the GRACE-FO was launched in June 2018 and continues to provide TWSA data that
    is being used in investigations of oceanography, hydrology, and geology (Ciraci
    et al., 2020; Ghobadi et al., 2020). To fill in the data gap, machine learning
    models have been used to reconstruct missing TWSA data. For instance, support
    vector regression, artificial neural networks, and other innovative approaches
    have been applied (Mukherjee and Ramachandran, 2018; Zhang et al., 2021a). Data-driven
    approaches, GRACE solutions, and input variables were compared on a global scale,
    and the results showed that filling in the missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO
    data could offer continuous measurements of Earth''s gravitational field (Li et
    al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Approximately 3° × 3° GRACE Level-2 data were gridded
    to produce the 1° resolution GRACE Level-3 products consisting of 3-spherical
    harmonic and 2-mascon products at a resolution of 0.5° and 0.25° (Watkins et al.,
    2015; Wiese et al., 2016). Since mascon solutions from the University of Texas
    Centre for Space Research (CSR) have been proven to be more accurate (Zheng et
    al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023), we choose to employ them in our analysis. GRACE
    mascon products remain too coarse to assess groundwater depletion at the local
    scale, despite the spatial resolution of Level-3 solutions being improved (Śliwińska
    et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2022a). Improved physical information can be retrieved
    from downscaling GRACE mascon solutions data to a precise spatial resolution for
    local scale application (Vishwakarma et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2021). GRACE observations
    can be downscaled using either a dynamical methodology or a statistical approach.
    The dynamical downscaling, which integrates observations of GRACE and simulated
    estimates of water storage from hydrological models, is also known as data assimilation
    (DA) (Tangdamrongsub et al., 2015). Zhong et al. (2020a) observed that the main
    disadvantage of DA is its high computational cost and reliance on the hydrological
    model''s uncertain boundary conditions. The downscaling of GRACE data using the
    statistical method can be taken as a substitute; the spatial resolution improvement
    of GRACE data is shown in recent studies based on the statistical approach (Milewski
    et al., 2019; Sahour et al., 2020; Vishwakarma et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2021;
    Ali et al., 2022b; Ali et al., 2023). Based on the strong association between
    evapotranspiration and GRACE GWSA over the NCP a downscaling method was developed
    (Yin et al., 2018), successfully improving the resolution to 0.02° from 1°. The
    outcome showed that the downscaling of GWSA estimates to 0.25° from 1° based on
    the random forest model has considerable potential (Chen et al., 2019). To increase
    the resolution of GRACE data to 0.25°, Yin et al. (2022b) used three different
    downscaling models: random forest, Noah V2.1, and multivariable linear regression
    model. The outcomes of the downscaling, however, abruptly changed across adjacent
    pixels (Yin et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2022b; Ali et al., 2021, Ali et al., 2022b,
    Ali et al., 2023). The applicability in local water resource management was constrained
    by the systematic impacts of downscaled data and coarser spatial resolution. Furthermore,
    Zhang et al. (2021b) used the random forest and extreme gradient boosting methods
    to estimate GWSA over China, producing datasets at high resolution (1 km) from
    2003 to 2016. The primary shortcoming of this study, though, is the question of
    whether models for downscaling established at the country level can be applied
    to small regions arbitrarily. The inability of the produced products to catch
    monthly variations, such as flood and drought occurrences, severely restricts
    their use in hydrological research because the temporal resolution of downscaled
    results is annual. Using GRACE data, the aforementioned studies have identified
    the variations in groundwater storage during the past few decades in the NCP.
    However, considering the missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO data, systematic
    groundwater variability detection has not yet been achieved for the downscaling
    of the GRACE data perspective. Therefore, the novelty resides in this study to
    integrate filling in the missing intermittent months (GRACE) and missing gap data
    between GRACE and GRACE-FO using modified STL at first and then regression GWR
    model-based regional downscaling of continuous GWSA data was performed. The strength
    of the GWR model regional-scale downscaling scheme was comprehensively evaluated
    to improve the resolution of GRACE-based GWSA to 0.05° between 2003 and 2022.
    The accuracy of regional downscaled GWSA was assessed using in-situ groundwater
    level data for independent validation. The regional downscaling approach was carried
    out in the NCP, one of the primary bases producing grains in Northern China. 2.
    Study area The NCP, which is the area of interest in this study, is the 140,000
    km2 area north of the Yellow River, south of the Yan Mountains, and east of the
    Taihang Mountains (Fig. 1). Since the 1970s, groundwater has been heavily utilized
    to fulfill water supply for industrial, agricultural, and urban purposes. The
    primary source of groundwater recharge, which accounts for 60 % to 90 % of the
    overall recharge with the majority of it occurring in summer, is precipitation
    infiltration (Liu et al., 2022). More than 80 % of the entire groundwater was
    used for agricultural irrigation in the region, although the average annual precipitation
    in the region is 400–500 mm (Zhang et al., 2019). The NCP has seen the most severe
    groundwater depletion as a result of the seasonal distribution of precipitation
    being irregular and the high-water demand. The NCP, China''s most significant
    agricultural region, provides roughly 61 % and 31 % of the country''s total production
    of maize and wheat, respectively (Cao et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res

    The groundwater levels in the NCP are monitored via a network of 558 unconfined
    wells. To determine the amount of groundwater stored in the unconfined aquifer,
    the detected dynamics are multiplied by the specific yield (Sy) (Fig. 1a). The
    Sy has a range from 0.025 to 0.29 (Gong et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). Based
    on unsteady-flow pumping studies, the uncertainty associated with groundwater
    storage brought on by the range of aquifer geometry and physical hydrogeological
    features, a Sy is estimated to have a 20 % inaccuracy (Huang et al., 2015; Pan
    et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2018). Due to the excessive water demand from industry,
    agriculture, and livestock over many years, the NCP has seen serious groundwater
    depletion (Feng et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2018; Zhao et al.,
    2019). 3. Material and methods 3.1. Input datasets We employed a variety of data

    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and German Aerospace Centre
    (DLR), consists of two satellites that monitor Earth''s gravity properties to
    look into water resources (Rodell et al., 2007; Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021a; Khorrami
    et al., 2023c). An important dynamic component of the hydrologic cycle is the
    terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA). Groundwater, soil moisture, rivers,
    lakes, snowpack, glaciers, and canopy water are all included in the vertically
    accumulated amount of water storage of various elements of the hydrologic cycle
    (Pan et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2023). In this investigation, the GRACE RL06
    Gridded CSR mascon solution with enhanced coastlines at a resolution of 0.25°
    product was used from 2003 to 2022 (Save et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018; Yang
    et al., 2021). The uncertainties associated with CSR mascon solutions were estimated
    to be lower than other mascon products (Zheng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023).
    In our earlier study, the modified STL approach was used to fill in the missing
    data of GRACE and the gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO only at the temporal scale
    (Khorrami et al., 2023a). In this study, the modified STL approach was also used
    to fill in the gaps between GRACE and GRACE-FO measurements and the missing months
    within GRACE at the temporal scale (Fig. S1) and each pixel''s scale level. 3.2.2.
    Water storage components To yield the best estimates of land surface fluxes, the
    GLDAS can benefit from ground-based- and satellite measurements and sophisticated
    land surface modeling (Rodell et al., 2004). The monthly water storage components
    such as soil moisture storage (SMS) and snow water equivalent (SWE) are derived
    from Noah-v2.1 at a 0.25° resolution. To disaggregate GWSA from GRACE-derived
    TWSA estimations, the SMS and SWE were converted to anomaly data similar to the
    GRACE data baseline (2004–2009). The goodness of match that the Noah-v2.1 products
    displayed to GRACE TWSA were superior to the other three models (i.e., CLM, Mosaic,
    and VIC) (Wang et al., 2023). In light of this, the GLDAS Noah-v2.1 model data
    from 2003 to 2022 were applied in this analysis. TWS data was derived from the
    Community Land Surface Model (CLSM) which is simulated GLDAS. Soil water up to
    a depth of 100 cm, snow water equivalent, water in the canopy, and shallow groundwater
    from 5 to 8 m deep in the aquifer all contribute to the CLSM-modeled TWS (Li et
    al., 2019). Note that CLSM TWS does not account for water stored on the surface
    in places like lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. Due to the negligible contribution
    of surface water storage to total water storage in arid NCP (0.28 mm/a during
    2003–2010; Feng et al., 2013), biases in the calculations of GWSA produced by
    such impacts can be ignored. To validate STL-based filled-in missing months of
    GRACE TWSA data, CLSM TWSA was produced by subtracting the long-term baseline
    mean between 2004 and 2009 from the corresponding CLSM TWS data. 3.2.3. Environmental
    forcing variables Environmental factors such as SMS, precipitation (P), actual
    evapotranspiration (ETa), land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) were utilized as independent variables for downscaling
    GRACE data. These auxiliary datasets were selected based on their major contribution
    to GRACE data which was analyzed in a previous study (Yin et al., 2022). Fig.
    S2 displays the analysis of these variables in terms of temporal time series.
    The monthly scale and 0.05° resolution of MOD13C2 Version 6 were used to obtain
    the NDVI data. The MODIS MOD11C3 at a resolution of 0.05° provided the monthly
    LST measurements. The values from the respective monthly files are averaged to
    yield the daytime and nighttime observations that comprise the LST products (Wang
    et al., 2021). The operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) model,
    which is used to calculate monthly MODIS ETa, was received from the USGS FEWS
    NET Data Portal (Senay et al., 2007). From Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
    with Station (CHIRPS), 0.05° resolution gridded precipitation data were obtained.
    3.2.4. Ground-based measurements From January 2005 to December 2018, the Beijing
    Water Resources Bulletin of China published monthly measurements of groundwater
    levels were taken to verify the validation of the downscaled GWSA estimations.
    The datasets are subject to a restricted quality control approach, and a recent
    study (Zhang et al., 2020) has verified their dependability. According to Fig.
    1, the observation wells in the NCP were distributed equally. It is important
    to highlight that during the preprocessing stage, a few wells'' observations with
    unusual jumps and outliers were removed. When calculating the groundwater level
    anomalies (GWLA) for specific bores, the monthly readings were subtracted from
    the long-term mean between 2005 and 2018 to obtain the GWLA. The observed GWSA
    was determined by multiplying the GWLA by the specific yield (Sy). After that,
    the average changes in groundwater storage from 2005 to 2018 were subtracted to
    generate the GWSA of each well monthly. 4. Methods We used four distinct methodologies:
    (1) using the modified STL method, we filled in missing months within GRACE and
    the gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO observations in both space and time before
    estimating the GWSA; (2) estimating the continuous GWSA using the modified STL-based
    imputed TWSA; (3) input the environmental variables and GRACE-derived GWSA data
    into the GWR model; (4) obtaining the intercepts, residuals, and regression coefficients
    from GWR model. The four statistical indicators of root mean square error (RMSE),
    Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and bias were used
    to validate the GWR-predicted GWSA data with GRACE-derived GWSA. Sen''s slope
    trend analysis was used to analyze the temporal variations of the downscaled GWSA
    data, respectively. To calculate the groundwater depletion in the various cities
    of the NCP, we employed the estimated downscaled GWSA fluctuations. 4.1. Gap filling
    of GRACE TWSA based on STL Intermittent missing months in GRACE and a continuous
    gap of 11 months between the GRACE and GRACE-FO prevent improved monitoring of
    water resources (Gong et al., 2018; Ali et al., 2021, Ali et al., 2022b, Ali et
    al., 2023; Yi and Sneeuw, 2021; Yin et al., 2022a, Yin et al., 2022b; Wang et
    al., 2023). Therefore, it is essential to complete the missing months in the data
    to accurately estimate the components of the hydrological cycle before downscaling
    GWSA. So far, different techniques such as Multilinear Regression Models, and
    different AI-based algorithms have been proposed and successfully applied to fill
    in the data gaps of the GRACE/GRACE-FO. However, since the used techniques mainly
    consider climatic variables, their optimal use is an issue of doubt because they
    may not model the exact variations of the GRACE-TWSA which is controlled not only
    by the climatic forces but also by anthropogenic drivers (Jing et al., 2020).
    The STL is a filtering method for decomposing time-series datasets. It is both
    simple and robust at the same time. The STL''s simplicity makes it possible to
    quickly compute and analyze time series data (Cleveland et al., 1990). The STL-based
    approach is a simple technique to fill in the existing gaps of the global TWSA
    values and since it is based on decomposing the TWSA time series into its components,
    it is hypothesized that the reconstructed TWSA values could better represent and
    characterize the real GRACE-observed TWSA characteristics through reflecting both
    the natural and anthropogenic impacts. Between 2003 and 2022, there were 31 missing
    months in total (Fig. S1a). The TWSA data reveals both long-term and seasonal
    patterns. Using these characteristics of TWSA, the modified STL method was applied
    to fill in the gaps in the GRACE and GRACE-FO datasets. The R programming environment
    is used to develop a modified STL model for completing the spatial and temporal
    gaps in the GRACE and GRACE-FO data. Eq. (1) demonstrates how the trend, seasonal,
    and residual components of the data were decomposed by the STL model. (1) where
    , , and at time t are, respectively, the trend, seasonal, and remainder components
    (Cleveland et al., 1990). The average seasonal and residual values along with
    the trend component of that missing month were added to compute the missing month''s
    values after the decomposition of TWSA. The modified STL model can be written
    as Eq. (2): (2) 4.2. Continuous groundwater storage anomaly estimation Snow, glaciers,
    surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater all contribute to the total water
    storage. We ignore the variation in surface water storage because around 40 %
    of the rivers in NCP are perennially dry (Wang et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2018;
    Zhang et al., 2021b). The main reservoirs have an estimated 2.47 billion m3 of
    water, or around 1.7 cm of equivalent thickness, according to statistics from
    the China Water Resources Bulletin (Yin et al., 2022). Water reserves in reservoirs
    can be disregarded in comparison to groundwater storage (Xiong et al., 2022).
    The GWSA is calculated by deducting the SMSA and SWEA from the TWSA on the basis
    that other water storage component''s contributions to the NCP are insignificant
    (Yin et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2021). The
    changes in GWSA in the study area were derived using Eqs. (3), (4). (3) (4) where
    SMSA and SWEA are anomalies of soil moisture storage and snow water equivalent.
    4.3. Geographically weighted regression model Brunsdon et al. (1996) first introduced
    the GWR as a regression model. It has been widely employed in research on the
    scale dynamic relationships between dependent and explanatory factors (Foody,
    2003). The GWR model can be written as: (5) ɛ where , , , and ɛ are, respectively,
    the latitude and longitude of the locations, intercept, slope (regression coefficient),
    residual at the j th point, and p specifies the number of environmental variables.
    According to Fotheringham et al. (2002), the difference between the GRACE-derived
    and GWR model predicted values is residual, the estimation of the local constant
    term is the intercept, and the computation of the local coefficient for each variable
    is slope; yi denotes the i th observation of the dependent variable and Xi,j denotes
    the j th observation of i th independent variable. A fundamental idea of the GWR
    model is that observations nearer to the j th point have a greater influence on
    the local coefficient for the location, which functions as a distance decay based
    on the distances between the j th point and its surrounding points. As shown below,
    the coefficient can be determined as below: (6) where denotes the local coefficient
    to be estimated at the location ; X and Y represent the vectors of the independent
    variables and the dependent variables, respectively; and is the weight matrix
    (Gao et al., 2012). The higher the weight, the closer the j th point is to its
    neighboring points. The weights can be calculated as follows (Lu et al., 2019;
    Arshad et al., 2021; Arshad et al., 2022): (7) where, = estimation of coefficient
    at the i th location using the weight of observation at the j th point. = distance
    (Euclidean) between the i th and j th points. = adaptive bandwidth size determined
    by the k th nearest neighbor distance. The selection criterion (Cross-Validation
    (CV), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
    and small sample bias adjusted AIC (AICc)) and kernel function (fixed bi-square,
    fixed Gaussian, adaptive bi-square, and adaptive Gaussian) are the two most important
    variables in GWR model. weight matrix in Eq. (6) is estimated using the “kernel
    function”. The ‘selection criterion is used to calculate the adaptive bandwidth''s
    size which is represented by the symbol in Eq. (7). In this work, the Adaptive
    Gaussian and Cross-Validation were employed as kernel function and selection criterion.
    As a result of these characteristics, the GWR model can be established with high
    accuracy (Xu et al., 2015). 4.3.1. Regional downscaling technique based on the
    GWR model Previous downscaling studies, such as 0.1° (Shang et al., 2019) and
    0.25° (Chen et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021ab; Xiong et al., 2022), have a target
    resolution that is too coarse to meet the needs of water resources management
    in local areas. Based on the constructed regression model, we substitute 0.05°
    predictors to obtain the GWSA at a higher resolution in this research. To produce
    the GWSA at 0.05° resolution, we enhanced the regional downscaling model with
    extensive environmental variables. The developed GWR model at a coarse resolution
    can be utilized to anticipate high-resolution GWSA using environmental variables
    with high resolution (Xu et al., 2015). Fig. 2 depicts the information about the
    downscaling procedure. The following is a list of the specific steps of the GWSA
    downscaling method based on GWR: Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download

    from 0.25° to 0.05° process flowchart for the NCP region. (1) Data preparation:
    It includes the preparation of GWSA data, environmental variables at 0.25°, and
    environmental variables at 0.05° resolution. The environmental variables include
    P, SMS, NDVI, LST, and ET. (2) GWR model: The GWR model is developed using environmental
    variables and GRACE-derived GWSA at a coarse resolution of 0.25°. The output of
    the GWR model is the intercept, slope (regression coefficients), and regression
    residual. In this work, the GWR model is developed in R programming. (3) Interpolating
    the parameters: The bilinear approach is used to interpolate the intercept, slope
    (regression coefficients), and regression residual from step (2) to generate the
    data at 0.05°. (4) Downscaling: To obtain the model residuals ( ɛ ), the GWR model
    predicted GWSA was subtracted from the GRACE-derived GWSA in step (2). Following
    that, these residuals were bilinearly interpolated to a 0.05° resolution. Using
    high-resolution environmental variables, slope (regression coefficients), and
    regression residuals at 0.05° resolution, downscaled GWSA (0.05°) were derived
    using Eq. (5). (5) The random forest (RF) model''s variable importance (VIMP)
    test was used to determine the parameters and significance of various environmental
    variables in the study area (Rahaman et al., 2019; Ali et al., 2021; Ali et al.,
    2022b). VIMP values near 0 show a variable''s minimal influence, while higher
    values show a variable''s larger significance in explaining variations in water
    storage. 4.4. Uncertainty analysis The input variables to the GWR model (NDVI,
    LST, ET, P, and SMS) are related to uncertainty in the downscaled GWSA. By multiplying
    each input variable''s coefficient value (β) by the sample standard error derived
    from the standard deviation (σ) (Duan and Li, 2016), the uncertainty related to
    each input variable was calculated. Utilizing the propagation of errors by linearization
    method (Faber, 2002; Duan and Li, 2016; Seyoum et al., 2019), the overall uncertainty
    associated with GWR-based downscaled GWSA ( ) was calculated as follows: (8) The
    GWR model-based coefficient value (β) was calculated using (Eq. (6)). 4.5. Statistical
    measurements Over the period 2003–2022, the monthly GWSA estimations derived from
    GRACE are compared with GWR-based predicted GWSA. The accuracy of the predicted
    GWSA estimates is evaluated using correlation coefficient (CC), bias (B), Nash
    Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are the four statistical
    measures chosen for validation (Ali et al., 2021, Ali et al., 2022b, Ali et al.,
    2023; Khorrami et al., 2023a). The perfect value of CC and NSE ranges from 0 to
    1. With a perfect value of 0, B indicates how much predicted GWSA estimates are
    exaggerated (positive) or underestimated (negative). The term “RMSE” refers to
    the size of error estimates; the lower the RMSE, the more accurate the predicted
    GWSA estimates are in comparison to GRACE-derived GWSA. The formulas are as follows:
    (9) (10) (11) (12) where o and y show GRACE-derived and GWR-based GWSA, the length
    of the time series is n, and are the mean values of y and o. 4.6. Sen''s slope
    estimator Sen (1968) developed the Sen''s slope estimator method as a non-parametric
    test to approximate the trend slope. In numerous studies (Yue and Hashino, 2003;
    Gocic and Trajkovic, 2013; Mohsin and Lone, 2021) it has been extensively used
    for trend analysis of a range of hydrometeorological variables. The Sen''s Slope
    estimator performs the following phases in its computation process: (13) where,
    and represent the data values at times j and k (j > k) respectively (Gocic and
    Trajkovic, 2013). The Sen''s slope is calculated as the median of the slope: (14)
    The calculated controls the reflection and the gradient of the current trend through
    its value and sign (Gocic and Trajkovic, 2013). The magnitude of the trend is
    estimated using Sen''s slope method. 5. Results 5.1. Reconstruction of GRACE TWSA
    Together, the TWSA data for GRACE and GRACE-FO have 31 missing months. The decomposition
    components of the GRACE TWSA dataset for the NCP basin are shown in Fig. S3. Several
    methods have been put forth for reconstructing the GRACE TWSA values. Seasonality
    is a common feature of the global TWSA changes, and the seasonal changes of the
    GRACE-observed TWSA were utilized to fill in the missing observations based on
    the modified STL method which were then verified by the values obtained in the
    CLSM dataset. The CLSM is currently the only global model that generates hydrological
    fluxes using the GRACE estimates as part of its advanced data assimilation process
    (Khorrami et al., 2023a, Khorrami et al., 2023b, Khorrami et al., 2023c). In comparison
    to other methods, the primary advantage of the novel approach to filling in missing
    observations based on the modified STL technique is its capacity to more simply
    and conveniently provide correct estimates of the GRACE missing TWSA observation.
    The missing months of the GRACE TWSA were filled in at a temporal (Fig. 3a) and
    spatial scale for each pixel (Fig. 3b) which led to better estimations of hydrological
    components. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. (a) modified STL-based filled-in temporal time series and (b) modified
    STL-based gap-filling between GRACE and GRACE-FO at the pixels level. As a result,
    better estimates of the hydrological components were produced based on spatiotemporally
    downscaled and gap-less TWSA values (Kumar et al., 2016). As a result, the TWSA
    findings from the STL technique were compared to the TWSA over the NCP derived
    from the CLSM. Fig. 3a shows the TWSA time series of the suggested method along
    with the missing values obtained from the GRACE-derived, CLSM-derived, and STL-derived
    values. The STL-based and CLSM-derived TWSA have a 0.93 correlation. The findings
    show that the employed STL approach can successfully reconstruct the GRACE mission''s
    missing TWSA values. As indicated in Fig. 3a, the TWSA time series show a remarkable
    decreasing trend for the whole NCP at the rate of 13.30 ± 8.20 mm/yr, 14.75 +
    7.67 mm/yr, and 13.33 + 4.85 mm/yr with missing months, without missing months,
    and CLSM. Similar results were found in previous studies that GRACE-derived TWSA
    was observed to be declining with a trend of 11 mm/yr from August 2002 to August
    2010 (Su et al., 2011), 12.4–15 mm/yr from 2003 to 2011 (Tang et al., 2013), 16.8
    mm/yr from 2003 to 2009 (Moiwo et al., 2013), 12.9 mm/yr from April 2002 to March
    2016 (Rodell et al., 2018), and 17.95 mm/yr from 2003 to 2017 (Xu et al., 2021).
    5.2. Temporal variations characteristics of TWSA and gap-filling effect In comparison
    to the other GRACE solutions, the mascon solutions often exhibit significantly
    smaller amplitude variations (i.e., maximum and minimum TWSA) (Xiong et al., 2022;
    Yin et al., 2022a). It can be observed from Fig. 4 that TWSA sharply increases
    at a rate of 3.00 mm/yr from 2003 to 2004 with a maximum storage of TWSA (134.42
    mm/month in August 2004), however, due to extensive groundwater extraction, TWSA
    abruptly declined with a rate of 6.79 mm/yr from 2005 to 2009 with depletion value
    of TWSA 110.95 mm/month in October 2009); however, a notable recharge between
    2010 and 2013 was observed and TWSA values reached to 27.86 mm/month (August 2012)
    as a result of an increase in precipitation. TWSA was observed to stabilize during
    2010–2013 with a moderate declining trend of 1.79 mm/yr (Huang et al., 2015).
    The TWSA was subsequently depleted between 2014 and 2015 because of severe drought
    (Zhao et al., 2019) with a maximum depletion of TWSA ( 277.25 mm/month). From
    2016 to 2018, the stabilizing TWSA was detected with a general declining trend
    of 0.92 mm/month after the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) implementation
    along with precipitation. Thereafter, there was a further decline until mid of
    year 2021, after which there was another sharp recharge observed of TWSA with
    an increasing trend of 0.98 mm/yr due to an increase in precipitation up to the
    year 2022 (Fig. 4). Moreover, the modified STL approach successfully filled in
    the missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO TWSA values (Fig. 3a). It can be observed
    (Fig. 4) that TWSA is decreasing during this missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO
    following the trends of effective precipitation and anomalies of SMS and SWE.

    Fig. 4. Time series of TWSA, GWSA, water storage anomalies, and precipitation
    from 2003 to 2022 in the NCP region. The red dotted box shows fill-in missing
    gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO using the modified STL method. Additionally, to
    calculate the GWSA, the SMSA and SWEA contributions were subtracted from TWSA
    (Fig. 4) because SMSA and SWEA are the major factors influencing TWSA in the NCP
    (Yin et al., 2022a; Yin et al., 2022b). Similar to TWSA, the GWSA (Fig. 4) showed
    a sharp decrease and subsequent increase, indicating a significant loss of groundwater
    in the region. While there are some changes in amplitude, the temporal distribution
    of GWSA trends and TWSA trends with CC up to 0.88 is similar. It suggests that
    GWSA is mostly responsible for the inter-annual trends in TWSA, which is consistent
    with findings from earlier studies (Rodell et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2020; Xu
    et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022). The main cause of this phenomenon is that climate
    change and intensive irrigation for agriculture place a significant amount of
    pressure on water supplies (Yin et al., 2022). Due to the lower requirement for
    irrigation in fall and winter, groundwater is primarily extracted for agricultural
    use in late spring and summer while remaining in aquifers until the next spring
    (Liu et al., 2022). For instance, from 2003 to 2012, Hebei province was found
    to have the highest annual average use of groundwater within the NCP at 15.64
    km3, followed by Henan province (2.54 km3) (WRPB, 2012). A following decreasing
    GWSA, however, was discovered from 2018 to the middle of 2021, which may have
    been brought on by a rise in groundwater depletion and a decline in precipitation.
    For instance, the year 2019 had the lowest annual precipitation of the previous
    years, at 532 mm (11.5 % decline from the long-term mean of 601 mm). This might
    reduce the net recharging of the aquifer and increase groundwater pumping due
    to the limited surface water availability. Precipitation, GRACE, and GLDAS (SMSA
    and SWEA) data for the period 2003–2022 generally show apparent stability and
    seasonal variation. Through complex hydrological processes such as surface runoff,
    evapotranspiration, and infiltration, precipitation must be redistributed before
    transforming into terrestrial water storage. As a result, there were periods in
    which the variations in precipitation and GRACE were not very consistent. According
    to Hocking and Kelly (2016) and Rossman et al. (2014), there is a lag in groundwater
    recharging. According to Liu et al. (2022), who examined changes in GWSA with
    precipitation 1–3 months lag, GWSA recharging in the NCP is more significantly
    influenced by and responds to precipitations more quickly. It is worth noting
    that the maximum monthly average precipitation of 235.03 mm, 261.65 mm, 243.75
    mm, 296.82 mm, 350.73 mm, and 230.72 mm occurred in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2021,
    and 2022 with average GRACE monthly values (−72.36 mm, −105 mm, −51.90 mm, −213.54
    mm, −268.25 mm, and − 76.64 mm) in these years. The comparison results of GRACE,
    GLDAS (SMSA and SWEA), and precipitation data showed that they presented regular
    seasonal fluctuations with consistencies. Rapid population growth and the expansion
    of irrigated agriculture have increased the pressure on the sustainability of
    groundwater storage. Overuse of groundwater is anticipated to increase when local
    surface water supplies become inadequate to meet rising demand. The rising water
    demand will inevitably have an impact on groundwater overexploitation in the region.
    Koch et al. (2020) estimated average annual net irrigation of 126 mm/yr (15.2
    km3/yr) for NCP and annual winter wheat classifications reveal an increasing crop
    area with a trend of 2200 km2/yr. the NCP confronts significant issues in the
    management of water supplies, especially groundwater reserves, due to its status
    as a vital producing and living area in China. 5.3. Downscaling of continuous
    GWSA To predict the GWSA, all spatial independent and dependent variables at a
    coarse resolution of 0.25° were incorporated into the GWR model. The GWR model
    predicted GWSA was compared to GRACE-derived GWSA. To assess the spatial distribution
    differences between GRACE-derived and GWR-based GWSA maps are compared for March
    2020. The particular month was chosen to observe the fluctuations in GWSA and
    because of the significant GWSA depletion in that month. The model-based approach
    under- and over-estimated the GWSA with biases of 1.60 % and 2.50 %, respectively,
    while CC ranged between 0.93 and 0.96, according to a statistical analysis of
    GWR model predicted and GRACE-derived GWSA (Fig. S4) from 2003 to 2022. The spatial
    distribution of the GWR model predicted GWSA substantially resembles the GRACE-derived
    GWSA, with small under/overestimations according to pixel-wise evaluation (Fig.
    5b). With local R2 values ranging from 0.63 to 0.85, the GWR model performed effectively
    on the majority of pixels (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5d displays the residuals map, which
    represents the amount of GWSA that the model is unable to account for and is noisy
    in terms of under- and over-estimation in model prediction. When comparing the
    model-based GWSA (Fig. 5b) to the GRACE-derived GWSA (Fig. 5a), the largest under-
    and overestimations reported were 95 mm/month and 181 mm/month (Fig. 5d). To get
    the high-resolution GWSA estimates, intercept and regression coefficients at a
    resolution of 0.25° from the GWR model output were further interpolated to 0.05°
    using the bilinear interpolation method in R programming. Eq. (5) was applied
    to the interpolated intercept and regression coefficients along with environmental
    variables to estimate the GWSA at 0.05° (Fig. 5e). Residual corrections minimize
    the bias, or over- or under-estimation, in the results of downscaling. The GWR
    model interpolated regression residuals and estimated GWSA at a resolution of
    0.05° are combined to perform residuals correction to compute GWR model-based
    downscaled GWSA at a resolution of 0.05° (Fig. 5f). The GWR model generated good
    results with high local R2 values and minimum residuals given the current arrangement
    of environmental variables, demonstrating its ability to forecast high-resolution
    GWSA in the research area. Because downscaled and GRACE-derived GWSA show similar
    spatial patterns, the spatial pattern is conserved while the downscaling approach
    improves spatial information of GRACE data at coarse resolution. Download : Download

    correction at 0.05°. To produce high-resolution (0.05°) GWSA data for the NCP,
    GWR performance is examined for various months between 2003 and 2022. Fig. S5
    contrasts the spatial distribution of monthly GWSA estimations derived from GWR-based
    downscaled and GRACE-derived for multiple selected months from 2003 to 2022. When
    compared to GRACE-derived estimations, it was found that downscaled GWSA estimates
    showed very similar spatial patterns of GWSA values. This showed that the downscaling
    method using the most recent high-resolution explanatory factors not only translated
    GWSA with improved information but also preserved the spatial pattern of GWSA.
    The downscaled GWSA using the GWR model has some uncertainty due to several sources
    of errors (such as input variables). Downscaled GWSA had an overall uncertainty
    of 14.39 mm, with particular uncertainties of 4.28 mm for SMS, 2.57 mm for rainfall,
    1.62 mm for ETa, 0.50 mm for LST, and 3.16 for NDVI respectively. The capability
    of the model to estimate high-resolution GWSA changes is greatly influenced by
    the environmental variables that determine trending fluctuations in water storage
    variations (Ali et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2022b; Ali et al., 2023). The VIMP test
    revealed that the complex hydroclimatic and topographical aspects of the research
    region affected the geographical variation in the relevance of environmental variables
    (Fig. S6). For instance, it was discovered that NDVI, with a VIMP value of 49.80
    %, was more significant in model prediction than precipitation (20.30 %) and SMS
    (20.00 %). To better show the features of the downscaled results, we compared
    the GWSA produced at 0.25° grid with one at 0.05° spatial resolution. The downscaled
    GWSA was consistent with the GRACE-derived 0.25° grid. Fig. 6 displays the geographical
    variations in March 2007 GWSA fluctuations between GRACE-derived and GWR-downscaled
    values. High-resolution GWSA measurements along the transects reveal the GWSA''s
    spatial fluctuations, which are hidden in the coarse resolution of GRACE data.
    Each of the three transects (P1-P2, P3-P4, and P5-P6) covers 6, 4, and 2 pixels
    of the GRACE-derived GWSA data (Fig. 6a) and 30, 20, and 10 pixels of the downscaled
    GWSA data (Fig. 6b). High-resolution GWSA data is especially helpful for small
    regions where it is difficult to detect spatial distribution fluctuations. The
    downscaled data, for instance, reveal a large regional spatial variability in
    the GWSA fluctuations (56.51 to 84.68 mm EWH) in transect P1-P2 (Fig. 6d), whereas
    the GRACE-derived GWSA is represented by homogenized pixels (Fig. 6c). This means
    that the downscaling results are consistent with the GRACE-derived values and
    also display finer regional heterogeneity. Download : Download high-res image

    and (c, d) shows temporal variations of GWSA at a resolution of 0.25° and 0.05°
    in different transects. The comparison of monthly GWR model-based downscaled and
    GRACE-derived GWSA variations over the NCP is shown in Fig. 7a. Similar variations
    in amplitudes may be seen in the time series of the coarse GRACE-derived and downscaled
    GWSA data, and both time series are consistent pre- and post-downscaling (Fig.
    7a), demonstrating the suitability of the regional downscaling technique to estimate
    GWSA changes at a high resolution. Between 2003 and 2022, the downscaled GWSA
    in the NCP generally decreased by 17.51 ± 7.25 mm/yr, and the GRACE-derived GWSA
    decreased by 17.55 ± 7.19 mm/yr (Fig. 7a). Other studies using GRACE observations
    have also noted GWSA decline over a variety of periods, ranging from 16.6 to 19.1
    mm/year from 2003 to 2020 (Liu et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2022; Gong et al.,
    2018; Zhang et al., 2021a, Zhang et al., 2021b). Download : Download high-res

    of colors show sub-periods (I) increasing, (II) decreasing, (III) stabilizing,
    (IV) sharp decreasing, and (V) increasing trends of GWSA and (b) spatial distribution
    of GWSA in different sub-periods. Since GWSA fluctuations during the whole study
    period (2003–2022) were not consistent, the study duration was split into five
    distinct sub-periods (January 2003 to April 2007 (I), May 2007 to December 2014
    (II), January 2015 to December 2018 (III), January 2019 to May 2021 (IV), and
    June 2021 to December 2022 (V)) to explore variations of the GWSA in more detail.
    The sub-periods are shown in different colors in Fig. 7a. The GWSA was increasing
    at the rate of 2.98 mm/yr in sub-period I, a decreasing trend of 8.45 mm/yr was
    observed in sub-period II, followed by 3.90 mm/yr in sub-period III and 3.97 mm/yr
    in sub-period IV. Among them, the rate of GWSA is recovered in sub-period V with
    a rate of 3.08 mm/yr. Despite the initial recovery in groundwater levels following
    the initiation of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) from 2015
    to 2018, further investigations have revealed negative trends in GWSA throughout
    period III. This can be attributed to the significant and persistent depletion
    of deep groundwater resources, exacerbated by inadequate precipitation, as documented
    by Li et al., 2021a, Li et al., 2021b and Xiong et al. (2022). According to a
    subsequent study (Guo et al., 2022), which similarly shows substantial growth
    in the deep groundwater funnel area from 2014 to 2020, similar behavior has been
    seen. The implementation of the SNWDP in 2014 enabled a shift from the previous
    water utilization approach to a conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater.
    However, the declining groundwater storage during period III indicates an increased
    water demand in arid conditions that cannot be adequately met solely through surface
    water sources such as diverted water and precipitation. Furthermore, it should
    be noted that the process of recovering from overexploitation, as observed in
    previous decades (Chen et al., 2005), is a gradual one. This is particularly evident
    when considering the increased extraction of groundwater and the subsequent decrease
    in net recharge due to the effects of a dry climate, as exemplified by the years
    2019 and 2020. The spatial distribution of GWSA was also analyzed during different
    sub-periods between 2003 and 2022. In sub-period I, surpluses were observed overall
    in the NCP. Minor deficits were starting to be experienced in the southwest region
    of NCP (sub-period I). However, sub-periods (III and IV) showed serious losses
    in GWSA over the cities to the southwest region of NCP. The GWSA losses were reduced
    through recharging by precipitation impact observed in sub-period V (Fig. 7b).
    Additionally, there have been observed small upward trends in GWSA around Beijing
    and Tianjin, the primary cities that receive diverted water from the SNWDP. Feng
    et al. (2013) observed a spatial pattern in groundwater depletion rates across
    three regions in China, namely Hebei province, Tianjin, and Beijing, during the
    period from 2003 to 2010. The depletion of groundwater was most pronounced in
    Hebei province, followed by Tianjin and Beijing. A comparable spatial trend was
    also identified throughout the period from 2003 to 2015, as reported by Gong et
    al. (2018). The regional distribution of our downscaled GWSA exhibited a comparable
    pattern over the NCP from 2004 to 2014. From 2015 to 2020, the GWSA observed a
    spatial divergence at the subregional level, indicating the presence of groundwater
    recovery in the vicinity of Beijing and Tianjin. Additionally, the regions along
    the SNWDP route exhibited a less pronounced depletion compared to previous periods.
    These findings align with the in-situ results reported by Zhang et al. (2021a).
    The annual spatial distribution of GWSA also depicted that GWSA is declining from
    2003 to 2022. However, a significant recovery of GWSA was observed in the year
    2022 in comparison to the year 2021 due to the huge precipitation that occurred
    in 2021 and 2022. But the groundwater depletion is more pronounced in southwest
    regions (such as Xingtai, Handan, Anyang, Hebi, Puyang, and Xinxiang) (Fig. 8).
    Concerning the effects of evapotranspiration (ET) variations, it is important
    to acknowledge that the combination of elevated temperatures and abundant precipitation
    results in the highest estimated ET values during July (Fig. S2). Regarding the
    ET throughout August to October, as depicted in Fig. S2, it is observed that over
    75 % of the overall precipitation takes place within these months. Additionally,
    it is worth noting that the groundwater, which is partially replenished by surface
    water, is utilized for irrigation purposes in preceding months. This utilization
    of groundwater for irrigation may potentially lead to a reduction in natural ET.
    The potential impact of reservoir regulation on both run-off control (Xu et al.,
    2013) and changes in TWSA (Melo et al., 2016) should also be considered, since
    it may influence the outcomes. High aquifer pumping for human consumption and
    agriculture water supply is related to this development, where GWSA is the primary
    component of the TWSA. The drought characteristics of the research region and
    the considerable human footprints in the already vulnerable areas are also related
    to the regional spatial heterogeneity in GWSA variations (Xiong et al., 2022;
    Yin et al., 2022a; Yin et al., 2022b). Download : Download high-res image (411KB)

    of downscaled GWSA in NCP from 2003 to 2022. The SNWDP construction considerably
    enhanced the water supply and security in the water-scarce areas along its path.
    Although there are obvious amplitude fluctuations within Tianjin and Hebei Province
    from 2015 to 2019 (Fig. 8), the spatial distribution reveals a steady GWSA decline
    from south to north. After 2015, the amplitude of the GWSA sequence significantly
    increased, yet it continued to exhibit a negative trend (Fig. 8). This suggests
    that groundwater over-extraction is turning into a more significant issue as a
    result of the increased demand for groundwater from industries and agriculture
    following the SNWDP. In the NCP, the regional distribution of GWSA is most noticeable,
    the amplitude of GWSA is substantially larger and these problems lasted until
    mid-2021. There was an obvious GWSA recovery observed from mid-2021 until 2022.
    In conclusion, the SNWDP does help GWSA mitigate a drought over the NCP. Data
    from 558 groundwater level observations and corresponding downscaled pixel values
    in the research area were averaged at the regional scale (Fig. S7) and were used
    to validate downscaled GWSA anomalies. Fig. 9, for instance, displays the mean
    monthly time series of the observed and downscaled GWSA. Downscaled GWSA exhibits
    a strong association with in-situ GWSA measurements from 2005 to 2018 when compared
    to observational data (R = 0.83), with decreasing rates of 15.22 ± 6.64 mm/yr
    and 13.36 ± 8.36 mm/yr, respectively. Nevertheless, according to the estimates
    derived from well data, the GWSA exhibited a positive trend of +1.88 mm/yr. In
    contrast, the estimates obtained by GRACE-based downscaled analysis suggested
    a decrease of −3.94 mm/yr. However, a period of recovery was observed between
    2016 and 2018, which can be attributed to the implementation of the SNWDP in conjunction
    with an increase in precipitation. The discrepancies in trend values can be attributed
    to the relatively low seasonal amplitude of GRACE-based downscaled GWSA compared
    to well observations. This discrepancy is primarily caused by two factors: (1)
    contamination of sub-regional GRACE data by signal leakage and amplitude-damping
    effects, as discussed by Feng et al. (2013) and Huang et al. (2015); and (2) the
    utilization of an overestimated specific yield when converting groundwater levels
    to GWS. Download : Download high-res image (385KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Temporal validation of downscaled GWSA at pixel scale from 2005
    to 2018. Given the evidence that GRACE-based downscaled GWSA is indicative of
    groundwater depletion caused by climate factors, the differences observed between
    GRACE-based downscaled results and in situ measurements could potentially be attributed
    to the complex groundwater processes associated with prolonged groundwater extraction
    (Thomas and Famiglietti, 2019; Scanlon et al., 2021). The GRACE-based downscaled
    approach involves the subtraction of non-GWSA TWSA components of the NOAH model
    from TWSA. It is important to note that the uncertainty inherent in NOAH simulations,
    such as soil moisture, can affect the estimation of GWSA. This influence is particularly
    significant during extreme events, such as the drought experienced from 2014 to
    2015. In addition, it should be noted that the NOAH model''s soil moisture depth
    is limited, which might potentially lead to an inadequate representation of the
    unsaturated zone''s impact on GRACE-based downscaled data. This limitation becomes
    apparent when comparing it to groundwater-level measurements since the recharge
    water must infiltrate beyond the root zone to be accurately reflected. In contrast
    to in-situ measurements that solely assess shallow unconfined aquifers, the GRACE-based
    downscaled approach includes variations in groundwater levels within deep confined
    aquifers. This inclusion may amplify differences, particularly in cases where
    significant extraction of deep groundwater occurs. In light of the aforementioned
    data limitations associated with the GRACE mission, it is worth noting that the
    differences observed between GRACE-based downscaled and in-situ findings could
    potentially be attributed to the very large spatial scale (i.e., 150,000 km2)
    at which raw GRACE observations are conducted. The fluctuations in specific yield
    (as depicted in Fig. 1) of the aquifer, along with its inherent uncertainty and
    regional heterogeneity, may potentially account for the observed discrepancies.
    5.4. Estimation of GWSA variations over the local scale In different regions of
    the NCP from 2003 to 2022, Fig. 10 displays the averaged (2003–2022) annual spatial
    distribution of downscaled GWSA variations and temporal variations. Fig. 10 shows
    how downscaling enhanced the assessment of GWSA variations within each region
    of NCP. When compared to GRACE-derived GWSA at coarse resolution, the spatial
    fluctuation captured in the high-resolution GWSA data (Fig. 10) seems to be homogeneous
    in coarse resolution (Fig. S8). For example, in Xingtai, Handan, Anyang, Hebi,
    Jiaozuo, Xinxiang, and Puyang, downscaled GWSA observed strong spatial heterogeneity
    and temporal variations at a higher decline with primarily intensive winter-wheat
    and summer-maize cropping system and increasing agricultural land use area in
    recent years (Zhang et al., 2019; Koch et al., 2020). For instance, GRACE-derived
    GWSA shows homogenized spatial distribution at pixel scale over the Xingtai and
    Handan regions (Fig. S8), while spatially distributed GWSA variations are observed
    by downscaled GWSA within these regions (Fig. 10). GWSA variations were previously
    investigated using GRACE data also agreed that more GWSA depleted in southwest
    regions of NCP (Gong et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2022a, Yin et al., 2022b; Liu et
    al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021; Agarwal et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2022). The GWSA
    estimations derived from the downscaled GRACE data offer a good level of precision
    to comprehend fluctuations at the local scale level. To understand fluctuations
    at the local scale level, downscaled GWSA estimations derived from the GWR model
    were utilized. Although the GWSA decreased overall between 2003 and 2022, hotspots
    of groundwater storage depletion are particularly obvious in the Xingtai and Handan
    regions. Comparing the southern areas to those in the upper areas, the GWSA drop
    is greater in the southern regions (Fig. 10). This is most likely due to the bigger
    consumptive fraction of irrigation withdrawal and the higher proportion of irrigation
    demand in the southern areas, which is mostly supplied by groundwater (Gong et
    al., 2018; Agarwal et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res

    in different regions of NCP The NCP uses 30 % of the nation''s groundwater since
    it is China''s political, economic, and agricultural center. The NCP''s topographical
    features result in minimal surface water reserves and a predominance of groundwater
    for its freshwater resources. Groundwater accounts for more than 79 % of the water
    supply sources in Hebei Province and provides almost 60 % of the freshwater resources
    in Beijing and Henan Province. Groundwater reserves in the NCP have seen extensive
    exploitation recently as a result of the growth of industry and agriculture. Some
    areas experience groundwater depletion as a result of insufficient groundwater
    supplies. The NCP region''s stability and economic growth are significantly hampered
    by this problem. Monitoring the NCP''s unique groundwater changes is therefore
    required. Scholars have also conducted a considerable deal of research over the
    past two decades, which has greatly advanced knowledge (Huang et al., 2015; Moiwo
    et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021a, Li et al., 2021b). This section

    and small GWSA variations were observed in the northeast regions. Fig. S9 compares
    the temporal variations of in situ and downscaled GWSA from 2005 to 2018 in different
    cities of NCP. The highest CC was found in Anyang (0.91), Shijiazhuang (0.83),
    and Xingtai (0.74) with long-term trend values of 15.12 mm/yr, 15.61 mm/yr, and
    11.44 mm/yr for in situ GWSA and 13.89 mm/yr, 13.61 mm/yr, and 14.17 mm/yr for
    downscaled GWSA. The downscaled GWSA data indicated similar temporal patterns
    of in situ GWSA. Table S1 represents the long-term trend values in different cities
    of NCP. The largest negative anomaly, up to 15.21 mm/yr, was recorded in Handan
    (Fig. 11). Tangshan has the lowest negative anomaly (Fig. 11, up to 9.08 mm/yr).
    According to Malekinezhad and Banadkooki (2018), this is the outcome of a combination
    of precipitation, evapotranspiration, hydrogeological conditions, and human activity.
    5.6. Limitations and future directions The limitations of our study, which can
    be overcome by subsequent research to further enhance the ability to identify
    groundwater depletion hotspots, should be taken into account while evaluating
    the contributions of our study. First, the trend, seasonal, and remaining components
    of the modified STL model are employed to fill in the missing data in GRACE and
    between GRACE and GRACE-FO. Although this method takes advantage of seasonal fluctuations
    in GRACE data, other machine learning methods can be adopted to derive TWSA data
    and compare it to modified STL model-based continuous TWSA data. Second, the GRACE
    Level-3 CSR-Mascon solutions were only downscaled. By downscaling additional Spherical
    Harmonic and Mascon products, which are available at 1° and 0.50°, the hotspots
    of groundwater depletion analysis can be expanded to examine the consistency.
    Third, a thorough validation process is complicated by the few groundwater level
    observations that have been made across the entire NCP. The anticipated groundwater
    depletion, however, is consistent with estimations made using the observational
    groundwater level data that is currently available. Finally, a thorough examination
    of the effects of cropping systems on the depletion of groundwater storage may
    be carried out in the NCP. 6. Conclusions The coarse resolution of GRACE measurements
    has made it extremely difficult to understand how water resources are changing
    dynamically at the local scale. There have been numerous attempts made to downscale
    GRACE observations using machine learning methods. Prior to downscaling GRACE
    data, however, there hasn''t been much research done to fill in the gaps in GRACE
    and between GRACE and GRACE-FO. Therefore, the modified STL model is initially
    used to generate continuous GRACE TWSA data before GRACE-derived GWSA downscaling.
    The modified STL-based continuous GRACE-derived GWSA along with environmental
    variables input to the GWR model to develop a unique regression regional downscaling
    model, which successfully improved the spatial resolution of GWSA to 0.05°. In
    general, a regional downscaling approach can identify spatial heterogeneity at
    a local scale while keeping the original GRACE-derived GWSA features. Based on
    the regional downscaling results, regions with maximum groundwater depletion can
    be located which seems to be uniform at the coarse resolution of GWSA. For instance,
    Handan ( 15.21 mm/yr), Xingtai ( 14.98 mm/yr), and Shijiazhuang ( 14.58 mm/yr)
    are the most depleted regions in the southwestern NCP. The validation results
    of selected pixels of downscaled GWSA against in-situ groundwater level measurements
    show a correlation of 0.83. In general, the downscaling scheme developed in this
    work suggests increased temporal coherence in addition to improved geographical
    variability. Higher resolution products may help with understanding the dynamics
    of local water resources and may offer quantitative data that is helpful for water
    management when taking regional agricultural water use into account. CRediT authorship

  description: Rapidly inverting soil salinity is crucial to the soil water and salt
    migration for the prevention of the secondary salinization. However, the accuracy
    and efficiency of soil salinity inversion models are hindered to the coupling
    relationship between water and salt in soil, particularly for time-consuming and
    labor-intensive soil collection. This study aims to reduce the interference of
    soil moisture for obtaining better sample diversity and further improving the
    robustness of soil salinitu inversion models by using spectral technology. A total
    of 113 normal and 115 saline soil samples were collected in the Xinjiang cotton
    fields. These samples were further subjected to different levels of wetting treatment.
    and subsequently 467 soil samples with varing salt and moisture contents were
    obtained. Soil salt content was calibrated using the conductivity of soil leaching
    solution. Spectral data of samples was captured using an ASD ground object spectrometer
    (400-1000 nm) and a near-infrared spectrometer (960-1693 nm). The soil moisture
    was also corrected using the external parameter orthogonalization (EPO). Additionally,
    deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) with different transposed
    convolution stride strategies were designed to evaluate the sample set using Fréchet
    Inception Distance (FID) scores. Machine learning models were employed to invert
    the soil salinity, including partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest
    (RF), and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) models using VGG
    (VNet), EfficientNet (ENet), and ResNet (RNet) architectures. The results demonstrated
    that the EPO can effectively reduce the interference of moisture on the salinity,
    indicating the better prediction performance of different models. RNet out performed
    PLSR, RF, VNet, Enet, RNet, and exhibited the best performance to predict the
    soil salinity in cotton fields. The lightweight residual neural network without
    attention mechanism was more suitable for one-dimensional hyperspectral data.
    There was an increase in the convolution stride and kernel length of the deep
    convolutional adversarial generative network. The better samples were obtained
    for the hyperspectral data with long sequences. The superior FID scores were achieved
    in the generated augmented sample set using Generator B (designed with the larger
    convolution stride and kernel size), compared with the rest. Specifically, the
    FID scores were reduced by 7.9% and 13.4%, respectively, compared with GA and
    GC. The weight distribution of attention was optimized after expanding the training
    set by DCGAN. The stability and accuracy of the model were further enhanced to
    predict the soil salinity under certain constraints on training samples. The EPO-DCGAN(GB)-RNet
    (called EPO-DCGAN-RNet) model was achieved in the superior RMSE and R2 values
    of 136.472 μS/cm and 0.910, respectively, on the validation set, compared with
    the EPO-SG-RNet (using SG filtering denoising) and EPO-RNet (without sample augmentation).
    Furthermore, 1D-CNN with Grad CAM was employed to identify the characteristic
    bands of soil conductivity in the soil leaching solution of cotton field. In summary,
    an accurate inversion model EPO-DCGAN-RNet was constructed for inversing soil
    salinity in the cotton fields using spectral technology. Water correction and
    sample augmentation were incorporated for the soil salt composition. The improved
    model has the promising potential to the salt-tolerant cotton varieties and irrigation
    strategies using slightly salty water in cotton fields.

    资源附件 摘要: 棉田土壤盐分的精准反演对于棉花的种植管理具有重要意义。水分和盐分作为主要环境因素，共同影响棉田土壤的波谱特征，两者之间的耦合关系直接影响土壤盐分的检测分析。为了提高基于光谱技术构建的模型对棉田土壤盐分信息解析的准确性与可靠性，该研究联用可见/短波近红外（400～1
    000 nm）和长波近红外（960～1 693 nm）技术，采集不同含水率与含盐量的新疆地区土壤样本的光谱；结合外部参数正交法（external parameter
    orthogonalization，EPO），校正不同标样集与不同波段光谱中的土壤含水率干扰信息；引入基于不同卷积步幅的深度卷积对抗网络（deep convolutional
    generative adversarial networks，DCGAN），进行样本增广与质量评估；参考三层残差神经网络设计一维卷积神经网络RNet，最终构建基于EPO-DCGAN-RNet的优化模型，用于棉田土壤盐分的反演。结果表明，与传统机器学习方法和基于VGG或EfficientNet结构一维卷积神经网络相比，该研究提出的EPO-DCGAN-RNet方法能够有效地滤除水分对盐分反演的影响、提高模型对特征波段的挖掘能力、降低深度学习算法对样本量的依赖性，并能得到更优的模型预测性能。EPO-DCGAN-RNet的建模集R2和均方根误差分别为0.942、115.420
    μS/cm，验证集R2和均方根误差分别为0.910和136.472 μS/cm。研究结果可为新疆棉田土壤盐分快速精准检测提供理论指导和技术支持，有助于促进盐碱地区棉花种植的水肥科学管理。

  description: 'Soil moisture (SM) data can provide guidance for decision-makers in
    fields such as drought monitoring and irrigation management. Soil Moisture Active
    Passive (SMAP) satellite offers sufficient spatial resolution for global-scale
    applications, but its utility is limited in regional areas due to its lower spatial
    resolution. To address this issue, this study proposed a downscaling framework
    based on the Stacking strategy. The framework integrated extreme gradient boosting
    (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting
    (CatBoost) to generate 1 km resolution SM data using 15 high-resolution factors
    derived from multi-source datasets. In particular, to test the influence of terrain
    partitioning on downscaling results, Anhui Province, which has diverse terrain
    features, was selected as the study area. The results indicated that the performance
    of the three base models varied, and the developed Stacking strategy maximized
    the potential of each model with encouraging downscaling results. Specifically,
    we found that: (1) The Stacking model achieved the highest accuracy in all regions,
    and the performance order of the base models was: XGBoost > CatBoost > LightGBM.
    (2) Compared with the measured SM at 87 sites, the downscaled SM outperformed
    other 1 km SM products as well as the downscaled SM without partitioning, with
    an average ubRMSE of 0.040 m3/m3. (3) The downscaled SM responded positively to
    rainfall events and mitigated the systematic bias of SMAP. It also preserved the
    spatial trend of the original SMAP, with higher levels in the humid region and
    relatively lower levels in the semi-humid region. Overall, this study provided
    a new strategy for soil moisture downscaling and revealed some interesting findings
    related to the effectiveness of the Stacking model and the impact of terrain partitioning
    on downscaling accuracy.'

    (2) Compared with the measured SM at 87 sites, the downscaled SM outperformed
    other 1 km SM products as well as the downscaled SM without partitioning, with
    an average ubRMSE of 0.040 m3/m3. (3) The downscaled SM responded positively to
    rainfall events and mitigated the systematic bias of SMAP. It also preserved the
    spatial trend of the original SMAP, with higher levels in the humid region and
    relatively lower levels in the semi-humid region. Overall, this study provided
    a new strategy for soil moisture downscaling and revealed some interesting findings
    related to the effectiveness of the Stacking model and the impact of terrain partitioning
    on downscaling accuracy. Keywords: SMAP L4; soil moisture downscaling; Stacking;
    machine learning 1. Introduction Soil moisture (SM) is an important component
    of the global water cycle, affecting rainfall and temperature through evapotranspiration
    processes [1]. Its variation not only relates to plant growth and agricultural
    production, but also to global climate change and extreme climate events, such
    as droughts, floods, and heat waves [2]. In the past, the acquisition of SM data
    has mainly relied on manual sampling and site observations [3]. In situ SM can
    be interpolated to a larger area by geostatistical techniques. However, the practical
    application is unsatisfactory, and the interpolation results have great uncertainty
    in complex surfaces [4]. Therefore, the observation based on point scale makes
    it challenging to meet the monitoring needs of SM at a regional or global scale.
    The remote sensing technique reduces the cost of SM measurements and allows continuous
    monitoring over a large scale. Microwave remote sensing has unique advantages
    in SM monitoring, as it is not affected by weather conditions, has a certain penetration
    ability, and captures SM information in the vertical profile [5]. Previous studies
    have found that L-band is less affected by surface roughness and vegetation types
    [6], and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), represented by L-band, has higher
    accuracy and robustness than other remotely sensed SM products [7]. SMAP L4 products
    provide estimates of surface (0–5 cm) and root zone (0–100 cm) SM at a 9 km spatial
    resolution. These products also fill in the gaps in SMAP observations caused by
    orbit and land surface characteristics, thus providing spatially and temporally
    more complete SM products [8]. However, 9 km resolution is still too coarse for
    many applications that require finer scale data, such as in agriculture, hydrology,
    and ecology. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods to downscale SMAP products
    to higher resolutions, such as 1 km or finer. There are many classifications for
    downscaling methods [9,10,11]. Zhao et al. [9] categorized downscaling methods
    into three types based on the relational models used: empirical methods, semi-empirical
    methods, and physics-based methods. Among these methods, empirical methods are
    based on a priori knowledge and operate under the assumption that the model’s
    scale remains consistent. They apply a relational model, established at a coarse
    resolution, to high-resolution downscaling factors, thereby producing the downscaled
    SM. This method has been widely used due to its simplicity. Machine learning (ML)
    belongs to the category of empirical methods, which has a strong ability to deal
    with nonlinear issues [12]. It expresses the relationship between SM and downscaling
    factors more reasonably under the lack of a physical background, overcoming the
    limitations of empirical methods and physical-based models. ML techniques have
    many cases in the field of passive microwave SM downscaling. Part of the studies
    performed downscaling directly through a single model. For instance, Wei et al.
    [13] used the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to downscale SMAP
    products and obtained promising results in most regions, although improvements
    are still needed in areas with denser vegetation cover. Karthikeyan et al. [14]
    generated a multi-layer SM product using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
    algorithm, and demonstrated that the method has high accuracy, with ubRMSE less
    than 0.040 m3/m3 at most sites. Another part of the studies selected the best
    performing one for downscaling by comparing a series of models in the training
    phase. Rao et al. [15] adopted a combination of multiple ML methods to downscale
    SMAP SM, including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression
    (SVR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), random forest (RF) and XGBoost. They
    found that XGBoost was selected most frequently and had the highest accuracy,
    followed by RF. Similarly, Yan et al. [16] compared three ML algorithms: RF, SVR,
    and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for AMSR-E and AMSR2 products. They found that RF
    had the best accuracy and used it to establish seasonal downscaling models. Despite
    the success of these studies, there are still some potential concerns. A single
    ML model is prone to overfitting in a multidimensional feature space and may not
    fulfill both performance and stability requirements. The Stacking fusion model
    is a heterogeneous ensemble method that can effectively combine the advantages
    of multiple models and obtain better results than a single model. Its advancement
    has been verified in the landslide susceptibility assessment [17], biomass estimation
    [18], visibility prediction [19] and other remote sensing related fields. However,
    to our knowledge, the potential of this method in the field of SM downscaling
    has not been fully explored. Therefore, this study attempted to improve the resolution
    and accuracy of SMAP products by using the Stacking fusion model. We chose three
    models as the base estimators for Stacking: XGBoost, light gradient boosting machine
    (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost). They are improved algorithms
    based on GBDT, with excellent generalization ability [20]. The superiority of
    XGBoost and LightGBM in SM downscaling has been confirmed [14,21]. CatBoost is
    widely used in various ML tasks due to its advantages in dealing with categorical
    features and regression issues [22,23]. But its applications in SM downscaling
    are relatively limited, and it is necessary to evaluate its applicability. To
    enhance the interpretability of the downscaling model, auxiliary data closely
    related to SM are required. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Vegetation Index
    (VI) are the most commonly used factors that form a feature space to describe
    the surface water and heat exchange process, also known as the triangular feature
    space [24]. In addition, Bai et al. [25] found that combining optical/infrared
    data with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can obtain better downscaling results
    in semi-arid areas with low vegetation cover. This is due to the fact that C-band
    radar can penetrate the soil surface and directly detect the surface SM content,
    while optical data has an indirect relationship with SM. In other words, multi-source
    data can reflect SM changes from different perspectives, thereby complementing
    the limitations of each data type. Apart from the dynamic variables mentioned
    above, some static variables also have a significant impact on SM, such as topography,
    soil properties, and land cover [21,26]. They are more important than dynamic
    variables because they determine the primary level and spatial pattern of SM at
    a specific location, and act as constraint conditions for the downscaling model.
    Dynamic variables predominantly capture the short-term fluctuations of SM, which
    are influenced by climate and vegetation. Karthikeyan et al. [14] first identified
    homogeneous regions by predictors in their study, and then performed SM downscaling
    by region. They suggested that ML algorithms based on homogeneous regions may
    solve the extrapolation problem. This inspires our study: we want to explore whether
    downscaling accuracy can be improved by partitioning modeling in regions with
    complex topography. In summary, the main objective of this study is to downscale
    SMAP L4-SM products using multi-source data through the Stacking strategy. In
    particular, we selected Anhui Province, which has a rich and easily distinguishable
    terrain, as the study area. This study compared the accuracy differences between
    downscaling models with and without terrain partitioning. Furthermore, we performed
    a comprehensive validation of the downscaling results through ground measured
    SM and precipitation data, as well as other 1km SM products. We also analyzed
    the impact of different sources of downscaling factors on SM. The contributions
    of this study are (1) Validating the applicability of the Stacking fusion model
    in passive microwave SM downscaling. (2) Exploring whether the strategy based
    on terrain partitioning can improve the downscaling accuracy. (3) Analyzing how
    different downscaling factors influence SM. 2. Study Area and Data 2.1. Study
    Area Anhui Province (29°41′–34°38′N, 114°54′–119°37′E; Figure 1) is situated in
    eastern China and is significantly influenced by monsoon climate. It has an average
    annual temperature of 14–17 °C and an average annual precipitation of 773–1670
    mm. The topography of Anhui province is diverse [27], with higher elevation in
    the south and lower in the north, consisting of five geomorphic units: Huai Bei
    Plain (HB), Jiang Huai Hilly (JH), Wan Xi Mountain (WX), Yan Jiang Plain (YJ),
    and Wan Nan Mountain (WN). This paper will use these abbreviations to describe
    these geomorphic units, respectively. Figure 1. Location of the study area. HB
    is located in the north of Anhui province, accounting for about 27% of the total
    area, with flat terrain and fertile soil, making it the largest agricultural center
    in the province. JH covers around 23% of the total area, characterized by relatively
    low terrain and abundant water resources. YJ, spanning about 21% of the total
    area, is situated along the Yangtze River. It has a dense river network and well-developed
    paddy agriculture. WX and WN make up approximately 29% of the total area and are
    dominated by forest, with higher elevation. 2.2. Research Data The data used in
    this study included ground measured SM, SMAP SM, MODIS products, Sentinel-1 data,
    DEM, soil property data, and precipitation data, all from the period of 1 April
    to 1 November 2019. Table 1 provides a description of these datasets. Table 1.
    Description of datasets used in this study. 2.2.1. Ground Measured SM Data The
    ground measured SM data are provided by the Anhui Hydrology Bureau. There are
    87 SM sites, of which 11 are located in WN, 5 in WX, 18 in YJ, 16 in JH, and 37
    in HB (Figure 1). These sites collect SM data at three standard depths (10 cm,
    20 cm, and 40 cm) on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month at 8:00 AM using the
    drying method. Validation of downscaling results with measured SM at 10 cm may
    introduce some uncertainty as the SMAP L4 represents SM at a depth of 5 cm. It
    has been demonstrated that SM of two consecutive soil layers is strongly correlated
    [28], therefore inconsistency in measurement depths has little effect on the correlation
    assessment. Theoretically, SM at 10 cm will be slightly higher than that at 5
    cm as a result of infiltration and evapotranspiration. 2.2.2. SMAP SM Data SMAP
    is a satellite mission launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) in 2015 to monitor the global distribution of SM and freeze–thaw states
    at the Earth’s surface. The satellite is equipped with an L-band radar and an
    L-band radiometer, which synergistically enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution
    of SM retrievals [29]. The SMAP L4-SM data used in this study were acquired from
    the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) (https://nsidc.org/data/smap, accessed
    on 10 April 2023). It is generated every three hours, and data from 6:00 AM to
    9:00 AM were selected to match the observation time of the measured SM. 2.2.3.
    Modis Products MODIS is a crucial data source for constructing downscaling models
    in this study, providing continuous data with a spatial resolution of 250 m–1
    km for important features such as spectral indices and surface temperature. All
    MODIS products used in this paper have been listed in Table 1, among which the
    MCD12Q1 provides LC data at 500 m resolution for 2019, MOD15A2H provides LAI data
    at 500 m every 8 days, and MOD11A1 provides LST data at 1 km per day. Additionally,
    MOD09A1 provides reflectance data at 500 m resolution every 8 days, and four spectral
    indices were calculated to provide information on surface vegetation, water bodies,
    and soils. The expressions for these indices are as follows: 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼=(𝑛𝑖𝑟−𝑟𝑒𝑑)/(𝑛𝑖𝑟+𝑟𝑒𝑑)
    (1) 𝐸𝑉𝐼=2.5∗(𝑛𝑖𝑟−𝑟𝑒𝑑)/(𝑛𝑖𝑟+6∗𝑟𝑒𝑑−7.5∗𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒+1) (2) 𝑁𝐷𝑊𝐼=(𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛−𝑛𝑖𝑟)/(𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛+𝑛𝑖𝑟)
    (3) 𝑁𝑆𝐷𝑆𝐼=(𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟1−𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟2)/𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟1 (4) where red, nir, blue, and green correspond to
    bands 1–4 of MODIS, and swir1 and swir2 correspond to bands 6–7, respectively.
    Furthermore, MCD43A3 provides albedo data in visible, near infrared, and shortwave
    bands. Since the difference between the mean values of white-sky albedo and black-sky
    albedo is small and highly correlated [30], their mean values in the shortwave
    band were used as an approximation of surface albedo in this study. 2.2.4. Sentinel-1
    Data Sentinel-1 is composed of two polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-1A and
    Sentinel-1B, both equipped with C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors
    to monitor land and ocean surfaces. It has a 12-day repeat cycle and can operate
    in four imaging modes: strip map (SM), interferometric wide swath (IW), extra-wide
    swath (EW), and wave (WV). The IW mode is the main mode for land surface observation,
    providing 10 m resolution images in both VV and VH polarizations. In this study,
    the ascending orbit data of Sentinel-1 in the IW mode were utilized, and a sliding
    time window processing method was applied to generate daily radar data. The window
    had a size of 12 days, containing 6 days before and after each day. This setup
    ensured that each day’s radar data had an equal temporal span, thus avoiding data
    gaps. Within the sliding time window, daily radar data were obtained by averaging
    all the Sentinel-1 images. 2.2.5. Topographic Data Topography plays an important
    role in SM downscaling, which is closely related to the climate, surface runoff,
    and the water cycle, etc. The distribution of SM at different scales is strongly
    influenced by topography (e.g., elevation, slope), and many studies have used
    topographic features for SM downscaling [21]. In this study, the Shuttle Radar
    Topography Mission (SRTM) data from the GEE platform were used with a spatial
    resolution of 90 m. 2.2.6. Soil Property Data Soil properties (proportion of clay,
    sand, and silt) are also vital predictors, which determine the permeability of
    surface water and the water-holding capacity of soil. The soil property data used
    in this study were downloaded from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) [31].
    This dataset adopted the FAO-90 soil classification system, which encompassed
    physical and chemical characteristics of topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (30–100
    cm). The clay, sand, and silt data of topsoil were extracted and cropped to the
    study area. 2.2.7. Precipitation Data Precipitation is another important climatic
    factor that affects SM dynamics besides surface temperature, and the soil response
    to rainfall differs across depths [32]. Time series precipitation data are commonly
    used to validate downscaled SM. The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
    with Station dataset (CHIRPS), which combines 0.05° resolution satellite imagery
    and in situ station data, is currently updated to version 2.0 and provides global
    precipitation data from 1981 to the present. In this study, CHIRPS data were acquired
    through the GEE platform as a validation set for the downscaling results. 2.2.8.
    Other SM Products Two SM products with a spatial resolution of 1 km were selected
    for comparison with downscaled SM. The first is SMCI1.0 (Soil Moisture of China
    by in situ data, version 1.0), produced by Shangguan et al. [33]. It provides
    daily SM data from 2000 to 2020 and consists of 10 depth layers (10–100 cm), offering
    two versions with different resolutions of 30 s (~1 km) and 0.1 deg (~9 km). The
    product is available from the National Tibetan Plateau Science Data Center (https://cstr.cn/18406.11.Terre.tpdc.272415,
    accessed on 6 May 2023). This study obtained SMCI1.0 SM at 10 cm depth with a
    spatial resolution of 1 km as one of the validation datasets. Moreover, SMAP released
    the SMAP-derived 1 km downscaled surface SM product (abbreviated as SMAP D-SM)
    in March 2023, which contains global daily 1 km resolution surface SM [34]. Currently
    version 1 data are available from the NSIDC Center, and daily SM data during the
    study period were obtained as another validation dataset (https://nsidc.org/data/smap,
    accessed on 25 April 2023). The product has two bands: band 1 represents the data
    for the ascending orbit (6 AM) and band 2 for the descending orbit (6 PM). Given
    the high number of missing values, we combined the two bands to fill in the missing
    values of the AM data with the PM data. 3. Methods Section 3.1 illustrates the
    data preparation process based on GEE. Section 3.2 introduces three improved algorithms
    for GBDT: XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, which are tree-based ML methods that
    differ in model construction, feature processing, and target optimization. To
    integrate the advantages of the three models, this study adopts the Stacking strategy.
    This subsection can be realized with the scikit-learn library for Python3 and
    Jupyter Notebook. Section 3.3 demonstrates the overall downscaling strategy and
    provides a schematic diagram. Finally, Section 3.4 presents several metrics to
    evaluate the downscaling results. 3.1. Data Preparation Some low-quality pixels
    may be observed in the MODIS products due to noise (mainly clouds). To maintain
    the spatial continuity and consistency of the data while minimizing the outliers,
    low-quality pixels were first filtered out through the quality control bands in
    each MODIS dataset. Then, for the daily-scale data (MOD11A1, MCD43A3), the missing
    values were filled in by linear interpolation using the valid values of the images
    within 15 days before and after. Similarly, for the 8-day scale data (MOD09A1,
    MOD15A2H), images of intermediate dates were generated by linear interpolation.
    To further improve the quality and smoothness of the interpolated data, the SG
    (Savitzky–Golay) filter was introduced. This method utilizes polynomials for the
    least-squares fitting of values within a moving window, effectively removing noise
    while preserving the trend of data [35]. There are two important parameters of
    the SG filter, the half-width of the sliding window, m, and the order of the polynomial,
    d. Specifically, m determines the amount of data considered by the filter, while
    d defines the order of the polynomial used in the filter. A larger m and smaller
    d result in a smoother filtering result. After several tests, this study set m
    to 5 and d to 4. MCD12Q1 is an annual product with five classification schemes.
    This study selected Land Cover Type 5, the Plant Functional Type (PFT) scheme,
    which includes 8 biomes and 4 other land cover types, totaling 12 types. The area
    of each class was calculated and reclassified to reduce the complexity and uncertainty
    of classification (Table 2). Water bodies were excluded to minimize the negative
    impacts on downscaling performance. Table 2. MCD12Q1 (PFT) land cover types and
    reclassification scheme. 3.2. Machine Learning Methods 3.2.1. XGBoost XGBoost
    is an ensemble learning method based on the GBDT algorithm proposed by Chen and
    Guestrin [36]. Compared to the traditional GBDT algorithm, XGBoost adopts the
    second-order derivative to expedite model convergence, thereby enhancing optimization
    efficiency. It also incorporates a regularization term to control the model complexity.
    Moreover, XGBoost can handle samples with missing features by assigning them to
    the left or right subtrees based on their gain. 3.2.2. LightGBM LightGBM was created
    by Microsoft in 2017 [37]. It is also based on GBDT and employs a histogram-splitting
    algorithm that greatly reduces the time complexity. Unlike other decision tree
    algorithms that operate level-wise, LightGBM uses a leaf-wise algorithm with depth
    limits, which reduces unnecessary computation. Additionally, LightGBM utilizes
    the gradient-based one-side sampling (GOSS) algorithm to remove samples with small
    gradients and prioritize under-trained data, making it particularly effective
    for handling large datasets. 3.2.3. CatBoost CatBoost is based on oblivious trees,
    developed by Yandex [38]. Oblivious trees are a special type of decision tree
    that are characterized by the use of the same features for node division at each
    level, which can minimize the depth of the tree and memory consumption. By using
    the ordered boosting method, CatBoost addresses the prediction shift problem inherent
    in traditional gradient boosting algorithms, thus avoiding target leakage and
    overfitting. 3.2.4. Stacking Model Current prevailing ensemble learning methods
    include Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Bagging and Boosting are homogeneous
    ensemble algorithms, and their base estimators are generated by the same algorithm.
    Stacking is a heterogeneous ensemble approach that observes different aspects
    of the data through different models. It is essentially a stratified structure
    where each layer can contain multiple estimators. In the case of two layers, the
    base estimator in the first layer receives its predictions from the training data
    and then passes them to the second layer for further study. This stratified structure
    allows different models to complement each other, ultimately creating a more powerful
    model. Considering the base models used in this study, the steps of Stacking are
    shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Schematic of the Stacking strategy. 3.3. Construction
    of Downscaling Framework Based on Stacking Strategy ML methods have been widely
    applied in SM downscaling. Some studies experiment directly with a single model,
    while others compare the performance of models during the training phase to select
    the best one. However, relying on a single model may not fully capture the complexity
    of SM distribution, especially when dealing with multiple influencing factors.
    This study proposed a Stacking fusion model for SM downscaling with a total of
    15 predictors, including NDVI, NDWI, NSDSI, EVI, VV, VH, LAI, LST, Albedo, sand,
    silt, clay, DEM, LC, and DOY (day of that year). Figure 3 illustrates the framework
    of downscaling, specifically: Figure 3. Schematic of the proposed downscaling
    framework. Data preparation: in Section 3.1, we performed quality control, gap-filling,
    and SG filtering on MODIS data through the GEE platform, simplifying the land
    cover types and removing the water bodies. Data processing: To standardize the
    spatial resolution of all predictors to 1 km and 9 km, the MCD12Q1 dataset was
    aggregated using the mode method and the remaining datasets were aggregated using
    the mean method. The coordinate systems for all datasets were unified to the UTM
    projection system with WGS84 datum. Sample generation: The 9 km features and SMAP
    L4-SM were sampled according to the terrain partition (HB, JH, WX, YJ, WN). Besides
    remotely sensed features, DOY was added to indicate the generation time of features.
    Model construction: Taking the WN region as an example, the samples collected
    in this region were randomly divided into the training set and test set with a
    ratio of 7:3. XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were trained using the five-fold
    cross validation method and fused through the Stacking strategy. The test set
    was not involved in training and only used for model evaluation. It is worth mentioning
    that, to test the effectiveness of terrain partitioning, we also trained a Stacking
    model without partitioning. Model application: The trained Stacking models were
    then applied to the 1 km resolution features to generate downscaled SM for each
    region, and finally the downscaled results were merged by date. Validation: The
    downscaling results were validated using the measured SM from 87 sites, together
    with precipitation data. Furthermore, we compared the SMCI1.0 and SMAP D-SM products
    as well as the downscaled SM without partitioning. 3.4. Evaluation Method To fully
    evaluate the proposed downscaling framework, several metrics were introduced [39].
    The correlation coefficient (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were used
    to assess the performance of the trained model, measuring the difference between
    the predicted and true values. The bias and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) were also applied.
    UbRMSE is commonly used in SM downscaling studies, and the SMAP requirement for
    ubRMSE is less than 0.040 m3/m3. These four metrics are calculated as follows:
    𝑅= 𝐸[( 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 −𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 ])( 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 −𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ])] 𝜎 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 𝜎 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 (5)
    𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= 𝐸[ ( 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 − 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ ] (6)
    𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠=𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 ]−𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ] (7) 𝑢𝑏𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= 𝑅𝑀𝑆 𝐸 2 − 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 2 − − − − − − − −
    − − − − √ (8) where E[•] represents the mean operator, 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑  and 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃
    refer to the measured SM and SMAP SM; and 𝜎 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 and 𝜎 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 are the standard
    deviations of the SMAP SM and measured SM, respectively. 4. Results 4.1. Validation
    of Downscaling Framework A total of 310,935 samples were obtained by sampling
    the feature dataset and SMAP L4 dataset at 9 km spatial resolution during the
    study period. For each region, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models were trained
    using the five-fold cross validation method, and their prediction results were
    fused by the Stacking strategy. Table 3 displays the number of samples for each
    region and the performance of the models in the training and test sets. It is
    evident that all models achieved R values exceeding 0.9 and RMSE values below
    0.028 m3/m3 on both training and testing sets, indicating a strong correlation
    between the model predictions and the actual values. The four models successfully
    captured the relationship among the features and target at a coarse scale. In
    addition, they exhibited similar R and RMSE values on their respective training
    and test sets, which further demonstrated that they were not overfitted. Table
    3. Number of samples and performance of XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and Stacking
    models on training and test sets for each region (HB, JH, WX, YJ, and WN). Bold
    indicates the best model score. The unit of RMSE is m3/m3. The model’s performance
    on the test set determines its ability to generalize to unknown data. Figure 4
    reveals that the Stacking model outperformed the others, with the highest R and
    the lowest RMSE in each region. XGBoost had comparable performance to Stacking
    model and was the most robust of the three base models. CatBoost also showed reliable
    accuracy, confirming its feasibility for the SM downscaling task. While LightGBM
    had the fastest training speed, its performance was slightly inferior to the other
    models. Surprisingly, the WN region had the best simulation results among the
    five regions (Stacking: R:0.989; RMSE:0.011 m3/m3), followed by the WX region
    (Stacking: R:0.981; RMSE:0.014 m3/m3), which may be attributed to the quality
    of the samples. Figure 4. Performance of XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Stacking
    on the test set. 4.2. Overall Performance of Downscaled SM Downscaled SM was validated
    using the measured SM data collected from April to November 2019. Figure 5 shows
    the distribution of R and ubRMSE values for 87 sites. Overall, most sites exhibited
    satisfactory performance. Regarding R values, 52 sites performed well (R > 0.60;
    60% of the total), 26 sites showed moderate performance (0.4 < R < 0.6; 30%),
    and 9 sites performed poorly (R < 0.4; 10%), including one with extremely weak
    correlation (R < 0). The 9 poorly performing sites were mainly located in the
    HB and JH regions, characterized by flat terrain and predominantly agricultural,
    so the weaker correlation may be attributed to the irrigation conditions in these
    regions. This emphasizes the influence of human activities on SM and the sensitivity
    of the downscaling approach to such impacts. In addition, the average ubRMSE value
    for these 87 sites was 0.040 m3/m3, with 45 sites that met the SMAP accuracy requirements
    for ubRMSE (ubRMSE < 0.040 m3/m3), 38 sites showed acceptable errors (0.040 m3/m3
    < ubRMSE < 0.060 m3/m3), and 4 sites underperformed (ubRMSE > 0.060 m3/m3), mainly
    in the JH and WN regions. Figure 5. Spatial distribution of (a) R and (b) ubRMSE
    between downscaled SM and measured SM at 87 SM sites from 1 April to 1 November
    2019. To further compare the downscaled SM across different regions, bias was
    introduced to assess the deviation between downscaled SM and measured SM. As shown
    in Figure 6, the positions of points represent the values of R and ubRMSE, and
    the colors reflect the bias values. Red indicates a dry bias, while blue signifies
    a wet bias, and the darker the color, the more severe the deviation. The results
    revealed that the downscaled SM in the HB and JH regions exhibited significant
    dry bias. Among the 37 sites in the HB region, 33 sites had bias values less than
    0, as well as for 14 out of 16 sites in the JH region. The average bias values
    for these two regions were −0.050 m3/m3 and −0.034 m3/m3. Conversely, the WX,
    YJ, and WN regions displayed a clear wet bias, especially in the WN region, with
    average bias values of 0.029 m3/m3, 0.026 m3/m3, and 0.090 m3/m3, respectively.
    The fundamental reason for deviation was that the original SMAP products had certain
    uncertainties due to the coarse resolution as well as the effects of vegetation
    and surface roughness, which inevitably affected the performance of the downscaled
    SM. Moreover, the deviation was related to the methods of obtaining SM data at
    different scales. The measured SM was collected based on ground observations,
    representing specific SM values at 10 cm depth, while the downscaled SM represented
    approximate average SM values at 5 cm depth within 1 km. Figure 6. The relationships
    between measured SM and downscaled SM. (a) HB, (b) JH, (c) WX, (d) YJ, and (e)
    WN. The color of the points represents the bias value. n represents the number
    of sites, and sites with a correlation coefficient less than 0 are excluded from
    the figure. We compared all SM products with measured SM and plotted their R,
    bias, RMSE, and ubRMSE values. As shown in Figure 7, the downscaled SM generally
    had higher correlation coefficients, with a mean R value of 0.613 and a median
    R value of 0.659. SMAP L4-SM is the original coarse-resolution product, which
    had comparable accuracy with the downscaled SM (mean R: 0.605; median R: 0.648).
    Yet, the downscaled SM showed a significant reduction in R outliers. The downscaled
    SM(WP) is a downscaled version of SM obtained without partition modeling. It also
    showed reliable accuracy, with a mean R value of 0.551 and a median R value of
    0.610. Compared with SMAP L4-SM, both downscaled SM and downscaled SM(WP) displayed
    a narrower range of bias values and were closer to 0. This may be explained by
    the fact that the downscaling process introduced more details, making the results
    closer to the measured SM. Although the RMSE values of the downscaled SM were
    slightly higher than downscaled SM(WP), its ubRMSE values were generally lower
    and exhibited less variability, suggesting higher overall accuracy. This demonstrated
    the feasibility of the Stacking model in SM downscaling field and proved the effectiveness
    of the terrain-based partitioning modeling strategy. The SMAP D-SM showed the
    most significant variation of all the metrics, implying the instability of its
    performance. This product consists of two bands representing SM values at 6 AM
    and 6 PM. Given the high number of missing values in a single band, the practice
    of using the 6 PM values to fill in the 6 AM missing values may have introduced
    additional uncertainties, leading to inconsistent overall performance. Furthermore,
    the algorithm of the product itself also has an impact. The SMCI1.0 product presented
    the lowest R level and the highest wet bias (mean bias: 0.089 m3/m3; median bias:
    0.076 m3/m3), probably related to the data and method used by the authors. In
    summary, the Stacking model successfully improved the accuracy of SM, especially
    under the terrain partitioning modeling strategy. Figure 7. Comparison of all
    SM products with measured SM. SMAP L4-SM denotes the original 9 km SMAP product.
    SMCI1.0 refers to the 1 km SM product of Shangguan et al. SMAP D-SM is the 1 km
    SM product released by SMAP in March 2023. Downscaled SM is the 1 km downscaling
    results of this study. Downscaled SM(WP) indicates the 1 km downscaling results
    without partition modeling. 4.3. Temporal Dynamics of Downscaled SM To verify
    whether downscaled SM can capture the temporal dynamics of SM and respond to rainfall
    events, we randomly selected 11 sites and plotted a series of charts. In Figure
    8, the first column shows the analysis results of all SM products (SMCI1.0, SMAP
    D-SM, SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, downscaled SM (WP)) along with measured SM, and
    precipitation data. The second column keeps only SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, and
    measured SM, highlighting the R, bias, and ubRMSE metrics before and after downscaling.
    We identified these sites using CODE-Region-LC numbers, where CODE stands for
    site code, Region for location, and LC for land cover type. The findings suggested
    that both downscaled SM and downscaled SM(WP) had strong temporally consistent
    behavior with SMAP L4-SM and captured the dynamic changes of SM. This observation
    was consistent for all sites. Surprisingly, downscaled SM eliminated the systematic
    deviation of SMAP to a certain extent, making the results closer to the measured
    SM. For instance, SMAP L4 underestimated the surface SM at site 50,637,471, resulting
    in a strong dry bias (bias = 0.094 m3/m3), while downscaled SM minimized it to
    0.010 m3/m3. Similar dry bias corrections were found at sites 50,435,400 and 50,901,400.
    Overestimation can also be mitigated by downscaled SM, as exemplified by sites
    62,905,301 and 70,140,600, where the bias was adjusted from 0.068 m3/m3 and 0.093
    m3/m3 to 0.017 m3/m3 and −0.025 m3/m3, respectively. Figure 8. Time series comparisons
    of SMCI1.0, SMAP D-SM, SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, downscaled SM (WP), measured
    SM, and precipitation data at 11 selected SM sites. Note: 2019-10-01 is not displayed
    because only one site had valid measured SM data on that day. Although in some
    cases, the downscaled SM still had a large bias, such as the wet bias of 0.071
    m3/m3 at site 62,909,502; there was already a noticeable improvement compared
    to the original SMAP L4-SM which had a wet bias of 0.138 m3/m3. In contrast, the
    bias correction ability of downscaled SM (WP) was relatively unstable. Some sites
    improved (50,801,100, 62,921,000), while others actually worsened (50,637,471,
    62,802,800), which reaffirmed the advancement of the partitioning strategy. Moreover,
    Figure 8 illustrates that almost every rainfall event corresponded with an increase
    in SM, and both SMAP L4-SM and downscaled SM responded positively. The blue boxes
    in Figure 8 highlight significant increases in SM during rainfall events, and
    the yellow boxes indicate a gradual return of SM after rainfall. Such phenomena
    have existed at any time period. SMCI1.0 tended to overestimate at most sites,
    and SMAP D-SM fluctuated wildly, with only a few valid values from mid-June to
    August. This is consistent with the findings presented in Figure 7. 4.4. Spatial
    Distribution of Downscaled SM To visualize the spatial heterogeneity of the downscaled
    SM, this section presents average distribution maps of SMAP L4-SM, downscaled
    SM, precipitation, LST during the study period, as well as DEM and clay. As can
    be seen from Figure 9, the downscaled SM not only retained the spatial pattern
    of the original SMAP L4-SM, but also provided a higher resolution. The SM pattern
    in Anhui Province presented a clear north–south variation, being lower in the
    north and higher in the south. Such difference is a consequence of combined climatic
    conditions, land cover, and topography [10]. The southern regions are located
    in the humid zone and enjoy abundant precipitation under the influence of monsoon.
    They are predominantly forested, which reduces water evaporation and runoff, thus
    increasing SM retention. Meanwhile, the northern areas experience a semi-humid
    climate characterized by limited precipitation. Coupled with extensive cultivation,
    the soil in this region is loose and has difficulty retaining water [40]. Figure
    9. Mean distribution maps from April to November 2019 for SMAP L4-SM, downscaled
    SM, precipitation, LST, and distribution maps for DEM and clay. Note that water
    bodies are not excluded from the plots. We additionally conducted a detailed examination
    of three regions, labeled A, B, and C, which display unique topographic and climatic
    features. Region A is characterized by low elevation, limited precipitation, and
    high temperature; region C is marked by high elevation, abundant precipitation,
    and low temperature; and region B has a medium elevation between the two, with
    mild temperature and precipitation. The local maps show that downscaled SM was
    sensitive to changes in precipitation and LST, indicating its strong spatial heterogeneity.
    And the distribution of downscaled SM in the three regions demonstrated characteristics
    consistent with topography and climate: region A had generally low SM values,
    suggesting a drier environment; region C tended to have higher SM values, indicating
    ample water resources; and region B had intermediate SM values and did not show
    significant dryness or wetness. It is noteworthy that the downscaled SM showed
    high spatial correlation with DEM and clay, highlighting their dominant roles
    in the downscaling models, while other features modulate the local changes and
    heterogeneity of SM. This finding will be further verified in the subsequent section.
    5. Discussion 5.1. Analysis of Input Predictors We developed a SM downscaling
    framework based on the Stacking strategy using 15 predictors: NDVI, NDWI, NSDSI,
    EVI, VV, VH, LAI, LST, Albedo, sand, silt, clay, DEM, LC, and DOY, which successfully
    generated SM at 1 km resolution on a daily scale. The relative importance of the
    predictors and their effects on the model’s output were also investigated. The
    feature importance provided by the tree models can reveal some of the black-box
    nature of the model and identify the influential features, but they do not indicate
    the exact relationship between the features and target, such as positive or negative
    correlation. SHAP [41] values can measure the magnitude and direction of each
    feature’s influence. They treat each prediction as a collaborative result of all
    features and assign a SHAP value to each feature based on its contribution to
    the prediction. We used SHAP values to analyze how each feature affects the prediction
    result in this study. To approximate the SHAP values of the Stacking model, we
    combined the SHAP values of the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models in each
    region on the training set. Feature importance was obtained by taking the mean
    of absolute SHAP values for each feature. Figure 10 displays the SHAP values of
    the features for each region, with the most influential features near the top
    of the y-axis. It is evident that DOY plays the most crucial role in downscaling
    models for all regions. This suggests that it is advisable to introduce time as
    a feature since it can capture the seasonal variation of SM. Moreover, the time
    feature can help the model identify anomalous data caused by noise like cloud
    cover or signal interference and adjust the predicted values promptly. Shangguan
    et al. [42] also found the importance of the DOY in their study. Figure 10. SHAP
    values and feature importance of Stacking models in different regions: (a) HB,
    (b) JH, (c) WX, (d) YJ, and (e) WN. LC_1.0, LC_2.0, LC_3.0, and LC_4.0 are new
    features generated by the one-hot encoding of LC features. (f) Feature importance
    plot obtained by averaging the absolute values of SHAP values; note that the new
    features derived from one-hot encoding of LC have been summed up as LC. Clay is
    the second most influential feature, which along with sand and silt, determines
    the physical properties of the soil, and in turn affects the storage and movement
    of SM [43]. Clay has the finest particles, and soils with more clay content generally
    have lower infiltration and permeability rates but higher water-holding capacity.
    Figure 10d shows a positive correlation between clay and SM, meaning that higher
    clay content leads to higher SM. Conversely, sand has the coarsest particles,
    and soils with more sand content have better permeability and drainage properties
    but lower water-holding capacity. Figure 10c demonstrates that sand is negatively
    correlated with SM, implying that higher sand content results in lower SM. Silt
    has a particle size between clay and sand, which can retain some water making
    the soil moist. DEM is the third significant feature, supported by previous studies
    demonstrating that topography and soil property are crucial factors influencing
    SM dynamics [14,21]. In HB, JH, and YJ regions, DEM was negatively correlated
    with SM, which is consistent with the results of Fu et al. [44]. These regions
    have lower elevations, typically below 100 m, and mainly consist of cropland.
    The negative correlation may be due to the flat topography, which allows moisture
    to accumulate. Unlike other regions, WX and WN have higher elevations and are
    predominantly forested, where a positive trend in the correlation between DEM
    and SM is observed. This could be explained by the role of trees in improving
    soil water retention capacity [45]. Generally, higher elevations have more forest
    cover, while lower elevations are dominated by grasslands or croplands. Forested
    land has more canopy and leaves, which shade solar radiation and reduce heat from
    the soil surface, thereby increasing SM content. On the other hand, temperature
    variations caused by elevation change are also a significant factor; higher elevations
    usually have lower temperatures, which reduces the evaporation rate and favors
    SM retention. We plotted the co-interaction of DEM and LST on SM in the JH and
    WX regions (Figure 11). The results show that DEM was more variable in the WX
    region, and there was a noticeable interaction between LST and DEM. In areas with
    higher DEM, LST tended to be lower and SHAP values were positive, indicating a
    positive effect on SM. On the contrary, the JH region had a small range of DEM
    variation, and the interaction between LST and DEM was less pronounced. These
    findings suggest that the impact of DEM on SM is complex, and it depends not only
    on the variation of DEM itself but also on the interaction effects of DEM with
    other factors. This is exactly the purpose of our downscaling strategy based on
    terrain partitioning, which simplifies the complex influence of terrain and improves
    the stability and consistency of downscaling models. Figure 11. Co-interaction
    of LST and DEM on SM in the JH and WX regions. (a) JH, (b) WX. LST controls the
    surface thermal changes and is the most significant dynamic variable besides DOY.
    Many studies have confirmed its importance [13,46]. As shown in Figure 10, the
    red LST point is on the left side of the y-axis, which means the increase of LST
    will bring negative feedback to the SM. This finding is further supported by Figure
    11, as the SHAP value is less than 0 when the LST exceeds about 25 °C, indicating
    a negative effect on SM at this point. Albedo is also of high importance as it
    represents the proportion of solar radiation reflected by the Earth’s surface.
    Studies have shown a typical exponential relationship between Albedo and SM, and
    the surface Albedo will decrease with the increase of SM [47]. This is due to
    the fact that wet soils are darker than dry soils and darker soils have lower
    albedo values. The negative correlation is more significant in the YJ, WX, and
    WN regions. VV and VH have a certain penetration ability and can directly detect
    the surface SM. Figure 10f shows that VV is more significant than VH, which agrees
    with the findings of Bai [25]. It is noteworthy that the influence of vegetation
    on the backscattering coefficient under the VV mode is less than that of VH. This
    is because under VH polarization, the radar microwave is vertically transmitted
    and horizontally received, which is more susceptible to vegetation, resulting
    in more vegetation information in the backscatter. Whereas VV polarization is
    vertically transmitted and vertically received, and so this mode penetrates the
    vegetation better and contains more soil information in the backscatter. Among
    the four spectral indices (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, and NSDSI), NSDSI has the highest
    importance, followed by NDWI and EVI, and NDVI is the least. NSDSI is an index
    calculated by the reflectance of the swir bands, which is sensitive to the changes
    of SM [48]. NDVI has been proven essential in previous SM downscaling studies,
    but it has little effect in this study. This is not an isolated case; Yang et
    al. [49] also found that NDVI had a low score in their study. The role of vegetation
    was significant in some studies [6,50], but others found that vegetation played
    a limited role at the 1 km scale [51]. This may be caused by the nonlinear and
    threshold effects of vegetation on SM, and the relationship between NDVI and SM
    may be positive, negative, or irrelevant for different vegetation cover. In terms
    of this study, these indices including LAI played a minor role in the downscaling
    models, while clay, DEM, and LST played a major role. 5.2. Uncertainty of This
    Study Despite the encouraging results of our downscaling study, as with most studies,
    there are some unavoidable uncertainties. The first is the quality of the remote
    sensing data sources, including both the predictors and target. During the data
    preparation step, we performed interpolation and filtering operations on the quality-controlled
    feature datasets to obtain more reliable continuous data. In fact, there were
    still missing values and outliers, especially in the LST data. Missing values
    reduced the number of valid samples, while outliers interfered with the judgement
    of the downscaling models to make inaccurate predictions. On the other hand, the
    accuracy of downscaling results is highly dependent on the coarse-resolution SM
    products. Since the model was constructed based on the relationship between the
    aggregated high-resolution predictors and coarse-resolution SM products, the uncertainty
    of the original SM products directly affected the accuracy of the downscaling
    results. As can be seen from Figure 7 and Figure 8, SMAP L4 products tended to
    underestimate at lower SM levels (HB, JH) and overestimate at higher SM levels
    (WX, YJ, and WN). These uncertainties were propagated and amplified during the
    downscaling process, leading to biases in the downscaled SM. Future research should
    aim to enhance the reliability of data sources and minimize the losses associated
    with data quality. The second uncertainty relates to scale. To align the resolution
    of the predictors with SMAP L4, the numerical features were aggregated using the
    average method. However, this process led to a loss of extreme values. For instance,
    the range of DEM changed from 1–1683 m to 4–1212 m. These extreme values reappeared
    when the model was applied, and the unlearned data may affect the accuracy of
    the model’s output. The third uncertainty occurs in the validation phase since
    the measured SM and the remotely sensed SM have different depths and breadths.
    On the one hand, the measured SM is acquired manually by the drying method, which
    always represents the SM condition at a depth of 10 cm, while the remotely sensed
    SM is obtained by inverting the microwave signal. SMAP L4 claims that the depth
    of the surface SM is the top 5 cm of the soil, but the actual penetration depth
    of the microwave signal is not fixed and varies with the soil water content [52].
    This means that the remotely sensed SM may contain SM information from different
    depths, not just from the top 5 cm. On the other hand, the measured SM only reflects
    the SM condition in a small area, while the downscaled SM represents the average
    SM condition within 1 km. In summary, the inconsistency of depth and breadth will
    affect the representativeness of the measured SM collected at a specific depth,
    thus reducing the comparability of the results. 6. Conclusions This study proposed
    a downscaling framework for SMAP soil moisture based on a Stacking strategy that
    considers the geomorphic units. The spatial resolution of the SMAP L4-SM product
    was successfully improved from the original 9 km to 1 km by using multi-source
    datasets including: MODIS, Sentinel-1, topography, and soil property. The main
    findings are summarized as follows. The framework incorporated three ML models,
    XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Comparison revealed that the Stacking model achieved
    the highest accuracy in all regions, followed by XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
    Validation with measured SM showed that 60% of the sites were highly correlated
    with downscaled SM (R > 0.6), with an average ubRMSE of 0.040 m3/m3, which satisfied
    the accuracy requirements of the SMAP products. Moreover, the downscaling results
    outperformed the available 1 km resolution SM products (SMCI1.0, SMAP D-SM) and
    method without partitioning (downscaled SM (WP)). Both downscaled SM and downscaled
    SM (WP) exhibited temporal consistency with SMAP L4-SM and responded positively
    to rainfall events. They also mitigated the systematic bias of the SMAP L4 product,
    but downscaled SM (WP) performed inconsistently and sometimes even aggravated
    the bias. The spatial pattern analysis indicated that the downscaled SM preserved
    the overall trend of SMAP L4-SM while enriching the details. The downscaled SM
    was higher in the humid regions and lower in the semi-humid regions, which agreed
    with the actual situation. Among the 15 predictors, DOY, clay, and DEM were the
    most important and determined the overall distribution of SM. It is worth noting
    that the relationship between DEM and SM was complex; they exhibited a negative
    correlation in the plains and a positive correlation in the mountains. LST and
    Albedo reflected the dynamics of surface energy and showed a negative correlation
    with SM in all regions. VV polarization was less affected by vegetation and thus
    captured SM changes more effectively than VH. NSDSI was found to be more sensitive
    to SM than the other spectral indices, and together they regulated local variations
    and spatial heterogeneity of SM. In conclusion, this study provides evidence supporting
    the applicability of the Stacking model in SM downscaling studies. Furthermore,
    it validates the effectiveness of the terrain-based partitioning strategy. Future
    studies can further explore the effects of long series data in practical applications,
    such as assessing the response of SM to climate change and human activities and
    analyzing the variability of downscaling results in different seasons. Author

  description: Soil salinization is one of the main factors contributing to land degradation,
    affecting ecological equilibrium, environmental health, and the sustainable development
    of agriculture. Due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil properties
    and environmental conditions in a large-scale region, the monitoring accuracy
    of soil salinization can be challenging. This study investigated whether the classification
    of diverse crop types on a time series can improve the prediction accuracy of
    regional soil salinity levels. Specifically, we evaluated the changes in soil
    salt content (SSC) under diverse vegetation cover over time in the Hetao Irrigation
    District (HID) using multi-phase Sentinel-2 imagery and ground-truth data collected
    from June to September 2021 and 2022. Focused on sunflower and maize fields, this
    study analyzed the impact of classifying these two crop types and examining four
    distinct time series on the accuracy of SSC estimation. Five indices were selected
    as characteristic parameters from a pool of 17 vegetation indices (VIs) and 13
    soil salinity indices (SIs) derived from satellite images. Moreover, three machine
    learning algorithms were used to establish SSC estimation models. The findings
    underscored the efficacy of classifying crop types and considering different time
    series in enhancing the response sensitivity of spectral indices to SSC and improving
    modeling accuracy. Among the spectral indices, VIs made more contributions to
    the SSC estimation model than SIs, achieving the highest coefficient of determination
    (R2) of 0.71. The artificial neural networks algorithm outperformed the other
    two machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability, yielding an
    optimal R2 of 0.72 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.15%. This study proposed
    a modeling and mapping approach that considers crop types and various time series,
    offering valuable insights for accurately assessing soil salinization, guiding
    strategies for its prevention and remediation.

    learningModeling and mapping 1. Introduction Soil salinization is a significant
    global issue that impacts the quality of our land resources and ecological environment.
    It adversely affects soil productivity, crop yields, and the overall balance of
    ecosystems (Mohamed et al., 2023). The Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in Inner
    Mongolia is a prime example, characterized by its arid and semiarid conditions,
    where approximately 70 % of cultivated land is affected by soil salinization (Sun
    et al., 2022). Therefore, there is an urgent need to accurately and rapidly obtain
    information on soil salinization to support local agricultural production. Traditional
    methods of monitoring soil salinity rely on manual sampling, laboratory analysis,
    and measurement, which are time-consuming and laborious. Ground monitoring stations
    can save labor, but they come with limitations, including limited monitoring ranges
    and high costs. In recent years, satellite remote sensing monitoring has emerged
    as a prominent method for qualitative or quantitative monitoring of soil salinization
    due to its unique advantages, including the ability to cover large areas, offer
    various data product types, and provide easy access, low cost, and convenient
    mapping (Cao et al., 2022). Soil salinity varies with irrigation, precipitation,
    evaporation, fertilization, and other production activities or meteorological
    changes, resulting in the soil''s horizontal and vertical movement of salinity
    (Tibhirine et al., 2023). Therefore, obtaining soil salinity distribution under
    different time series is crucial to understanding the dynamic patterns of soil
    salt content (SSC). Currently, many studies have used satellite remote sensing
    to acquire multi-temporal data on surface soil salinization to estimate SSC both
    in bare soil (Abuzaid et al., 2023) and in periods of vegetation cover (Guo et
    al., 2019). Recent research has used hyperspectral and radar data from satellites
    for monitoring soil salinization. Wang et al., (2020b) conducted a qualitative
    analysis of soil salinization level using HJ-1A hyperspectral images and the fractional
    derivatives method, with an R2 of 0.66. Periasamy and Ravi (2020) assessed the
    feasibility of estimating soil electric conductivity (EC) for bare and vegetated
    soil using Sentinel-1 SAR data, yielding a best R2 of 0.85 in sandy bare soil,
    and the R2 greater than 0.7 in soil covered by short crops with a mean height
    of 0.5 m. However, compared to hyperspectral data, multispectral images have a
    smaller data volume, are easier to process, and are more widely used in soil salinity
    monitoring (Marshall and Thenkabail, 2015, Sahbeni et al., 2023). Researchers
    found that multispectral bands, especially those in the visible and near-infrared
    regions, are highly sensitive to SSC (Dehaan and Taylor, 2002, Farifteh et al.,
    2008). Based on the above evidence, many multispectral salinity indices (SIs)
    have been developed, which combine two or more sensitive spectral bands to enhance
    the response sensitivity of band information to soil salinity. Khan et al. (2005)
    constructed SIs, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and SI-1
    for monitoring arid land. In addition, during the vegetation cover period, certain
    vegetation indices (VIs) based on multispectral bands have been found to be more
    effective to SSC than SIs. Zhang et al., (2021a) noted that as fractional vegetation
    cover increases, NDVI and other VIs have higher correlation weights with SSC than
    SIs. Therefore, multispectral satellite data and derived spectral indices (VIs
    and SIs) are reliable data for soil salinity assessment. When using optical satellites
    for large-scale monitoring, the SSC and field environment show spatial heterogeneity
    (Wang et al., 2023), and spectral reflectance captured by these satellites typically
    results from the combined influence of soil properties, crop characteristics,
    and meteorological factor. Moreover, the spectral data contains a large amount
    of information, which can potentially affect the accuracy of SSC monitoring. Therefore,
    spectral information and environmental factors should be accounted for when estimating
    SSC using optical satellite data. Some researchers (Salcedo et al., 2022) have
    noticed that environmental factors can affect the accuracy of SSC inversion and
    attempted to eliminate this impact (Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi et al., 2014). Zhang
    et al., (2021a) observed that the correlation between SSC and spectral indices
    varies under different fractional vegetation cover, and they found that the segmentation
    of different vegetation coverage can improve the estimation accuracy of SSC. Scudiero
    et al. (2015) evaluated the impacts of soil type, field management practices,
    and meteorological factors on SSC estimation accuracy using simple linear models.
    They found that field management practices and meteorological factors significantly
    affect the SSC estimation accuracy. Li et al. (2022b) found that the correlation
    between SSC and spectral covariates varied with seasons and predicted SSC of different
    season soils using remote sensing. Our previous study found that different crop
    growth periods have a notable impact on the model when estimating SSC at a small
    scale during the vegetation cover period (Cui et al., 2023). When conducting large-scale
    SSC monitoring, crop types are diverse and complex within the region and significant
    variations are found in the spectral characteristics across different periods.
    There have been relatively few studies on the influence of different vegetation
    growth stages and crop types on large-scale SSC estimation using remote sensing.
    Both simple linear models and machine learning algorithms were used to establish
    SSC estimation models. Machine learning regression models have consistently demonstrated
    their capability to explore nonlinear relationships, showing their superiority
    in SSC estimation than linera models (Mohamed et al., 2023). Xu et al. (2023)
    obtained a high SSC estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.89) using an improved random forest
    algorithm. Zhou et al. (2021) successfully estimated SSC using an improved SVM
    algorithm, and the R2 of the improved SVM model was 0.56. In the previous research
    on the SSC estimation during the vegetation cover period, Cui et al., (2022) found
    that artificial neural networks (ANNs) show superior performance. This study aims
    to (1) evaluate the influence of time series and crop types on the SSC estimation
    during the vegetation cover period and whether dividing different time series

    between SSC and spectral indices, improve the sensitivity of spectral indices
    to SSC, and identify the most effective independent variables for modeling; (3)

    is located on the desert plateau of Inner Mongolia, China (Fig. 1). This area
    receives about 5 billion cubic meters of water from the Yellow River annually,
    making it the largest irrigated area in the Yellow River basin. HID is a temperate
    continental monsoon climate with little rainfall and large evaporation, and agricultural
    irrigation water depends on the Yellow River (Lu et al., 2019). The most used
    method in the local area is flood irrigation and excessive diversion irrigation
    all year round, which causes high groundwater levels and salt accumulation in
    the soil. About 70 % of cultivated land was salinized to varying degrees (Xiong
    et al., 2021). Sunflower, maize, and squash are the main crops grown in HID, with
    relatively larger areas of sunflower and maize (Li et al., 2022a). Because of
    the climatic conditions, crops are planted only once a year in HID, and there
    is no rotation. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    imagery This study used Sentinel-2 images obtained from the USGS Earth probe data
    portal (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). One of the best quality images in each
    ground sampling period were selected for study, and image data were collected
    on June 30, July 30, August 19, and September 8, 2021, and June 30, July 25, August
    9, and September 3, 2022, in which June to August is summer and early September
    is early autumn. The determination of sampling time was related to the key growth
    period of the main crops in HID. Maize was in jointing stage, tasseling stage,
    milking stage and maturity stage in the above four sampling periods, while sunflower
    was in seedling stage, budding stage, flowering stage and maturity stage respectively.
    The image spectral bands and central wavelengths are as follows: Band2 (blue)
    with a central wavelength of 490 nm, Band3 (green) with 560 nm, Band4 (red) with
    665 nm, Band5 (red-edge) with 705 nm, and Band8 (near-infrared) with 842 nm. Sen2Cor
    software (v2.10.01) was used to perform atmospheric correction on L1C data which
    then was converted into an L2A-level surface reflectance image. SNAP (8.0) software
    was used to generate a cloud removal file for L2A-level data and resampled all
    band images to a resolution of 10 m. Finally, ENVI 5.3 was used for single band
    image stitching, cloud removal, radiometric calibration, and clipping. The study
    focuses on the cultivated land within HID, while urban residential areas, water
    bodies, bare discarded cultivated land, and other landscapes are not within the
    scope of the study. The cultivated land area in HID was extracted with a shapefile
    of Gong et al. (2019). 2.2.2. Ground truth data collection and measurement This
    study conducted four cycles of ground sampling from 2021 and 2022. The sampling
    periods were as follows: June 25 to July 7, July 19 to July 30, August 12 to August
    20, and September 2 to September 9, 2021; and June 29 to July 2, July 23 to July
    27, August 9 to August 12, and August 30 to September 5, 2022. Across these two
    years, 84 sampling areas were established in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID),
    with 35 in 2021 and 49 in 2022. Notably, there were 9 overlapping sampling areas
    (Fig. 1). Within HID, 3 to 5 sampling points were designated in each sampling
    area, the number of sampling points and the descriptive statistics of the SSC
    data were shown in Table 1. The selection of sampling points considered principles
    such as uniform distribution, soil salinity gradient, and vegetation cover type.
    Three soil samples were taken diagonally from each sampling point within the 3
    × 3 m quadrate, and the average of the three soil samples was taken as the final
    result. Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0–20 cm at each sampling site,
    and geographic location information of sampling sites was recorded with RTK differential
    GNSS equipment (Zhang et al., 2021b). After 10–15 days of air-drying, the collected
    samples were ground into powder using a 1-mm aperture sieve, then configured into
    solution (EC1:5) according to distilled water to soil mass ratio of 5:1. The prepared
    solution (EC1:5, μs/cm) was stirred with an electrical conductivity meter for
    8 min and then left to precipitate for 8–10 h. An electrical conductivity meter
    (DDS-307A, Shanghai Yidian Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) was
    used to measure the electric conductivity (EC) of the filtrate. Equation (1) was
    used to calculate the SSC (Wei et al., 2020): (1) SSC = (0. 2882EC1:5 + 0. 0183)

    Methods of crop type classification In this study, crop type was one of the key
    factors influencing SSC estimation. Consequently, obtaining the crop type distribution
    information within HID for the respective periods is necessary. The model established
    by Li et al. (2022a) based on U-Net algorithm was used for crop type recognition.
    The overall recognition accuracy for sunflower and maize using multiple phase
    images captured in June and July ranged between 83.0 % and 83.8 %, and 90.6 %
    to 95.8 %, respectively (Li et al., 2022a). Sentinel-2 images from June 30, 2021,
    and 2022 were used to extract sunflower and maize pixels in this study. The mapping
    result is shown in Fig. 3. The number of sunflower and maize pixels accounted
    for 61 % and 39 %, respectively in 2021. These percentages shifted to 64 % for
    sunflower and 36 % for maize in 2022. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    indices calculation Spectral indices are usually computed using two to four of
    the five bands. Some studies have shown that some VIs are more sensitive to SSC
    than SIs during the vegetation cover period (Zhang et al., 2021a). Therefore,
    in addition to the thirteen commonly used SIs, we also incorporated seventeen
    VIs for correlation analysis. The spectral indices and their corresponding calculation
    formulas are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Salinity indices (SIs) and Vegetation

    methods Pearson''s linear correlation coefficient r was used to characterize the
    pairwise correlations among all independent variables in this study and presented
    with a heatmap. In addition, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) (Granitto
    et al., 2006) was used to determine the optimal number of input variables for
    modeling. The feature selection algorithm of RFE is the random forest, which recursively
    eliminates variables with low contributions until all variables are removed. The
    model with the highest R2 corresponds to the optimal number of variables. 2.3.4.
    Model training, validation and evaluation A linear regression method was used
    as a based model to evaluate the impact of different time series and crop cover
    types on SSC regression accuracy. In addition, three machine learning algorithms,
    including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) were used to establish SSC estimation models. The input
    parameters of models were satellite-derived VIs and SIs selected based on PCCs
    and RFE. Cross-validation (k-fold) method (Stone, 1974) is a resampling method
    used for model training and validation. The original dataset (n = 1304) was randomly
    divided into a cross-validation dataset and a testing dataset with a ratio of
    3:1. The 4 fold cross-validation was used. The testing dataset was used as a separate
    dataset to test model accuracy. The dataset partitions and descriptive statistics
    were shown in Table 3. Table 3. Number of sampling points in each time series

    CVd, cross-validate datasets; Testing, testing datasets. The 4-fold, RF, SVR and
    ANN were completed using “caret”, “randomForest,” “e1071,” and “nnet” packages
    in R language (R-3.5.3). For RF, the tree number uses the default value (5 0 0),
    and the number of variables per node was optimized with values ranging from 2
    to 5 at 1 interval. For SVR, the radial basis kernel function was selected as
    the kernel function, and the kernel parameter (gamma) and penalty parameter were
    optimized with values ranging from 0.1 to 1. For ANN, the single hidden-layer
    feedforward backpropagation neural network structure was adopted, and the initial
    number of nodes were optimized with values ranging from 1 to 5 at 2 intervals.
    The parameters not mentioned remain default values. Root mean square error (RMSE)
    and determination coefficient (R2) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models.
    The mean error (ME) was used to evaluate the model''s tendency to either overestimate
    or underestimate the data. A positive ME value represents the overestimation,
    while a negative ME value indicates the underestimation. 2.3.5. Mapping method
    The optimal estimation model was used to generate maps of SSC in HID across various
    time. Spectral index images were calculated using the Band Math tool in ENVI 5.3
    (Harris Corporation, Jersey City, NJ, USA). The “rgdal,” “raster,” “maptools,”
    and “nnet” packages in R were used to create multiple time series SSC prediction
    distribution maps. In the mapping of SSC under different crop types, ArcGIS (10.2)
    software was applied to mask, reorganize, and reclassify satellite images based
    on crop classification results. 3. Results 3.1. Statistical analysis of soil samples,
    spectral indices, and datasets The collected soil samples were categorized into
    four salinity levels using the classification of Wang et al., (2020a). These levels
    were defined as follows: no-salinization (SSC ＜ 0.2 %), mild-salinization (0.2
    % ≤ SSC ＜ 0.4 %), moderate-salinization (0.4 % ≤ SSC ＜ 0.6 %), and severe-salinization
    (0.6 % ≤ SSC ＜ 1.0 %). In this study, SSC and spectral indices (e.g., NDSI) were
    grouped based on different crop types and various time series, and the statistical
    characteristics of the data were analyzed (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the SSC
    data for maize primarily fell within the mild and moderate salinization categories
    across all four time series. In contrast, the SSC data for sunflower were predominantly
    concentrated in the moderate and severe salinization ranges, which were notably
    higher than those for maize. Furthermore, significant differences in NDSI values
    were observed between sunflower and maize under the same time series, especially
    during June, when the absolute values differed by more than 0.4. This can be attributed
    to differences in vegetation coverage. The sowing time of local maize is from
    late April to early May, while the sunflower is in mid to late May. The sunflower
    was planted later than maize in the local area and was in the seeding stage in
    June. Therefore, the spectral reflectance of soil pixels was affected, resulting
    in lower absolute NDSI values. It can be seen that the spectral reflectance and
    SSC between sunflower and maize fields differed greatly, and the spectral index
    value fluctuated significantly across different time series. Therefore, it becomes
    evident that different crop types and time series influence SSC estimation. Download

    spectral indices and SSC The selection of variables is crucial for SSC estimation.
    Linear correlation coefficients were used to analyze correlations between thirty
    spectral indices derived from satellite images and SSC, and the preliminary result
    matrix was presented as a heat map. As shown in Fig. 5, both SIs and VIs were
    significantly correlated with SSC (r ≥ 0.3). In general, VIs exhibit a stronger
    correlation with SSC than SIs, in alignment with the observations made by Zhang
    et al., (2021a). The study indicated that as vegetation coverage increased, the
    correlation between VIs and SSC became gradually higher than that of SIs. Download

    r between spectral indices and SSC. To determine the optimal number of characteristic
    variables, 31 spectral index variables were analyzed using the RFE method, where
    variables with the least contribution to the model were eliminated one by one
    until the number of variables was 1. R2 and RMSE values of the 31 established
    random forest models were shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, when the number
    of variables is 13, the model accuracy is the highest (R2 = 0.425, RMSE = 0.136
    %), but we also observe that when the number of variables is 5, the model accuracy
    has reached a relatively high level (R2 = 0.418, RMSE = 0.137 %). With the increase
    of the number of variables, the improvement of model accuracy was slight, but
    the risk of model overfitting was greatly increased. Therefore, the optimal number
    of variables for modeling was set to 5. Download : Download high-res image (108KB)

    of variables based on RFE method. Considering the results of Section 3.1, 20 spectral
    indices (with r ≥ 0.3) were used to investigate whether the classification of
    crop types and different time series would improve the correlations between SSC
    and spectral indices. Fig. 7 shows the results. When comparing the entire dataset
    to the individual maize and sunflower datasets, only a slight decrease in the
    correlation between each spectral index and SSC. However, when classifying datasets
    based on crop type and further analyzing them within different time series, the
    correlation between each spectral index and SSC had been greatly improved. Using
    NDSI as an example, the r without classification of crop type and time series
    was 0.409, while after considering the crop types, we found rmaize = 0.380 and
    rsunflower = 0.323. For different time series within each crop type, rmaize ranged
    from 0.509 to 0.606 and rsunflower ranged from 0.501 to 0.606. These results may
    be attributed to the fact that SSC values and corresponding spectral index values
    for the two crops do not follow normal or uniform distributions when analyzed
    without considering crop types. As indicated by the statistics in Fig. 4, sunflowers
    generally exhibit higher SSC levels compared to maize, and the NDSI values for
    sunflower were also significantly higher than those for maize. Therefore, when
    crop types were not considered, this data distribution led to a significant positive
    correlation between NDSI and SSC, where a high NDSI corresponded to high SSC,
    and a low NDSI corresponded to low SSC). However, with crop type divisions, the
    differences in data distribution caused by the distinct characteristics of these
    crops were removed, and the influence of factors such as growth characteristics
    of crops on the correlation were amplified, resulting in a decrease in the correlation
    between NDSI and SSC compared to the dataset that did not consider crop classification.
    A previous study (Cui et al., 2022) indicated substantial variations in crop canopy
    phenotypic characteristics at different time series, resulting in corresponding
    changes in spectral index. However, the fluctuation in SSC over the entire crop
    growth period is considerably smaller than those observed in spectral indices.
    Therefore, the r increased significantly after dividing the data by different
    time series. According to the statistics in Fig. 7a, the absolute correlation
    between SSC and SI under sunflower cover in June was in the range of 0.36–0.50,
    while those in August and September were 0.36–0.61 and 0.42–0.56 respectively,
    and the correlation between SI and SSC in June was mostly lower than that in August
    and September. Download : Download high-res image (402KB) Download : Download

    3.3. Evaluation of the effects of crop type and time series on SSC estimation
    using a linear model Based on the results of Section 3.2, NDSI has a relatively
    high correlation with all datasets. Therefore, the linear relationship between
    NDSI and SSC is used as a reference to evaluate the influence of different crop
    types and different time series on the estimation results of SSC. Equation (3)
    is the linear formula, and the R2 of this model is 0.234. (3) SSCj = 0.509 + 0.425
    × NDSIj where SSCj is the predicted value at each location j and NDSIj is the
    measured value at each location j. Scudiero et al. (2015) reported that using
    different regression coefficients for explanatory variables according to field
    management type (such as cropped and fallow soils) can improve the explained variance
    of a regression equation. Introducing crop types (sunflower and maize) to establish
    a regression model (Eq. (4)), the resulting R2 values were 0.163 for sunflower
    and 0.229 for maize. and the model performance was suboptimal than that of Eq.
    (3). It can then be concluded that when dealing a dataset containing multiple
    time series, the inclusion of crop type as a covariate alone does not improve
    the accuracy of the SSC regression model. (4) SSCj = α + βcrop × NDSIj where SSCj
    and NDSIj are the same as Eq. (3), the α are 0.501 and 0.469 for sunflower and
    maize, and the βcrop are 0.376 and 0.401 for sunflower and maize, respectively.
    As described in Section 2.2, in addition to the great variations in the value
    interval of NDSI among different crops, the characteristics of crops during other
    time series also lead to the great differences in NDSI value interval. Therefore,
    the study developed regression equations (Eqs. (5), (6)) based on crop types differnticating
    by time series (June–September). (5) SSCs,j = λs,time + δs,time × NDSIs,j (6)
    SSCm,j = φm,time + μm,time × NDSIm,j where SSC is the predicted soil salt content,
    NDSI is the measured value, j is the Sentinel-2 pixel location, s is the sunflower
    pixel, m is the maize pixel, λ and φ are the intercepts, δ and μ are the slopes,
    and time is the time series (June, July, August, and September). Table 4 presents
    the intercepts, slopes, and R2 of Eqs. (5), (6). The average R2 of the models
    were significantly higher than Eq. (3) (−0.02–0.284) using different regression
    coefficients for NDSI according to different crop types and time series. For sunflower
    data in July, R2 was lower than Eq. (3), probably because the correlation between
    NDSI and SSC was lower than other spectral indices during the period. It can be
    concluded that the classification of crop type and time series can effectively
    improve the accuracy of SSC estimation. Table 4. Coefficients of determination

    analysis results of section 3.2, the first five spectral indices of each dataset
    with a high r values were selected as independent variables (Table 5). Three machine
    learning algorithms (RFR, ANN, and SVR) were used to establish SSC estimation
    models for different crop types and time series. To assess the impact of crop
    type classification on the model, an initial machine learning model was established,
    which solely considered time series divisions without incorporating crop type
    distinctions. The model performance metrics, R2 and RMSE, are summarized in Table
    6. Comparing these machine learning models to the linear model with a single independent
    variable, it becomes obvious that the machine learning algorithms delivered higher
    accuracy in SSC estimation. According to the results in Table 6, the accuracy
    of sunflower and maize models significantly improved when crop types were taken
    into account, resulting in an increase in R2 from 0.02 to 0.25 compared to undivided
    crop type datasets. Among the three machine learning algorithms, the validation
    and test accuracy of the ANN algorithm were the best in most datasets, with the
    Random Forest (RF) model achieving the highest accuracy in the sunflower dataset
    for July and the maize dataset for September. In general, the SSC estimation model
    based on ANN (R2 = 0.52–0.73, RMSE = 0.08–0.13 %) was considered the most effective
    and possesses the best generalization capability under these conditions. Table

    %) to evaluate the prediction error of the model. Fig. 8 shows the scatterplots
    of the SSC estimation and ground truth values for the ANN models established for
    each crop type and time series. These plots and ME results reveal slight overestimations
    for some no-salinization data (ME = 0 ∼ 0.6 %), and slight underestimations for
    severe salinization data (ME = 0 ∼ -0.14 %). In general, taking into account the
    model’s overall accuracy, it can be concluded that the ANN model exhibits strong
    performance in SSC estimation modeling. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    3.5. Multiple time series mapping of SSC As demonstrated in Section 3.4, ANN models
    had the best performance. Therefore, the predicted SSC distribution maps for HID
    across different time series were generated using the ANN models. Fig. 9 shows
    the distribution maps for HID during each time series in 2021 and 2022. Different
    colors on the map represent varying degrees of soil salinization (as shown in
    the legends), while white pixels represent other crop types apart from sunflower
    and maize fields, roads, deserts, urban residential areas, and other areas unrelated
    to the research object. The pixel statistics of the SSC prediction distribution
    maps mentioned above were shown in Fig. 10. A noticeable pattern appears by analyzing
    the map and counting the pixel for each salinization level. The overall trend
    in soil salinization levels across the four time series within the same year followed
    a pattern from low to high and then back to low. In June, the pixels of no-salinization
    and mild-salinization had the widest distribution, while the pixels of moderate
    and severe salinization were fewer but increased significantly in July and August.
    Soil salinization decreased in September, but still higher than June. Compared
    to 2021, the soil salinization level in the corresponding periods in 2022 exhibited
    a slight decrease, with a relatively reduction in severe-salinization pixels and
    an increase in none and mild salinization. However, August 2022 was an exception,
    as some pixels during this month were significantly overpredicted. SSC generally
    shows dynamic changes across different time series throughout the monitoring period.
    The mapping results of this study can effectively illustrate the dynamic distribution
    of SSC within different crop types and time series. Download : Download high-res

    of crop type and time series division The tolerance of different crops to salinity
    and their response to soil salt stress can vary significantly, especially during
    the vegetation cover period (Tong et al., 2015). To understand this, we analyzed
    the spectral indices and SSC values of the two major crops, sunflower and maize,
    cultivated in HID. We observed that sunflower fields consistently had higher SSC
    values compared to maize fields. This discrepancy can be attributed to the better
    saline-alkali tolerance levels of sunflower than maize. Li et al. (2020) and Dain
    (2023) showed that sunflower had excellent salt tolerance, while Wen et al. (2023)
    showed that maize had good drought resistance but had poorer salt-alkali tolerance.
    Therefore, local farmers often plant sunflowers in areas with high salinity. The
    spectral indices (e.g., NDSI) of the two crops in the same period were significantly
    different, which was related to the great difference in canopy spectra. Take August
    as an example, maize was in the milk-ripe stage with ears visible in the canopy,
    while sunflower was in the blooming stage, characterized by a canopy with prominent
    yellow inflorescence. Therefore, combining data from two crops for analysis and
    modeling would conceal the differences in canopy phenotypic characteristics of
    different crops and their response to SSC. In addition, the SSC and NDSI values
    of the same crop show dynamic changes across the four time series. However, NDSI
    exhibited a considerably higher variation amplitude than SSC. This resulted in
    SSC values showing only slight variations between different periods, while the
    corresponding spectral index values for each period displayed significant fluctuations.
    Such variations could be attributed to the different physiological characteristics
    of the same crop at different growth stages. Jia and Zhang (2014) also had a comparable
    conclusion, noting that sunflowers exhibit different spectral reflectances at
    different growth stages. The spectral reflectance increases with the progress
    of the growth stage, and a reflection peak (809 nm) is formed at the flowering
    stage. As a result, using mixed data from multiple time series for modeling would
    cover up the differences throughout a crop’s entire growth cycle, ultimately reducing
    modeling accuracy. The insights outlined above were further validated during the
    selection of variables for modeling. The classification of crop types and different
    time series significantly improved correlations between each spectral index and
    SSC, with a maximum increase r of 0.31 (EVI in July). Because the classification
    reduces the spectral characteristic confusion arising from differences in canopy
    structure among various crop types and growth stages, the influence of these two
    environmental factors on the correlation strength between spectral indices and
    SSC was eliminated. Meanwhile, the correlation between VIs and SIs changed significantly
    in different time periods. For example, in July, the r value between EVI and SSC
    in sunflower fields was 0.712, ranking as the highest among all spectral indices,
    while in June and August, the r for the same variables were 0.494 and 0.488, respectively,
    ranking the 8th and 16th. This is similar to the results of Zhang (2021a), who
    found that the correlation between spectral indices and SSC from April to August
    changed with the increase in vegetation coverage. It can be concluded that the
    classification of crop types and time series can identify variable combinations
    that are more responsive to SSC, which is beneficial for improving the accuracy
    of modeling and mapping processes. 4.2. Prediction models Considering model accuracy,
    machine learning regression algorithms generally outperform linear regression
    methods. Nonlinear or indirect relationships often exist between the explanatory
    variable and the dependent variable, which machine learning algorithms are proficient
    at uncovering, resulting in improved modeling accuracy Bouasria et al. (2022).
    As evident from the results, the SSC estimation model for the vegetation cover
    period established based on ANN showed the best performance in terms of model
    accuracy. However, it was also found that the prediction accuracy of the model
    for no-salinization and severe-salinization data was relatively low. According
    to the data distribution, the segmentation value between no-salinization and mild-salinization
    data was set at 0.2 %, with the majority of data falling within the 0.1 %–0.3
    % range. The data values within 0.1 %–0.2 % and 0.2 %–0.3 % differ slightly in
    spectral reflectance, which may lead to 0.1 %–0.2 % of the data being overestimated.
    For the severe-salinization data, the performance of the model decreased, likely
    due to its limited sample size. To improve the estimation accuracy of these two
    segments of data, further studies are necessary to analyze the specific characteristics
    of these salinization data and expanding the dataset of severe salinization. 4.3.
    Soil salinity maps The SSC was predicted for pixels classified as maize and sunflower.
    Fig. 11 shows the spatial distribution of SSC for August 2021. Examining the spatial
    division of predicted results between sunflower and maize pixels, the levels of
    soil salinization in sunflower pixels are generally higher than those in maize
    pixels, which is consistent with our field survey and data analysis in Section
    3.1. In the HID region, a common irrigation practice is to implement large-scale
    “spring irrigation” throughout the entire irrigated area before crop planting,
    typically in late May each year (Cui et al., 2022). Spring irrigation mainly aims
    to make surface salt migrate to deeper soil layers with water through excessive
    irrigation to create a suitable soil environment for crop emergence. This corresponds
    well with the predicted results presented in Fig. 9. When comparing different
    months, the soil salinization level of HID was relatively low in June, and soil
    salt reaccumulated on the soil surface due to strong evaporation, resulting in
    elevated soil salinization in July and August. Download : Download high-res image

    influences SSC mapping accuracy. In 2022, a prolonged period of continuous cloudy
    weather occurred in mid to late August, resulting in suboptimal or missing image
    quality in the transit time of Sentinel satellites. As shown in Fig. 12, a part
    of the true color map and SSC prediction maps for HID in August 2022 showcases
    a noticeable seam in the image stitching, denoted by the black box, along with

    When conducting large-scale soil salinization monitoring, the impact of environmental
    variations across expansive areas on monitoring results cannot be ignored (Yang
    et al., 2015). Previous studies have shown that environmental factors, such as
    fractional vegetation cover (Zhang et al., 2021a), meteorological conditions,
    soil texture, and field management practices (Scudiero et al., 2015), were closely
    related to the accuracy of remote sensing monitoring for SSC. This study discussed
    the effects of crop types and varying monitoring time series on estimating the
    regional SSC and obtained positive results. However, this study mainly focused
    on maize and sunflower crops, which may limit the findings'' applicability to
    regions with a wider variety of crop types. Further research efforts should explore
    the sensitivity response of additional crops to SSC and assess the generalizability
    of the model across diverse geographic regions. The previous studies using UAV
    for high-resolution SSC monitoring also found that a number of crop growth parameters
    can improve SSC estimation (Cui et al., 2022). In addition, environmental factors,
    such as soil type, nutrient levels, and soil water content, may also influence
    the responsiveness of crops to SSC, thus impacting estimation accuracy (Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi
    et al., 2014). Therefore, it is necessary to further study the impact of these
    environmental factors on monitoring accuracy in future research on SSC estimation
    during different vegetation cover periods and explore the applicability of these
    factors or features across various monitoring resolutions. An important consideration
    is the necessity to map environmental features, in addition to spectral features,
    within the same range and resolution as SSC when generating prediction distribution
    maps. This not only increases the difficulty of data acquisition, but also introduces
    the potential for cumulative accuracy errors in the distribution map of each factor,
    ultimately affecting the accuracy of SSC mapping. Therefore, how to obtain high-precision
    spatial distribution data for other environmental factors in a quick and efficient
    manner should be considered in future research. When applying these models for
    real-world monitoring, it is necessary to preliminarily assess the crop type and
    time series in the monitored area. Subsequently, SSC predictions must be made
    based on each specific scenario, and then synthesize the final results into a
    prediction map. This process adds difficulty to the practical application of the
    model, and future work needs to resolve this issue. 5. Conclusions This study
    developed SSC estimation models for various time series using Sentinel-2 data
    and produced spatial prediction distribution maps of SSC in HID for different
    times. The results demonstrated that classifying crop types and considering different
    time series significantly enhanced the correlation between SSC and spectral indices,
    thereby positively impacting SSC estimation. Among spectral indices, VIs exhibited
    higher correlations with SSC and made more substantial contributions to the estimation
    models compared to SIs. Within SIs, only NDSI had a high correlation with SSC
    datasets, while within VIs, NDVI, NAVI, TCARI, and EVI showed correlations with
    SSC datasets. Further research is warranted to explore additional environmental
    factors and their spatial distribution information. Funding This study was supported

  description: The authors of this study investigated the use of machine learning
    (ML) and feature engineering (FE) techniques to accurately determine FAO reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) with a minimal number of climate variables being measured.
    The recommended techniques for areas with insufficient measurements are based
    solely on daily temperature readings. Various ML methods were tested to evaluate
    how sophisticated an ML algorithm is for this task necessary. The main emphasis
    was on feature engineering, which involves converting raw variables into inputs
    better suited for ML algorithms, resulting in improved results. FE methods for
    estimating evapotranspiration include approximations of clear-sky solar radiation
    based on altitude and Julian day, approximate relative humidity and wind velocity,
    a categorical month variable, and variables interactions. The authors confirmed
    that the ability of ML in such tasks is not solely dependent on choosing the suitable
    algorithm but also on this frequently ignored step. The results of computational
    experiments are presented, accompanied by a comparison of the proposed method
    against standard ETo empiric equations. Machine learning methods, mainly due to
    the transformation of raw variables using FE, provided better results than traditional
    empirical methods and sophisticated ML algorithms without FE. In addition, the
    authors tested the applicability of the developed models in the broader area to
    evaluate the possibility of their generalizability. The potential of this approach
    to deliver improved predictions, reduced input requirements, and increased efficiency
    holds interesting promise for optimizing water management strategies, irrigation
    planning, and decision-making within the agricultural sector.

  description: Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is an essential variable in agricultural
    water resources management and irrigation scheduling. An accurate and reliable
    forecast of ETo facilitates effective decision-making in agriculture. Although
    numerous studies assessed various methodologies for ETo forecasting, an in-depth
    multi-dimensional analysis evaluating different aspects of these methodologies
    is missing. This study systematically evaluates the complexity, computational
    cost, data efficiency, and accuracy of ten models that have been used or could
    potentially be used for ETo forecasting. These models range from well-known statistical
    forecasting models like seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA)
    to state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) algorithms like temporal fusion transformer
    (TFT). This study categorizes monthly ETo time series from 107 weather stations
    across California according to their length to better understand the forecasting
    models' data efficiency. Moreover, two forecasting strategies (i.e., recursive
    and multi-input multi-output) are employed for machine learning and DL models,
    and forecasts are assessed for different multi-step horizons. Our findings show
    that statistical forecasting models like Holt-Winters' exponential smoothing perform
    almost as well as complex DL models. Unlike statistical models, DL models generally
    suffer from low data efficiency and perform well only when enough data is available.
    Importantly, although the computational costs of most DL models are higher than
    statistical methods, this is not the case for all. Considering computational cost,
    data efficiency, and forecasting accuracy, our findings point to the superiority
    of the neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting
    (N-BEATS) architecture for univariate ETo time series forecasting. Moreover, our
    results suggest Holt-Winters and Theta methods outperform SARIMA – the most employed
    statistical model for ETo forecasting in the literature – in accuracy and efficiency.

    to a comprehensive understanding of the present status of the system, making decisions
    usually require a reliable perception of the system''s future. In other words,
    accurate forecasts facilitate sustainable management strategies and decisions
    (Samaniego et al., 2019). Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential variable for
    irrigation management and scheduling. ET is the sum of evaporation from the soil
    and wet vegetation surfaces and transpiration through plant leaves and plays a
    prominent role in the global hydrological cycle (Pereira et al., 1999). ET rate
    is controlled by physical and biological factors and is plant specific. However,
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a pure meteorological variable that relaxes
    the plant surface''s controlling effects by assuming a hypothetical reference
    crop surface and standardized conditions (Allen et al., 1998, Diodato and Bellocchi,
    2007), which is critical for agricultural water management. There are numerous
    studies in the literature focused on ETo forecasting. Examples are Gocić et al.
    (2015) study on soft computing methods for monthly ETo forecasting, Karbasi et
    al. (2022) weekly ETo forecasting using a hybrid deep learning model, Ferreira
    and da Cunha (2020) research on using deep learning models to forecast multi-step
    ahead daily ETo, and Chia et al. (2022) work on long-term forecasting of monthly
    mean ETo using deep neural networks. Many recent research articles attest that
    ETo forecasting is a prominent case of agricultural time series forecasting (Ferreira
    and da Cunha, 2020). Moreover, a mature body of research is available in the literature
    on applying machine learning models for ETo estimation (Chia et al., 2021a, Chia
    et al., 2021b). Natural systems are associated with internal randomness and inherent
    uncertainties that challenge forecasting their future states. From simpler linear
    models to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, numerous forecasting methodologies
    are available in the literature (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018), and they address
    modeling uncertainties differently. Although most of these models have been employed
    to forecast agricultural and meteorological time series (Ni et al., 2020, Hunt
    et al., 2022), their performance has rarely been systematically compared. This
    study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing ten forecasting models'' complexity,
    data efficiency, and accuracy. To this end, we evaluate the models'' performance
    in the case of monthly ETo forecasting in California. Having a significant seasonality
    and negligible trend in short periods, monthly ETo is a suitable archetype of
    agrometeorological time series. Moreover, with more than one hundred standardized
    weather stations, grave water availability, and quality challenges, California
    is a suitable case study for this research (Lund et al., 2018, Ahmadi et al.,
    2022). Forecasting models evaluated in this study are either ubiquitous statistical
    forecasting methods employed in numerous studies for agrometeorological time series
    forecasting or cutting-edge DL models with promising performances over benchmark
    data sets and in data science competitions. These models are divided into three
    classes: 1) statistical models consisting of autoregressive integrated moving
    average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), Holt-Winters'' exponential smoothing,
    and Theta method; 2) machine learning (ML) models consisting of the light gradient-boosting
    machine (LightGBM); and 3) state-of-the-art DL models including neural basis expansion
    analysis for interpretable time series forecasting (N-BEATS), long short-term
    memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), Transformer model, and temporal
    fusion transformer (TFT). The models'' performance is evaluated in a multi-dimensional
    framework for more in-depth investigation. For this purpose, weather stations
    are categorized based on their historical data availability, two multi-step ahead
    forecasting strategies are employed for ML and DL models, and forecasts are made
    for different forecasting horizons. Forecasting strategies used in this study
    are recursive and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategies. Contrary to the
    recursive strategy that forecasts one time step at each iteration, the MIMO strategy
    forecasts the entire forecasting horizon at once. The multi-dimensional analysis
    of this study goes beyond the typical comparison of performance measures in the
    literature and casts light on various aspects of agrometeorological time series
    forecasting, informing future applications. It is also worth mentioning that although
    some of the more well-known and older DL models, like LSTM, have been applied
    in agricultural and hydrological studies (Hunt et al., 2022), most of the more
    recent model structures, like N-BEATS and TFT, have had limited or no records
    of application in the hydrological and agricultural research. Implementing the
    state-of-the-art DL forecasting models, this study goes beyond analyzing the current
    trend in agricultural forecasting. It aims to introduce the advances of time series
    forecasting to the field of agrometeorology and to promote the current research
    trend in the field. Here, we hypothesize that more complex DL models (i.e., deeper
    and wider architectures) generally outperform statistical methods (Makridakis
    et al., 2022). We also hypothesize that DL models encounter challenges in accurately
    forecasting future time steps for more recently established weather stations (e.g.,
    stations with less than 15 years of data records), as more complex data-driven
    models tend to require more input data and be less data-efficient (Hassani et
    al., 2021). Additionally, we hypothesize that more complex DL models are computationally
    expensive and take longer to train. Furthermore, we hypothesize that ML and DL
    models trained with the MIMO strategy outperform models trained with the recursive
    strategy (Taieb et al., 2012). We test these hypotheses consistently across models.
    In doing so, we keep all the effective parameters (e.g., input data length) similar
    for all the models. Moreover, we analyze the potential effects of background factors
    (e.g., geographical characteristics and climatic conditions) to ensure the reliability
    of our findings. 2. Study area and dataset In our case study of California, meteorological
    drivers of ETo (i.e., inputs of the Penman-Monteith equation, which are net radiation,
    soil heat flux, air temperature, vapor pressure, and wind speed) are measured
    in standardized weather stations throughout the state. These stations are managed
    under the California irrigation management information system (CIMIS), which consists
    of over 145 automated weather stations to assist irrigators and water managers
    with planning and decision-making. CIMIS uses the Penman-Monteith equation and
    a modified version of Penman''s equation to calculate ETo. Hourly weather data
    is used to calculate hourly ETo, which is subsequently added up over 24 h (midnight
    to midnight local time) to estimate daily ETo. Monthly ETo values reported by
    the CIMIS portal are the aggregation of daily values in metric units (mm). More
    information about CIMIS data and the Penman-Monteith equation can be found in
    Ahmadi et al. (2022). For this study, monthly ETo data from 107 active CIMIS stations
    are acquired (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). Stations are chosen according to their
    maintenance and condition records. Stations with unreliable or inconsistent data
    (e.g., stations with poor maintenance, non-grass reference surface, or inadequate
    irrigation) are eliminated from this analysis. All 107 stations used in this study
    have data available until the end of June 2022 without any missing values for
    monthly ETo. However, the stations have been established at different times; therefore,
    their data''s start dates vary. To have a better understanding of the effect of
    historical data availability on the performance of the forecasting models, stations
    are categorized into three categories: 1) long records: stations with more than
    25 years of data, 2) medium-length records: stations with 15 to 25 years of data,
    and 3) short records: stations with 5 to 15 years of data. There are 34, 38, and
    35 stations in the first, second, and third categories, respectively. The oldest
    stations have data available from 1986. No further data preprocessing has been
    conducted on the raw ETo data. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the stations for
    each category. The zoning scheme in Fig. 1 refers to homogeneous zones with respect
    to the reference evapotranspiration. CIMIS divides California into 18 homogeneous
    zones with similar meteorological and evapotranspiration characteristics. More
    information about these zones'' climatic characteristics and locations can be
    found in Table S1 and Figure S9 in the supplementary material. Readers are referred
    to Ahmadi et al. (2022) for more in-depth information about how ETo and its meteorological
    driving factors compare between these zones. Download : Download high-res image

    with 5 to 15 years of data, respectively. (For interpretation of the references
    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) 3. Methodology 3.1. Time series decomposition An essential step
    in analyzing time series characteristics is decomposition. This technique splits
    the time series into three main components: trend, seasonality, and residual error
    (a.k.a. noise components). In this study, we used the Statsmodels library in Python
    to perform an additive time series decomposition (Equation (1): (1) Where is the
    observed value at time t, and , , and are the trend, seasonality, and residual
    components, respectively. 3.2. Forecasting strategy and horizon This research
    focuses on univariate time series forecasting without using exogenous variables
    to forecast monthly ETo. Hence, the only input to forecasting models is monthly
    ETo in previous time steps. To perform one-step and multi-step ahead forecasting,
    we employed three forecasting horizons: one month ahead, three months ahead, and
    six months ahead. The last two years of data, July 2020 to June 2022, are used
    as the test set. For each station, all the forecasting models are trained with
    the data before July 2020, and after training, their performances are evaluated
    according to their forecasts for the test set. Having the same time frame as the
    test set for all the stations and models minimizes the seasonal and climatological
    biases in measuring forecasting accuracy. Fig. 2 shows how the models are trained
    and used to forecast. The model is trained with the original training data to
    forecast the first horizon. The training data is expanded in the next step, and
    the stride is added. The model is now retrained with this expanded training set
    and forecasts the next horizon. This procedure continues until the model forecasts
    the last time step (i.e., June 2022). For all horizons, the stride is set to one
    time step (one month). Notably, we conducted retraining only for statistical and
    machine learning models. Since DL models require a long time to train, these models
    are trained only on the original training set and are not retrained at each step.
    However, the DL models use extended data at each step as input. Download : Download

    and forecasting time steps. We employed two well-known strategies for multi-step
    ahead time series forecasting: recursive strategy and multi-input multi-output
    (MIMO) strategy. Recursive strategy, also called iterated or multi-stage, is the
    oldest and most intuitive forecasting strategy (Taieb et al., 2012). In this strategy,
    forecasting model f is trained to perform a one-step-ahead forecast: (2) Equation
    (2) represents a univariate recursive strategy that forecasts the variable of
    interest (y) at time step t + 1 using the same variable at k previous time steps.
    A recursive strategy can also be used for multi-step ahead forecasting. To do
    so, the model first forecasts the first step. Subsequently, the forecasted value
    is added to the input variables to forecast the next step, using the same one-step
    ahead model f. This procedure is continued until the whole horizon is forecasted.
    Contrary to the recursive strategy, in the MIMO strategy, the forecasting function
    F is a multiple-output function that forecasts the entire horizon simultaneously:
    (3) As shown in equation (3), in the MIMO strategy, the whole forecasting horizon,
    which consists of H time steps, is forecasted by one iteration of the F function.
    It is worth noting that there is no difference between recursive and MIMO strategies
    for one-step ahead forecasting. It should be noted that the MIMO strategy can
    be implemented for machine learning and DL models only. In other words, the statistical
    forecasting models of this study are all restricted to recursive strategy. 3.3.
    Time series forecasting models We use Darts, a Python library for time series
    manipulation and forecasting (Herzen et al., 2022). Darts contains a variety of
    forecasting models, from statistical such as ARIMA to cutting-edge deep neural
    networks. Readers are referred to Herzen et al. (2022) for more information about
    this library. 3.4. Statistical forecasting models 3.4.1. (Seasonal) autoregressive
    integrated moving average (ARIMA and SARIMA) The ARIMA model is one of the most
    popular linear models in time series forecasting (Contreras et al., 2003). ARIMA
    combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) features
    (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018). Differencing refers to computing the difference
    between consecutive observations to remove non-stationarity from time series.
    The autoregressive component is a linear model that forecasts the variable of
    interest using a linear combination of past values of the same variable. In other
    words, the AR model is a linear univariate forecasting model. The MA model, on
    the other hand, uses past forecast errors instead of past values of the variable
    of interest in a regression-like model. An ARIMA model has three hyperparameters,
    which are non-negative integers and need to be determined by the user: p, which
    is the order (number of time lags) of the AR model, d which is the order of differencing
    (i.e., the number of times the data have had past values subtracted), and q which
    is the order of the MA model (i.e., the size of the moving average window). ARIMA
    model is a non-seasonal forecasting model. The seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model includes
    additional seasonal terms in the original ARIMA model. SARIMA has four additional
    hyperparameters, P, D, and Q (order of the seasonal component for the AR, difference,
    and MA models, respectively). The fourth hyperparameter of the SARIMA model is
    m, which is the periodicity or the number of time steps in a whole seasonal period.
    For monthly data, m = 12. More detailed information about the ARIMA and SARIMA
    models can be found in Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018). This study used the
    pmdarima statistical library in Python to optimize ARIMA and SARIMA hyperparameters.
    We optimized hyperparameters for each station and used those station-specific
    parameters to train ARIMA and SARIMA models. From the pmdarima library, we used
    the AutoARIMA model, which identifies the optimal set of parameters for ARIMA
    and SARIMA models, settling on a single-fitted model. In calibration, we set the
    maximum p, q, P, and Q values to 5. As we work with monthly data, m was set to
    12. The information criterion used to select the best model was the Akaike information
    criterion (AIC). We used alpha = 0.05 as the test level for statistical significance,
    the Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) unit root test to detect stationarity,
    and Osborn-Chui-Smith-Birchenhall (OCSB) as the seasonal unit root test. A stepwise
    algorithm outlined by Hyndman and Khandakar (2008) is used to optimize the model
    parameters. The limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm
    with optional box constraints (L-BFGS) is employed as the optimization algorithm.
    Figures S1 and S2 in the supplementary material illustrate the distribution of
    optimized hyperparameters for different stations, categorized by their historical
    data availability. ARIMA and SARIMA models of the Darts library are wrapped around
    the Statsmodels Python module. 3.4.2. Holt-Winters'' exponential smoothing Exponential
    smoothing is a statistical forecasting method proposed in the late 1950s (Holt,
    2004, Winters, 1960). Exponential smoothing is a univariate method that uses weighted
    averages of past observations to forecast future steps. These weights decay exponentially
    as the observations get older. In other words, the more recent the observation,
    the higher the associated weight (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018). More information
    about this method is available in Kalekar (2004) and Hyndman and Athanasopoulos
    (2018). The model used in this study is wrapped around Statsmodels Holt-Winters''
    exponential smoothing. We used an additive model for both trend and seasonality
    components. The seasonal period is set to 12, and the trend component is damped.
    3.4.3. Theta method The Theta model proposed by Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos
    (2000) is a univariate forecasting method based on modifying the local curvature
    of the time series using a coefficient “Theta” (a real number) applied to the
    second differences of the data. Theta method decomposes the original data into
    two or more lines, extrapolates them using appropriate forecasting models, and
    then combines their predictions to obtain the final forecast. This study uses
    the 4Theta model, a modified version of the original Theta method (Spiliotis et
    al., 2020). Through a manual search, we chose Theta = 2 for this model. The seasonality
    period is set to 12, and the type of seasonality is multiplicative. The Theta
    lines are combined with an additive model, and the trend mode is linear. For more
    information about the Theta and 4Theta models, readers are referred to Assimakopoulos
    and Nikolopoulos (2000) and Spiliotis et al. (2020), respectively. 3.5. Machine
    learning model (LightGBM) This study employs the LightGBM as a machine learning
    forecasting tool. LightGBM, initially proposed by Ke et al. (2017) and developed
    by Microsoft as a free and open-source framework, provides an efficient implementation
    of the gradient boosting algorithm and reduces memory usage. Gradient boosting
    is an ensemble method where ensembles are constructed from decision tree models.
    Models are fit through a gradient descent optimization algorithm, where the loss
    gradient is minimized as the model is tuned. In the machine learning literature
    and competitions, gradient boosting and decision tree-based models outperform
    other regression algorithms when applied to tabular data (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon,
    2022). Moreover, it is shown in the literature that gradient boosting algorithms
    work similarly in terms of accuracy and runtime, while some studies point to the
    superiority of LightGBM (Al Daoud, 2019). Therefore, this study employs LightGBM
    as its machine learning model. We feed 12 previous time steps as the input of
    the LightGBM model. More information about the LightGBM method can be found in
    Ke et al. (2017) and Al Daoud (2019). 3.6. Deep learning models We conducted a
    manual hyperparameter tuning for all deep learning models. We objectively searched
    different values for hyperparameters and chose a subset that resulted in the best-performing
    model. We also conducted a grid search for the dropout rate. Data from the Davis
    CIMIS station, one of the best-maintained CIMIS stations with data from 1986,
    is used for hyperparameter tuning. When two sets of hyperparameters had similar
    performances, we chose the simpler model (i.e., the model with fewer trainable
    parameters). To facilitate the comparison between different models, the input
    of all DL models is ETo in the past 12 months. 3.6.1. N-BEATS N-BEATS is a deep
    neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep
    stack of fully connected layers (Oreshkin et al., 2019). N-BEATS was originally
    developed in 2019 to solve the univariate time series forecasting problem. N-BEATS
    architecture is fast to train and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for
    different datasets. For more information about N-BEATS architecture, readers are
    referred to Oreshkin et al. (2019). In this study, we employed the generic architecture
    outlined in Oreshkin et al. (2019). In this architecture, we used four stacks,
    with four blocks in each stack. We used four fully connected layers preceding
    the final backcast-forecast forking layer in each block, with 16 neurons in each
    layer. The expansion coefficient dimension is set to five, and the rectified linear
    unit (ReLU) is used as the activation function of the encoder/decoder intermediate
    layer. The grid search showed that N-BEATS works best without dropout; therefore,
    the dropout probability was set to zero. We trained the model over 100 epochs
    with a batch size of 32. 3.6.2. Long short-term memory (LSTM) LSTM, proposed by
    Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), is a recurrent neural network (RNN). Numerous
    studies in agriculture and hydrology have employed LSTM for forecasting purposes
    (Ni et al., 2020, Ghasemlounia et al., 2021, Hunt et al., 2022). RNN models are
    generally suitable for solving problems with sequential input data like time series.
    However, vanilla RNN models struggle with remembering information for an extended
    period, which is called a long-term dependency problem. LSTM architecture is designed
    exclusively to avoid this problem, which is the main advantage of this model.
    More information about LSTM can be found in Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)
    and Van Houdt et al. (2020). Our LSTM model consists of one recurrent layer with
    12 features in the hidden state. The dropout is set to zero for this model. The
    LSTM model is trained over 1,000 epochs with a batch size of 8. 3.6.3. Temporal
    convolutional network (TCN) Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are
    commonly associated with raster data, they can also be used for sequential data
    with the proper modifications. The TCN, presented by Bai et al. (2018), is a generic
    convolutional architecture designed for sequence modeling. In this study, we use
    dilated TCN for forecasting. Readers are referred to Bai et al. (2018) for more
    information about this model. Our model has a kernel size of 6 and 18 filters.
    The base of the exponent determining the dilation on every level is set to two.
    We used weight normalization of the model and a dropout rate of 0.1. With a batch
    size of 32, we trained the model for 1,000 epochs. 3.6.4. Transformer model Transformer
    is a state-of-the-art DL model introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017). Following
    an encoder-decoder structure, the transformer architecture does not rely on recurrence
    and convolutions to generate an output. The core feature of its architecture is
    the multi-head attention mechanism. In the case of sequential data, a multi-head
    attention mechanism can jointly attend to information at different positions in
    the sequence, making Transformer an appealing architecture for time series forecasting.
    The mechanism is also highly parallelizable, which makes the Transformer architecture
    suitable to be trained with GPUs. More information about the Transformer model
    can be found in Vaswani et al. (2017). In our model, we set the number of features
    in the transformer encoder/decoder inputs to 16, with one encoder layer and one
    decoder layer. We used four heads in the multi-head attention mechanism. The dimension
    of the feedforward network model is set to 128. We used ReLU as the activation
    function of the encoder/decoder intermediate layer. According to the grid search
    results, the dropout rate is set to 0.1. The model is trained with a batch size
    of 32 and over 1,200 epochs. 3.6.5. Temporal fusion Transformer (TFT) TFT is a
    cutting-edge DL architecture introduced by Lim et al. (2021) for interpretable
    multi-horizon time series forecasting. TFT is a novel attention-based architecture
    that uses recurrent layers for local processing and a self-attention layer for
    long-term dependencies. TFT can learn temporal relationships at different scales
    and utilizes specialized components to select relevant features. Readers are referred
    to Lim et al. (2021) for detailed information about this architecture. In this
    study, we set the hidden state size of the TFT architecture to 16 and the hidden
    size for processing continuous variables to 8. We used one layer for the LSTM
    encoder/decoder. We used four attention heads, where a multi-head attention query
    is applied to the future (decoder) part only. A gated residual network is used
    as the feedforward network. PyTorch mean squared error (MSE) is employed as the
    loss function for training. We trained the model over 700 epochs with a batch
    size of 32. 3.7. Performance measures In this study, three deterministic performance
    measures are used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting models: root mean square
    error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2):
    (4) (5) (6) Where N is the number of time steps; and are observed and predicted
    monthly ETo values at ith time step, respectively; and are the mean values of
    observations and predictions, respectively. Lower RMSE and MAE values and higher
    R2 values indicate higher accuracies and better performances. 4. Results and discussion
    4.1. Stations and time series characteristics Stations from different categories
    are almost uniformly distributed over the study area (Fig. 1). Therefore, we hypothesize
    that no systematic bias is introduced to the results and the categorization caused
    by the stations'' location. However, as Fig. 1 shows, there are no stations with
    15 to 25 years of data in northern California. It should be noted that since the
    primary goal of the CIMIS program is to assist farmers with irrigation management,
    most of the CIMIS stations are located in farming/irrigation-oriented regions
    of California. Therefore, there are more stations in central and southern California
    and fewer in northern California. To test our hypothesis and confirm that the
    results are not affected by the geographical and climatic differences among categories,
    we analyzed the long-term monthly ETo records of the stations. As can be inferred
    from Fig. 3, no significant difference exists between the distribution of records
    from different categories. It should be noted that box plots in Fig. 3 represent
    all the observations from all the stations used in this study. Download : Download

    the Davis CIMIS station. It should be noted that decomposition is time series-specific,
    meaning only one time series can be decomposed at a time. Here we show decomposition
    of ETo time series for a well-maintained CIMIS station with adequately long historical
    data (Davis station). This station is located in the Central Valley, where many
    other CIMIS stations are placed. Expectedly, considerable seasonality is present
    in the time series (Fig. 4). Although Fig. 4 suggests an increasing trend in the
    minimum monthly ETo values for the Davis CIMIS station, the trend component does
    not control the observed time series. More information about California, the trends
    of ETo, and its meteorological driving factors can be found in Ahmadi et al. (2022).

    complexity To have a more in-depth comparison of forecasting models, in addition
    to their accuracy, we analyzed their complexity and computational cost. Table
    1 presents the complexity of DL models by providing the number of their trainable
    parameters. Also, this table shows the runtime of all forecasting models as a
    measure of their computational cost. The runtime is based on the Google Colab
    platform without any hardware accelerator (e.g., GPU) and represents the time
    required for training the model on the Davis CIMIS station and making one-step
    ahead forecasts on the test set. In the case of ARIMA and SARIMA models, runtime
    consists of two parts: 1) optimizing the hyperparameters for Davis station using
    the pmdarima library (152 s); 2) training the model with optimized hyperparameters
    and making forecasts on the test set. Table 1. Runtime and number of trainable

    As expected, given their higher complexity, DL models generally have a higher
    runtime than statistical and machine learning models. However, Table 1 shows that
    N-BEATS has a significantly lower runtime than other DL and even ARIMA and SARIMA
    models. The main reason is that N-BEATS architecture is very fast to converge.
    As mentioned in the methodology section, we used only 100 epochs to train the
    N-BEATS model, whereas other DL models required a much higher number of epochs
    to reach minimum loss values. Notably, the number of trainable parameters in the
    N-BEATS model is not lower than in other DL models. Quite the contrary, Table
    1 reveals that the N-BEATS architecture used in this study has the highest number
    of trainable parameters among all DL models. Our findings align with Oreshkin
    et al. (2019), demonstrating the computational efficiency of the N-BEATS model.
    Unlike the N-BEATS model, LSTM architecture is proven very slow to train. Although
    LSTM has the lowest number of trainable parameters among the DL models, it has
    the most extended runtime (Table 1). According to Yu et al. (2019), the slow training
    of LSTM can be attributed to its backward propagation through time. The literature
    suggested some methods to speed up the convergence of LSTM training (e.g., a convex-based
    LSTM network introduced by Wang, 2017). Our study''s findings also suggest no
    direct relationship between the number of trainable parameters of a DL model and
    its runtime. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the overall architecture
    of a DL model is more important than merely the number of trainable parameters
    in the model’s computational cost. 4.3. Forecasting accuracy We used three measures
    of performance to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting models: RMSE, MAE, and
    R2. We show R2 results in the main text and other measures in the supplementary
    material. Since we have multiple time series with different scales in each category,
    and there is a meaningful effect of seasonality in the magnitude of monthly ETo
    at various timesteps, a scale-free accuracy measure like R2 is preferred. According
    to Fildes et al. (2022), results of non-scale-free measures (e.g., RMSE) should
    be handled cautiously in the case of time series forecasting. Fig. 5, Fig. 6,
    Fig. 7 illustrate the models'' accuracy for one month, three months, and six months
    lead time ETo forecasting, respectively. As mentioned earlier, there is no difference
    between recursive and MIMO strategies in one-step-ahead forecasting. Therefore,
    Fig. 5 shows a single box for each ML and DL model. The ARIMA model forecasts
    ETo less accurately than the other models, as its performance falls considerably
    short compared to other models (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This is mainly due to
    the lack of seasonality features in the ARIMA model. As Fig. 4 illustrates, there
    is a significant seasonality in our data, and it is no surprise that a model that
    does not consider seasonality is not a good choice for ETo data. On the other
    hand, the seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model results in accurate monthly ETo forecasts
    for various forecasting horizons and with different amounts of available historical
    data (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This finding aligns with Aghelpour et al. (2022)
    and Ashrafzadeh et al. (2020), who report on the goodness of the SARIMA model
    for monthly ETo forecasting. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download

    image Fig. 7. R2 results of forecasting models in the case of six months ahead
    reference evapotranspiration forecasting. As Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 show, LSTM,
    Transformer, and TFT models have difficulty working with smaller training sets
    (i.e., short data). In other words, these models are data-hungry and require larger
    training sets to work optimally. Transformer and TFT models are even more sensitive
    to the input data length, as their performance drops more severely than LSTM in
    the case of smaller training sets. Therefore, these models are suitable for forecasting
    agrometeorological variables only when enough input data is available. Recent
    literature offers techniques to make these models more data-efficient (e.g., Hassani
    et al. (2021)). Contrary to the data-hungry models, N-BEATS and TCN show low sensitivity
    to the input data length. The most data-efficient DL model is N-BEATS, as its
    performance is least affected by the length of the training set. LightGBM model
    is also sensitive to the length of the data, but much less than more complex DL
    models. Statistical forecasting models do not show profound sensitivity to the
    training data length. Therefore, our results point to the overall data efficiency
    of statistical models. Expectedly, all models perform better when forecasting
    the near future (e.g., one step ahead). In other words, the forecasting accuracy
    of the models drops when the forecasting horizons increase. Fig. 7 and figure
    S8 in the supplementary material suggest that N-BEATS is the best model for longer
    forecasting horizons, followed by Theta and Holt-Winters models. Our findings
    do not suggest a significant difference between the ML and DL models'' accuracy
    under recursive and MIMO strategies. It can be inferred that neither of these
    strategies has a systematic advantage, at least in our case study. Our findings
    generally point to the superior performances of simpler forecasting models compared
    to more complex DL models. Results illustrate that Theta and Holt-Winters methods
    work almost as well as the most accurate DL models while having much lower run
    time and complexity. We hypothesize that these models are more suitable for less
    complex time series, like ETo data. Another important note is that although numerous
    hydrological and agricultural studies employ the SARIMA model (Ashrafzadeh et
    al., 2020, Aghelpour et al., 2022), our study reveals that other statistical models
    outperform this model. This is even more important as we compare the higher computational
    costs of LSTM with other statistical models (i.e., Theta and Holt-Winters; see
    Table 1). Considering the computational cost and the forecasting accuracy, N-BEATS
    is the best model among the models evaluated in this study. N-BEATS is very fast
    to train (Table 1), data-efficient, and can accurately forecast long horizons
    (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). One reason for the superior performance of N-BEATS might
    be that this DL model was initially developed for univariate time series forecasting.
    In other words, this model works better than other DL models for our case because,
    inherently, it is the most appropriate architecture. 4.4. Observed vs. Forecasted
    time series Fig. 8 depicts the forecasted time series of the N-BEATS (i.e., the
    best DL model) and Holt-Winters (i.e., the best statistical model) models against
    the observed values for different forecasting horizons. Davis, Auburn, and Woodland
    stations are chosen to represent stations with various data lengths (available
    data from 1986, 2005, and 2011, respectively). All these stations are placed in
    ETo zone 14 (Mid-central Valley) and close to each other. This proximity minimizes
    the effects of climate and geographic characteristics on the models'' performance.
    Fig. 8 confirms the previous findings on the similarity of performances between
    the best DL model (i.e., N-BEATS) and the statistical model (i.e., Holt-Winters).
    This figure indicates that when monthly ETo values are increasing (when it is
    getting warmer), the forecasted values of both models tend to underestimate observed
    values. Download : Download high-res image (494KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Time series of observed and forecasted monthly reference evapotranspiration
    for three CIMIS stations. Dashed black lines, solid red lines, and solid blue
    lines depict observed values, Holt-Winters model forecasted values, and N-BEATS
    model forecasted values, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to
    colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) On the other hand, when monthly ETo values are decreasing (i.e., when
    it is getting cooler), forecasted values tend to overpredict observed values.
    Again, this pattern happens for both N-BEATS and Holt-Winters models. This behavior
    can be attributed to DL and statistical models using past time series values to
    forecast and tend toward the averaged values. In the case of the Holt-Winters
    method, this is more evident, as this method uses weighted averages of past observations
    to forecast new values, while the exponential smoothing technique gives more importance
    (i.e., larger weights) to more recent observations. Given the similarity between
    the forecasted values of Holt-Winters and the DL model (Fig. 8), we speculate
    that a DL method might learn the same pattern in input data. Due to this tendency
    toward predicting average values of past observations, a postprocessing model
    that adds/subtracts residuals to the predicted ETo data based on the slope of
    predictions can be explored as an alternative to improve forecasts. 5. Summary
    and conclusion This study evaluated the performance, computational cost, and complexity
    of well-known statistical and state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning
    models for forecasting reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Monthly ETo in 107
    standardized stations in California was used for this analysis. Stations were
    categorized according to historical data availability, and models were tested
    for various forecasting horizons. Recursive and MIMO forecasting strategies were
    evaluated for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Significant
    findings of this study and insights for future research include: 1. Complex deep
    learning models (e.g., LSTM and Transformer) are not data-efficient enough for
    agrometeorological forecasting. Given the scarcity of agrometeorological data
    and the unavoidable data gaps in time series measured by micrometeorological sensors,
    more research is needed on the data efficiency of DL forecasting models. One potential
    solution for this issue is developing pre-trained DL models that can be retrained
    for short-range agrometeorological data (aka, transfer learning; e.g., Raei et
    al., 2022). Furthermore, generative adversarial networks can potentially help
    alleviate this problem. 2. Simpler statistical forecasting models work as well
    or even better than state-of-the-art deep learning models. This might be due to
    the inherent simplicity of monthly reference evapotranspiration. Further studies
    are required to analyze the performance of these models for more complex agrometeorological
    time series. 3. N-BEATS was the best overall deep learning forecasting model.
    N-BEATS is very fast to cooverge, requiring only 100 epochs to train, while other
    DL models need a much higher number of training epochs (e.g., 1,000 in the case
    of LSTM and 1,200 for Transformer). N-BEATS is also very data-efficient; this
    model can forecast monthly ETo accurately even when less than fifteen years of
    historical data is available. 4. Although the most popular statistical method
    for agrometeorological time series forecasting is SARIMA, our findings reveal
    that Holt-Winters and Theta methods are more data-efficient, less computationally
    expensive, and generally more accurate than SARIMA. Future studies can evaluate
    their performance in other cases, for example yield forecasting. 5. Our findings
    reveal no significant difference between recursive and MIMO strategies. A more
    in-depth study is needed to analyze the effects of forecasting strategy on the
    performance of ML and DL models, primarily when covariates (e.g., from numerical
    weather predictions or other sensors) are used to inform ETo forecasting. Some
    of the limitations of the current research that introduce opportunities for future
    studies include the following: 1. This research focused on monthly data with a
    clear seasonality component. More studies are needed to evaluate the performance
    of forecasting models for higher-frequency input data (e.g., daily data). 2. This
    study focused on univariate time series, while several agrometeorological cases
    can benefit from covariates and exogenous variables. According to the findings
    of the M5 competition, multivariate models with informative exogenous variables
    are expected to outperform univariate models (Makridakis et al., 2022). We hypothesize
    that introducing exogenous variables to deep learning models will boost their
    performance. However, it should be noted that statistical models are generally
    restrained to one variable. When exogenous variables are available, multivariate
    deep learning models are expected to outperform simpler statistical models. Future
    studies can test these hypotheses. 3. This study trains models for each station.
    However, deep learning models can benefit from cross-learning. Cross- or global-learning
    refers to learning from multiple series to extract information from the global
    data set (Makridakis et al., 2022). This is especially advantageous in agrometeorological
    forecasting, as the time series from various stations and sensors may share common
    characteristics (e.g., seasonality). For instance, ungauged regions with poor
    data history can benefit from neighboring stations and cross-learning strategies
    for accurate forecasting. Future studies can cast light on the advantages of cross-learning
    in agrometeorological forecasting. 4. This research focused on California as the
    case study. Although California is a climatically diverse case study with various
    ecosystems, more studies are required to evaluate the findings of this research
    in other climate conditions. However, as the agrometeorological time series are
    often similar to the time series used in this study in terms of a dominant seasonal
    component, we hypothesize that the findings of this research are relevant to other
    regions and climates. CRediT authorship contribution statement Arman Ahmadi: Software,

    to fill gaps in daily ETa time series. • The best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions required
    by the GPR algorithm were identified. • The best results were obtained when the
    dataset included climate data, SWC and VIs. • The use of ERA5-L data and VIs retrieved
    by Sentinel 2 or MODIS is a good alternative. • GPR algorithm was tested for different
    crops in continental and temperate zones. Abstract The knowledge of crop evapotranspiration
    is crucial for several hydrological processes, including those related to the
    management of agricultural water sources. In particular, the estimations of actual
    evapotranspiration fluxes within fields are essential to managing irrigation strategies
    to save water and preserve water resources. Among the indirect methods to estimate
    actual evapotranspiration, ETa, the eddy covariance (EC) method allows to acquire
    continuous measurement of latent heat flux (LE). However, the time series of EC
    measurements are sometimes characterized by a lack of data due to the sensors''
    malfunctions. At this aim, Machine Learning (ML) techniques could represent a
    powerful tool to fill possible gaps in the time series. In this paper, the ML
    technique was applied using the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm to
    fill gaps in daily actual evapotranspiration. The technique was tested in six
    different plots, two in Italy, three in the United States of America, and one
    in Canada, with different crops and climatic conditions in order to consider the
    suitability of the ML model in various contexts. For each site, the climate variables
    were not the same, therefore, the performance of the method was investigated on
    the basis of the available information. Initially, a comparison of ground and
    reanalysis data, where both databases were available, and between two different
    satellite products, when both databases were available, have been conducted. Then,
    the GPR model was tested. The mean and the covariance functions were set by considering
    a database of climate variables, soil water status measurements, and remotely
    sensed vegetation indices. Then, five different combinations of variables were
    analyzed to verify the suitability of the ML approach when limited input data
    are available or when the weather variables are replaced with reanalysis data.
    Cross-validation was used to assess the performance of the procedure. The model
    performances were assessed based on the statistical indicators: Root Mean Square
    Error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), regression
    coefficient (b), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE). The quite high
    Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient, and the root mean square error (RMSE)
    low values confirm the suitability of the proposed algorithm. Previous article

    1. Introduction The 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs) supports action to bring good and healthy living conditions for the world
    population. Agriculture 4.0 is the last advancement in farming technology, based
    on four main pillars: increasing productivity, sustainable use of natural resources,
    resilience to climate change, and reducing food waste (Zhai et al., 2020). Regarding
    the sustainable use of natural resources, optimization of irrigation systems plays
    a key role because agriculture uses around 70% of the global freshwater consumption
    (United Nations, 2021). To improve water use in agriculture, political actions
    and institutional interventions should be finalized to regulate the pricing policies
    from one side and, from the other, farmers should improve water use efficiency
    for food production through management optimization which depends, among the other
    factors, from the correct estimation of crop water requirement. According to the
    FAO-56 model (Allen et al., 1998), crop water requirements depend on actual crop
    evapotranspiration (ETa), which is composed of two different terms: actual plant
    transpiration (Ta) and soil evaporation (Ea). For a given crop type and phenological
    stage, ETa is governed by the atmospheric evaporative demand and soil water availability.
    Agro-hydrological models based on the soil water balance, SWB, (Van Dam et al.,
    1997, Marletto et al., 2007, Pereira et al., 2020) or surface energy balance models,
    SEB (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998, Awada et al., 2019) have been extensively applied
    to assess actual crop evapotranspiration. Indirect estimations of actual crop
    evapotranspiration, ETa, can be obtained, according to the single crop coefficient
    approach (Allen et al., 2008), by: (1) in which ETo is the crop reference evapotranspiration,
    Kc is the crop coefficient accounting for the crop phenological stage and, Ks
    is the water stress coefficient depending on soil water availability. Even if
    several models based on the combination of the available climate variables have
    been proposed to estimate ETo, the Penman-Monteith equation has been largely applied
    when standard climatological records (air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed,
    and relative air humidity) are available (Allen et al., 1998). In some regions
    of the world where weather data are unavailable and/or poor, global atmospheric
    models are considered a valid alternative to compensate for the absence or improve
    the quality of data (Rodrigues and Braga, 2021). ERA5 and ERA5-Land (ERA5-L),
    provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), are
    the last generation of the global reanalysis climate database. Specifically, in
    the ERA5-L the simulated land fields are controlled by a process of atmospheric
    forcing using air temperature (Tair), air humidity and air pressure. The values
    of these variables are corrected considering the altitude difference between the
    grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-L (Muñoz Sabater, 2019).
    In a recent review presented by Muñoz Sabater et al. (2021), it is possible to
    notice the state-of-the-art associated with the use of ERA5-L for land and environmental
    applications. A climate reanalysis generates large datasets and gives a numerical
    description of the recent climate produced by combining models with observations.
    It contains estimates of atmospheric parameters for all locations on Earth and
    for a long time period. The ERA5 and ERA5-L databases are freely downloadable
    from the internet (https://www.copernicus.eu/en) and are characterized by a spatial
    resolution of 0.25° latitude by 0.25° longitude and 0.10° latitude and 0.10° longitude,
    respectively and a temporal coverage from 1950 up to five days before the real-time.
    In a recent study carried out in Sicily, Pelosi and Chirico (2021) indicated that
    the joint use of ERA5-Land reanalysis and CM-SAF satellite-based radiation data
    is suitable to assess crop reference evapotranspiration, ETo, if ground data were
    not available. For Continental Portugal, Paredes et al. (2018) used daily meteorological
    observations to assess the performance of the ERA-Interim weather variables when
    compared to ground observations and to evaluate the performance of computing daily
    ETo with reanalysis data. The values of crop coefficients Kc (1), for different
    growth stages and management are tabulated in the original FAO-56 manual or more
    recent publications accounting for the research carried out in the last two decades
    (Pereira et al., 2021, Rallo et al., 2021). To avoid the limitations associated
    with the tabular values, satellite images can represent a valid alternative to
    monitor the actual Kc remotely and in a precise way. Pôças et al. (2020) reported
    an exhaustive list of different Kc–Vegetation Indices (VIs) relationships, valid
    for a variety of crops, retrieved based on satellite images acquired by different
    sensors which provide information in the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR) and
    shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions. The value of the stress coefficient Ks (1),
    can be determined based on the application of the water balance model, using different
    functions related to the soil water content (Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, the
    joint use of reanalysis and remote sensing data can represent a powerful database
    to retrieve information on climate variables and crop characteristics with spatial
    and temporal resolutions suitable for practical applications. On the other hand,
    direct estimations of ETa can be obtained, at a larger spatial scale, with micrometeorological
    techniques, such as the eddy covariance (EC) system. This technique, largely used
    in various agroforestry systems, allows to measure the vertical turbulent fluxes
    within the atmospheric boundary layers (Cammalleri et al., 2013, Anderson et al.,
    2017, Rozenstein et al., 2019, Corbari et al., 2020, French et al., 2020, Saitta
    et al., 2020). However, the results achievable depend on the quality and the continuity
    of the available energy fluxes time series. The occurrence of acquisition gaps
    of one or more sensors compromises the continuity of actual evapotranspiration
    records; anomalies are generally due to failure, improper installation of the
    sensors or incorrect calibration, as well as the poor maintenance of sensors or
    data logger. Moreover, the occurrence of outliers in time series can also compromise
    the output quality and could generate inconsistent results mainly when model simulations
    are applied. Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently been proposed as suitable
    methods for time series gap-filling. ML algorithms have already been developed
    for the estimation of crop reference evapotranspiration (Jing et al., 2019, Kim
    et al., 2020, Krishnashetty et al., 2021), several authors have been investigating
    the suitability of ML models to predict directly ETa since, in most cases, they
    disposed of long temporal series of data for training and validating the models
    (Granata et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2020; Talib et al., 2021; Mosre and Suárez,
    2021). In particular, Rasmussen and Williams (2006) demonstrated that the ML model
    GPR (Gaussian Process Regression) can allow to retrieval of synthetic temporal
    series even if the availability of training data is limited. The GPR is a non-parametric
    model based on statistical Bayesian theory that can be used to solve supervised
    multivariate regression and classification issues such as high-dimensional, small-sample,
    and nonlinear problems (Rasmussen et al., 2006; Murphy, 2012). Carter and Liang
    (2019) and Mosre and Suárez (2021) demonstrate that the quality of the results
    of ML algorithms application can be improved if the input variables include vegetation
    indices VIs as NDVI, NDWI as well as EVI. The Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index, NDVI (Rouse et al., 1974) is based on the reflectance in the regions of
    visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR), and the Normalized Difference Water Index,
    NDWI (Gao, 1996) consider the reflectance in the regions of NIR and shortwave
    (SWIR): (2) (3) where ρnir, ρred and ρswir are the near-infrared, red and shortwave
    reflectance, respectively. According to Rouse et al. (1974), the authors retrieved
    the near-infrared and red reflectance values in band 5, from 0.6 to 0.7 µm, and
    in band 7, from 0.8 to 1.1 µm, respectively, using ERTS-1 MSS data. On the other
    hand, Gao (1996) used reflectance at 0.86 µm for near-infrared and at 1.24 µm
    for shortwave. As shown by Pagano et al. (2023), the existing literature focused
    on the prediction of actual evapotranspiration ETa, by means ML algorithms, is
    very limited. Moreover, many of the proposed models are site-specific and the
    replicability of the algorithm on different crops and climatic conditions is not
    yet addressed. Instead, in this paper, the performances of the proposed ML algorithm
    to predict actual evapotranspiration are validated on different crops, in different
    climatic conditions and considering different input data sources. Taking into
    account the reasons presented above, the objective of this study was to assess
    the suitability and the performance of the GPR algorithm to fill gaps in the time-series
    of daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of different crops acquired in temperate
    e continental zones. To this purpose, data, provided from different sources, were
    considered as input variables, like combinations of ground and remote sensing
    data, and reanalysis data when necessary. That''s why a large part of the work
    consisted in verifying the suitability of the climate variables, comparing ground
    and reanalysis data in those experimental fields where both databases were available.
    Even data retrieved from two different satellites were compared when both databases
    were available. 2. Materials and methods The performances of the GPR algorithm
    have been tested on six experimental fields: two in Italy, three in the United
    States of America, and one in Canada, with different crops and climatic conditions
    in order to consider the suitability of the ML model in various contexts. A comparison
    of ground and reanalysis data have been conducted where both databases were available
    and for one of the experimental filed two satellite databases were compared since
    contemporary Sentinel-2 and MODIS images were available. This last comparison
    has been conducted in order to verify the suitability of the MODIS product, which
    is characterized by a lower spatial resolution than Sentinel-2 product. 2.1. Experimental
    fields The first experimental field is a Mediterranean citrus orchard (Citrus
    reticulata Blanco, cv. Mandarino Tardivo di Ciaculli) of about 0.4 ha, located
    near Palermo, Italy (38° 4’ 53.4’’ N, 13° 25’ 8.2’’ E). Fig. 1 shows the map of
    the field with the position of the sensors and tools installed on the ground.
    The experimental activities were carried out from March 2019 to September 2021.

    of Sicily, Italy (37°38’61’’ N, 12°50’53’’ E), about 5 km far from the town of
    Castelvetrano, is part of a larger irrigation district characterized by a flat
    landscape and rather homogeneous soil and crop types. The experimental activities
    were carried out over three years, from January 2009 to December 2011. More details

    fields, citrus and olive orchard, are characterized by a Hot summer Mediterranean
    climate (Csa) (Kottek et al., 2006), according to the last version of the Köppen
    climatic classification, with rainfall concentrated in fall and winter and quite
    hot and dry summer. The other four sites, with different crops and climatic classifications,
    are reported in Fig. 3. The US_ARM is situated near Billings, Oklahoma, USA (36°
    36’ 20.9’’N, 97° 29’ 19.59’’ O). The main crop grown is hard red winter wheat
    (“common wheat,” Triticum aestivum L., main var. Jaeger, Jagalene, and Fuller)
    with infrequent crop rotations (Fischer et al., 2007, Raz-Yaseef et al., 2015).
    The experimental activities were carried out from January 2005 to December 2010.
    The Köppen climatic classification (Kottek et al., 2006) is Humid subtropical
    climate (Cfa). Download : Download high-res image (645KB) Download : Download

    Nebraska, USA (41° 09’ 54.56’’N, 96° 28’ 35.50 O). This field is irrigated with
    a center pivot system. The site has ten years history of maize-soybean rotation
    under no-till (Suyker, 2022). The experimental activities were carried out from
    January 2001 to December 2020. The Köppen climatic classification (Kottek et al.,
    2006) is Hot summer humid continental climate (Dfa). The fifth site (US_CF1) is
    near Pullman, Washington, USA (46° 46’ 53.53’’N, 117° 4’ 55.50’’ O). The predominant
    crops are winter wheat, spring cereals (barley and wheat), and pulse crops (dry
    pea, lentil, and chickpea). The experimental activities were carried out from
    January 2018 to December 2020. According to the Köppen climatic classification
    (Kottek et al., 2006), the climate is Warm, dry summer continental climate (Dsb).
    The sixth and last site (CA_ER1) is near Guelph, Ontario, Canada (43° 38’ 26.17’’N,
    80° 24’ 44.35 O). This field is an agricultural site where corn is cultivated.
    The site is relatively flat and homogenous. The experimental activities were carried
    out from January 2016 to December 2019. The Köppen climatic classification (Kottek
    et al., 2006) is Warm summer humid continental climate (Dfb). Table 1 summarizes

    data The climatic data were obtained from different sources depending on the availability
    of ground measurements and/or reanalysis data. 2.2.1. Ground measurements In the
    citrus orchard, a WatchDog 2000 (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Aurora, IL, USA)
    standard weather station (WD) was installed near the field to collect, at half
    hourly steps, precipitation, P [mm], global solar radiation, Rs [W m-2], air temperature,
    T [°C], air relative humidity, RH [%], wind speed [m s-1] and direction [°] at
    2 m height. In the olive orchard, the same climate variables with hourly steps
    were measured by a standard weather station belonging to the Sicilian Agro-meteorological
    Information Service (SIAS) (www.sias.regione.sicilia.it/). For the four American
    and Canadian fields, climate data from ground measurements were not available.
    2.2.2. Reanalysis data Additionally, for all the six fields, hourly reanalysis
    data of air temperature, T [°C], global solar radiation, Rs [W m-2], dew-point
    temperature, Tdew [°C], and wind speed measured at 10 m above the ground, Ws10
    [m s-1], were also downloaded from the ERA5-Land (ERA5-L) database (Muñoz Sabater,
    2019), available in the climate change service portal provided by Copernicus,
    with the resolution of the spatial grid of 0.1° latitude and 0.1° longitude. (https://cds.climate.co1pernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home).
    The hourly relative air humidity, RH [%], not available in the reanalysis database,
    was calculated as (Allen et al., 1998): (4) where and are the actual and saturated
    vapor pressure corresponding at dew-point, Tdew, and actual air temperature, T,
    respectively. Moreover, the hourly wind speed at 2 m above the ground, Ws2 [m
    s-1], was calculated based on the wind speed at the height z retrieved by the
    ERA5-L database, assuming valid the logarithmic wind speed profile (Allen et al.,
    1998): (5) where Ws2 and Wsz are the wind speed at 2 m and z m above the soil
    surface. For ERA5-L, z is equal to 10 m. Considering the aim of this study, all
    the weather variables at the half hourly and hourly time steps were then aggregated
    at the daily time step. 2.2.3. Quality assurance and quality control The quality
    assurance procedures applied to the Italian ground climate measurements, provided
    by the WatchDog and SIAS stations, are reported in Fiebrich et al. (2010). The
    quality of ERA5-Land data was evaluated by direct comparison to many in situ observations
    collected mainly for the period 2001–2018, as well as by comparison to additional
    model or satellite-based global reference datasets (Muñoz-Sabater et al., 2021).
    2.3. Micrometeorological data Micrometeorological data were retrieved from Eddy
    Covariance towers for the Italian orchards as well as from the AmeriFlux network
    for the Canadian and American orchards. 2.3.1. Italian fields In both the Italian
    experimental fields, actual evapotranspiration, ETa [mm], was estimated by an
    Eddy Covariance flux tower (EC). More details regarding the equipment of the EC
    towers in the citrus and olive orchard are reported in Ippolito et al. (2022)
    and in Cammalleri et al. (2013), respectively. Sensible, H [W m-2], and latent,
    LE [W m-2], heat fluxes were evaluated as: (6) H=ρ cp σWT (7) LE=λ σWQ where ρ
    [g/m3] is the air density, cp [J g-1 K-1] is the air-specific heat capacity at
    constant pressure, σWT [m K s-1], λ [J g−1] is the latent heat of vaporization
    and σWQ [g m-2 s-1] are the covariance between vertical wind speed and air temperature
    or water vapor density, respectively. All the fluxes were evaluated, using (6),
    (7), with a time step of 30 min using the software developed by Manca (2003).
    All the fluxes at the half hourly time steps were then aggregated at the daily
    time step. 2.3.2. American and Canadian fields The values of latent heat flux
    (LE) for the American and Canadian sites were obtained from the AmeriFlux BASE
    data product (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov). Three sites’ datasets had a half-hourly
    resolution, except the US_Ne1 site, which had an hourly resolution (Biraud et
    al., 2021, Suyker, 2022, Wagner-Riddle, 2021, Phillips and Huggins, 2022). Data
    shared under CC-BY-4.0 licence were downloaded. The LE at the half-hourly and
    hourly time steps were then aggregated at the daily time step. 2.3.3. Quality
    assurance and quality control For the Italian field, the raw EC data were post-processed
    by means of the procedure implemented by Manca (2003), virtually analogous to
    the FLUXNET standard protocol (Mauder et al., 2008; Pastorello et al., 2014; 2020).
    Data de-trending was performed using a running mean, a coordinate rotation was
    applied to the sonic anemometer data to obtain a zero mean vertical and transversal
    wind speeds, and correction for spectral loss was performed. In addition, adjustments
    for high wind speeds on sonic temperature and Webb–Pearman–Leuning corrections
    for water vapor were applied (Moncrieff et al., 1997) before the final computation
    of half-hourly fluxes. The method suggested by Prueger et al. (2005), based on
    the Closure Ratio (CR), was used to assess the surface energy balance closure.
    When the energy storage in the soil is neglected, CR represents the slope of the
    regression line between the available energy given by the variance of the net
    radiation, Rn, and the soil heat flux, G, and the covariance of the turbulent
    heat fluxes (LE + H) only evaluated from the subset of half hourly data corresponding
    to Rn ≥ 100 W m-2: (8) To guarantee the consistency of the daily data, only the
    days with 48 half-hourly measurements were considered. AmeriFlux BASE data Quality
    Assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) follow the methodology adopted for processing
    the FLUXNET2015 dataset (Pastorello et al., 2014). The data for each site goes
    through QA and QC steps tailored to the generation of these derived data products.
    A few of these QA and QC steps are described in Pastorello et al. (2020). They
    provide a processing flowchart, which describes all the processing that is applied.
    Data QA and QC assesses units and sign conventions, timestamp alignments, trends,
    step changes, outliers based on site-specific historical ranges, multivariate
    comparisons, diurnal/seasonal patterns, friction velocity filtering, and variable
    availability. Quality checks are done over single variables, multiple/combined
    variables, or more specialized tests. 2.4. Monitoring soil water contents Only
    in the citrus orchard, the temporal dynamics of soil water content (SWC) were
    monitored with four \"drill & drop\" probes (Sentek Pty Ltd, Stepney, Australia),
    installed at a distance of 0.8 m from the trees’ trunks and 0.3 m apart from one
    emitter. These sensors, based on the frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) technique
    (Gaskin and Miller, 1996), allowed measuring apparent soil dielectric permittivity,
    whose values are strongly influenced by the monitoring SWC, at each 0.1 m depth,
    from the soil surface to 0.6 m depth, with a time step of about 30 min. FDR sensors
    have been extensively used to monitor SWC (Burgess et al., 2006, Sun et al., 2014,
    Singh et al., 2019, Campora et al., 2020). The \"drill & drop\" sensor’s response
    is represented by the scaled frequency, which includes the raw counts in air,
    water, and soil. The probes calibration equations for the different soils were
    obtained directly in the field. The probes were normalized, according to the recommendation
    of the manufacturer, to convert the raw counts, corresponding to the actual water
    content, into scaled frequency (SF). To determine SF, the frequencies in air and
    water were also acquired: (9) where Fa is the raw count in air, Fs is the raw
    count in the soil, and Fw is the raw count in water. The manufacturer also provides
    a standard calibration power relationship that allows to retrieve SWC, expressed
    in cm3 cm-3, value starting from the SF values measured by the sensor: (10) SWC
    = α SFβ where α and β are the coefficients of the general equation proposed by
    the manufacturer, equal to 0.494 and 3.017, respectively. 2.5. Vegetation indices
    (VIs) Sentinel-2 scenes and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    nadir reflectances time series were used to calculate the NDVI as well as the
    NDWI. Matlab® R2021b and QGIS version 3.4.3 were jointly used to process the images
    and evaluate both vegetation indices. 2.5.1. Sentinel-2 Since the Copernicus mission
    started operations in 2018 spring and the experiments started in 2019 winter,
    the spatio-temporal variability of vegetation indices for the citrus orchard was
    investigated only by using the Sentinel-2 multispectral images level 2 A. Instead,
    since the experimental period in the olive orchard is prior to 2018, it was not
    possible to use the Sentinel-2 data. However, for this experimental field, it
    was decided to use the Sentinel-2 images, available for the years 2019–2021, to
    test the reliability of the MODIS data. The images were downloaded and pre-processed
    using the R package toolbox “sen2r” (Ranghetti et al., 2020) In the period from
    2019 to 2021, 191 and 65 available clear-sky scenes were selected for the citrus
    and the olive orchards, respectively; the near-infrared, red and shortwave reflectance
    were detected in the bands B08 ranging from 785 to 899 nm, B04 from 650 to 680 nm,
    and B11 from 1565 to 1655 nm of the Sentinel- 2 electromagnetic spectrum. Based
    on (2), (3), maps of NDVI and NDWI with a spatial resolution of 10 m, were generated.
    To downscale the maps of NDWI at 10 m resolution, the value of a single pixel
    in the shortwave region (20 m resolution) was associated with the corresponding
    four values in the near-infrared region (10 m resolution). A continuous time series
    of daily VIs were obtained based on linear interpolations carried out between
    consecutive pairs of Sentinel-2 images acquired at two different dates (Pan et
    al., 2017). 2.5.2. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43A3 Version 6 product (MCD43A
    v006) (Schaaf and Wang, 2015) was considered to obtain time-series of nadir reflectance
    at the different wavelengths for all the experimental fields, except for citrus
    orchard. The continuous time series of MODIS nadir reflectance were downloaded
    using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The near-infrared, red and shortwave
    reflectance were detected respectively in band B2 ranging from 841 to 876 nm,
    in band B1 ranging from 620 to 670 nm and in band B6, from 1628 to 1652 nm of
    the MODIS electromagnetic spectrum. 2.5.3. Sentinel-2 vs MODIS As previously mentioned,
    for the olive orchard, a comparison between Sentinel-2 and MODIS images was carried
    out in the period 2019–2021 to verify the suitability of MODIS images for estimate
    the vegetation indices NDVI e NDWI since this product is characterized by a spatial
    resolution very lower than the Sentinel-2 one. The results demonstrated that MODIS
    images can be considered suitable for the investigated areas since are quite homogeneous
    in terms of soil and crop types (Autovino et al., 2016). 2.6. Gaussian Process
    Regression (GPR) algorithm To estimate the missing data in the ETa time series,
    the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was exploited for its power, among
    other machine learning algorithms, to make predictions relying on a few parameters.
    The model establishes a relation between the independent input variables, xi,
    (climatic variables, soil water status, and VIs), and the dependent variable,
    y, represented by the actual crop evapotranspiration. Specifically, the regression
    model built by the GPR is: (11) y ∼ N(m(x), k(x’x’)) where x and y denote the
    input and output in the training dataset and f(x) is known as latent variable
    in the GPR model, and is the noisy observations of the true function expressed
    as a normal distribution characterized by a mean equal to zero and variance estimated
    from the data. The Gaussian process can be defined by its mean m(x) and covariance
    kernel k(x,x’) functions, represented respectively by a vector and a matrix in
    the form: (12) (13) The mean (basis) function of the GPR model can be assumed
    constant, with a value set to zero, equal to the mean of the training dataset,
    or by using a linear function. The kernel (covariance) function represents a geometrical
    distance measure assuming that the more closely located inputs would be more correlated
    in terms of their function values. The covariance kernel function can be assumed
    as rational quadratic, squared exponential, exponential, or using a Matern kernel.
    More details on the GPR model can be found in Rasmussen and Williams (2006). To
    identify the best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, the machine learning model based
    on the GPR was implemented by using a Matlab® script, which was used to test fifteen
    possible combinations of the mean and covariance kernel functions: three mean
    functions (Zero, Constant, and Linear) and five covariance kernel functions (Squared
    Exponential, Matern 5/2, Matern 3/2, Rational Quadratic, and Exponential). The
    Squared Exponential kernel, also called Gaussian kernel or RBF kernel, is defined
    as (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006): (14) where can be regarded as the squared Euclidean
    distance between two eigenvectors and σS, λS and σε are three hyperparameters.
    controls the marginal variance of f(x) and is referred to as variance parameter,
    which is used to characterize the deviation of the fitting function from the signal
    mean value. When is small, the fitting function deviates from the signal mean
    value slightly. When is large, the fluctuation of the fitting function will become
    larger (Pan et al., 2021). λS is the relative characteristic length scale, which
    is used to describe the smoothness of the function. When λS is small, the dynamic
    response performance of the fitting function is better than when it is high, but
    it is accompanied by the risk of overshooting; when λS is large, the resultant
    function tends to be smooth. represent the measurement error. X is the indicator
    function. The Matern function kernel is named by Stein (1999) after the work of
    Matern (1986). It can be written as: (15) where υ is a chosen parameter equals
    to (p + ½), the definitions of σM and λM are like those of σS and λS, where the
    subscripts indicate the reference to the kernel function name. Γ is the Gamma
    function. The Matern kernel is characterized by the parameter υ. According to
    Rasmussen and Williams (2006), we set υ equal to 3/2 and 5/2. The Rational Quadratic
    kernel can be treated as a scale mixture of Squared Exponential kernels with the
    different characteristic length-scales (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006): (16) The
    hyperparameters σR, λR and σε are like those in the definition of Squared Exponential
    and Matern, where the subscripts indicate the reference to the kernel function
    name. Rational Quadratic has a positive-valued scale-mixture parameter αR that
    can determine the relative weighting of large-scale and small-scale variances.
    Rational Quadratic kernel is equivalent to a scale mixture of Squared Exponential
    kernels with different relative characteristic length scales (Roberts et al.,
    2013). The rational quadratic kernel has a wide scope, which could help the prediction
    performance also when small input database is used and to improve the generalization
    ability and the dynamic response performance (Yang et al., 2022, Shi et al., 2022).
    Finally, the mathematical formula of the Exponential kernel is as follow (Rasmussen
    and Williams, 2006): (17) The hyperparameters σf, λf and σε are defined previously,
    where the subscripts indicate the reference to the kernel function name. This
    analysis was carried out by considering the complete dataset of the input variables
    acquired in the citrus orchard including: i) the standard weather variables: global
    solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (T), relative air humidity (RH), and, wind
    speed measured at 2 m height (Ws2); ii) the Soil Water Content (SWC), expressive
    of the soil water status; iii) two vegetation indices (VIs), such as NDVI and
    NDWI, accounting for the characteristics of the vegetation, with impact on the
    crop coefficient Kc (Lei and Yang, 2014, Pôças et al., 2020). Once identified
    the best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, using the complete database, four different
    possible combinations of the input variables were considered to reduce the computational
    burden. Table 2 summarizes the combinations of the investigated variables used
    as input, to run the model; where the first combination is used to find the best
    mean and kernel functions; instead, the other four to reduce the computational
    burden. The first combination contains the complete dataset that was also used
    to select the m(x) and k(x,x’) functions. The second and the third combinations
    excluded, respectively, the VIs, and the SWCs, whose values are not always available.
    The fourth combination considers only the agrometeorological variables, whereas
    the last combination included only variables acquired from remote platforms and
    available online, such as the agrometeorological variables and the VIs. Table

    using the best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions previously retrieved, for the olive
    orchard, only the last three variables’ combinations due to the unavailability
    of SWC measurements, were tested; instead, for the fields located in the USA and
    Canada only the 5th combination was evaluated. For these applications, the VIs
    were retrieved from the MODIS sensor. 2.7. N-fold cross-validation and statistical
    indicators The best combination of m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, as well as the
    performances associated with the other variables combinations, were evaluated
    using the N-fold cross-validation (Mosteller et al., 1968). Cross-validation is
    a statistical method in which the database is randomly divided into N different
    groups, each one containing the records corresponding to the natural number closest
    to , in which Nt is the total number of records. Model validation follows an iterative
    procedure in which a group is used as test set, while the other N-1 groups are
    used for training. The procedure is stopped after N iterations and therefore after
    using each group as test set. This iterative statistical analysis reduces the
    possibility of overfitting problems (Nguyen et al., 2021) occurring when the model
    fits well the training data but fails in the prediction phase due to the noise
    or random fluctuations in the training data (Namasudra et al., 2021). In this
    study, the value of N was set up as equal to five and therefore 80% of the entire
    database was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing purposes.
    The suitability of m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, as well as the performance of the
    GPR model with the other four different variables combinations were assessed based
    on the following statistical indicators: i) the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE,
    mm d-1) whose target value is zero if there are no differences between simulated
    and observed values; ii) the coefficient of determination (R2, dimensionless)
    whose unitary target indicates that the variance of the observed values is totally
    explained by the model (Eisenhauer, 2003); iii) the Mean Absolute Error (MAE,
    mm d-1) representing the distance between the predicted and observed values, with
    a target of zero; iv) the regression coefficient (b, dimensionless), whose target
    is one, representing the angular coefficient of the regression line between simulated
    and observed values forced to the origin; v) the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient
    (NSE, dimensionless), whose target values is one; a value of this indicator between
    0.0 and 1.0 indicates an acceptable model performance, whereas a negative value
    indicates that the mean of observed values is a better predictor than the simulated
    ones and therefore the performance is unacceptable (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970).
    For each iteration, all the statistical indicators were evaluated. Finally, the
    model performances were analyzed as the mean of all the N performed iterations.
    3. Input data analysis Before the algorithm application, a comparison between
    ground and reanalysis data was conducted. This analysis, realized in the citrus
    orchard, where both databases were available, allowed to evaluate the suitability
    of reanalysis climate variables when ground data are not available. Then, the
    series of actual evapotranspiration values for each experimental field were estimated
    and the consistencies of these series were analyzed to evaluate the percentage
    of missing data for each site. Finally, for the olive orchard, as previously mentioned,
    a comparison between the NDVI and NDWI retrieved from Sentinel-2 and MODIS was
    evaluated in order to verify the suitability of MODIS images to estimate the VIs.
    3.1. Ground vs reanalysis data Fig. 4 shows the scatterplots between ground, acquired
    by the citrus orchard WD weather station, and reanalysis observations, retrieved
    by ERA5-L database, of global solar radiation, Rs (a), average air temperature,
    Tavg (b), relative air humidity, RHavg (c), and wind speed measured at 2 m above
    the soil surface, Ws2 (d). The colored bar indicates the day of the solar year
    (DOY). Rs values retrieved from the ERA5-L product were slightly overestimated
    (b = 1.03; RMSE = 32.68 W m-2), being the relatively higher differences associated
    with the lower Rs values, mostly concentrated during winter (blue and red dots)
    (Fig. 4a). The average air temperature Tavg retrieved by the ERA5-L database resulted
    slightly underestimated if compared with the ground measurements (b = 0.93; RMSE
    = 2.25 °C). In this case, the underestimation was distributed along the year (Fig.
    4b). In Fig. 4c, the point cloud is larger than the previous one, and the red
    and blue points, corresponding to the wet seasons, stay up the 1:1 line, while
    the yellow and orange points, stay under the1:1 line. Therefore, RHavg evaluated
    based on the ERA5-L records is lightly overestimated in the wet season and underestimated
    in the dry season, since RMSE value is equal to 8.64%. Finally, the wind speed
    values at 2 m height, calculated from the ERA5-L reanalysis data referred at 10 m
    height by assuming a logarithmic wind profile, resulted generally higher than
    the ground measurements (Fig. 4d), with a coefficient of the regression line passing
    through the origin equal to b = 2.00 and RMSE value equal to 1.43 m s-1. Download

    a,d. Comparison between a) daily global solar radiation, Rs, b) average air temperature,
    Tavg, c) average air relative humidity, RHavg, and d) wind speed measured at 2 m
    above the ground, Ws2, registered by the weather station installed in the citrus
    orchard and retrieved by the reanalysis data. The colored bar indicates the day
    of the year (DOY). Similar results for all the climate variables were obtained
    by Vanella et al. (2022) for the weather station installed near the olive orchard
    for which the comparisons with the ERA5-L data led to RMSE values respectively
    of 30.31 W m-2 for Rs, 1.37 °C for Tavg, 9.72% for RHavg and 1.54 m s-1 for Ws2,
    air temperature. Vanella et al. (2022) considered acceptable these results because
    of ERA5-L provided daily ETo estimates with good accuracy. Therefore, in the examined
    area, reanalysis database such as the ERA5-L can be considered a suitable surrogate
    of the ground data, as evaluated by several authors for most weather stations
    installed in Sicily (Pelosi and Chirico, 2021, Vanella et al., 2022). 3.2. Micrometereological
    data The scatterplots between the turbulent heat fluxes, H+LE, as a function of
    the available energy, Rn-G measured by the EC tower installed in the citrus orchard
    at the half hourly time step, for each of the three years, were already evaluated
    in Pagano et al. (2023). The slope of the regression line passing through the
    origin represents the closure ratio, CR, whose values resulted in satisfactory
    and equal to 0.98, 0.88 and 1.03 for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. For the
    olive orchard, the values of CR were estimated equal to 0.90 for 2009, 0.92 for
    2010 in Cammalleri et al. (2013), and 1.02 for 2011 in Autovino et al. (2016).
    For tree crops, Kustas et al. (1999) considered acceptable values of CR ranging
    between 0.80 and 0.90 even if values of CR equal to 1.08 and 1.03, were obtained
    by Er-Raki et al. (2009) in two citrus orchards in south Morocco characterized
    by a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. The CR estimates for the two fields conformed
    to the values found in the literature and are therefore considered reliable. Table
    3 summarizes the lack of data percentage for each field. Table 3. Lack of data

    5 shows the comparison between the NDVI and NDWI retrieved from Sentinel-2 (black
    line) and MODIS (red line) products for the olive orchard. The Sentinel-2 VIs,
    with the corresponding standard deviations, were obtained through zonal statistics
    considering all the Sentinel-2 pixels contained within the pixel MODIS. The major
    differences between the two VIs are concentrated during falls and winters (red
    and blue dots in the scatter plots on the right) probably due to the presence
    of ground weeds that grow after rain events (Ippolito et al., 2022), which can
    be detected with the Sentinel-2 images and not with the MODIS ones. The generally
    good agreements between the NDVI (b = 0.95: R2 =0.99) and NDWI (b = 0.88; R2 =
    0.96) obtained from the two different platforms strongly depend on the homogeneity
    of soil and land characterizing the MODIS pixel (Autovino et al., 2016). Download

    4. Results and discussion Once the input data as well as the actual evapotranspiration
    have been estimated, the GPR algorithm was tested. The best mean, m(x), and kernel
    covariance, k(x,x’), functions were assessed by the complete dataset related to
    the citrus orchard, which includes all the examined variable (see combination
    1 in Table 2). Table 4 summarizes the statistical indicators associated with the
    fifteen combinations of the examined m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, whereas Fig.
    6 illustrates the scatterplots of the corresponding measured versus estimated
    actual evapotranspiration values when considering the complete database of the
    input variables and implementing the best and the worst m(x) and k(x,x’) functions
    in the GPR model. Table 4. Statistical indicators for mean, m(x), and kernel covariance,

    Fig. 6. a,b. Scatterplots of estimated versus measured ETa obtained for the citrus
    orchard when considering the complete dataset (Combination 1) and assuming the
    best (a) and the worst (b) combination of the mean and kernel covariance functions.
    RMSE values for the best and the worst combination are equal to 0.38 mm d-1 and
    0.45 mm d-1, respectively. Despite the fairly limited differences in terms of
    the examined statistical indicators, the best result was obtained when assuming
    a zero mean function and an exponential kernel covariance function. Under these
    assumptions, the estimations of ETa resulted characterized by RMSE = 0.38 mm d-1
    and MAE = 0.28 mm d-1. On the other hand, the worst result, characterized by RMSE
    = 0.45 mm d-1 and MAE = 0.32 mm d-1 was obtained when assuming a constant m(x)
    and a squared exponential k(x,x’). In general, however, regardless of the m(x)
    and k(x,x’) functions, the model estimates quite well the daily actual evapotranspiration
    (NSE > 0.83). Therefore, for the other variables’ combinations and in all the
    other fields, the suitability of the ML model was tested using the best m(x),
    and, k(x,x’) functions, that is zero mean function, and an exponential kernel
    covariance functions, respectively. For the other combinations of the input variables
    (see combinations 2÷5 in Table 2), Fig. 7 shows the scatterplots of measured versus
    estimated daily ETa by implementing in the GPR model the best m(x) and k(x,x’)
    functions; the estimated values are in better agreement with the measured ones
    in fall and winter days (blue and red dots). In spring and summer days (yellow,
    green, and cyan dots), the dispersion increases for values higher than about 2.5 mm
    d-1. For the citrus orchard, Table 5 summarizes the statistical indicators associated
    with the GPR model implemented with the best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions and the
    five input variables’ combinations. As can be observed, whatever is the variable
    combination there is always an underestimation of actual evapotranspiration with
    slopes of the regression lines declining from 0.97 to 0.95 as the number of variables
    decreases. The RMSE and MAE values increase from 0.43 mm d-1 to 0.55 mm d-1 and
    from 0.31 mm d-1 to 0.42 mm d-1, respectively. As well as, the R2 and NSE values
    decrease from 0.84 to 0.74, for both the statistical indicators. Download : Download

    variable combination, involving the measured soil water content SWC (combination
    2) resulted in a better model performance than including the two vegetation indices
    (combination 3), as demonstrated by the lower RMSE and MAE and the higher R2,
    b and NSE values. The possibility to include measurements of SWC among the input
    variables to improve the estimations of actual evapotranspiration was also indicated
    by Granata (2019). On the other hand, also the introduction of the VIs improved
    the model performances, as shown by Carter and Liang (2019) and Mosre and Suárez
    (2021). The worst performances were associated with combination 5, in which all
    the input variables are detected from information freely available online. However,
    even if compared to the others, the statistical parameters evidenced that the
    joint use of reanalysis and remote sensing data can still be considered acceptable
    for practical applications related to irrigation management, considering that
    all the required input data can be downloaded from the web, avoiding costly and
    time-consuming field measurements in areas where ground data are not available.
    According to Faramiñán et al. (2021) and Kang et al. (2019) the use of reanalysis
    and remoted sensed data could be a good alternative to retrieve ETa with ML techniques.
    Similar good results were obtained when considering the daily actual evapotranspiration
    data collected in the olive orchard. Even if the available database did not include
    measurements of SWC, it permitted a further validation of the proposed ML algorithm
    by considering only the three variable combinations including the weather data
    and VIs. Fig. 8 shows the scatterplots between measured and estimated ETa by assuming
    a zero mean function and an exponential kernel covariance function and the three
    combinations of the input variables. The estimated values are in better agreement
    with the measured ones in fall and winter days (blue and red dots). The dispersion
    increases for values higher than about 3 mm d-1. The statistical indicators associated
    with the three different variable combinations are summarized in Table 6. As can
    be observed, combinations 3 and 5 are characterized by quite similar results.
    This result is a consequence of the good performance of the ERA5-L in depicting
    the agrometeorological data measured on the ground nearby the olive orchard (Vanella
    et al., 2022). Slightly worse results were associated with combination 4 in which
    only measured weather data were used as input of the model. Download : Download

    involves the American and Canadian sites, located in different climate zones,
    returns good performances. The approach was tested using only remote sensed data
    (combination 5). Fig. 9 shows the scatterplots between measured and estimated
    ETa of daily actual evapotranspiration by assuming a zero mean function and an
    exponential kernel covariance function and the fifth combination of the input
    variables for each field. As can be noticed, the points are distributed differently
    according to the different climate classifications. As shown in Table 7, the RMSE
    values are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the other climatic zones.
    The values are always lower than 0.57 mm d-1. Finally, the NSE values ranging
    from 0.70 to 0.87 confirm the model''s possibility to estimate actual evapotranspiration
    values. Download : Download high-res image (372KB) Download : Download full-size

    the seasonal performances of the method, considering the best m(x) and k(x,x ´ ),
    the NSE values were also evaluated by splitting the database in two. The division
    was done considering the cold seasons, fall and winter days, and the warm seasons,
    spring and summer days. The first included DOYs from 1 to 92 and from 275 to 366;
    the second from 93 to 274. The results, shown in Table 8, demonstrated that the
    model performances are better, in many cases, during the warm seasons than in
    the cold season. For two sites, US_ARM and US_CF1, the results are the best in
    the cold seasons but are also good in the others. For the warm seasons, these
    values are encouraging because these could permit good performance in the irrigation
    water management. Table 8. Seasonal NSE values. Empty Cell NSE [-] Empty Cell

    this study, the use of the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm to fill
    gaps in the time series of daily actual evapotranspiration was investigated for
    six different sites located in different climates zone. Initially, a detailed
    analysis of the available data, the methodologies, and tools adopted for the estimation
    of ETa and the possible variables on which its value depends was carried out.
    In particular, a comparison between ground and reanalysis databases was made,
    which allowed to evaluate the suitability of reanalysis climate variables when
    ground data are not available. Two different satellites product, with different
    spatial resolutions, were compared, in order to analyze the possibility of use
    VIs, retrieved from images with a lower spatial resolution, when no other products
    are available. Five different combinations of variables were considered to verify
    the suitability of the ML approach when limited input data are available Then,
    the GPR model was tested. Initially, the best combination of mean, m(x), and kernel
    covariance, k(x,x’), functions were identified considering all the input variables
    associated with the climate, soil water status as well as two vegetation indices
    expressive of plant vigor and surface water status in the citrus orchard where
    all the variables were available. Then, four additional variable combinations
    were also explored for the same orchard, to verify the performance of the estimation
    when limiting the number of input variables or considering only input variables
    freely downloadable from the web. Further validation of the proposed ML algorithm
    with the three variable combinations not including SWC was carried out in the
    second experimental field, the olive orchard. Finally, the approach was also applied
    using only remote sensed data for the experimental sites, located in different
    climate zones, in the United States of America and Canada. The goodness of the
    proposed methodology is always confirmed by the quite high NSE index and by the
    low values of RMSE. Therefore, the joint use of agrometeorological and remote
    sensing data with a GPR model can represent an opportunity to estimate missing
    data in the daily ETa time series. Furthermore, in the zone where ground data
    are not available, the use of ERA5-Land agrometeorological archive and VIs retrieved
    from Sentinel-2 images or, in areas characterized by homogeneous soil and land
    use, from MODIS sensors can be considered a valid alternative to fill gaps in
    measured time series of daily actual evapotranspiration. Reliable values of actual
    evapotranspiration obtained using the proposed ML algorithm, allow for the estimation
    of accurate values of crop water requirements to improve water use in agriculture.
    Future studies will assess the performance in ETa estimations associated with
    the introduction, as an input variable, of high-resolution satellite-based soil
    moisture products. Declaration of Competing Interest The author declares that

    This study aimed to predict AD in waterbodies using machine learning (ML). AD
    and physicochemical variables (PVs) data from three rivers monitored via standard

    was assayed using regression metrics. The average pH, EC, TDS, salinity, temperature,

    0.10 ± 0.00 PSU, 17.29 ± 0.21 °C, 80.17 ± 5.09 mg/L, 87.51 ± 5.41 NTU, 8.82 ±
    0.04 mg/L, 4.00 ± 0.10 mg/L, and 3.19 ± 0.03 log CFU/100 mL respectively. While
    the contributions of PVs differed in values, AD predicted value by XGB [3.1792
    (1.1040–4.5828)] and Cubist [3.1736 (1.1012–4.5300)] outshined other algorithms.
    Also, XGB (MSE = 0.0059, RMSE = 0.0770; R2 = 0.9912; MAD = 0.0440) and Cubist
    (MSE = 0.0117, RMSE = 0.1081, R2 = 0.9827; MAD = 0.0437) ranked first and second
    respectively, in predicting AD. Temperature was the most important feature in
    predicting AD and ranked first by 10/18 ML-algorithms accounting for 43.00–83.30%
    mean dropout RMSE loss after 1000 permutations. The two models' partial dependence
    and residual diagnostics sensitivity revealed their efficient AD prognosticating
    accuracies in waterbodies. In conclusion, a fully developed XGB/Cubist/XGB-Cubist
    ensemble/web SAIS app for AD monitoring in waterbodies could be deployed to shorten
    turnaround time in deciding microbiological quality of waterbodies for irrigation

    Open access 29 June 2022 Introduction Acinetobacter species belong to the group
    of aerobic gram-negative bacteria that are non-motile, non-fermentative, catalase
    positive, oxidase negative encapsulated coccobacilli, having a DNA G+C content
    of 39 to 47 mol1,2. Taxonomically, scientists have identified 68 validated species
    in the genus Acinetobacter, with numerous others yet to be delineated into species3,4,5.
    Many Acinetobacter species are found naturally in different environments, including
    soil, water, air, wastewater, fomites, human skin, animals, and even on plants6,7,8.
    Some species can utilise different substrates, such as amino acids, carbohydrates,
    organic acids, and hydrocarbons, while some can secrete industrial enzymes like
    lipase and protease9,10. However, few species are human opportunistic pathogens.
    For instance, Acinetobacter baumannii is a well-known notorious species in hospital
    settings that cause life-threatening infections such as pneumonia, respiratory
    and urinary tract infections, septicaemia, and wound infections, among others,
    especially in immune-compromised patients11,12,13. Acinetobacter species are widely
    spread via the environmental milieu and may alarmingly spread antimicrobial resistance
    genes in the environment14,15. In addition, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
    feed by hospital and municipal wastewater inflows have been reported to contribute
    multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter
    isolates to their effluents receiving waterbodies compared with other sources15,16.
    Discharging WWTP effluents increases the prevalence of Acinetobacter in the receiving
    river waterbodies and promotes antimicrobial resistance and transmission to irrigated
    vegetables15. The transmission of Acinetobacter spp. (especially A. baumannii)—with
    high antimicrobial resistance and case fatality ratio—onto fresh produce has been
    demonstrated and reviewed by Carvalheira et al.17. Acinetobacter species with
    different resistant capabilities ranging from MDR to XDR have been isolated in
    fresh fruits and vegetables (apples, cabbages, melons, cauliflowers, peppers,
    mushrooms, lettuce, cucumbers, bananas, radishes, sweet corn carrots, potatoes,
    peach, pear, strawberry, apple, celery, tomato, and radish) at a density up to
    50–1000 CFU/g18 in Hong Kong19, France20, Nigeria21, Lebanon22, Portugal23 and
    agricultural environment in Algeria24. Furthermore, waterbodies especially rural
    rivers for instance, support recreational use of considerably high levels by people
    incognizant of the inflow/inputs of WWTP effluents and the influx of multidrug-resistant
    pathogens of public health concern including Acinetobacter25. The routine experimental
    determination and identification of Acinetobacter species and other bacteria in
    all matrices (water, food, and clinical samples, etc.) using most probable number,
    direct plate count, adenosine triphosphate testing, and membrane filtration methods
    are usually laborious, repetitive, time-consuming (incubation period), and cost-intensive
    endeavours that required expert knowledge which might not be readily available
    in most settings. Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid, reliable, and
    cost-effective means that required no or low technical know-how to assess Acinetobacter
    density (AD) in waterbodies and other matrices to ensure short turnaround time
    necessary to make informed microbiological quality decisions. It is hypothesized
    that AD in waterbodies could be predicted accurately and dependably by using machine
    learning intelligence frameworks that depend upon the dynamic’s relationship between
    AD based on the afore determination methods and physicochemical variables of waterbody
    and other matrices in a low-cost and time-effective way. Thus, an artificial intelligence
    system for AD determination in waterbodies receiving WWTP effluents, which are
    subsequently used as irrigation source waters (ISW), would be an invaluable preventive
    option for immediate and future public health challenges. The main merits of ML
    models lie in their capacity to overcome problems associated with traditional
    statistical models in capturing and predicting multidimensional interactions in
    large data by “learning” deep patterns26. ML frameworks and SAIS allow proactive
    management of events rather than reactive. Thus, MLs and SAIS are finding increasing
    applications in many sectors, including medicine, precision farming, environmental
    management, water purification, Vibrio abundance on microplastics, wastewater
    treatment, watershed typologies and stormwater quality and epidemiology prediction26,27,28,29,30
    and the application is endlessly expanding daily. Therefore, the present study
    aimed at predicting/determining AD in waterbodies (receiving hospital, municipal
    and WWTP effluents) using ML without the repetitive, laborious, cost-intensive,
    and time-consuming laboratory routines to reduce the turnaround time essential
    to make informed microbiological quality decisions (e.g., for irrigation use and
    other purposes). Materials and methods Sample collection and in-situ determination
    of physicochemical data Water samples were collected using grab sampling technique
    from the Great Fish River, Keiskamma River and Thyume River, serving as receiving
    waterbodies for municipal and hospital wastewater effluents (MHWE) discharge at
    one or more points along their courses in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.
    At least, five strategic sampling locations based on socioeconomic importance
    (e.g., fishing, swimming, nearness to wastewater treatment plants, farming, pasture,
    irrigation, dam etc.) of each river were selected for sample collection. At the
    sampling sites, water temperature (TEMP), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical
    conductivity (EC), salinity (SAL), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were determined in-situ
    using a standard multi-parameter device (Hanna, model HI 9828) instrumental protocol.
    In addition, the rivers’ turbidity (TBS) was assessed using a turbidimeter (HACH,
    model 2100P). For microbiological analysis and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
    measurement, midstream water samples (25–30 cm depth) were collected at the same
    sampling sites in three replicates into sterile glass and amber bottles, respectively
    and stored in iceboxes and transported to the laboratory for analysis with 6 h
    of collection31. After five days of incubation of samples in amber bottles, the
    BOD of the samples was determined using a biochemical oxygen demand meter (HACH,
    HQ 40 days)31. Detailed sampling strategy, sampling points’ description, and study
    area maps were as described in our previous study32. Acinetobacter data acquisition
    The density of Acinetobacter species in the water samples was estimated via membrane
    filtration31. Briefly, 100 ml of serially diluted water samples were filtered
    in three independent iterations using a Ø47 mm 0.45 μm pore-sized cellulose membrane31.
    These membranes were aseptically placed onto freshly prepared Acinetobacter CHROMagar
    plates containing selective supplements (CHROMagar, Paris, France) per the manufacturer’s
    instruction. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. All Acinetobacter colonies
    presented as red colouration on CHROMagar plates post-incubation was counted and
    log transformed (log CFU/100 mL). All isolates were purified, validated as oxidase
    negative, and assessed by Acinetobacter-specific polymerase chain reaction. Fifty
    per cent (50%) of glycerol stocks of the pure culture was prepared and stored
    at – 80 °C. Model development Pre-processing and modelling procedure The datasets
    were first subjected to explanatory and bivariate Pearson''s correlation (r) [Eq.
    (1)] analyses. The estimation of 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the r-value
    in bivariate correlation analysis was based on Fisher''s r-to-z transformation
    with bias adjustment [Eq. (2)]. To avoid multicollinearity, where the r-value
    between two variables ≥ 0.99, one of them was dropped randomly in subsequent models
    (see Table 2). Any of the two variables can be used in the implementation of the
    models. Also, for models’ implementation, the datasets were centre scaled such
    that the mean = 0 and the square root of the variance = 1 for variables. The dataset
    for DTR was not scaled. $$r=\\sum_{i=1}^{h}({u}_{i}-\\overline{u })({w}_{i}-\\overline{w
    })/\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{h}{({u}_{i}-\\overline{u })}^{2}}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(w}_{i}-\\overline{w
    })}^{2}} $$ (1) $$z=\\mathrm{arctanh}\\left(r\\right)= 1/2\\mathrm{log}((1+r)/(1-r))$$
    (2) where r is a Pearson’s correlation coefficient with possible values from − 1
    to 1 inclusive. Here, u and w represent a pair of PVs and h is the sample size.
    Acinetobacter density (AD) was modelled as a dependent variable of the rivers’
    physicochemical variables (PVs). Hence, the conditional expected (CE) AD value
    at instances of PVs consisting of a vector of TEMP, DO, BOD, TSS, SAL, and pH
    is derived as \\({\\mathrm{CE}}_{AD|PVs}(AD)\\). Thus, the estimation of the mean
    AD can be constructed as Eq. (3). $${\\mathrm{CE}}_{AD|PVs}(AD)\\approx f\\left(PVs\\right).$$
    (3) Equation (1) was implemented via 18 regression ML algorithms that have the
    robust capability to fit multidimensional variables of ordinal/continuous outcome,
    including linear regression with stepwise selection (LRSS), an RF, XGB, SVR, linear
    regression (LR), a gradient boosted machine (GBM), neural network (NNT) (6–6–1
    network with 49 weights multiple; decay = 0.1), a KNN (k-nearest neighbour), M5P,
    a boosted regression tree (BRT), a Cubist regression, a decision tree (DTR), multivariate
    adaptive regression splines (MARS), ANN [with one 6-node hidden layers (ANN6),
    extreme learning machine (ELM), two 4- and 2- node hidden layers (ANN42), and
    two 3- and 3-node hidden layers (ANN33), and elastic net (ENR)]. The dataset (540
    observations, 6 variables after explanatory feature selection) was split into
    a learning subset (70%) for the estimate of models’ coefficients and a validation
    subset (30%) for model substantiation. In all the ML implementations of Eq. (1),
    ten different learning-validation dataset pairs were generated via tenfold cross-validation
    accompanied by 3 repeats and 10 tune-lengths. Optimal hyper-parameters were derived
    and selected through a grid search algorithm. Models’ hyper-parameters are provided
    in detail in the supplemental material. Detailed discussion on the strengths and
    weaknesses and previous application of the various algorithms could be found elsewhere
    and their documentation. The explanatory rendition of all variables contributions
    in the models was according to Eq. (4): $$f\\left(w.\\right)= {t}_{0} +\\sum_{j=1}^{p}t\\left(j,w.\\right),$$
    (4) where t(j, w.) denotes the jth variable contribution measure to the model’s
    prediction at instance w and t0 is the average model prediction33. Assessment
    of ML model’s performance The MLI algorithms model’s performance was determined
    against experimental data based on Eqs. (5)–(8): $$\\mathrm{Mean \\, squared}-\\mathrm{error}:
    MSE\\left(f,\\underline{U}, \\underline{w}\\right)=\\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{i}^{h}{\\left({\\widehat{w}}_{i}-{w}_{i}\\right)}^{2}=
    \\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{1}^{h}{r}_{i}^{2}$$ (5) $$\\mathrm{Root}-\\mathrm{mean}-\\mathrm{squared
    \\, error}: RMSE\\left(f,\\underline{U}, \\underline{w}\\right)= \\sqrt{MSE\\left(f,\\underline{U},
    \\underline{w}\\right)}$$ (6) $${R}^{2}\\left(f,\\underline{U}, \\underline{w}\\right)=1-
    \\frac{MSE\\left(f,\\underline{U}, \\underline{w}\\right)}{MSE\\left({f}_{0},\\underline{U},
    \\underline{w}\\right)}$$ (7) $$\\mathrm{Median \\, absolute \\, deviation}: MAD\\left(f,U,
    \\underline{w}\\right)=median\\left(\\left|{r}_{1}\\right|, \\ldots , \\left|{r}_{n}\\right|\\right).$$
    (8) where h = number of the sample; f0(): baseline model; ri: residual for the
    ith observation, U: matrix of PVs; \\(\\underline{w}\\): vector of AD; \\(f\\left(\\widehat{\\underline{\\theta
    }},\\underline{U}\\right):\\) model based on the training dataset; \\(\\widehat{\\underline{\\theta
    }}:\\) estimated values of the model’s coefficients; and \\({\\widehat{\\underline{w}}}_{i}:\\)
    model’s prediction equivalent to \\({\\mathrm{w}}_{i}\\). RMSE was further employed
    in assessing mean dropout loss for variable importance following 1000 permutation34,35.
    Models’ sensitivity analysis Residual diagnostics and partial-dependence profiles
    of PVs on the predicted AD was generated to assess the model’s sensitivity. The
    partial-dependence profile of a model f() (i.e., anticipated/predicted AD value
    at an instance by the model) and the outcome variable Uj set at s (over the empirical/marginal
    distribution of U-j (h), i.e., the collective distribution of all other PVs without
    Uj ) is created according to Eqs. (9) and (10): $${q}_{P}^{j}\\left(\\mathrm{s}\\right)={E}_{{\\underline{X}}^{-j}}\\left\\{f\\left({U}^{j|=s}\\right)\\right\\}.$$
    (9) $${\\widehat{q}}_{P}^{j}\\left(\\mathrm{s}\\right)=\\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{i=1}^{h}f\\left({\\underline{u}}_{i}^{j|=s}\\right).$$
    (10) The implementation of all models was achieved in R v.4.1.2 software. Results
    A descriptive summary of the physicochemical variables and Acinetobacter density
    of the waterbodies is presented in Table 1. The mean pH, EC, TDS, and SAL of the
    waterbodies was 7.76 ± 0.02, 218.66 ± 4.76 µS/cm, 110.53 ± 2.36 mg/L, and 0.10 ± 0.00
    PSU, respectively. While the average TEMP, TSS, TBS, and DO of the rivers was
    17.29 ± 0.21 °C, 80.17 ± 5.09 mg/L, 87.51 ± 5.41 NTU, and 8.82 ± 0.04 mg/L, respectively,
    the corresponding DO5, BOD, and AD was 4.82 ± 0.11 mg/L, 4.00 ± 0.10 mg/L, and
    3.19 ± 0.03 log CFU/100 mL respectively. Table 1 Descriptive statistics of the
    physicochemical variables and Acinetobacter density of the waterbodies. Full size
    table The bivariate correlation between paired PVs varied significantly from very
    weak to perfect/very strong positive or negative correlation (Table 2). In the
    same manner, the correlation between various PVs and AD varies. For instance,
    negligible but positive very weak correlation exist between AD and pH (r = 0.03,
    p = 0.422), and SAL (r = 0.06, p = 0.184) as well as very weak inverse (negative)
    correlation between AD and TDS (r = − 0.05, p = 0.243) and EC (r = − 0.04, p = 0.339).
    A significantly positive but weak correlation occurs between AD and BOD (r = 0.26,
    p = 4.21E−10), and TSS (r = 0.26, p = 1.09E−09), and TBS (r = 0.26, 1.71E-09)
    whereas, AD had a weak inverse correlation with DO5 (r = − 0.39, p = 1.31E−21).
    While there was a moderate positive correlation between TEMP and AD (r = 0.43,
    p = 3.19E−26), a moderate but inverse correlation occurred between AD and DO (r = −
    0.46, 1.26E−29). Table 2 Bivariate correlational relationship among physicochemical
    variables and Acinetobacter density in waterbodies receiving municipal and hospital
    wastewater effluents. Full size table Model predicted AD and explanatory contribution
    of PVs The predicted AD by the 18 ML regression models varied both in average
    value and coverage (range) as shown in Fig. 1. The average predicted AD ranged
    from 0.0056 log units by M5P to 3.2112 log unit by SVR. The average AD prediction
    declined from SVR [3.2112 (1.4646–4.4399)], DTR [3.1842 (2.2312–4.3036)], ENR
    [3.1842 (2.1233–4.8208)], NNT [3.1836 (1.1399–4.2936)], BRT [3.1833 (1.6890–4.3103)],
    RF [3.1795 (1.3563–4.4514)], XGB [3.1792 (1.1040–4.5828)], MARS [3.1790 (1.1901–4.5000)],
    LR [3.1786 (2.1895–4.7951)], LRSS [3.1786 (2.1622–4.7911)], GBM [3.1738 (1.4328–4.3036)],
    Cubist [3.1736 (1.1012–4.5300)], ELM [3.1714 (2.2236–4.9017)], KNN [3.1657 (1.4988–4.5001)],
    ANET6 [0.6077 (0.0419–1.1504)], ANET33 [0.6077 (0.0950–0.8568)], ANET42 [0.6077
    (0.0692–0.8568)], and M5P [0.0056 (− 0.6024–0.6916)]. However, in term of range
    coverage XGB [3.1792 (1.1040–4.5828)] and Cubist [3.1736 (1.1012–4.5300)] outshined
    other models because those models overestimated and underestimated AD at lower
    and higher values respectively when compared with raw data [3.1865 (1–4.5611)].
    Figure 1 Comparison of ML model-predicted AD in the waterbodies. RAW raw/empirical
    AD value. Full size image Figure 2 represents the explanatory contributions of
    PVs to AD prediction by the models. The subplot A-R gives the absolute magnitude
    (representing parameter importance) by which a PV instance changes AD prediction
    by each model from its mean value presented in the vertical axis. In LR, an absolute
    change from the mean value of pH, BOD, TSS, DO, SAL, and TEMP corresponded to
    an absolute change of 0.143, 0.108, 0.069, 0.0045, 0.04, and 0.004 units in the
    LR’s AD prediction response/value. Also, an absolute response flux of 0.135, 0.116,
    0.069, 0.057, 0.043, and 0.0001 in AD prediction value was attributed to pH, BOD,
    TSS, DO. SAL, and TEMP changes, respectively, by LRSS. Similarly, absolute change
    in DO, BOD, TEMP, TSS, pH, and SAL would achieve 0.155, 0.061. 0.099, 0.144, and
    0.297 AD prediction response changes by KNN. In addition, the most contributed
    or important PV whose change largely influenced AD prediction response was TEMP
    (decreases or decreases the responses up to 0.218) in RF. Summarily, AD prediction
    response changes were highest and most significantly influenced by BOD (0.209),
    pH (0.332), TSS (0.265), TEMP (0.6), TSS (0.233), SAL (0.198), BOD (0.127), BOD
    (0.11), DO (0.028), pH (0.114), pH (0.14), SAL(0.91), and pH (0.427) in XGB, BTR,
    NNT, DTR, SVR, M5P, ENR, ANET33, ANNET64, ANNET6, ELM, MARS, and Cubist, respectively.
    Figure 2 PV-specific contribution to eighteen ML models forecasting capability
    of AD in MHWE receiving waterbodies. The average baseline value of PV in the ML
    is presented on the y-axis. The green/red bars represent the absolute value of
    each PV contribution in predicting AD. Full size image Table 4 presents the eighteen
    regression algorithms’ performance predicting AD given the waterbodies PVs. In
    terms of MSE, RMSE, and R2, XGB (MSE = 0.0059, RMSE = 0.0770; R2 = 0.9912) and
    Cubist (MSE = 0.0117, RMSE = 0.1081, R2 = 0.9827) ranked first and second respectively,
    to outmatched other models in predicting AD. While MSE and RMSE metrics ranked
    ANET6 (MSE = 0.0172, RMSE = 0.1310), ANRT42 (MSE = 0.0220, RMSE = 0.1483), ANET33
    (MSE = 0.0253, RMSE = 0.1590), M5P (MSE = 0.0275, RMSE = 0.1657), and RF (MSE = 0.0282,
    RMSE = 0.1679) in the 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 position among the MLs in predicting AD,
    M5P (R2 = 0.9589 and RF (R2 = 0.9584) recorded better performance in term of R-squared
    metric and ANET6 (MAD = 0.0856) and M5P (MAD = 0.0863) in term of MAD metric among
    the 5 models. But Cubist (MAD = 0.0437) XGB (MAD = 0.0440) in term of MAD metric.
    The feature importance of each PV over permutational resampling on the predictive
    capability of the ML models in predicting AD in the waterbodies is presented in
    Table 3 and Fig. S1. The identified important variables ranked differently from
    one model to another, with temperature ranking in the first position by 10/18
    of the models. In the 10 algorithms/models, the temperature was responsible for
    the highest mean RMSE dropout loss, with temperature in RF, XGB, Cubist, BRT,
    and NNT accounting for 0.4222 (45.90%), 0.4588 (43.00%), 0.5294 (50.82%), 0.3044
    (44.87%), and 0.2424 (68.77%) respectively, while 0.1143 (82.31%),0.1384 (83.30%),
    0.1059 (57.00%), 0.4656 (50.58%), and 0.2682 (57.58%) RMSE dropout loss was attributed
    to temperature in ANET42, ANET10, ELM, M5P, and DTR respectively. Temperature
    also ranked second in 2/18 models, including ANET33 (0.0559, 45.86%) and GBM (0.0793,
    21.84%). BOD was another important variable in forecasting AD in the waterbodies
    and ranked first in 3/18 and second in 8/18 models. While BOD ranked as the first
    important variable in AD prediction in MARS (0.9343, 182.96%), LR (0.0584, 27.42%),
    and GBM (0.0812, 22.35%), it ranked second in KNN (0.2660, 42.69%), XGB (0.4119,
    38.60); BRT (0.2206, 32.51%), ELM (0.0430, 23.17%), SVR (0.1869, 35.77%), DTR
    (0.1636, 35.13%), ENR (0.0469, 21.84%) and LRSS (0.0669, 31.65%). SAL rank first
    in 2/18 (KNN: 0.2799; ANET33: 0.0633) and second in 3/18 (Cubist: 0.3795; ANET42:
    0.0946; ANET10: 0.1359) of the models. DO ranked first in 2/18 (ENR [0.0562; 26.19%]
    and LRSS [0.0899; 42.51%]) and second in 3/18 (RF [0.3240, 35.23%], M5P [0.3704,
    40.23%], LR [0.0584, 27.41%]) of the models. Table 3 Feature importance of PVs
    over 100 permutational resampling on AD prediction. Full size table Figure 3 shows
    the residual diagnostics plots of the models comparing actual AD and forecasted
    AD values by the models. The observed results showed that actual AD and predicted
    AD value in the case of LR (A), LRSS (B), KNN (C), BRT 9F), GBM (G), NNT (H),
    DTR (I), SVR (J), ENR (L), ANET33 (M), ANER64 (N), ANET6 (O), ELM (P) and MARS
    (Q) skewed, and the smoothed trend did not overlap. However, actual AD and predicted
    AD values experienced more alignment and an approximately overlapped smoothed
    trend was seen in RF (D), XGB (E), M5P (K), and Cubist (R). Among the models,
    RF (D) and M5P (K) both overestimated and underestimated predicted AD at lower
    and higher values, respectively. Whereas XGB and Cubist both overestimated AD
    value at lower value with XGB closer to the smoothed trend that Cubist. Generally,
    a smoothed trend overlapping the gradient line is desirable as it shows that a
    model fits all values accurately/precisely. Figure 3 Comparison between actual
    and predicted AD by the eighteen ML models. Full size image The comparison of
    the partial-dependence profiles of PVs on AD prediction by the 18 modes using
    a unitary model by PVs presentation for clarity is shown in Figs. S2–S7. The partial-dependence
    profiles existed in i. a form where an average increase in AD prediction accompanied
    a PV increase (upwards trend), (ii) inverse trend, where an increase in a PV resulted
    in a decline AD prediction, (iii) horizontal trend, where increase/decrease in
    a PV yielded no effects on AD prediction, and (iv) a mixed trend, where the shape
    switch between 2 or more of i–iii. The models'' response varied with a change
    in any of the PV, especially changes beyond the breakpoints that could decrease
    or increase AD prediction response. The partial-dependence profile (PDP) of DO
    for models has a downtrend either from the start or after a breakpoint(s) of nature
    ii and iv, except for ELM which had an upward trend (i, Fig. S2). TEMP PDP had
    an upward trend (i and iv) and, in most cases filled with one or more breakpoints
    but had a horizontal trend in LRSS (Fig. S3). SAL had a PDP of a typical downward
    trend (ii and iv) across all the models (Fig. S4). While pH displayed a typical
    downtrend PDP in LR, LRSS, NNT, ENR, ANN6, a downtrend filled with different breakpoint(s)
    was seen in RF, M5P, and SVR; other models showed a typical upward trend (i and
    iv) filled with breakpoint(s) (Fig. S5). The PDP of TSS showed an upward trend
    that returned to a plateau (DTR, ANN33, M5P, GBM, RF, XFB, BRT), after a final
    breakpoint or a declining trend (ANNT6, SVR; Fig. S6). The BOD PDP generally had
    an upward trend filled with breakpoint(s) in most models (Fig. S7). Discussion
    The present investigation studied the invaluableness of MLs in determining AD
    in waterbodies to shorten the turnaround time involved in routine determination
    of the emerging pathogen with significant public health priority and high case-fatality
    ratio. Jiang et al. previously demonstrated that ML models predicted and offered
    cost-effective risk assessment options for Vibrio spp. relative abundances on
    microplastics in the estuarine milieu based on easy-to-measure environmental variables30.
    Characteristics of the waterbodies The pH of the waterbodies (5.05–9.11) did not
    satisfied South African water guidelines for irrigation purposes and recreational
    use of a pH range of 6.5–8.4 and 6.5–8.5, respectively36 but the average pH (7.76 ± 0.02)
    of the waterbodies met the FAO criteria37. In relation to the pathogen, Acinetobacter
    spp. are known to possess and survive under a wide pH (5–10) and temperature (−
    20 to 44 °C) range with an optimal long-term survival temperature of 4–22 °C no
    matter nutrient availability38. The observed EC (47.00–561.00 µS/cm) of the waterbodies
    generally satisfied the WHO guidelines for 2500 μS/cm in surface waters39, and
    the mean (218.66 ± 4.76 μS/cm) was in accepted limits of 400 µS/cm and 700 to
    3000 µS/cm WHO and FAO standard for irrigation water37. The EC of the waterbodies
    also fell in the categories of Class I (excellent: ≤ 250 µS/cm) and Class II (good:
    250–750 µS/cm) irrigation water EC limits classification40. The EC concentrations
    of the waterbodies will generally impact fishing negatively, as an EC range of
    0.15–0.50 μS/cm are necessary to support fisheries according to the USEPA (United
    States Environmental Protection Agency)41. TDS summed up organic and inorganic
    substances in the waterbodies but generally did not exceed the WHO’s maximum permissible
    limit of 1000 mg/L TDS in drinking water39. The TDS (23.00–279.00 mg/L) of the
    waterbodies followed the World Health Organization standard of a TDS < 300 mg/L
    (excellent) and its average (110.53 ± 2.36 mg/L) does not exceed the USEPA and
    WHO limit for drinking water (500 mg/L)41,42. However, the TBS average values
    of the waterbodies exceeded the WHO guideline of 5 NTU39. Higher EC, TDS, and
    TBS in surface waters are generally attributed to wastewater and anthropogenic
    activities inputs43. Also, high levels of EC, TDS and TBS are known to impair
    visibility, cleanliness, safety, aesthetics, and recreational use of river waters44.
    The mean TSS (80.17 ± 5.09 mg/L) of the waterbodies exceeded the WHO (2006) wastewater
    discharge limit of 60 mg/L and exceeded the Australia and New Zealand (2000) guideline
    limits (TSS < 0.03 mg/L) of water quality for aquaculture45,46. In addition, the
    average BOD level (4.00 ± 0.10 mg/L) of the waterbodies complied with the tolerance
    limit of 5 mg/L in surface waters for aquatic life47. Higher level of BOD in waterbodies
    depletes DO available for aquatic organisms48 and generally have negative impacts
    on fishing and fish harvest. The average AD (3.19 ± 0.03 log CFU/100 mL) obtained
    in this study is comparable to AD reported from waterbody impacted by hospital
    wastewater, WWTP, informal settlements, and veterinary clinics effluents along
    Umhlangane River course in Durban South Africa49. The observed DO (8.82 ± 0.04
    mg/L) and BOD (4.00 ± 0.10 mg/L) both suggested the facultative aerophilic characteristics
    of Acinetobacter and a relatively high nutrient composition of the rivers’ probable
    from wastewater effluents. The average EC in the waterbodies was 218.66 ± 4.76
    µS/cm. This shows high level of organic carbon (DOC) in the rivers. EC is an indirect
    indicator of DOC25,50,51 and found to have associations with Acinetobacter-specific
    ARG and other ARG abundance25,52,53. Generally, A. baumannii in the environment
    can survive irrespective of the level of DO54. The finding from this study revealed
    that AD negligible—positive but very weak—correlated with pH (r = 0.03), and SAL
    (r = 0.06) and—negatively—with TDS (r = − 0.05) and EC (r = − 0.04) (Table 2).
    These results can be attributed to the ability of the Acinetobacter to survive
    under a wide range of harsh environmental conditions. A significantly positive
    correlation between AD and BOD (r = 0.26), TSS (r = 0.26), and TBS (r = 0.26)
    indicated a considerable increase AD with an increase in nutrient and DOC pollution
    in aquatic environments (Fig. S7). Also, findings showed a moderate positive correlation
    between TEMP and AD (r = 0.43), suggesting that AD improves in abundance with
    an increase in temperature38 to specific breakpoints. AD moderately and inversely
    correlated with DO (r = − 0.46), indicating that Acinetobacter abundance increases
    with an anaerobic condition or low oxygen level. Model predicted AD and explanatory
    contribution of PVs The predicted AD average and range values by the 18 ML models
    differed. The present study''s findings suggested that both lower/upper bound
    and the general trend characteristic of the prediction is far more important than
    the average prediction only. Most algorithms had higher average predictions but
    overestimated or underestimated AD values at lower and upper bounds, respectively.
    Thus, algorithms other than XGB and Cubist are not suitable for predicting AD
    in waterbodies. Whereas the performance of most ML algorithms, such as RF, DTR,
    and MARS43,55, has been praised in terms of average predictions and regression
    metrics, most studies neglect consideration of the lower/upper bound and the general
    trend characteristic of their predictions—which are far significant when dealing
    with infectious organisms/poison that might have low infectivity dose/potent at
    a very low concentration. Several researchers also reported the superiority of
    XGB against several ML algorithms in predictive performance in terms of average
    prediction, and sensitivity43,55. Although a previous study showed that RF models
    achieved higher level of accuracy than XGB, SVR, and ENR in predicting the Vibrio
    spp. relative abundance on microplastics, the actual trend characteristics including
    the lower/upper bounds were not reported30. The difference in the models’ trend
    coverage and boundary characteristics in AD predictions are attributable to the
    capability of the models to capture the complex interactions of co-occurrence
    levels/changes in different environmental variables at different degrees or concentrations.
    The performance of Cubist [3.1736 (1.1012–4.5300)] was also found to be comparable
    to XGB [3.1792 (1.1040–4.5828)] in term of trend and boundaries characteristics
    as both models outshined other models. A typical problem with most algorithms
    observed in this study was over-estimation and underestimation of AD at lower
    and higher concentrations, respectively. These limitations suggested that the
    models could raise false alarm of high risk at lower AD as well as undermine higher
    risk at higher concentrations of AD. An indication that those models could not
    capture the nonlinear complex relationships between AD, PVs, and underlying anthropogenic
    inputs. Nevertheless, the absolute contributions of individual PV change to models’
    prediction of AD from their models attributed mean values varied (Fig. 2). The
    behaviours could be interpreted in term of the complex interactions among the
    PVs coupled with the prevailing anthropogenic fluxes in the waterbodies. Several
    PVs undergo fluctuations co-concurrently unlike behaviours in models in which
    other PVs are held constant to assess a particular PV’s effects on the outcome
    variable (AD). These interactions are capture to some great degrees by the algorithms
    leading to differences in the ranking of PVs contributions to AD predictions by
    the algorithms. Also, intrinsic characteristics of the distinct algorithms and
    data noise are major causes of differences in observed contributions of variables
    in ML models30. Considering the overall performance of 18 AI-based models assayed
    in this study using four metrics, XGB (MSE = 0.0059, RMSE = 0.0770; R2 = 0.9912;
    MAD = 0.0440) and Cubist (MSE = 0.0117, RMSE = 0.1081, R2 = 0.9827; MAD = 0.0437)
    were the best models ranking in first and second position respectively, to outshined
    others in AD prediction in waterbodies (Table 4). XGB has reputation of been the
    best performer ML algorithms in most microbiological regression studies compared
    with others30. Cubist has been demonstrated to outperformed partial least squares,
    RF, and MARS in predicting soil property including soil total nitrogen, organic
    carbon, total sulphur, exchangeable calcium clay; sand, and cation exchange capacity,
    and pH and RF, classification, and regression trees, SVM, and KNN predicting NH4–N
    and COD in subsurface constructed wetlands effluents56,57. In forecasting daily
    dissemination of COVID-19 vaccination, Cubist outperformed ENR, Gaussian Process,
    Slab (SPIKES), and Spikes ML algorithms58. Also, Cubist has been shown to outmatched
    XGB in predicting left ventricular pressures, volumes, and stresses59. An ensemble
    of XGB and Cubist could be further exploited for a better performance in forecasting
    AD in waterbodies. However, ANN (R2 = 0.953) was demonstrated to show a superior
    predictive coefficient over Cubist model (R2 = 0.946) and LR (R2 = 0.481) when
    assaying faecal coliform content in treated wastewater for reuse purposes60. Generally,
    while XGB involved ensemble of trees that capture multidimensional interactions/relationships,
    Cubist combined the strengths of both linear regression equations and a committee
    tree-based structural nodes for capture effectively linear and nonlinear multidimensional
    relationships among variables and outcome event56. The results show that ANET6,
    ANRT42, ANET33, M5P, and RF had MSE and RMSE that placed them in the 3, 4, 5,
    6, and 7 position among the MLs in predicting AD, their performances are to be
    avoided for practical forecast of AD for preventive purposes. Table 4 Predictive
    performance of eighteen regression algorithms in predicting AD in the waterbodies.
    Full size table Feature importance of PVs in predicting AD TEMP was the most important
    PV in predicting AD in the waterbodies and ranked by 10/18 ML-algorithms including
    RF, XGB, Cubist, BRT, and NNT accounting 45.90%, 43.00%, 50.82%, 44.87%, and 68.77%
    in respective models, as well as 82.31%, 83.30%, 57.00%, 50.58%, and 57.58% RMSE
    dropout loss in ANET42, ANET10, ELM, M5P, and DTR respectively. The observed results
    can be explained in term of the direct and indirect influence TEMP had on other
    PVs and AD in the waterbodies. DO decreases with increase temperature, favoured
    facultative aerobic lifestyle of Acinetobacter. Also, temperature increase decomposition
    of organic matters in waterbodies, thereby leading to high BOD contents providing
    more nutrients for AD and other microbial lives. Resultant increase in DOC in
    waterbodies is an indirect indicator of EC25,50,51 and found to have associations
    with Acinetobacter-specific ARG abundance in waterbodies25,52,53. BOD was another
    significant feature identified in forecasting AD in the waterbodies and ranked
    first in 3/18 [MARS (182.96%), LR (27.42%), and GBM (22.35%)] and second in 8/18
    models [KNN (42.69%), XGB (38.60%); BRT (32.51%), ELM (23.17%), SVR (35.77%),
    DTR (35.13%), ENR (21.84%) and LRSS (31.65%)]. BOD is a measure of nutrient pollution
    from anthropogenic inputs such as wastewater effluents, agricultural activities,
    and environmental events such as rainwater runoffs among others. BOD also influence
    EC, TDS, and TBS in surface waters43 Whereas SAL was identified as first important
    feature in in 2/18 (KNN, ANET33) and second in 3/18 (Cubist, ANET42, ANET6) models,
    Acinetobacter can only survive relatively high SAL without improving its population
    density (Fig. S4). Unlike Vibrio spp, whose high density are linked with high
    salinity30 as it promotes genes expression and functional proteins61 and eventual
    vibrio growth and reproduction62, high SAL are not suitable for AD as its inhibitory
    for growth related gene expression. The sensitivity analyses of the 18 ML predictive
    models of AD using the residual diagnostics plots found that LR (A), LRSS (B),
    KNN (C), BRT (F), GBM (G), NNT (H), DTR (I), SVR (J), ENR (L), ANET33 (M), ANER64
    (N), ANET6 (O), ELM (P) and MARS (Q) did not fit the data optimally. This imply
    that the models are not suitable for forecasting AD in waterbodies. Meanwhile
    models such as RF (D), XGB (E), M5P (K), and Cubist (R) fitted the data with more
    alignment and approximately overlapped smoothed trend between the actual and the
    predicted AD values, RF (D) and M5P (K) over-predicted and under-predicted AD
    at lower and higher extremities, respectively. Thus, could be interpreted as forecasting
    exaggerated risk (AD) at probable innocuous level while weakening true risk at
    higher extremity. Such models are not suitable to assess real life events of AD
    in waterbodies. Although both XGB and Cubist predicted AD value slightly higher
    than the actual value at lower extremities, XGB had a closer fit smoothed trend
    than Cubist. Compared to other models assayed in this study, the duo is the best
    and could be applied for AD AI-smart system design for water quality monitoring.
    A stacked model of XGB and Cubist may outmatch and overcome the limitation the
    two models had at the lower extremity of AD value. The overall summary of the
    PDPs of the PVs on AD prediction by the 18 modes (Figs. S2–S7), found that any
    degree of change/flux in a particular PV especially changes beyond its breakpoints
    attracted a corresponding varied response in AD which could decrease or increase
    AD prediction response. The various forms of partial-dependence profiles as explained
    in previous section also showed the direct/indirect/complex interactions between
    a PV and AD coupled with the sensitivity of a model in mapping the relationships.
    Summarily, the increase in AD level (PDP) in most models equivalent to a decline
    trend in DO and SAL especially after its breakpoint(s) excluding ELM where DO
    had upward trend (i; Figs. S2 and S4). These patterns revealed a nonlinear relationship
    between AD and the PVs. A near increase-by-increase relationship exist between
    TEMP and AD in most models coupled with one or more breakpoints. LRSS revealed
    a zero-relationship between AD and TEMP indicating its inability to map the relationship
    between them. Although Acinetobacter has been showed to have a broad pH range,
    a typical downtrend PDP of pH by LR, LRSS, NNT, ENR, ANN6—filled with breakpoint(s)
    in RF, M5P, and SVR while other models showed a typical upward—is informative
    of the weakness of the models as increasing in pH from 5.02 to 10 promotes Acinetobacter
    growth38. AD prediction responses aligned with a general increase in BOD regardless
    of breakpoint(s) in most models revealed important of nutrients for Acinetobacter
    population density in waterbodies. Furthermore, the strengths of this current
    study aside been the first that assessed AD in waterbodies receiving hospital
    and municipal wastewater effluents along their courses, two ML algorithms optimally
    and accurately predict AD, proven to be promising candidates for developing SAIS
    for AD determination and thereby shorten the turnaround time and reduce labour
    involved in experimental approaches. Also, the MLs were able to capture nonlinear
    complex multidimensional interactions between AD and PVs as well as their inherent
    anthropogenic fuels which conventional mathematical models could not robustly
    mapped63. In addition, the MLs are amenable to improvements and can be utilized
    across several water management landscape. However, the shortcoming of the present
    study lies in the lack of spatiotemporal covariates that could improve upon the
    ML models’ predictions as stochastic distributions of waterborne pathogens are
    governed by both spatial extension and temporal duration across depth in water
    columns. Future studies should seek data from a wide range of socioeconomic activities/areas
    as well as include spatiotemporal and geospatial inputs in developing AI-based
    predictive framework for AD determination. Conclusion The present study has proven
    SAIS as an evidence-based strategy to shorten the turnaround time involved in
    assessing AD in waterbodies; thereby minimizing exposure. The best models (XGB/Cubist)
    identified in this study could be developed into standalone SAIS (XGB/Cubist,
    XGB-Cubist ensemble, or web app) or integrated into existing instrumentations
    for PV estimation in waterbodies to enhance timely decision-making of microbiological
    qualities of waterbodies for irrigation and other purposes. The study also unveiled
    temperature and BOD as significant candidates for predicting AD in waterbodies
    in most models. Finally, AD in waterbodies could accurately and reliably predicted
    via AI-based smart systems that rely on waterbody physicochemical variables’ dynamics
    in a low-cost and time-effective manner. Data availability All data generated

  description: Accurate groundwater level (GWL) forecasts are crucial for the efficient
    utilization, strategic long-term planning, and sustainable management of finite
    groundwater resources. These resources have a substantial impact on decisions
    related to irrigation planning, crop selection, and water supply. This study evaluates
    data-driven models using different machine learning algorithms to forecast GWL
    fluctuations for one, two, and three weeks ahead in Bangladesh’s Godagari upazila.
    To address the accuracy limitations inherent in individual forecasting models,
    a Bayesian model averaging (BMA)-based heterogeneous ensemble of forecasting models
    was proposed. The dataset encompasses 1807 weekly GWL readings (February 1984
    to September 2018) from four wells, divided into training (70%), validation (15%),
    and testing (15%) subsets. Both standalone models and ensembles employed a Minimum
    Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) algorithm to select the most influential lag
    times among candidate GWL lags up to 15 weeks. Statistical metrics and visual
    aids were used to evaluate the standalone and ensemble GWL forecasts. The results
    consistently favor the heterogeneous BMA ensemble, excelling over standalone models
    for multi-step ahead forecasts across time horizons. For instance, at GT8134017,
    the BMA approach yielded values like R (0.93), NRMSE (0.09), MAE (0.50 m), IOA
    (0.96), NS (0.87), and a-20 index (0.94) for one-week-ahead forecasts. Despite
    a slight decline in performance with an increasing forecast horizon, evaluation
    indices confirmed the superior BMA ensemble performance. This ensemble also outperformed
    standalone models for other observation wells. Thus, the BMA-based heterogeneous
    ensemble emerges as a promising strategy to bolster multi-step ahead GWL forecasts
    within this area and beyond.

    Bayesian model averaging 1. Introduction Groundwater is a crucial resource of
    water for fulfilling the requirements of different sectors, such as domestic,
    industrial, and agricultural sectors. Unfortunately, the unsustainable extraction
    of groundwater resources has caused a reduction in the availability of this resource,
    leading to a notable disparity between the amount of groundwater available and
    the amount that is required to fulfill the needs. The unsustainable withdrawal
    of groundwater for irrigation practices is causing the annual extraction of groundwater
    beyond its natural replenishment capacity. This highlights the urgent requirement
    for the implementation of sustainable measures to manage groundwater resources.
    Changes in climate, such as alterations in precipitation patterns and temperature,
    can influence the rate at which groundwater is replenished, resulting in a decline
    in groundwater levels (GWL) in aquifers. Moreover, human activities, including
    land use modifications like deforestation and urbanization, can decrease the amount
    of water recharge rates in the groundwater aquifers. In Bangladesh, groundwater
    is a major source of drinking water and it plays a significant role in the agricultural
    sector. However, the overexploitation of groundwater through excessive pumping
    for irrigation purposes has resulted in declining GWLs in multiple regions, causing
    water scarcity and deteriorating water quality [1]. According to a recent study,
    the rate of groundwater depletion in Bangladesh has escalated from 1980 to 2019,
    leading to a significant impact on agricultural productivity and water availability
    [2]. To address these issues, forecasting the accuracy of GWL is essential for
    managing water resources effectively and minimizing the effects of climate change
    on water availability. The use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in GWL forecasting
    has become more frequent as they are capable of processing large amounts of data
    and capturing nonlinear relationships between predictors and response variables.
    On the other hand, obtaining comprehensive knowledge about aquifer processes,
    geometry, and modeling techniques required for physically based numerical simulation
    models can be challenging due to data limitations, especially in developing countries
    like Bangladesh. Therefore, these models usually rely on assumptions and simplifications.
    Physically based numerical simulation models can be affected by significant uncertainties
    and errors in areas with limited monitoring data, mainly due to data scarcity
    and poor quality [3]. Additionally, physically based models may encounter inaccuracies
    in their predictions due to simplifications and assumptions made during the modeling
    process, leading to structural errors [4]. These limitations have prompted researchers
    to seek alternative modeling approaches, such as data-driven modeling, that can
    overcome these issues. On the other hand, ML-based models are commonly considered
    to be a “black box” model because they use algorithms to analyze and identify
    patterns in data without the need for explicit programming instructions. Nevertheless,
    the nonlinear dynamics of aquifer responses can be effectively captured by ML-based
    algorithms, which have emerged as an alternative to physically based models. Unlike
    physically based models, ML algorithms can establish a direct relationship between
    predictors and response variables without requiring an explicit definition of
    physical system parameters. As a result, they have become a valuable tool in groundwater
    management and forecasting. Recent research has emphasized the effectiveness of
    ML algorithms in data-driven modeling approaches for GWL prediction. As an illustration
    of the potential of ML in groundwater prediction and management, Vu et al. [5]
    employed the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to create a data-driven model
    that surpassed a physically based numerical model in its ability to forecast GWLs
    in an arid area. Pham et al. [6] employed ML algorithms to predict GWLs and discovered
    that their data-driven model had a superior performance in comparison to a physically
    based model. This finding aligns with recent research, which has demonstrated
    that data-driven modeling methods can perform equally well or better than physically
    based simulation models in forecasting nonlinear time series data, such as groundwater
    table data [7,8,9]. These investigations emphasize the potential of data-driven
    approaches in addressing the difficulties related to physically based models,
    particularly in developing nations, where data constraints can make it challenging
    to obtain a comprehensive understanding of aquifer processes and modeling techniques.
    Therefore, our study aimed to compare the performances of seven commonly used
    ML models in predicting multi-scale GWLs at the selected observation wells in
    Bangladesh. These models included Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS),
    Bootstrap Aggregated Random Forest (Bagged RF), Boosted Random Forest (Boosted
    RF), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
    (Bi-LSTM) network, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), and Support
    Vector Regression (SVR). The study aimed at assessing how well each of the ML
    models predicted future GWLs at selected wells, taking into account multiple time
    steps into the future. Some recent research has highlighted the capability of
    these algorithms in forecasting the accuracy of various parameters. Some applications
    in their usage in various disciplines including GWL prediction and forecasting
    domain comprise the application of ANFIS [10,11,12], Bagged RF [13,14], Boosted
    RF [15,16], GPR [17,18], Bi-LSTM [19,20], MARS [21], and SVR [22,23]. However,
    these ML-based forecasting models individually can often fail to map the nonlinear
    relationships between the inputs and outputs relating to GWL fluctuations due
    to prediction uncertainties. Recent studies have demonstrated that although ML
    algorithms can be effective in predicting GWLs, there are certain limitations
    and uncertainties when relying solely on a single algorithm for this task. To
    address these limitations and uncertainties associated with using a single ML
    algorithm for GWL forecasting, recent studies have suggested the use of heterogeneous
    ensemble models [24] that combine different algorithms or modeling techniques.
    These heterogeneous ensemble models are aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability
    of the forecasting results. Researchers have explored different approaches such
    as combining multiple ML algorithms, statistical models, or physical models. Examples
    of recent studies that have proposed and evaluated heterogeneous ensemble models
    for GWL forecasting include the works of Tang et al. [25], Cao et al. [26], and
    Liu et al. [27]. Overall, these studies highlight that while ML algorithms can
    be promising in predicting GWLs, using a single algorithm may not always be enough
    to ensure accurate and reliable forecasts. To address this issue, an ensemble
    of several ML algorithms can be used to provide robust and precise forecasts.
    Ensemble models that combine with multiple algorithms may be necessary to improve
    forecasting performance and enhance the robustness of the models. Ensemble learning
    is a technique that combines multiple ML-based models to improve forecast accuracy
    of a model. There are various types of ensembles that can be used in ML algorithms,
    including bagging, boosting, stacking, blending, and random forest approaches.
    Each type of ensemble has its own unique approach to combining the forecasts of
    multiple models, and recent studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving
    the accuracy and reliability of GWL forecasting models. The weighted average approach
    is gaining popularity as an ensemble of ML-based models because it assigns weights
    to individual prediction models based on their prediction precision. Recent studies
    have explored the effectiveness of the weighted average ensemble in GWL prediction
    [28,29,30]. A study by Tao et al. [31] proposed a weighted ensemble of deep learning
    models for GWL forecasting, which outperformed single deep learning models and
    other traditional ML algorithms. Similarly, a study by Gong et al. [32] used a
    weighted average ensemble of SVR models for GWL forecasting, which achieved higher
    accuracy compared to single models and other ensemble approaches. Bayesian Model
    Averaging (BMA) is a popular weighted average ensemble approach to improve the
    accuracy of GWL forecasting models compared to other weighted average ensembles.
    Recent studies have shown the advantages of using BMA, such as its ability to
    incorporate uncertainties in model selection and parameter estimation, which can
    lead to more accurate and robust predictions. For example, Zhou et al. [28] compared
    the performance of BMA with other ensemble methods for GWL forecasting and found
    that BMA outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Similarly,
    Seifi et al. [33] used BMA to combine multiple ML models for GWL forecasting and
    demonstrated that the approach improved the accuracy of the forecasting results
    compared to other weighted average ensembles. However, these studies were conducted
    with different ML algorithms at different geographical locations, limiting their
    applications at other geographical locations. Therefore, the current study aims
    to enhance forecast accuracy and tackle modeling uncertainty by utilizing a weighted
    average ensemble approach based on the BMA of individual forecast models at four
    different observation wells located in northern Bangladesh. The aim of this research
    is to demonstrate the application of several ML algorithms, including ANFIS, Bagged
    RF, Boosted RF, GPR, Bi-LSTM, MARS, and SVR, to forecast GWLs and compare their
    individual performance with a weighted average ensemble based on a BMA approach.
    The study involves developing ensemble forecast models that use historical GWL
    data as input variables and applying them to the observation wells situated in
    Godagari upazilla, Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Our key contributions to the existing
    body of literature involve the first investigation of: Performance evaluation
    of the seven ML-based individual models to forecast multi-step ahead GWL fluctuations.
    Development of a heterogeneous ensemble of the GWL forecast models using the BMA
    approach and comparison of the performance of the ensemble with that of the standalone
    forecast models. Therefore, the research aimed at enhancing the forecasting accuracy
    of multi-scale GWL fluctuations through the utilization of a heterogeneous ensemble
    comprising various ML algorithms. This improvement in forecasting accuracy is
    crucial for effective water resource management and decision-making. In addition,
    by utilizing data-driven ML models, the research offers a more direct and efficient
    approach to GWL forecasting. This reduces the dependence on complex numerical
    simulation models that require extensive data and modeling expertise. Another
    unique aspect is the ensemble’s ability to address forecast uncertainties inherent
    in data-driven models. The introduction of the ensemble approach helps address
    the inherent uncertainties in standalone data-driven models. By combining the
    predictive power of multiple algorithms, the ensemble provides more robust and
    reliable GWL forecasts, particularly in scenarios where uncertainty is a critical
    concern. While ML-based methods have been applied to this domain before, the integration
    of diverse algorithms in an ensemble to enhance accuracy is a unique and innovative
    aspect of this study. The findings can assist water resource managers and policymakers
    in making informed decisions about groundwater resource utilization and conservation.
    Overall, this research will contribute to the advancement of GWL forecasting techniques
    and provides valuable insights for sustainable water resource management in the
    study area and beyond. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area and the Data The
    study area is located at the Godagari upazilla of the Rajshahi district in the
    Rajshahi division, Bangladesh. It is situated between 24°21′ and 24°36′ north
    latitudes and 88°17′ and 88°33′ east longitudes with an aerial extent of about
    472.13 km2. The area falls in the extensive Gangetic floodplain, which has a typical
    climatic pattern with very cold winters (below 6 °C) and very dry and hot summers
    (up to 45 °C) [34]. It experiences little annual rainfall compared to other parts
    of the country. Groundwater recharge from rainfall is hindered by a thick clayey
    layer of around 18 m at the top surface. Previous data on GWL fluctuations were
    used to model future scenarios of GWL fluctuations in the selected observation
    wells of the study area, especially to provide a multi-step ahead forecast of
    GWLs. For this, weekly historical data on GWL fluctuations with a period from
    10 October 1983 to 24 September 2018 (1825 weekly GWL records) were collected
    from the Bangladesh Water Development Board [35], an entity dedicated to collecting
    weekly GWL information from designated observation wells. In addition to these
    GWL records, this organization possesses pump test and lithology data for the
    observation wells. The research primarily focuses on evaluating the effectiveness
    of our proposed approach in generating multi-step ahead GWL forecasts with minimal
    input variables, specifically, utilizing only past GWL data. Our approach eliminates
    the necessity of incorporating multiple attributes and relying on numerical simulation
    models, which often demand extensive data and specialized modeling expertise,
    as well as subjective judgment. In summary, this research relies on secondary
    data gathered by the Bangladesh Water Development Board, which is responsible
    for collating water quality and water level data from designated observation wells.
    This data collection includes manually recorded measurements of the depth of the
    water level below the ground surface. Collected data at different observation
    wells were carefully checked and four observation wells, namely GT8134017, GT8134020,
    GT8134021, and GT8134022, were selected based on the criterion of the least number
    of missing entries. The observation well GT8134017 is positioned between 24.40°
    N latitude and 88.43° E longitude. The position of the observation well GT8134020
    is between 24.52° N latitude and 88.38° E longitude. The observation well GT8134021
    lies between 24.49° N latitude and 88.46° E longitude, whereas the observation
    well GT8134022 is situated between 24.43° N latitude and 88.46° E longitude. The
    study area and the positions of the observation wells inside the study area are
    shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Study area. To ensure that the collected GWL datasets
    meet the highest standards, a data quality assurance approach is frequently employed.
    This approach enhances the reliability of GWL forecasts made using ML techniques.
    The quality of the collected GWL data was rigorously evaluated for accuracy and
    completeness using range/limit tests, even though a comprehensive quality inspection
    method was not applied to the current dataset. The primary objective of range
    testing is to confirm that each observation falls within a specified range. Only
    measurements within this threshold are accepted, while those outside of the range
    are accurately categorized as invalid. To generate a multi-step ahead GWL projection,
    the data falling within the permissible range were used to model future GWL changes
    in the selected observation wells. However, there were some missing values in
    the GWL datasets in the selected observation wells. The missing entries of weekly
    GWL data accounted for 0.60% (12 missing entries out of 2021 data), 0.49% (10
    missing entries out of 2021 data), 0.35% (7 missing entries out of 2021 data),
    and 0.39% (8 missing entries out of 2021 data) for the observation wells GT8134017,
    GT8134020, GT8134021, and GT8134022, respectively. The average of the preceding
    and subsequent weeks (i.e., adjacent weeks) was used to fill in any gaps in a
    given week’s data [36]. Table 1 presents a few descriptive statistics of the datasets
    (after imputation of the missing entries) at the selected observation wells. Table
    1 reveals that the mean values of GWL data ranged between 6.534 m (at GT8134022)
    and 7.735 m (at GT8134020), whereas the standard deviation values varied between
    2.274 m (at GT8134022) and 2.797 m (at GT8134017). The data at all observation
    wells possessed a longer left tail than the right tail in their distribution,
    as evidenced by the negative skewness values (Table 1). Likewise, the datasets
    showed “light-tailed” distributions because the kurtosis values are also negative
    at all observation wells. Table 1. Values of the statistical parameters computed
    on the GWL data (m) at the designated observation wells. 2.2. Machine Learning-Based
    Models 2.2.1. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) A hybrid computational
    model, called the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), incorporates
    the advantages of both Artificial Neural Network and fuzzy reasoning methods.
    Models that can learn from data and then apply that learning to generate predictions
    or anticipate the future may be developed using ANFIS. The ANFIS model architecture
    used in this study is Sugeno-based and employs Gaussian and linear-type Membership
    Functions (MFs) for the inputs and outputs, respectively. According to Jang et
    al. [37], a Gaussian MF comprises the two important model parameters {c, σ} and
    can be written as follows: 𝑔𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑎𝑛(𝑥,𝑐,𝜎)= 𝑒 − 1 2 ( 𝑥−𝑐 𝜎 ) 2 (1) where 𝑐 represents
    the center of the MF, and 𝜎 denotes the MF’s width. Figure 2 can be used to visually
    display the architecture of an ANFIS model of the Sugeno-type [37]. Figure 2.
    ANFIS architecture based on a two-input first-order Sugeno FIS. The ANFIS architecture
    depicted in Figure 2 is a basic design that is developed from a Sugeno FIS structure
    of the first order, comprising a single output ( 𝑓 ) and two inputs ( 𝛼 and 𝛽
    ). The fuzzy if-then rules for the Sugeno FIS are represented as: Rule 1:If 𝛼
    is  𝑃 1  and 𝛽 is  𝑄 1 then  𝑓 1 = 𝑝 1 𝛼+ 𝑞 1 𝛽+ 𝑟 1 (2) Rule 2:If 𝛼 is  𝑃 2  and
    𝛽 is  𝑄 2  then  𝑓 2 = 𝑝 2 𝛼+ 𝑞 2 𝛽+ 𝑟 2 (3) The ANFIS model is composed of five
    layers, namely the input layer, fuzzification layer, rule layer, defuzzification
    layer, and an output layer. The input data is fed into the input layer, and subsequently,
    the fuzzification layer transforms it into fuzzy sets. Rules are generated in
    the rule layer based on these fuzzy sets, which are then combined to generate
    the system output. The defuzzification layer is responsible for converting the
    fuzzy output to a crisp output. During the learning process, the ANFIS model adjusts
    the parameters of the fuzzy sets and the rules using the training data. To adjust
    the parameters of the neural network, the model employs a backpropagation algorithm,
    while the parameters of the fuzzy sets are adjusted using a least squares method.
    ANFIS offers several advantages over other modeling techniques due to its ability
    to handle noisy and uncertain data, capture non-linear relationships between input
    and output variables, and integrate expert knowledge into the model. The GWL forecasting
    models based on ANFIS are created by utilizing the functions and commands of MATLAB
    programming language. ANFIS employs a hybrid learning algorithm for parameter
    identification in Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems (FIS). This approach combines
    the least squares method and the backpropagation gradient descent method to train
    FIS membership function parameters, effectively replicating a provided training
    dataset. ANFIS models are developed by tuning the parameters of initial FISs,
    which are created using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM). The FCM
    is employed to compress the training dataset into a set of identical clusters
    that significantly reduce the number of rules in FIS generation. This clustering
    approach substantially reduces the number of adjustable parameters, both linear
    and nonlinear, within the FIS models. Selecting the optimum number of clusters
    is an important pre-processing step in FIS model development using the FCM algorithm.
    The appropriate number of clusters is determined based on the nature of the problem
    and the dimension of the input space. In most cases, a simpler model architecture
    is preferred. In this study, we determine the optimal number of clusters by conducting
    multiple trials with varying cluster numbers and assessing the resulting Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the actual and predicted responses obtained from
    the selected FIS models. We select the number of clusters that yields the minimum
    RMSE value and the least variance in RMSE values between the training and testing
    datasets, considering it to be suitable. We also scrutinize the lowest variance
    in RMSE values between the training and testing datasets to prevent model overfitting.
    2.2.2. Bagged and Boosted RF A Random Forest (RF) is an ML-based algorithm that
    utilizes an ensemble of decision trees for making predictions. The method involves
    generating a group of independent trees and combining their outputs through averaging.
    Each tree in the forest is constructed based on a random subset of features from
    the dataset, and the splitting criteria for each tree are determined independently
    [38]. Bagging and Boosting are commonly utilized in ML to enhance the accuracy
    of decision tree-based models like RF. These techniques can significantly improve
    the performance of RF models by reducing model overfitting, variance (in the case
    of Bagging), and bias (in the case of Boosting). Bagging is a method that entails
    generating several random samples of the training data by using bootstrapping
    and training a model on each sample. The ultimate prediction is achieved by taking
    an average of all the model predictions. This technique helps to mitigate the
    problem of overfitting and variance that can occur in a model. On the other hand,
    Boosting is an ML technique that involves training a model on the entire training
    set and iteratively adjusting the weights of the misclassified samples to enhance
    the model’s performance. In Boosting, new decision trees are added to the model
    to correct the errors of the previous trees. The final prediction is made by combining
    the predictions of all the trees, which are weighted based on their accuracy.
    A detailed description of the Bagged and Boosted RFs can be found in Breiman [38]
    and is not repeated in this study. The Bagged-RF and Boosted-RF-based GWL forecasting
    models are developed using the functions and commands of MATLAB. 2.2.3. Gaussian
    Process Regression (GPR) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a non-parametric
    and Bayesian ML approach that models nonlinear relationships between input and
    output variables. It uses a Gaussian process, which is a set of random variables
    that have a joint Gaussian distribution, to model the relationship between inputs
    and outputs. The goal of GPR is to build a mapping between the predictors, 𝑋(𝑖)
    and the response variable, 𝑌 , expressed as a functional relationship. In simpler
    terms, GPR is a way to predict outputs based on inputs by building a statistical
    model using a flexible and non-parametric approach. The functional relationship
    between 𝑋(𝑖) and 𝑌 can be defined as [39]: 𝑌=𝑓(𝑋(𝑖))+𝜀 (4) where 𝜀 symbolizes
    the Gaussian noise with variance 𝜎 2 𝑛 . When using GPR, the mean and covariance
    of the Gaussian process are determined by the data used for training. These two
    functions play important roles in building the input–output mapping for the GPR
    model. The mean function is responsible for determining the expected value of
    the function at any given location in the variable space. In other words, it provides
    a prediction for the output variable based on the input variables. This mean function
    can be written as [40]: 𝑚( 𝑥 𝑖 )=𝐸[𝑓( 𝑥 𝑖 )] (5) The most fundamental and significant
    component in developing a GPR model is thought to be the covariance function.
    The covariance function shows how similar or dissimilarly connected the inputs
    and outputs are. The covariance function is defined as follows: 𝑘( 𝑥 𝑖 ,  𝑥 𝑗
    )=𝐸 [(𝑓( 𝑥 𝑖 )−𝑚( 𝑥 𝑖 )) (𝑓( 𝑥 𝑗 )−𝑚( 𝑥 𝑗 ))] (6) A final representation of the
    Gaussian process is: 𝑓(𝑥)~𝑔𝑝 (𝑚( 𝑥 𝑖 ), 𝑘( 𝑥 𝑖 ,  𝑥 𝑗 )) (7) One of the major
    benefits of using GPR is that it can effectively model intricate relationships
    between input and output variables without assuming any specific distribution
    of the data. This feature is especially useful when dealing with data that may
    be noisy or incomplete, as GPR cannot only provide predictions but also estimates
    of the uncertainty associated with these predictions. Therefore, GPR is a powerful
    tool for predictive modeling in situations where the relationships between variables
    are complex and the data are imperfect. The GPR-based GWL forecasting models are
    developed using the functions and commands of MATLAB. 2.2.4. Bidirectional Long
    Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Network Bi-LSTM is a variant of the traditional LSTM
    neural network, consisting of both forward and backward LSTM layers that allow
    for the integration of long-range context in both directions. The LSTM architecture
    addresses the issue of vanishing gradients by using gating mechanisms, while the
    Bi-LSTM allows for the inclusion of both preceding and subsequent data. The traditional
    LSTM consists of multiple memory blocks with several memory units and three gates:
    the input gate selects and converts new data into cell form, the forget gate removes
    irrelevant information, and the output gate decides which essential information
    from the cell should be used as the output. As a type of Recurrent Neural Network
    (RNN), Bi-LSTM transforms the individual activations into dependent activation
    sequences by providing all neural network layers with identical weights and biases
    and using prior outputs as input for subsequent hidden layers. In a standard RNN
    architecture, the hidden layer undergoes an update based on the layer input and
    prior hidden form at each time step 𝑡 using the following equation. ℎ 𝑡 = 𝜎 ℎ  (𝑊
    𝑥 𝑡 +𝑉 ℎ 𝑡 −1− 𝑏 ℎ ) (8) where W is the weight matrix delivered via the input
    to the hidden layer, V is the weight matrix between two hidden serial states (
    ℎ 𝑡−1 and ℎ 𝑡 ), 𝑏 ℎ is the bias vector for the hidden layer, and 𝜎 ℎ is the activation
    function to generate the hidden structure. The model output can be represented
    as 𝑦 𝑡 = 𝜎 𝑦 (𝑈 ℎ 𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑦 ) (9) where U is the weight matrix from the hidden layer
    converted to the output layer, and 𝜎 𝑦 is the activation function of the output
    layer. The LSTM layers process sequential data unidirectionally and modify it
    to capture the patterns. However, a backward LSTM layer can introduce bidirectional
    capabilities to the model. The LSTM layers procedure series data unidirectionally
    and modify it to capture the randomness. Nonetheless, a backward LSTM layer can
    deliver bidirectionality into the model. Thus, developing a Bi-LSTM layer, including
    a forward LSTM layer and a backward LSTM layer, processes series data with two
    particular hidden layers and merges them into the same output layer. In the development
    of Bi-LSTM models, network architectures featuring three hidden layers were implemented.
    Following each of these hidden layers, a dropout layer was incorporated to prevent
    or mitigate overfitting in the proposed Bi-LSTM models. The first, second, and
    third hidden layers were configured with 100, 50, and 20 hidden neurons, respectively.
    Correspondingly, dropout rates of 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 were assigned to the respective
    dropout layers. These optimal values were determined through an iterative process
    of experimentation. Various training configurations for the Bi-LSTM models were
    explored during these trials and the most effective ones for the model training
    were selected (Table 2). Table 2. Optimal parameter sets for the GWL forecasting
    models. The training setup consisted of four layers for the Bi-LSTM models: A
    sequence input layer, which matched the number of input variables or features.
    A Bi-LSTM layer, whose units corresponded to the number of hidden units. A fully
    connected layer, tailored to the number of output variables or response variables.
    Finally, a regression layer. This architecture allowed effective training and
    evaluation of the proposed Bi-LSTM models for the intended task. 2.2.5. Multivariate
    Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS)
    is a non-parametric regression method that was first introduced by Jerome H. Friedman
    in 1991 [41]. Since then, it has become a widely used technique for modeling intricate
    and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables in data mining
    and ML applications. One of the advantages of MARS is its ability to handle both
    continuous and categorical input variables, as well as their interactions. Additionally,
    MARS is particularly helpful in identifying the most important input variables
    in high-dimensional data and modeling non-linear interactions between inputs and
    outputs. Overall, MARS is a powerful tool for building flexible and accurate regression
    models in situations where the relationships between variables are complex and
    nonlinear. MARS approximates the nonlinear relationship between input and output
    variables by dividing them into a series of linear segments, which are connected
    at “knots”. The selection of knots is based on the associated data, and they are
    used to improve prediction accuracy by minimizing the sum of squared errors between
    the actual and predicted responses. Each linear segment is represented as a linear
    combination of the input variables, where the coefficients are also determined
    by the data. MARS model building involves both a forward and a backward stepwise
    procedure. During the forward step, the model is constructed using user-specified
    Basis functions, while during the backward step, redundant or unnecessary input
    variables are systematically eliminated to reduce the model’s complexity and prevent
    over fitting. This results in a more optimal and accurate model. The mapping between
    input and output variables in MARS can be expressed mathematically, as outlined
    in Roy and Datta [42]. 𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 (𝑋)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,  𝑋 𝑗 −𝑎) 𝑜𝑟 𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 (𝑋)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, 𝛼− 𝑋 𝑗 )
    (10) 𝑌=𝑓(𝑋)=𝛽± 𝛾 𝑘 ×𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 (𝑋) (11) where 𝑖 and 𝑗 symbolize the indices for Basic
    functions and input variables, respectively; 𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 indicates the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ Basis functions;
    𝑋 𝑗 denotes the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ input variables; 𝛼 is a constant referred to as the knot;
    𝛽 indicates a constant value; 𝛾 𝑘 represents the corresponding coefficients of
    𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 (𝑋). 2.2.6. Support Vector Regression (SVR) Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    is an ML-based approach that is employed for performing regression tasks by offering
    both linear and non-linear mappings between the input and output variables. It
    is based on the same principle as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which are used
    for classification tasks. The primary goal of SVR is to determine a function that
    can best approximate the relationship between input and output variables while
    minimizing the prediction error. To achieve this, SVR maps the input variables
    to a high-dimensional feature space, where a linear relationship between input
    and output variables may exist. The technique then identifies a hyperplane that
    maximizes the margin between the predicted values and the actual values, with
    the margin represents the distance between the predicted values and the hyperplane.
    This margin is used to balance the complexity of the model against the error rate.
    Additionally, SVR is less prone to overfitting than other non-linear regression
    techniques since it concentrates on discovering the best hyperplane that generalizes
    well to new data [43]. This effort provides a concise overview of how SVR models
    can be used to solve regression problems. When constructing an SVR model, the
    training dataset can be expressed using the following equation: 𝑃={( 𝑎 1 , 𝑏 1
    ),( 𝑎 2 , 𝑏 2 ),( 𝑎 3 , 𝑏 3 ),….,( 𝑎 𝑁 , 𝑏 𝑁 )} (12) where 𝑎 𝑖 (𝑖=1,2,3,….,𝑁)
    represents a vector comprising real independent variables; 𝑏 𝑖 (𝑖=1,2,3,….,𝑁)
    represents the associated scalar real independent variable. The feature space
    representation of the regression equation for the training dataset is as follows:
    𝑧(𝑎,𝑤)=(𝑤·∅(𝑎)+𝑐) (13) where 𝑤 represents the weight vector; 𝑐 symbolizes a constant;
    ∅(𝑎) denotes the feature function; and 𝑤·∅(𝑎) represents the dot product. SVR
    minimizes the following cost function to accomplish regression tasks: Minimize:
    𝑄(𝑓)=𝐶 1 𝑁 𝐿 𝜀 (𝑏,𝑧(𝑎,𝑤))+ 1 2 ∥ 𝑊 2 ∥ (14) 𝐿 𝜀 (𝑏,𝑧(𝑎,𝑤))={ 0 |𝑏−𝑧(𝑎,𝑤)|−𝜀 if  |𝑏−𝑧(𝑎,𝑤)|≤𝜀  otherwise
    (15) The above equation represents the empirical error, while the second term
    (denoted by 𝐶 ) measures the trade-off between the empirical error and the model
    complexity. Equation (15) represents a loss function referred to as the “ε-insensitive
    loss function” [44]. By introducing Lagrangian multipliers 𝛽 and 𝛽* , the optimization
    problem in Equation (15) is transformed into a dual problem. Support vectors are
    only defined as combinations of non-zero coefficients and their corresponding
    input vectors, 𝑎 𝑖 . The equation eventually has the following final form: 𝑧(𝑎,
    𝛽 𝑖 , 𝛽 ∗ 𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑠𝑣 ( 𝛽 𝑖 − 𝛽 ∗ 𝑖 )(∅( 𝑎 𝑖 )·∅( 𝑎 𝑗 ))+𝑐 (16) The SVR function
    can be expressed as follows using the kernel function 𝐾( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ) : 𝑧(𝑎, 𝛽
    𝑖 , 𝛽 ∗ 𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑠𝑣 ( 𝛽 𝑖 − 𝛽 ∗ 𝑖 )𝐾(𝑎, 𝑎 𝑖 )+𝑐 (17) The above equations are
    used to compute the term 𝑐 using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition. When using
    the SVR technique to solve a regression problem, the cost function 𝐶 , the radius
    of the insensitive tube 𝜀 , and the kernel parameters 𝐾( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ) are thought
    to be the most crucial variables. The forecasting models for GWL based on the
    SVR approach are developed using MATLAB’s functions and commands. 2.3. Modeling
    Techniques This section provides specifics on data pre-processing and modeling
    techniques adopted in this research to develop the ML-based forecast models (ANFIS,
    Bagged RF, Boosted RF, GPR, Bi-LSTM, MARS, and SVR) proposed in this research
    to forecast multi-step ahead GWL fluctuations. Data pre-processing is a crucial
    step in enhancing the forecasting accuracy of any ML model. It encompasses various
    tasks, including data collection and compilation, quality assessment, cleaning
    and imputation, data splitting, feature engineering, and data standardization,
    among others, to ensure that the data are suitable for analysis and modeling.
    The issues related to data collection and compilation, as well as cleaning and
    imputation, are addressed in Section 2.1, ‘Study area and the data’. Subsequent
    sub-sections provide detailed information on data splitting, feature engineering,
    data standardization, and the modeling techniques employed in this research. These
    steps collectively contribute to improving the forecasting accuracy of multi-scale
    GWL fluctuations using a heterogeneous ensemble of ML algorithms. 2.3.1. Data
    Preprocessing Initially, a total of 1825 GWL records (from 10 October 1983 to
    24 September 2018) were collected for providing multi-step ahead GWL forecasts.
    The collected weekly GWL data decreased at every observation well due to temporal
    lags for the lagged inputs and the output. At each observation well, a total of
    1807 historical records remained (from 13 February 1988 to 24 September 2018 after
    removing 18 records due to time lagging (3-time lags forward + 15-time lags backward)
    from the entire GWL time series of 1825 readings (from 10 October 1983 to 24 September
    2018). The remaining dataset at each observation well were divided into three
    subsets: the first 1267 datasets (70% of total) were employed for model development
    (training), the next 270 datasets (15% of total) were used for model validation,
    and the remaining 270 datasets (15% of total) were used for model evaluation (testing).
    After satisfactory training and validation of the GWL forecast models, the models
    were tested using an unseen test dataset, which was used neither for model training
    nor for model validation. Although there is not a fixed rule for dataset dividing
    throughout model training and validation [45], it is generally agreed that the
    validation division should be between 10% and 40% of the length of the entire
    dataset [46]. 2.3.2. Selection of Input Variables One of the most crucial aspects
    in creating ML-based forecast models is deciding on the influential input variables
    [47,48]. In order to choose the input variables for hydrological and water resources
    modeling, both linear [49] and nonlinear approaches [48] have been used [47].
    However, because hydrological and water resource modeling frequently involves
    nonlinear issues, linear approaches based on the Partial Auto Correlation Function
    (PACF) and Auto Correlation Function (ACF) are normally not the best approaches
    [50]. In general, nonlinear approaches based on Mutual Information (MI) [51] outperform
    linear approaches for the modeling of hydrology and water resources research areas
    in addition to other scientific and technological application domains [32,47,48,52].
    Since ANFIS, GPR, Bi-LSTM, and SVR do not automatically quantify the significance
    of input variables, it is crucial to undertake the selection of most influential
    input variables before developing these models. In this research, we employed
    the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) technique developed by Peng et
    al. [53], one of the most popular MI techniques for input variable identification.
    Using MI to find potential candidate inputs that are pertinent but not unnecessary,
    this method chooses input variables from a group of alternatives. It has been
    demonstrated that this method chooses input variables that are more suitable than
    other methods of a similar kind [54]. An operator Φ(𝐷,𝑅) is defined to concurrently
    optimize the minimum redundancy ( 𝑅 ) and maximum relevance ( 𝐷 ) for selecting
    an input subset ( 𝑆 ) from 𝑑 input variables in 𝑥 [53]. This can be mathematically
    represented as: maxΦ(𝐷,𝑅), Φ=𝐷−𝑅 (18) A detailed outline of MRMR can be found
    in Peng et al. [53] and is not repeated in this effort. Nevertheless, for approaches
    like MARS and RF, the choice of the input variable is not required. Both strategies
    carry out the internal functions of input variable selection and variable importance
    quantification. 2.3.3. Standardization of Data Data standardization is seen as
    a method for putting data on a uniform scale, making them simpler to assess and
    compare. In order to be certain that various variables or attributes are on an
    equivalent scale and have identical ranges, machine learning algorithms are standardized.
    In the present investigation, the variables used for input were initially normalized
    before the GWL forecasting models were built. Several earlier studies on hydrology
    and water resources used the standardization approach [55,56]. As a result, the
    dataset was created with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 [57]. The data were standardized
    using the following formula: 𝑋 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 = 𝑋−𝜇 𝜎 (19) where 𝑋 represents the
    actual input, 𝑋 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 denotes the standardized input, 𝜇 is the mean value
    of the input, and 𝜎 is the standard deviation of the input. 2.3.4. Development
    of Individual Models The choice of the best parameter settings has a significant
    impact on how accurately the majority of ML-based algorithms forecast. Probst
    et al. [58] claim that the vast majority of ML algorithms require that a set of
    properly selected appropriate parameters be used. ML-based model performance is
    significantly influenced by the choice of parameters [59], and poor parameter
    choosing can lead to underachieving models. To enable an equitable evaluation
    of ML-based forecasting models, it is ideal to choose the best or optimal parameter
    sets for each of the ML-based models. In this attempt, a number of trials were
    run using different parameter sets for each model in order to pick the best models
    using the best parameter values for that model. The training and validation data
    were used to conduct these trials, which examined the RMSE of the training phase
    and validation performance. When the RMSE values for the training and validation
    phases differed very little from one another, it was determined that a model was
    performing at its peak efficiency and that no model was overfitted. The parameters
    that were used for the trained individual GWL forecast models developed at the
    four observation wells are shown in Table 2. 2.3.5. Development of Ensemble Models
    Different ML-based modeling approaches have varying degrees of precision in forecasting.
    In accordance with the datasets utilized in both training and evaluation, the
    efficacy of a model may change. It is important to select the best model for a
    specific problem; not all ML-based modeling techniques can be used in a given
    study to compare the effectiveness of each one. This selecting process is difficult
    and time-consuming. An ensemble modeling technique has a benefit in these circumstances
    because it enables the selection of a predetermined number of effective models
    and the combination of their forecasts to provide more precise outcomes. An ensemble
    forecast enhances forecast reliability by more accurately capturing the relationships
    between the predictors and responses in the dataset. Additionally, it shields
    a model’s performance from an individual poor model by minimizing the impact of
    poor projections from the model in question [60]. An ensemble technique utilizes
    the unique characteristics of individual models to recognize various input–output
    relationship trends across the whole decision space of the input–output data.
    For this reason, ensemble models frequently provide higher precision than an individual
    forecast model. Individual forecasting models used in the ensemble development
    must, however, be sufficiently precise and varied to be useful for forecasting.
    The appropriate balance between independent forecasting models in an ensemble-based
    forecast is mostly governed by the trade-offs between model complexity, forecasting
    accuracy, and the level of uncertainty minimization. To overcome the limitations
    of the forecast performance of the individual models, the present study utilizes
    a weighted average ensemble approach using the BMA approach [61]. When there is
    ambiguity over the best model to utilize, BMA is a statistical method that is
    employed to calculate the parameters of the model and generate forecasts. BMA,
    which combines forecasts from many different models by weighing them in accordance
    with their posterior probabilities, which are determined using the data at hand
    and a prior distribution over the models in question, offers an improved comprehension
    of the overall forecasting uncertainty [62]. In order to derive consensus predictions,
    BMA uses probabilistic probability measures for weighting individual predictions,
    with higher probability likelihood values obtaining bigger weights than forecasts
    that have lower probability likelihood values. The fundamental tenet of BMA is
    to approach model selection as a random variable and to account for this uncertainty
    in the analysis. BMA takes into account a set of candidate models and assigns
    a probability to each one depending on how well it fits the data and how well
    it relates to prior knowledge about the problem, rather than choosing a single
    “best” model based on some criterion (e.g., statistical performance assessment
    indices). In comparison to individual ensemble members created using several competing
    ML algorithms, BMA offers a probabilistic forecast that offers more accuracy and
    dependability [62]. For challenges involving multi-scale GWL prediction, the BMA
    technique was employed in this endeavor. A thorough description of the BMA approach
    can be found in the literature [61,62,63], hence the following is a concise summary
    of it. Let us consider the following terms and notations: 𝑦 denotes the predicted
    variable, 𝐷=[ 𝑦 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 1 ,  𝑦 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 2 , 𝑦 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 3 ,…, 𝑦 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑁 ] represents
    the training data with a data length of 𝑁 , and 𝑓=[ 𝑓 1 , 𝑓 2 , 𝑓 3 ,…, 𝑓 𝑘 ]
    is the ensemble of all selected individual model predictions. Furthermore, consider
    𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷) to be the posterior distribution of 𝑦 with model prediction 𝑓
    𝑘 and matrix of the training data 𝐷 . Then, according to the total probability
    law, the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the BMA-based probabilistic prediction
    of 𝑦 is presented using the equation below: 𝑝(𝑦|𝐷)= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷)· 𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦|
    𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷) (20) where 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷) denotes the posterior probability of the model prediction
    𝑓 𝑘 , also known as the probability of model prediction 𝑓 𝑘 being the accurate
    prediction for the training data set 𝐷 . The term 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷) in Equation (20)
    determines how precisely this specific ensemble member matches the actual observed
    values. If we consider the term 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷) to be equal to the weights of the individual
    ensemble member, i.e., 𝑤 𝑘 =𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷) , then the sum of weights for all individual
    ensemble members should be equal to 1, i.e., ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝑤 𝑘 =1 . The BMA predictions’
    posterior mean and variance can be represented by the following equations [62]:
    𝐸[𝑦|𝐷]= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷)·𝐸[ 𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷)]= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑘 𝑓 𝑘 (21) Var[𝑦|𝐷]=
    ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑘 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝑓 𝑘 − ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑖 𝑓 𝑖 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ 2 + ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑘
    𝜎 2 𝑘 (22) where 𝜎 2 𝑘 denotes the variance related to the model prediction 𝑓
    𝑘 concerning the training data set 𝐷 . The expected BMA forecast is essentially
    the average of the various predictions weighted by the probability that a particular
    model is accurate for the given observations. In the BMA algorithm, it is assumed
    that the conditional probability distribution, denoted as 𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷) , follows
    a Gaussian distribution. In the standard BMA approach, the EM algorithm is employed
    to maximize the log-likelihood function associated with the parameter vector being
    estimated. If we represent 𝜃 as 𝜃=[{ 𝑤 𝑘 , 𝜎 𝑘 ,𝑘=1,2,…,𝐾}] , the log-likelihood
    function can be approximated as follows: 𝓁(𝜃)=log ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑘 .
    𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷) ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (23) Obtaining an analytical solution for this problem
    is infeasible, necessitating the use of an iterative procedure. The EM algorithm
    is particularly well suited for this purpose. In essence, the EM algorithm formulates
    the maximum likelihood problem as a ‘missing data’ problem. This missing data
    may not represent actual observations but can instead be a latent variable that
    requires estimation. It is important to note that the EM algorithm tends to converge
    to local optima, and the optimal solution is highly sensitive to the initial guess
    of the optimization variables. For clarity, Figure 3 illustrates a flow diagram
    of the proposed ensemble model, including the algorithmic flow of the execution
    of the EM algorithm. Figure 3. Flowchart of (a) a standard BMA approach and (b)
    algorithmic flow of the EM algorithm. Since the probability of a model is essentially
    a gauge of how well the model forecasts match the data provided, one benefit of
    BMA is that a BMA forecast is given larger weights from models that perform better.
    Another benefit of BMA is that it offers a means to account for model uncertainty
    (through BMA variance) and prevent overfitting, which can happen when a single
    model is chosen based on a particular criterion. BMA variance is made up of two
    parts: (1) between-model variance, which is expressed by the very first component
    on the right-hand side of the equation (Equation (22)); and (2) within-model variance,
    which is indicated by the second component on the right-hand side of the equation
    (Equation (22)). As a result, BMA offers a more accurate representation of predictive
    uncertainty than a non-BMA-based ensemble strategy, which integrates uncertainty
    based solely on the ensemble spread (considers between-model variance alone),
    and on the other hand, produces under-dispersive predictions [62]. With the proper
    estimation of 𝜃=[{ 𝑤 𝑘 , 𝜎 𝑘 ,𝑘=1,2,…,𝐾}] and 𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝜃,𝐷) , it is possible
    to easily generate probabilistic forecasts using Equation (20). 2.4. Model Performance

    ratio of actual and forecasted values within a range of 0.80 and 1.20. 2.5. Variable
    Importance MARS and RF variants (Bagged and Boosted RF) inherently offer insights
    into the significance of explanatory variables for predicting the target variable.
    For other models, a total of sixteen (GWL at present time and 15 lags behind)
    most significant input variables were selected using the MRMR technique presented
    in Section 2.3.2. The feature importance score was computed and the top 16 predictors
    were selected for the one-, two-, and three-steps ahead forecasts individually
    at the four observation wells. A high score value indicates the significance of
    the associated predictor. Likewise, a reduction in the feature importance score
    reflects the level of confidence in feature selection. For instance, if the MRMR
    technique confidently selects feature 𝑥 , the score value of the subsequent important
    feature would be notably lower than that of feature 𝑥 . Given that there was no
    considerable disparity between the scores of the subsequent predictors until the
    sixteenth most significant predictors, we opted for the first sixteen most important
    features to build the ML-based models. The analysis revealed that certain variables
    exhibit substantial relative contributions to the models, while the majority displayed
    minimal or negligible contributions. It was generally observed that lagged GWL
    (Lag-1), as expected, was the most important variable for 1 week ahead forecasting
    (Figure 4). Figure 4. Variable importance based on MRMR scores for one-, two-,
    and three-step ahead predictions at different observation wells. 3. Results and
    Discussion 3.1. Performance of the Individual Forecasting Models during Training
    and Validation Training and validation were carried out for the individual forecasting
    models to assess their performance. Figure 5 and Figure 6 display the RMSE index,
    utilized to compare the efficiency of the proposed models across the learning
    and validation phases. The RMSE values for various standalone models forecasting
    GWL one, two, and three weeks in advance are presented for both the learning and
    validation datasets. This index serves as a metric for gauging the accuracy of
    the models during their development. The results reveal that, in the cases of
    wells GT8134017, GT8134021, and GT8134022, the SVR model exhibited lesser disparities
    between RMSE values in training and validation, in contrast to other models like
    ANFIS, BaggedRF, BoostedRF, GPR, BiLSTM, and MARS, which demonstrated more significant
    discrepancies. Conversely, for well GT8134020, the MARS model showcased a smaller
    variance, while ANFIS, BaggedRF, BoostedRF, GPR, BiLSTM, and SVR displayed higher
    divergences. Of all the models, ANFIS displayed the weakest performance, yielding
    the most notable dissimilarities in terms of RMSE values between the training
    and validation phases. Figure 5. Train and validation RMSE during the training
    and validation phases of model development: observation wells GT8134017 and GT8134020.
    Figure 6. Train and validation RMSE during the training and validation phases
    of model development: observation wells GT8134021 and GT8134022. 3.2. Performance
    of the Standalone and Ensemble Models on the Independent Test Dataset When applied
    as individual models, ML-based models often struggle to capture the wide range
    of complex patterns contained in the dataset. This limitation can lead to poor
    predictions. In such situations, an ensemble of standalone prediction models can
    be employed, which sometimes outperforms an individual model [24]. Therefore,
    due to the frequent inability of standalone forecast models to capture the true
    trends within training and testing patterns of the dataset, the concept of ensemble
    prediction has been introduced in this research. Furthermore, efforts in model
    development typically focus on reducing prediction uncertainties to provide meaningful
    predictions and enhance the generalization capacity of the developed models. This
    can be accomplished by integrating the predictions of multiple standalone models,
    creating an ensemble of models that produces a single combined prediction [60].
    An ensemble approach can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous, depending on
    the use of single or multiple ML-based algorithms in the ensemble formation [24].
    Previous studies on GWL prediction have demonstrated the effectiveness of homogeneous
    ensembles [29], which outperformed standalone models. Although recent studies
    on saltwater intrusion problems in coastal aquifers have applied a heterogeneous
    ensemble of prediction models [24], this approach has not been previously employed
    to enhance the forecasting accuracy of multi-scale GWL forecasts. This study examines
    the application of a BMA-based ensemble approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
    of multi-scale GWL forecasts. The approach involves consolidating multiple competing
    forecasts generated by various ML algorithms. BMA is a statistical method that
    derives consensus predictions by assigning weights to individual predictions based
    on their probabilistic likelihood measures. Predictions with superior performance
    receive greater weights than those with poorer performance. Additionally, BMA
    offers a more dependable representation of the overall predictive uncertainty
    compared to the other ensemble approaches, resulting in a more precise and well-calibrated
    Probability Density Function (PDF) for the probabilistic predictions. Ensemble
    techniques aim to enhance the accuracy and consistency of predictions by amalgamating
    multiple standalone forecast models. The rationale underlying ensemble forecasting
    rests upon the notion that diverse models possess individual strengths and weaknesses.
    By consolidating their predictions, a more resilient and precise ML-based algorithm
    can be crafted. Ensemble forecasting is a widely favored strategy to amalgamate
    the forecasting accuracies of individual models due to their divergent performances
    in varied scenarios [24]. A comprehensive comparison between the performances
    of independent models and the BMA ensemble approach distinctly showcases the supremacy
    of the BMA methodology across the GT8134017, GT8134020, GT8134021, and GT8134022
    observation wells. It is worth noting that the precision of forecasts, as gauged
    by evaluation indices, diminishes as forecasting horizons extend. In essence,
    one-week forecasts outperformed two-week forecasts, and two-week forecasts exhibit
    greater accuracy than three-week forecasts. Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the
    individual model performances across various statistical indices when predicting
    the weekly GWL of four observation wells. In Figure 7, the NRMSE and MAD values
    for various ML-based algorithms are presented across different observation wells.
    In terms of statistical significance, the accuracy of a model improves as the
    NRMSE and MAD values decrease. At the GT8134017 well, the BMA model emerged as
    the highest-ranking model, showcasing lower NRMSE values (0.09, 0.12, and 0.13
    for one-, two-, and three-week ahead GWL forecasts) as well as lower MAD values
    (0.17, 0.25, and 0.27 for one-, two-, and three-week ahead GWL forecasts). Conversely,
    the MARS model exhibited the poorest performance, characterized by higher NRMSE
    and MAD values (NRMSE = 0.20, 0.91, and 0.85; MAD = 0.48, 3.18, 3.48 for one-,
    two-, and three-week ahead GWL forecasts). Similarly, across the GT8134020, GT8134021,
    and GT8134022 wells, the BMA model consistently demonstrated lower NRMSE and MAD
    values, further confirming its favorable performance. Figure 7. Error of the models
    developed to forecast the weekly GWL of observation wells GT8134017, GT8134020,
    GT8134021, and GT8134022. Figure 8. Performance of the models developed to forecast
    the weekly GWL of observation wells GT8134017, GT8134020, GT8134021, and GT8134022.
    Conversely, depicted in Figure 8 are the values of R, IOA, and a-20 index for
    distinct ML-based algorithms across various observation wells. Broadly, heightened
    values of R, IOA, and a-20 index correspond to enhanced model accuracy. For the
    GT8134017 observation well, BMA exhibited superior performance when compared to
    alternative models, as evidenced by its higher values of R (0.93, 0.88, and 0.86),
    IOA (0.96, 0.93, and 0.92), and a-20 index (0.94, 0.91, and 0.91) for one-, two-,
    and three-week ahead GWL forecasts, respectively. Likewise, BMA consistently outperformed
    other models across the remaining observation wells, corroborating its efficacy.
    The findings presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 collectively indicate that the
    BMA model emerges as the superior choice across various prediction horizons for
    different observation wells, surpassing other standalone models when evaluated
    on the independent test dataset. In this study, the BMA approach exhibits exceptional
    performance, with larger R, IOA, and a-20 index values and smaller NRMSE and MAD
    values across all three forecasting horizons and the four observation wells. For
    instance, at the GT8134017 observation well, the BMA model improves the accuracy
    of statistical indices in one-week forecasts by (R = 25.67%, NRMSE = 55%, MAD
    = 68%, IOA = 15.67%, and a-20 index = 18.98%) compared to the poorest-performing
    model. On average, the BMA model consistently demonstrates greater accuracy than
    other individual models across other observation wells. According to our study,
    the BMA approach offers a more dependable and robust comprehension of overall
    predictive uncertainty. The effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian Model Averaging
    approach over the independent models is also apparent when considering other statistical
    performance evaluation measures, as presented in Table 3. It is evident from the
    data presented in Table 3 that, despite the individual models yielding comparatively
    reduced Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Bias Error values,
    the Bayesian Model Averaging approach consistently yields the most minimized values
    across all observation wells and forecasting horizons. While the standalone models
    exhibit relatively lower Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient values, the Bayesian
    Model Averaging approach consistently outperforms them in terms of NS for all
    instances. Table 3. Performance of the models in forecasting weekly groundwater
    levels of GT8134017, GT8134020, GT8134021, and GT8134022. A noteworthy observation
    is that the forecasting performance decreases as the forecasting horizon extends.
    This finding aligns well with the conclusions drawn by Rahman et al. [71] and
    Quilty et al. [48], who reported that the accuracy of predictive models tends
    to decrease with the expansion of the forecasting horizon. In summary, the suggested
    heterogeneous ensemble of forecast models based on Bayesian Model Averaging has
    substantially enhanced the reliability and accuracy of multi-scale groundwater
    level fluctuations within the study area. This result aligns well with the conclusions
    reported by Darbandsari and Coulibaly [72]. 4. Conclusions A dependable and precise
    forecast of GWLs can be used to create a groundwater management strategy that
    is effective and sustainable. For agricultural, household, and industrial uses,
    this planning will help to determine the best groundwater abstraction recommendations.
    But it is frequently challenging to provide precise GWL forecasts because of the
    nonlinear nature of GWLs as well as their multi-scale and time-varying behavior.
    An essential requirement for building precise ML-based models involves the selection
    of the most pertinent input variables from a pool of potential candidates, in
    conjunction with the optimization of model parameters. To tackle these concerns,
    this study evaluated the efficacy of various ML-based approaches capable of effectively
    capturing nonlinear relationships between input and output variables and that
    often show the best accuracy for GWL and other research domains in different parts
    of the world. Few of the ML-based approaches are able to perform selection of
    the most significant input variables internally, while for the others, the most
    significant input variables were selected using the MRMR approach. These models
    were fed into the time-lagged information extracted from the time series data.
    Furthermore, these ML-based forecasting model outputs were integrated using the
    BMA approach to enhance the forecasting models’ ability. The proposed models were
    explored for 1, 2, and 3 weeks ahead GWL forecasting. The performance of the proposed
    BMA approach was compared against standalone forecast models. The comparison between
    individual ML approaches and their heterogeneous ensemble (BMA) counterpart demonstrated
    that the BMA approach exhibited higher accuracy in comparison to the standalone
    ML models. The standalone ML methods also showcased respectable accuracy, albeit
    slightly below the level achieved by the BMA approach. Evaluation indices consistently
    highlighted the outstanding performance of the suggested BMA-based heterogeneous
    ensemble technique, even though performance marginally declined as forecast horizons
    increased. The ensemble approach based on BMA notably enhanced the accuracy of
    GWL forecasts across various lead times, with particularly notable improvement
    for 1-week ahead forecasts than the 2- and 3-week ahead forecasts at the observation
    wells. This outcome holds promise for forecasting multi-scale processes frequently
    encountered in hydrology and water resources. The amalgamation of ML methods through
    the BMA approach presents a compelling novel framework for GWL forecasting in
    the study area, warranting further exploration in the realm of hydrology and water
    resources, both for short-term and long-term predictive applications. It is worth
    mentioning that this study utilized a dataset covering roughly 35 years, ranging
    from 1983 to 2018. Further validation of the proposed modeling approach can be
    conducted using the most recent dataset obtained from the selected observation
    wells and potentially applied in a future study. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: This study focuses on assessing the accuracy of supervised machine
    learning regression algorithms (MLAs) in predicting actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act) for a deficit irrigated vineyard of Vitis vinifera cv. Tempranillo,
    influenced by a typical Mediterranean climate. The standard approach of using
    the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) crop evapotranspiration under standard
    conditions (FAO-56 Kc-ET0) to estimate ETc act for irrigation purposes faces limitations
    in row-based, sparse, and drip irrigated crops with large, exposed soil areas,
    due to data requirements and potential shortcomings. One significant challenge
    is the accurate estimation of the basal crop coefficient (Kcb), which can be influenced
    by incorrect estimations of the effective transpiring leaf area and surface resistance.
    The research results demonstrate that the tested MLAs can accurately estimate
    ETc act for the vineyard with minimal errors. The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)
    values were found to be in the range of 0.019 to 0.030 mm·h⁻¹. Additionally, the
    obtained MLAs reduced data requirements, which suggests their feasibility to be
    used to optimize sustainable irrigation management in vineyards and other row
    crops. The positive outcomes of the study highlight the potential advantages of
    employing MLAs for precise and efficient estimation of crop evapotranspiration,
    leading to improved water management practices in vineyards. This could promote
    the adoption of more sustainable and resource-efficient irrigation strategies,
    particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates.

    Notes Abstract This study focuses on assessing the accuracy of supervised machine
    learning regression algorithms (MLAs) in predicting actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act) for a deficit irrigated vineyard of Vitis vinifera cv. Tempranillo,
    influenced by a typical Mediterranean climate. The standard approach of using
    the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) crop evapotranspiration under standard
    conditions (FAO-56 Kc-ET0) to estimate ETc act for irrigation purposes faces limitations
    in row-based, sparse, and drip irrigated crops with large, exposed soil areas,
    due to data requirements and potential shortcomings. One significant challenge
    is the accurate estimation of the basal crop coefficient (Kcb), which can be influenced
    by incorrect estimations of the effective transpiring leaf area and surface resistance.
    The research results demonstrate that the tested MLAs can accurately estimate
    ETc act for the vineyard with minimal errors. The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)
    values were found to be in the range of 0.019 to 0.030 mm·h⁻¹. Additionally, the
    obtained MLAs reduced data requirements, which suggests their feasibility to be
    used to optimize sustainable irrigation management in vineyards and other row
    crops. The positive outcomes of the study highlight the potential advantages of
    employing MLAs for precise and efficient estimation of crop evapotranspiration,
    leading to improved water management practices in vineyards. This could promote
    the adoption of more sustainable and resource-efficient irrigation strategies,
    particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates. Keywords: grapevine; vineyard
    irrigation; actual crop evapotranspiration; machine learning algorithms; decision
    support systems 1. Introduction Viticulture is a vital socio-economic activity
    for Mediterranean countries, but it faces significant challenges due to climate
    change and extreme weather conditions. More severe droughts and higher temperatures
    are expected [1], leading to increased evaporative demand and reduced water availability
    for irrigation. In this context, efficient irrigation management is crucial for
    optimizing yield and berry composition in vineyards. Such a scenario brings new
    challenges to Mediterranean viticulture, as irrigation emerges as an adaptation
    strategy aimed at optimizing yield while improving ripening and berry composition
    [2,3]. Grape ripening is a critical phenological phase that greatly influences
    berry composition at harvest time. Moderate water stress during this period benefits
    grapevine water-use efficiency and grape quality [2]. Accurate quantification
    of this condition requires monitoring actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act),
    which allows for the implementation of efficient irrigation management schemes.
    To ensure optimal plant water status, irrigation protocols must be based on accurate
    knowledge of weather, soil, and plant variables. Nevertheless, there is some debate
    among plant physiologists and micrometeorologists regarding the factors contributing
    to plant water loss through transpiration. Plant physiologists emphasize the role
    of stomata in this process [4,5,6], while micrometeorologists focus on the high
    energy required for water evaporation [7]. Several methods to estimate evapotranspiration
    (ET), incorporating various factors from soil to vegetation and based on weather
    variables, have been developed [8]. Some are derived from the Penman–Monteith
    equation, which describes the ET process considering the soil and air moisture,
    mass transfer, and the energy required for the process [7]. The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) recommends crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions
    (FAO-56 Kc-ET0) as the standard approach for defining and calculating reference
    ET (ET0). Since ET0 reflects the weather-related effects on water use by a reference
    crop [9,10], in order to be applicable to different crops, the method needs to
    scale ET0 by a crop coefficient (Kc), which accounts for the physical and physiological
    differences from the reference crop, their impact on ET0, and their variability
    during the growing season [9]. Several simplifications were incorporated into
    the Kc coefficients, including plant transpiration and soil evaporation [11].
    To avoid incorrect estimation of crop ET (ETc) in orchards and sparse crops with
    drip irrigation and large exposed soil areas, the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method was adapted
    to separate plant and soil components of Kc, the basal crop (Kcb) and the soil
    evaporation coefficient (Ke) [9]. However, for crop species with tight stomatal
    control of water loss and regulation of leaf water potential, such as grapevine,
    literature has reported major accuracy limitations in using the FAO-56 Kc-ET0
    method [11,12,13,14,15]. These inaccuracies are mainly related to the surface
    resistance and incorrect estimation of Kcb [16,17,18]. In fact, the procedure
    for the practical estimation of the ETc act, must take into account the effective
    transpiring leaf area, and additionally include auxiliary sub-models for aerodynamics
    and surface conductance, which must be parameterized for each new measurement,
    location, and condition [15,19,20,21,22]. To overcome the limitations of the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 method, alternative approaches, such as employing machine learning regression
    algorithms (MLA) can be considered [23,24]. Indeed, MLAs have the capacity to
    map input-dependent variables to output-independent ones by learning patterns
    from training datasets with known pairs of input-output data [25]. Previous studies
    in the literature describe the use of MLA approaches to estimate ET0, but to the
    best of our knowledge, none of them relates to farm scale calculation of the ETc
    act for grapevines [24,26,27,28,29]. This research assesses the performance of
    eight state-of-the-art supervised machine learning regression algorithms (MLA),
    using three main atmospheric variables (net radiation—Rn, wind speed—U, and vapor
    pressure deficit—VPD) and a plant variable (stomatal conductance to water vapor—gsw),
    to predict ETc act as key information for designing optimal irrigation management
    systems in vineyards. To assess the accuracy of the algorithms, ETc act estimates
    by MLA are compared to the accuracy of the ETc act computed by the FAO-56 Kc-ET0
    method, using the actual crop ET recorded by the Eddy covariance tower flux installed
    in the field as an external validation variable. The findings suggest that MLA
    models can be effective in estimating the ETc act and optimizing irrigation management
    in vineyards. These models can continuously improve and expand their knowledge
    by incorporating new data from agronomic campaigns. The application of MLA in
    arid climates can significantly benefit viticulture in Mediterranean regions.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Layout The trials were carried out
    in a commercial vineyard (Herdade do Esporão) in Reguengos de Monsaraz, Alentejo
    wine region, southern Portugal (lat. 38°23′55.00″ N; long. 7°32′46.00″ W). Specifically,
    a 17-year-old commercial vineyard of the red Vitis vinifera cv Tempranillo (syn.
    Aragonez), grafted on 1103 Paulsen rootstock, was chosen for the study. The vines
    are 1.5 m within and 3.0 m between rows (2220 vines/ha), north-south oriented,
    trained to vertical shoot positioning, and spur-pruned on a bilateral Royat cordon
    system. All vines were pruned evenly, with 15–16 buds per vine. A Eutric Cambisol
    (CM) with a depth of 1.0 m and a silty-clay texture was found, with a pH ranging
    from 7.0 to 7.6, a low organic matter content, and a high content of phosphorus
    and potassium. Standard cultural practices in the region were followed, and the
    vines were irrigated weekly with drip irrigation, using 2.4 L·h−1, 1.0 m spaced
    emitters, in accordance with owners’ practices. For the study, 20 adult and healthy
    vines were randomly selected from two adjacent rows, with 10 vines per row. This
    criterion of narrow sample selection increases confidence in the coherence of
    the measurements, as it ensures an optimal data acquisition procedure under conditions
    of low temporal and spatial variability within each measurement, without compromising
    the variability observed in the field. This experimental design also allowed for
    the assessment of solar radiation effects, as both sides of the canopy (east and
    west) were studied under contrasting incident radiation. The field trial, detailed
    in Section 2.2.1, was carried out during the ripening period in 2019 (20 and 22
    July) and 2020 (24, 29 and 31 August), from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 2.2. Field and Reference
    Measurements 2.2.1. Field Measurements Wind speed (U) was measured with a 3D sonic
    anemometer (Gill Windmaster Pro, Gill Instruments Limited, Hampshire, UK). To
    avoid gust peaks, the wind speed was recalculated using a 300-s running average
    over the incoming wind signal [30] and corrected by applying Equation (1) to wind
    speed measured 3 m above the ground surface [9]: 𝑈= 𝑈 𝑧 . 4.87 𝑙𝑛(67.8 𝑧−5.42)
    (1) where U is the wind speed (m·s−1) measured at 2 m above the ground surface,
    Uz is the wind speed (m·s−1) measured in z m above the ground surface, and z is
    the height above the ground surface (m) at which the wind speed is measured. Air
    temperature (Tair) and relative humidity (RH) were recorded using a thermohygrometer
    (CS215-PWS Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) placed 2 m above the soil surface.
    Net radiation (Rn) was measured with a net radiometer (NR2, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge,
    UK), installed above the top of the canopy. Soil heat flux (G) was measured with
    six heat flux plates (Hukseflux HFP01, Hukseflux Thermal Sensors, Delft, The Netherlands),
    placed at 5 mm depth, one under the canopy, and the others 0.5 m apart, perpendicular
    to the vine row and covering all the inter-row. Soil heat flux data are presented
    as the average of all six measurements. Soil and meteorological sensors were connected
    to a datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) and data was collected
    every minute and averaged every five minutes. Plant water status was assessed
    by pre-dawn leaf water potential (ΨPD) measurements on each sampling date using
    a Scholander-type pressure chamber. Water vapor gas exchange was also monitored
    by measuring stomatal conductance to water vapor (gsw) on adult leaves from each
    side of the canopy, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., using a steady state porometer (LI-1600,
    LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). A summary of the field measurements is shown in Table
    1. Table 1. Summary of field measurements and instrumentation. 2.2.2. Characterization
    of the Climate and Grapevine Water Status The study zone’s climate is Mediterranean,
    with hot and dry summers and mild rainy winters. Accumulated rainfall from October
    to August ranged from 341 to 466 mm in 2019 and 2020, respectively (Table 2).
    Table 2. Characterization of rainfall patterns. Accumulated rainfall during grapevine
    dormancy, from October (Oct) to December (Dec) of the previous year’s vintage
    (year (i − 1)), dormancy to flowering (January–May), and berry development to
    grape ripening (June (Jun) to August (Aug)) of the harvest year (year (i)) and
    the cumulative rainfall from October of the previous year to August. Hourly averaged
    net solar radiation above the canopy (Rn, W·m−2), soil heat flux (G, W·m−2), air
    temperature (Tair, °C), wind speed (U, m·s−1), and air vapor pressure deficit
    (VPD, kPa), during the experimental period and measured on the experimental plot,
    are shown in Figure 1. All measurements were taken under clear-sky conditions.
    Tair and VPD followed a similar daily pattern. In the afternoon, the VPD was always
    above 3 kPa and reached 4.5 to 5 kPa between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. The wind speed,
    U, was moderate, with a maximum of 4.4 m·s−1. The vineyard row orientation and
    the apparent daily course of the sun influenced the soil heat flux. The G increased
    from the early hours of the day until 2 p.m., when it almost reached its maximum
    value, and decreased after 3 p.m. when Rn decreased. Rn, soil G, Tair, and VPD
    showed a similar diurnal pattern during all measurement periods. Figure 1. Atmospheric
    and Soil Variable Patterns on the Measurement Days. The figure illustrates the
    measurements of net solar radiation above the canopy (Rn, W·m−2), Soil heat flux
    (G, W·m−2), air temperature (Tair, °C), wind speed (U, m·s−1), and air vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD, kPa) measured on 20 and 22 August 2019 and 24, 29 and 31 July 2020
    on the experimental plot. The values represent means, and the vertical bars indicate
    the standard error of the mean plots (n = 12). Predawn leaf water potential (ΨPD)
    varied between −0.4 and −0.6 MPa, corresponding to a condition of moderate to
    severe stress in grapevine, considered adequate to produce high-standard wines
    [2,31] (Table 3). A moderate recovery in ΨPD was observed after each irrigation
    event, with an increase of more than 0.1 MPa, (e.g., on 22 August 2019, and on
    24 and 29 July 2020). Table 3. Predawn leaf water potential (ΨPD) of grapevines
    on the measurement days. The table displays measurements of predawn leaf water
    potential (ΨPD) of grapevines on specific measurement days. Measurements were
    conducted on 20 August (before irrigation) and 22 August 2019 (after irrigation)
    at 4–5 a.m., as well as on the 24 July (after irrigation), 29 July 29 (before
    irrigation), and 31 July 2020 (after irrigation). The data is presented as the
    mean (Avg) and standard error of the mean (SE) of five replicates per day. 2.2.3.
    Reference Actual Crop Evapotranspiration Measurements An EC system installed on
    the experimental plot was used to record actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act
    meas) simultaneously with U. A part of the collected data was used as a target
    variable in the model training phase and a part as an external validation dataset.
    The EC system consisted of a fast response, 0.1 Hz, open path CO2/H2O analyzer
    (LI-6500 DS, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) and a 3D sonic anemometer (Gill Windmaster
    Pro, Gill Instruments Limited, Hampshire, UK) connected to a Smartflux 3 system
    (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The sonic anemometer and the open path CO2/H2O
    analyzer were installed at a height of 3.0 m above the ground surface, over the
    top of the canopy. A fetch of at least 300 m, facing the prevailing north winds
    and covering the experimental field ensured that all fluxes within the area of
    interest were measured. The quality of the recorded data was tested and analyzed
    with the EddyPro software v7.0.6 (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The measurements
    enabled us to record the registered actual evapotranspiration (ETc act meas) at
    a high temporal resolution, every 1/10 s. More than 90% of the daily data flux
    of the dataset analyzed here had an energy balance closure greater than 0.95.
    Consequently, the uncertainty of the measured ETc act meas values was less than
    5%, which corresponded to an ETc act meas measurement uncertainty of less than
    0.002 mm h−1 on the hourly flux determination of 90% of the data. Despite the
    significant differences between the ETc act meas recorded before and after irrigation
    days, similar patterns were found in the ETc act meas recorded before irrigation
    and in the ETc act meas recorded after irrigation (Figure 2). Irrespective of
    the irrigation difference, the ETc act meas increased exponentially from the early
    morning hours, reaching its peak between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. In 2020, when the
    grapevines were less stressed after irrigation (Table 3), the maximum ETc act
    meas reading was recorded at 1 p.m., when the air VPD reached 3.5 MPa, and decreased
    towards the end of the day, regardless of the energy available for water evaporation.
    In both years, prior to irrigation, and under more severe water stress conditions,
    the maximum ETc act meas reading was registered at 11 a.m. and was maintained
    at a similar level for an extended period, only decreasing after 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.
    (Figure 2). These results are consistent with the strong regulation of gsw on
    grapevine transpiration [4], and the large contribution of plant transpiration
    compared to soil evaporation to total evapotranspiration in vineyards. While before
    irrigation, ETc act meas ranged from 0.06 to less than 0.2 mm·h−1, the recorded
    ETc act meas after irrigation was on average 1.3 to 1.4 times higher, thus suggesting
    larger stomata opening and greater water loss through transpiration. Figure 2.
    Actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act meas) measured in the experimental plot.
    The figure displays the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act meas) measured
    in the experimental plot using an Eddy covariance flux tower. Measurements were
    taken on the 20 and 22 August 2019, before and after irrigation, respectively,
    as well as on the 24 July, after irrigation, 29 July, before irrigation, and after
    irrigation on 31 July 2020. The values represent means, and the vertical bars
    indicate the standard error of the mean plots. 2.3. Developed Methodology 2.3.1.
    Data Processing and Analysis In order to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration,
    under non-standard conditions (ETc act est), from weather and plant variables
    using machine learning techniques, the initial field measurement data underwent
    a transformation to create a suitable data structure for processing and analysis.
    The original data were structured into a nine-dimensional vector composed of the
    seven measured variables (gsw, ETc act meas, Tair, RH, U, Rn, and G) and two derived
    variables (Rn—G and VPD), with 600 measurements per variable. VPD was calculated
    using Tair and RH as described in Equations (2)–(5) (Table 1). To train the machine
    learning models (MLA) to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration, ETc act est,
    the ETc act meas recorded in the experimental plot was used as the label/dependent
    variable (target), and the variables gsw, VPD, Rn, G, U, and Tair were initially
    considered as predictors, subject to the results of the pre-processing analysis.
    The predictor variables were selected from the crop and meteorological variables
    with the greatest influence on ETc act according to the literature. Data pre-processing
    included outlier analysis, variable correlation analysis, and data structuring
    into an internal training and testing set, and an external validation dataset.
    Outliers were identified by the interquartile range (IQR) method with a cut-off
    of 1.5 × IQR. Scores that fell below 1.5 × IQR − Q1 (the 1st or 25% quartile)
    or above 1.5 × IQR + Q3 (the 3rd or 75% quartile) were considered as outliers
    and removed from the dataset. To avoid multicollinearity of the model, the correlation
    of the variables was analyzed by a Pearson product-moment correlation test. Variables
    not correlating below −0.6 or above a threshold of 0.6 were selected as good candidates
    for ETc act predictors. Consequently, the variable Tair was removed based on this
    criterion. After removing the outliers and discarding the variable, the data were
    randomly split into three datasets: A training and testing dataset containing
    40% of the 2019 and 2020 data, and two validation datasets, one containing the
    remaining 2019 data, and the other containing the remaining 2020 data (Figure
    3). The three datasets were configured to maintain similar data patterns (Table
    4). Figure 3. Data structure. The original data was divided into three final datasets:
    a training and testing dataset containing 40% of all data from the years 2019
    and 2020, and two external validation datasets containing the remaining data from
    the years 2019 and 2020. Table 4. Model predictors and characterization of response
    variables. The table provides variable characterization for each pooled dataset
    (training, testing, and validation). It includes stomatal conductance to water
    vapor (gsw), net radiation above the canopy minus soil heat flux (Rn − G), wind
    speed (U), air vapor pressure deficit above the canopy (VPD), and crop evapotranspiration
    measured by the Eddy covariance method under non-standard conditions (ETc act
    meas). The data are characterized by the total number of cases (N), the mean of
    the variable (Mean), the minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) values, the standard
    deviation (SD), and the respective coefficient of variation (CV, %). 2.3.2. Modeling
    Vineyard Actual Evapotranspiration under Non-Standard Conditions The pooled training
    dataset (Figure 3) was used to train and fit a set of supervised machine learning
    regression models to predict ETc act pred, employing a five-fold cross-validation
    scheme to protect against overfitting. The selected model predictors, as detailed
    above, were the daily course of net radiation (Rn, W·m−2), soil heat flux (G,
    W·m−2), air vapor pressure deficit (VPD, kPa), wind speed (U, m·s−1) measured
    above the canopy, as well as the stomatal conductance to water vapor (gsw, m·s−1).
    The pooled training dataset, ETc act meas data, recorded in the field (Figure
    3), was used as the target variable. For modeling purposes, the units of gsw were
    converted to m·s−1 using the molar density of the air (mol.m−3), and Rn after
    subtracting G to determine the energy available for crop ET processes. Accordingly,
    a set of supervised machine learning models was developed, using Matlab R2021b
    (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), which included: (a) A non-parametric kernel-based
    probabilistic model (Gaussian process regression model—GPR), using either an exponential
    kernel function or a squared exponential kernel function; (b) A support vector
    machine (SVM) regression model using either a linear kernel function, a quadratic
    kernel function, a cubic kernel function, or a medium Gaussian kernel function;
    (c) An ensemble of regression trees (ERT), either using least-squares boosting
    regression trees learners or using bootstrap-aggregating (bagging) regression
    trees learners. 2.4. Methodology to Evaluate the Predictive Accuracy of MLA Models
    in Estimating Actual Crop Evapotranspiration To assess the predictive accuracy
    of the proposed MLA models, the actual crop evapotranspiration predicted by the
    models, ETc act pred, was compared to the ETc act meas measurements recorded in
    the field by the Eddy covariance method. To better examine the performance of
    the proposed models, we also compared the predictive accuracy of ETc act estimated
    by the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method with the values from the same dataset of ETc act meas
    recorded in the field using the Eddy covariance method. Finally, the accuracy
    of MLA models for predicting ETc act was verified by comparison with the accuracy
    of the recommended standard method FAO-56 Kc-ET0 for estimating ETc act. 2.4.1.
    Predictive Accuracy of MLA Models to Estimate Actual Crop Evapotranspiration The
    accuracy of the MLA proposals for predicting ETc act was verified by comparing
    the fitted values of all models with the ETc act meas measures recorded in the
    field by the Eddy covariance method. The predictive accuracy of the MLA models
    was evaluated according to the method described in Section 2.4.3. 2.4.2. Predictive
    Accuracy of the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 Model to Estimate Actual Crop Evapotranspiration
    The accuracy of the predicted ETc act using the recommended standard method FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 was compared to the ETc act meas measurements recorded in the field by
    the Eddy covariance method. To predict ETc act using the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 standard
    method, ET0 was first calculated according to the method proposed by [9] using
    data from the farm’s meteorological station. A detailed description of the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 method can be found in the work by [9]. In this study, the dual crop coefficient
    Kc approach was employed to assess crop evapotranspiration (ETc). This approach
    involves splitting Kc into two factors that separately describe the components
    soil evaporation (Ke) and grapevine transpiration (Kcb). The basal crop coefficient
    (Kcb) was estimated by the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained
    from Sentinel 2 imagery time-series with a spatial resolution of 10 m, following
    the model presented in [32] (Equation (6)). Kcb = 1.44 × NDVI − 0.10 (6) The model
    presented in [32] was developed for a vineyard with the same cultivar and rootstock,
    and a similar climate and crop management, showing a high coefficient of determination
    (R2 = 0.96). Thus, Equation (6) was selected to estimate Kcb from the NDVI measured
    in the experimental plot. As the grapevines in the study were subjected to some
    stress, a stress coefficient (Ks) was applied to Kcb to assess ETc act according
    to the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 methodology, following Equation (7): ETc act = (Ke + Ks ×
    Kcb) × ET0 (7) The calculation of Ks was based on Equation (8), as described in
    [32]: Ks = 1.217 × e(1.444×ΨPD) (8) The predictive accuracy of the FAO-56 Kc-ET0
    standard method was evaluated according to the method described in Section 2.4.3.
    2.4.3. Comparative Analysis of the Predictive Accuracy of MLA Models and the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 Method for Estimating Actual Crop Evapotranspiration The models’ predictive
    accuracy was assessed for the pairs model—dataset by examining the coefficient
    of determination (R2) of the trained models and comparing the goodness of fit
    measures of the simulated vs. observed ETc act. For this purpose, we used the
    Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE), which is defined as follows: 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦
    ̂ 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 𝑛 − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (9) where ŷi and yi are the predicted
    and measured actual crop ET, respectively, for the i-th segment of the dataset
    and n is the number of ETc act measurements used in each dataset. To avoid the
    differences in ETc act between different datasets, the relative error (|E|) was
    calculated and expressed as a percentage, from the expression: |E|= | ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1
    ( 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 )| ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 ×100 (10) 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Characterization
    and Correlations of Actual Crop Evapotranspiration Predictors Figure 4 shows the
    correlation between all variables trained as predictors of actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act) before data was split into datasets. Since air temperature (Tair) showed
    a positive and significant correlation with air VPD (R = 0.97, p < 0.001), Tair
    was not used as a predictor of ETc act to avoid multicollinearity. All variables
    correlated positively and significantly (p < 0.001) with the target variable (ETc
    act meas). With the exception of Rn-G, the energy available for the ET process,
    which showed a correlation coefficient (R) value with ETc act meas twice that
    of the other predictors, all others correlate in a similar order of magnitude.
    None of the predictors per se explained more than 40% of the variability of the
    ETc act meas, thus suggesting that non-linear relationships between predictors
    and the ETc act meas may be involved, and/or the interaction between the variables
    are the main contributors to the observed variability. Figure 4. Correlogram Showing
    Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients. The figure displays the Pearson
    product-moment correlation coefficients between pairs of variables selected as
    predictor candidates for actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act). The variables
    include meteorological variables such as Rn-G (the energy available for crop evapotranspiration
    processes, calculated as the net solar radiation above the canopy (Rn) minus the
    soil heat flux (G)), U (the wind speed above the canopy), VPD (the air vapor pressure
    deficit), and Tair (the air temperature). Additionally, the grapevine variable
    gsw (stomatal conductance to water vapor) and field-measured actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act meas) are included in the correlation analysis. All correlation coefficients
    are significantly different from zero (p < 0.001). Correlations of similar magnitude
    are depicted with the same color, according to the color code shown below. Table
    4 shows the characterization of the datasets used for training and testing, as
    well as for external validation of the MLA approach and FAO-56 Kc-ET0 models.
    The table shows considerable variability within each variable across all datasets,
    as indicated by the coefficient of variation (CV). This variability can be attributed
    to how the different variables changed throughout the day. Despite the variability,
    the mean and the amplitude of data variability, represented by the maximum (Max)
    and minimum (Min) values, as well as the standard deviation (SD) of each variable
    (both predictor and target variables), were found to be similar between datasets
    (Table 4). 3.2. Evaluation of MLA Models in Estimating Actual Crop Evapotranspiration
    Table 5 shows the fitted supervised machine learning (MLA) models that were trained
    and tested to estimate ETc act using the variables Rn, G, U, VPD, and gsw as predictors.
    In the testing phase, all trained models achieved a high and significant coefficient
    of determination (R2), thus indicating high efficiency in predicting the ETc act.
    The poorer model was the SVM approach, using a linear kernel function, which yielded
    an R2 score of 0.746. The two ERT approaches, the SVM model, using a medium Gaussian
    kernel function, and the GPR, using an exponential kernel function, showed the
    best performance in predicting the ETc act, with R2 values between 0.910 and 0.992.
    The high and significant R2 of all MLA regression models (Table 5) indicates that
    the selected variables (gsw, Rn-G, U, and VPD) account for a very high proportion
    of the observed ETc act variability, suggesting that they are robust explanatory
    variables of the ETc act. Table 5. Fitted Machine Learning Algorithms for actual
    vineyard evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc act). The table
    presents the results of fitted Machine Learning Algorithms for actual vineyard
    evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc act) using the pooled dataset
    for training and testing. The data was obtained from the years 2019 and 2020,
    based on actual vineyard evapotranspiration measured by the Eddy covariance method
    in the field (n = 236). The values of the coefficient of determination (R2) for
    all the algorithms are significant (p < 0.001). Table 6 presents the goodness-of-fit
    measures for the MLA approaches used to estimate the ETc act using the validation
    dataset with the variables Rn, G, U, VPD, and gsw. The results of the validation
    phase were consistent with those of training and testing. Except for the SVM implementing
    a linear kernel function, the model validation process demonstrated the high accuracy
    of the remaining MLA models for predicting the ETc act. The results showed a correlation
    (R) between observed and fitted values greater than 0.880 and a maximum root mean
    square error (RMSE) of 0.032 mm·h−1, which is below the minimum ETc act value
    recorded in both years (as shown in Table 6 and Figure 5). Figure 5. Relationship
    between observed and estimated crop evapotranspiration. This figure illustrates
    the relationship between the observed crop evapotranspiration (ETc act meas, mm·h−1),
    recorded with an Eddy covariance flux tower, and the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act est, mm·h−1) estimated by different supervised machine learning algorithms.
    Each subfigure shows a specific algorithm used for estimation. (A) recorded ETc

    The data validation samples from 2019 are represented with circles (n = 185),
    and data from 2020 are represented with triangles (n = 174). The dotted line in
    each subfigure represents the 1:1 line, indicating perfect alignment between the
    observed and estimated values. Table 6. Statistical indicators of goodness-of-fit
    measures of the supervised machine learning regression algorithms. The table presents
    statistical indicators of goodness-of-fit measures for estimating vineyard evapotranspiration
    under non-standard conditions (ETc act) using supervised machine learning regression
    algorithms. The data validation was performed with two independent datasets: observed
    (field recorded) vineyard evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc
    act meas) and model-estimated vineyard evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions
    (ETc act est). The datasets are from the years 2019 (n = 185) and 2020 (n = 174).
    The goodness-of-fit measures included are root mean square error (RMSE) and relative
    error (|E|). The analysis of the goodness-of-fit measures of the models in Table
    6 confirmed that the MLA with a linear transformation had the poorest performance
    in estimating the ETc act. However, the MLA models tested with the year 2019 and
    2020 independent validation datasets demonstrated high accuracy potential in predicting
    the ETc act, with R2 values ranging between 0.629 (SVM using a linear kernel function,
    and the 2020 validation dataset) and 0.915 (SVM using a medium Gaussian kernel
    function, and the 2019 validation dataset). The relative error (|E|) of the predictions
    made with the 2019 validation dataset was in the [0.2, 6.3] interval, while with
    the 2020 dataset, the range was [0.7, 5.1], both expressed in percentage. Overall,
    the MLA models exhibited strong predictive capabilities for estimating ETc act,
    as evidenced by their high R2 values and relatively low errors. All algorithms
    explained more than 80% of the ETc act variability present in the validation dataset.
    The GPR using an exponential and a squared exponential kernel function, both ERT,
    using either least squares boosting or bootstrap aggregation methods and the SVM
    with a medium Gaussian kernel function, showed the best accuracy in estimating
    the ETc act. These algorithms explain between 80 and 90% of the variability of
    the ETc act measured in the field while exhibiting an RMSE in the range of 0.019
    to 0.030 mm·h−1. Excluding the SVM using a linear transformation, the MLA algorithms,
    using plant and weather variables, showed a remarkable ability to learn the inner
    relations between ETc act meas, Rn, G, U, and VPD, by predicting the actual vineyard
    ET variability with high accuracy. Similar results were obtained by other authors
    [24,26,27,33,34,35] for other crops. 3.3. Evaluation of FAO-56 Kc-ET0 Method to
    Estimate Actual Crop Evapotranspiration Figure 6 depicts the scatter plot representing
    the relationship between the observed actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act
    meas) recorded with the Eddy covariance method and the estimated actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act est) obtained through the application of the FAO 56 Kc-ET0 method (fitted
    values). The results reveal a noteworthy and statistically significant correlation
    (R = 0.858, p < 0.001) between the observed and fitted data. However, it is evident
    that the variability increases as the magnitude of the observed values rises,
    as illustrated in Figure 6. Moreover, the FAO 56 Kc-ET0 method exhibits a tendency
    to overestimate the actual crop evapotranspiration values, which is consistent
    with findings in other studies concerning olive orchards [36] and peach orchards
    [16]. Consequently, the goodness-of-fit measures indicate an RMSE of 0.059 mm·h−1,
    a value 1.3 to 2.9 times higher than the minimum ETc act recorded in the field
    using the Eddy covariance method. Furthermore, the relative error (|E| = 26.5%)
    is relatively high, indicating certain weaknesses of the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method
    in accurately predicting ETc act in sparse vegetation crops like vineyards. This
    observation underscores the method’s limitations in simulating soil resistance
    and vine stomatal conductance under more stressful conditions, as investigated
    in this study. The observed limitations of the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method in accurately
    estimating ETc act in vineyards are consistent with previous literature, including
    studies by [15,16,19,22,36,37]. Figure 6. Relationship between observed and estimated
    actual crop evapotranspiration. The figure illustrates the relationship between
    the observed actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act meas) recorded using the
    Eddy covariance flux tower, and the actual crop evapotranspiration estimated (ETc
    act est) with the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method. The coefficient of determination (R2)
    and goodness-of-fit measures from data validation with two independent datasets
    of observed vineyard evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc act
    meas) and estimated actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act est) with FAO 56 Kc-ET0
    method from the year 2019 (n = 48, circles) and 2020 (n = 72, triangles) are presented
    in the figure. The Goodness-of-fit measures include root mean square error (RMSE)
    and relative error (|E|). The dotted line in the figure represents the 1:1 line,
    indicating perfect agreement between the observed and estimated values. 3.4. Comparison
    of the Prediction Accuracy of MLA and FAO-56 Kc-ET0 Method to Estimate Actual
    Crop Evpotranspiration With the exception of SVM implementing a linear kernel,
    all MLA proposals demonstrated superior performance in predicting ETc act compared
    to the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method. The scatterplots depicting the relationship between
    the observed ETc act values (recorded with the EC method) and the estimated ETc
    act est values (obtained through MLA) showed a close alignment with the 1:1 line,
    indicating a good fit of all MLA models (see Figure 5). During the validation
    process, the MLA models exhibited a very high and statistically significant coefficient
    of determination (R2) between the simulated and observed values. Moreover, the
    intercept and slope of the MLA fitted values were very close to 0 and 1, respectively,
    further confirming the accuracy of the predictions. In contrast, when compared
    to the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method, only the SVM with a linear kernel exhibited a lower
    R2 and a less satisfactory fit to the observed data. This outcome suggests that
    the SVM with a linear kernel might not be as effective as the other MLA models
    in accurately estimating ETc act under the conditions considered in this study.
    The comparison of accuracy between models, using the external validation dataset,
    clearly indicates that the MLA models outperform the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method. The
    MLA models’ fitted values demonstrated significantly smaller errors (as measured
    by RMSE and |E|) compared to the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method. Specifically, the scatterplots
    between the observed and the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 fitted values showed an RMSE that was
    1.65 to 1.98 times less accurate, in 2019 and 2020, respectively, when compared
    to the worst MLA proposal (SVM with a linear kernel function). Moreover, the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 method was found to be 2.2 to 2.8 times less accurate, in 2019 and 2020,
    respectively, when compared to the best MLA models, namely the GPR with an exponential
    kernel function, and the SVM with a medium Gaussian kernel function. In terms
    of prediction capacity, all MLA models exhibited higher accuracy compared to the
    FAO-56 Kc-ET0 model. The absolute value of the error (|E|) in the MLA predictions
    was more than 6.8 times lower than the values predicted by the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 model,
    as shown in Table 7. Table 7. Comparison of prediction accuracy to estimate actual
    crop evapotranspiration recorded in the field. The table provides a comparison
    of prediction accuracy to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration recorded in
    the field using the Eddy covariance method. It includes results from the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 and the two best machine learning algorithms: GPR (Gaussian process regression)
    using an exponential kernel function, and SVM (Support vector machine) using a
    medium Gaussian kernel function. Prediction accuracy measures include the coefficient
    of determination (R2) of the trained models, and the goodness-of-fit measures
    from the data validation process (root mean square error—RMSE and relative error—|E|).
    These findings further strengthen the superiority of MLA models in accurately
    estimating actual crop evapotranspiration compared to the traditional FAO-56 Kc-ET0
    method. The significant reduction in errors, as indicated by RMSE and |E| values,
    highlights the enhanced predictive capabilities of MLA models in this study. 4.
    Conclusions The present work demonstrates that machine learning regression algorithms,
    when provided with gsw, G, and three meteorological variables (Rn, U, and VPD),
    can accurately predict the ETc act. The five best-performing algorithms explain
    more than 89% of the measured variability in ETc act recorded in the field, with
    RMSE values below 0.03 mm·h−1. The results showcase the MLA’s capacity to estimate
    the ETc act with a simple parameterization and lower computational requirements
    compared to the traditional FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method while retaining robustness in
    calculations. Furthermore, the findings highlight the limitations of the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 method in accurately predicting ETc act for grapevines under deficit irrigation,
    where vine stomatal significantly impacts water usage and soil surface water evaporation
    is limited. In contrast, the presented MLA models, which incorporate gsw as input
    knowledge, proved to be accurate in predicting ETc act under such conditions.
    The study shows that the MLA models are well suited for application in semi-automated
    or automated field data analysis for predicting vineyard ETc act. Their ability
    to continuously process new data in near real time, retrain the algorithm, and
    adapt to new data patterns and associations can enhance prediction accuracy and
    support more efficient irrigation practices. Additionally, the use of machine
    learning algorithms for monitoring the ETc act based on grapevine and atmospheric
    parameters can provide valuable insights for decision support systems aimed at
    optimizing vineyard irrigation management. However, further optimization is required
    concerning the amount of available data and consideration of climatic conditions.
    In conclusion, the study demonstrates the efficacy of MLA algorithms in accurately
    estimating vineyard ETc act, making them a promising approach for water management
    in grapevine cultivation. Nonetheless, future research should focus on refining
    the models with respect to data availability and varying climatic conditions.

    Predicting groundwater levels is challenging, especially in regions of water scarcity
    where data availability is often limited. However, these regions have substantial
    water needs and require cost-effective groundwater utilization strategies. This
    study uses artificial intelligence to predict groundwater levels to provide guidance
    for drilling shallow boreholes for subsistence irrigation. The Bilate watershed,
    located 80 km north of Arba Minch in southern Ethiopia and covering just over
    5250 km2, was selected as the study area. Bilate is typical of areas in Africa
    with high demand for water and limited availability of well data. Using a non-time
    series database of 75 boreholes, machine learning models, including multiple linear
    regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, artificial neural networks,
    random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression (GBR), were constructed
    to predict the depth to the water table. The study considered 20 independent variables,

    Ethiopia is one of the countries in East Africa that is threatened by water scarcity.
    In Ethiopia, rainfed agriculture and small farming predominate. A recent study
    showed that around 95% of the agricultural areas in Ethiopia are rainfed areas
    [1]. A Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) study [2] showed that small farming
    families make up 72% of the total population. In total, 74% of Ethiopia’s farmers
    come from small farming families, and 67% of these live below the national poverty
    line. About 75% of farmland is devoted to cereals. Maize and wheat dominate, complemented
    by teff, barley, sorghum, and rice. Drought is a major stressor that reduces cereal
    yields. Moreover, climate change has induced significant and erratic deviations
    in rainfall patterns over the year and across the country, significantly reducing
    crop yields overall, especially cereals [3]. To mitigate the impact of water stress
    and reduce hunger, utilizing groundwater by drilling wells for irrigation is a
    potential solution to address the problem of increasingly erratic rainfall. Predictions
    of groundwater level, or the depth to water table, could support decisions on
    where to drill wells to extract groundwater. Artificial intelligence (AI) has
    been widely used to predict both the surface [4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and groundwater
    [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21] levels globally. Regarding surface water level
    prediction, Khan and Coulibaly [4] used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to examine
    the long-term water level in Lake Erie in North America based on mean monthly
    water level data from 1918 to 2001. The authors compared SVM with a multilayer
    perceptron (MLP) and with a conventional multiplicative seasonal autoregressive
    model. They found that the SVM outperformed the other two models with an overall
    RMSE of less than 0.25 m. Liang et al. [5] applied SVM and a deep learning model
    based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict daily surface water
    levels in Dongting Lake in China. They found that the LSTM has better accuracy
    than the SVM model with less than 0.1 m RMSE. A river water level study performed
    by Chen and Qiao in 2021 [6] also confirms that LSTM has good performance in predicting
    surface water levels. Choi et al. [7] used four machine learning algorithms, including
    artificial neural networks (ANN), decision tree, random forest (RF), and SVM based
    on the daily water level from 2009 to 2013, to predict water levels from 2013
    to 2015 in Upo wetlands, South Korea. They found that random forest outperformed
    the other three algorithms, with a 0.09 RMSE. Regarding groundwater level prediction,
    in 2013, Sahoo and Jha [11] constructed seventeen site-specific AI models to predict
    groundwater levels in Japan. Compared to multiple linear regression (MLR) models,
    ANN-predicted groundwater levels have a better agreement with RMSE values, ranging
    from 0.04 to 0.4 m for 17 sites. Sahoo et al. [12] developed a modeling framework
    using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network architecture to simulate groundwater
    level changes in two agricultural regions in the US. They found ANN performed
    better than the MLR and multivariate nonlinear regression model with RMSE less
    than 2 m for both the agricultural regions. Zhang et al. [13] developed a new
    model based on LSTM to predict groundwater levels, which outperformed feed-forward
    neural networks and double LSTM with a 0.14 m RMSE. In 2021, Liu et al. [14] applied
    SVM combined with the data assimilation (DA) technique for predicting changes
    in groundwater level. The researchers predicted the change in groundwater levels
    at 1- to 3-month time scales for 46 wells located in the northeast United States
    and found that both the SVM and SVM with DA can adequately predict groundwater
    levels with RMSE less than 4 m. Hikouei et al. [15] demonstrated that Extreme
    Gradient Boosting exhibited superior performance over the RF model for predicting
    groundwater levels in the tropical peatlands of Indonesia. Many recent studies
    employed wavelet-transformed analysis [16,17] and hybrid AI techniques [18,19],
    which had good performance in groundwater level prediction using time series data.
    Missing values in groundwater level time series datasets are a frequent occurrence,
    presenting challenges for accurate forecasting. To address this data gap, previous
    studies have utilized machine learning frameworks to estimate the missing values
    in groundwater level data, resulting in enhanced prediction reliability [22,23].
    Overall, these groundwater level studies provide valuable insights into groundwater
    dynamics and contribute to more effective resource management. Most of these studies
    that use machine learning algorithms employed a large amount of time series data
    to predict future water levels for lakes [4,5,8], rivers [6,9,10], wetlands [7],
    basins [11,17,19], regions [13,16,18,20], aquifers [12], and watersheds [14,21].
    These models generally have good performance with low mean square errors in predictions
    of water levels. These studies were conducted in regions with high data availability
    on both the time series of water level data and climate variables. Even when missing
    values occurred, extensive data availability greatly facilitated the estimation
    of data gaps [22,23]. However, in many regions of interest, a large amount of
    time series of water level data are unlikely to be available due to the high cost
    of data collection for local governments or organizations. Many water scarcity
    areas have a great need for groundwater development for sustainable irrigation,
    although the lack of good data can make models perform poorly. To the best of
    our knowledge, there is no research on groundwater level prediction using machine
    learning based on non-time series data in rainfed agricultural regions. It is
    much more difficult to predict water levels accurately in the absence of time
    series data because previous water level is a strong predictor of current water
    level. The objective of this study is to use AI to identify suitable drilling
    locations for sustainable irrigation for subsistence agriculture in water scarcity
    regions using sparse non-time series data on existing wells. To achieve this objective,
    five machine learning models were constructed to predict groundwater levels. These
    include MLR, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), ANN, random forest
    regression (RFR), and gradient boosting regression (GBR). The models were developed
    using data from 75 existing boreholes in the Bilate watershed in southern Ethiopia.
    The best-performing model was used to predict the groundwater level for hundreds
    of thousands of grid points covering the Bilate region. Finally, a map of predicted
    water levels was created to provide guidance for decision-making on drilling locations
    for local individuals and organizations. Figure 1 shows the workflow of this study.
    Figure 1. The workflow of this study. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 describes the study area, data sources, and methodology used in this
    study; Section 3 shows the main results from each of the machine learning models;
    Section 4 provides a discussion of the results; and Section 5 concludes the paper.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The Bilate watershed is located in southeastern
    Ethiopia at latitude 6°34′ to 8°6′ N and longitude 37°46′ to 38°18′ E. The total
    area is 5276.25 km2. Bilate is one of the largest watersheds in the Ethiopia Rift
    Valley Basin [24,25]. Elevation of the region ranges from 1194 m to 3216 m, as
    shown in Figure 2. The Bilate region was classified as a three-season climate
    type, with major rains from June to September, dry season from October to January,
    and minor rains from February to May [26,27]. In Bilate, the minor rains typically
    start in March. However, for our analysis, we adhered to the general classification,
    commencing from February, as referenced in [24,25]. The annual average precipitation
    within the Bilate watershed spans from 769 mm in lower regions to 1339 mm in the
    highlands. Meanwhile, the mean annual temperature fluctuates between 11 °C and
    22 °C in Hossana, situated upstream, and ranges from 16 °C to 30 °C at Bilate
    Tena, the lower stream of the watershed [24]. The vegetation density in Bilate
    can be generally described as sparse to dense vegetation in the minor and major
    rainy seasons, and sparse vegetation in the dry season. Land in the region is
    mainly cultivated, grassland, plantation, shrubland, and wetland. The northern
    and western parts of the study area are mountainous, whereas the southern and
    eastern parts are lowlands. Distributed lakes in the study area indicate the presence
    of shallow groundwater. Pyroclastic and volcano-sedimentary rocks are dominant
    outcrops in the study area. The productivity of the aquifers varies from moderately
    productive to highly productive with an average transmissivity range between 1.03
    × 10−5 and 2.78 × 10−1 m/s2 [28]. Figure 2. Bilate watershed (pink region on the
    lower left plot) belongs to a basin called Rift Valley (light green basin on the
    upper left plot). The map of Bilate watershed with boreholes and elevation [29]
    is shown on the right. 2.2. Data Description In this study, the dependent variable
    is the static water level. Field data on 75 boreholes were collected by Arba Minch
    Water Technology Institute (AWTI) in 2007 [30]. Although the dataset was collected
    fifteen years ago, changes in static water level during the intervening years
    would have very little impact on our analysis. Any change would likely be within
    a few centimeters, which is small in relation to the accuracy of our analysis.
    Therefore, the existing historical dataset is useful to demonstrate the value
    of machine learning for predicting water levels. Initially, we explored a broader
    range of variables, identifying a subset that demonstrated greater influence on
    our predictions. The method we employed for feature selection involved a synergistic
    approach that combined domain expertise—where we incorporated factors known to
    be critical in our field—with a backward stepwise feature selection using random
    forest regression, which iteratively removed the least significant variables based
    on mean square error criteria on the out-of-bag samples. This directed our attention
    towards incorporating this subset, resulting in the consideration of twenty independent
    variables for our modeling and analysis. These included elevation, soil type,
    meteorological variables (i.e., precipitation, specific humidity, wind speed,
    and land surface temperature (LST) at day and night time) and vegetation (i.e.,
    NDVI) for the three seasons from October 2005 to September 2007. We chose to use
    data from a time period that closely aligned with when the static water level
    was measured. We had the coordinates for each of the 75 boreholes and have extracted
    the values for each variable from the raw dataset. Given that the resolution varied
    for different independent variables, borehole points that were close to each other
    might have the same extracted value, particularly for predictors with sparse resolution.
    Details on the sources of the dependent and independent variables are summarized
    in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1. Summary of data sources. Table 2. Description
    of dependent and independent variables. Nearly all the borehole points in the
    data set are located in areas categorized as cultivation or grassland. As mentioned,
    the purpose of this study is to predict groundwater levels to support decision-making
    on the optimal borehole drilling locations for agricultural irrigation. Based
    on the local conditions, it is unusual to place a borehole in a forest, wetland,
    or shrubland. For this reason, only observations in cultivated and grassland areas
    were included in the training and testing data sets, and the model does not predict
    groundwater levels for the forest, wetland, and shrubland. Machine learning models
    were built using a training dataset consisting of 63 randomly selected observations.
    Performance was then evaluated on a testing set made up of the remaining 12 observations.
    Each algorithm was subjected to fifteen individual experiments. For MLR and MARS,
    models were constructed based on fifteen diverse and randomly selected training
    sets. For ANN, RFR, and GBR, five different random data separations were used,
    and three experiments were carried out for each training dataset. Performing a
    variety of experiments is important to verify the model’s ability to effectively
    generalize to unseen data. This paper mainly presents and discusses models with
    median performance. The model comparisons are based on consistent training and
    testing data separations across all algorithms. The average performance scores
    from the fifteen experiments are also reported, providing a comprehensive understanding
    of each model’s effectiveness. To predict groundwater levels for a larger area
    in the Bilate region, we generated a grid with a resolution 100 m × 100 m that
    covered the Bilate region. The data for twenty independent variables for each
    grid point were prepared and processed in the same manner as for the original
    dataset of 75 boreholes. As the resolution of the grid points was relatively high,
    grid points that fell within the same spatial resolution unit of a variable would
    have identical extracted values. The primary software tools used for data preparation
    and visualization were QGIS 3.24.1 [37] and R 4.1.3 [38]. 2.3. Resampling Methods
    2.3.1. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation Cross-validation (CV) is a resampling technique
    to check the generalization ability of a model on a limited sample. The k-fold
    CV method randomly divides the observations into k groups/folds of approximately
    equal size [39]. The first fold is used as the validation set. The remaining folds
    are used to fit a model. This process repeats k times, and a different fold is
    used as the validation set each time. The CV estimate is finally computed as the
    average of the mean square error on each validation set. Leave-one-out CV (LOOCV)
    is a special case of cross-validation, where k is the number of samples [39].
    In LOOCV, the model is fit based on the entire dataset with one observation excluded.
    Next, the fitted model is used to predict the one observation that was left out.
    Then, the process is repeated n times, leaving out a different observation each
    time, where n is the number of observations in the data set. As the dataset is
    small, we performed LOOCV across the machine learning models in this study. 2.3.2.
    Bootstrapping Bootstrapping is a resampling method that randomly samples values
    with replacements. It is mainly employed in the construction of RFR models. In
    the context of RFR, each decision tree within the forest is trained on a distinct
    dataset, generated by bootstrapping the original training set. This ensures each
    dataset is of the same size as the original, but composed of a subset of the original
    data, with some samples likely repeated. This process introduces randomness into
    the model-building phase, which aids in preventing overfitting and improves model
    robustness by ensuring that each individual tree within the forest learns from
    a slightly different sample of the data. 2.4. Machine Learning Algorithms Machine
    learning is a branch of AI focused on building systems that learn from data. It
    has been widely applied in science and engineering. Application areas include
    hydrogeology [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,40], cyber security [41,42],
    transportation [43,44], and aerospace engineering [45,46,47]. By identifying patterns
    in data, the computer can learn a decision rule from data without explicit programming.
    Over time, with more data, machine learning models can make increasingly accurate
    predictions or decisions. 2.4.1. Multiple Linear Regression A multiple linear
    regression model [48] was built to identify factors that affected the groundwater
    level and, therefore, to estimate the groundwater level. The general form of a
    linear regression model was defined as: f(X)= β 0 + ∑ j=1 p X j β j , (1) where
    β 0 is the intercept; β 1 , β 2 ,…, β p are the coefficients; and X 1 , X 2 ,…,
    X p are the predictors. The coefficients β 0 , β 2 ,…, β p are estimated from
    the training data to optimize a measure of fit, typically the sum of squared residuals.
    2.4.2. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline MARS is a nonparametric regression
    method that creates a piece-wise linear model so that the relationship between
    the predictor and the response can be different for different ranges of predictors
    [49]. The model begins with a simple constant model and iteratively adds basis
    functions that best reduce the sum of squared residuals. The basis functions are
    created using hinge functions that form piecewise linear relationships. A hinge
    function takes a single variable and a constant as input, returning the difference
    between the variable and the constant when the variable is greater than the constant,
    and zero otherwise. For a cut point a, a pair of hinge functions are defined as:
    h(x−a)={x−a if x>a,0 otherwise} h(a−x)={a−x if x<a,0 otherwise}, (2) where x is
    a given variable. Each time a pair of basis functions is added, the model chooses
    the variable and the constant that minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS).
    In order to control overfitting, MARS then performs a backward deletion process.
    It removes basis functions that contribute the least to the model’s predictive
    power based on the generalized cross-validation (GCV) score or Akaike Information
    Criterion (AIC) score. The backward pass prunes the model by eliminating the terms
    one by one until the best subset is found for the model. The one with the lowest
    GCV or AIC score is usually chosen as the final model. 2.4.3. Artificial Neural
    Networks ANN is a machine-learning model inspired by the neural structure of the
    brain. An ANN model transforms inputs into outputs through a series of hidden
    layers to an output layer. For a regression model with a single hidden layer,
    the form of the ANN model [50] is defined as: p(y│x,θ)=N(y│ w T z(x), σ 2 ) z(x)=g(Vx)=[g(
    v T 1 x),…,g( v T H x)], (3) where g is a non-linear activation function; z(x)
    is the hidden layer, which is a deterministic function of the input; H is the
    number of hidden units; V is the weight matrix from the inputs to the hidden nodes;
    and w is the weight vector from the hidden nodes to the output. Figure 3 shows
    a simple neural network with only one hidden layer. The weights are typically
    estimated through an iterative procedure that finds a local minimum of a goodness
    of fit measure, typically the sum of squared residuals. Figure 3. A simple neural
    network with one hidden layer [50]. 2.4.4. Random Forest Regression The random
    forest regression algorithm, proposed by Breiman in 2001, is a supervised learning
    algorithm that produces a forecast based on many decision trees [51]. Each tree
    is built based on a bootstrap sample of the training data. At each decision node
    of each tree, the best split is chosen among the number of randomly selected predictors.
    The splitting process terminates at a leaf node when a termination criterion is
    met. To make a prediction at a point, the tree is traversed to find the leaf node
    corresponding to the independent variables corresponding to the point, and the
    dependent variables for the data points at the leaf nodes are averaged [52]. This
    procedure, creating decision trees based on different bootstrap samples and then
    averaging the predictions from all the trees, is called bootstrap aggregation,
    or bagging. The bagging technique in the RFR model tends to reduce the variance
    of predictions, but a bias still exists. Specifically, as the prediction is the
    average of the output from all leaf nodes, observations with small values tend
    to be overestimated and those with large values tend to be underestimated. This
    tendency to bias has been identified in previous studies [53,54]. Our results
    showed a bias in the initial RFR model. To correct the bias, a post-processing
    bias-correcting transformation to the RFR predictions was made [54]. For the linear
    transformation, a linear regression model was fitted to find the intercept (β0)
    and slope (β1) of the transformed prediction: f(ŷ) = β0 + β1 × ŷ (4) where ŷ is
    the predicted response value by the initial random forest model on training data;
    β0 is the coefficient for the intercept, and β1 is the coefficient for ŷ. The
    objective is to find the parameters that minimize the mean square error: min β
    0 , β 1 1/n∗∑ (f( ŷ i )− y i ) 2 (5) 2.4.5. Gradient Boosting Regression Gradient
    boosting regression (GBR) is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple
    weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive
    model. Initially, the ensemble is empty. The model starts with an initial prediction,
    typically the mean of the response variable. The difference between the observed
    values and the initial prediction, known as the residuals, is calculated. These
    residuals represent the errors that the model needs to correct. Then, a decision
    tree is trained to predict the residuals. The tree is constructed to minimize
    a specific loss function using gradient descent optimization. The loss function
    we used in this study is defined as: L( y i ,f( x i ))= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 1 2 ( y i −f(
    x i )) 2 (6) where y i is the ith observed value; f( x i ) is the predicted response
    value; and n is the number of observations. Next, the predictions from the decision
    tree are combined with the current ensemble’s predictions to obtain an updated
    prediction. This updated prediction is added to the ensemble. Then, the residuals
    are recalculated using the updated predictions. The new residuals represent the
    errors that were not captured by the current ensemble. The process continues for
    a specified number of iterations or until a certain stopping criterion is met.
    The final prediction is obtained by summing the predictions from the entire ensemble.
    By iteratively correcting the errors of the previous models, gradient boosting
    regression is able to learn complex relationships and improve predictive accuracy.
    2.5. Evaluation Metrics The evaluation metrics presented in this paper include
    mutual information (MI), root mean square error (RMSE), median absolute error
    (MAE), and R-squared. In the definitions below, y i denotes the i th observed
    value; y ̂ i denotes the i th predicted value; and y      denotes the mean
    of the observed values. MI measures the degree of relatedness between the datasets
    [55]. A higher MI value shows that the dependent variable (y) has higher relatedness
    to the corresponding independent variable (x). MI(Y;X)= ∑ 𝑥∈𝑋 ∑ 𝑦∈𝑌 p(x,y)log(
    p(x,y) p(x)p(y) ), (7) where p(x, y) represents the joint probability function
    of x and y; p(x) and p(y) are the marginal probability functions of x and y, respectively.
    RMSE describes how far the predictions deviate from the actual values. A small
    RMSE represents a good performance of the model. RMSE= ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ̂ i )
    2 n − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (8) MAE measures the median of absolute errors
    between the predicted and observed values. Similar to RMSE, it is also used to
    describe how well the data fit the model. MAE=Median(| y ̂ i − y i |) (9) R-squared
    represents how much variation for a dependent variable is explained by an independent
    variable. R 2 =1− ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ̂ i ) 2 ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y      ) 2 ,
    (10) 3. Results In this section, we detail the mutual information analysis and
    outcomes from all the implemented methods. We primarily focus on results from
    one training and testing data partition used consistently across all methods.
    This training and testing split was chosen because it yielded close to median
    performance across all models. For the ANN, RFR, and GBR methods, three experiments
    were conducted for each data partition; of these, the models with median performance
    were selected. Primary results associated with all algorithms include plots of
    residuals versus predicted values and observed versus predicted values for both
    training and testing data. Furthermore, tables are presented summarizing the performance
    metrics of the models. These include results based on a single experiment with
    median performance, as well as average scores across the fifteen experiments.
    3.1. Mutual Information Analysis A zero MI value indicates no mutual dependence
    or relatedness between the specific independent variable and the static water
    level. A larger MI value represents a stronger relatedness. Figure 4 shows that
    the variables precipitation Oct to Jan (X3), precipitation Jun to Aug (X5), and
    specific humidity Jun to Sep (X8) have relatively stronger relatedness to static
    water level. On the other hand, Wind speed Oct to Jan (X9), Wind speed Jun to
    Sep (X11), and NDVI Feb to May (X19) showed weaker relatedness. The soil type
    (X2) is removed from the mutual information analysis because it is a categorical
    variable. Figure 4. Mutual information between independent variables and the dependent
    variable. 3.2. Multiple Linear Regression Before building the MLR, highly correlated
    predictors were removed. If a pair of predictors have a correlation equal to or
    greater than 0.85, the R function findCorrelation() randomly picks one predictor
    to remove. The remaining predictors include soil type (X2), precipitation (X3–5),
    wind speed from Feb to May (X10), LST at daytime from Feb to May (X13), LST at
    nighttime from Oct to Jan (X15), NDVI from Feb to May (X19), and NDVI from Jun
    to Sep (X20). Table 3 shows the predictors remaining after removal along with
    their coefficients. We found the factors, including the euric vertisols soil type
    (X2) and NDVI from Jun to Sep (X20), had a significant relationship with the static
    water level at a 0.05 significance level. Table 3. Summary of MLR. To examine
    the normality assumption of a linear regression model, we created a Quantile–Quantile
    (Q–Q) plot and a residual plot. The Q–Q plot shown in Figure 5 shows that the
    points are approximately distributed along the line with light upper and lower
    tails. No evident pattern was found on the residual plot (Figure 6a). We also
    performed a Shapiro–Wilk normality test on residuals with the null hypothesis
    that the residuals are normally distributed. The p-value is approximately 0.51,
    which is much greater than the conventional 0.05 level for statistical significance;
    therefore, the null hypothesis of normality cannot be rejected. The model performance
    results are shown in Table 4 and Table 5 and will be discussed in Section 4.2.

    predicted values (m) on training sample for (a) MLR; (b) MARS; (c) ANN; (d) Original
    RFR; (e) RFR with linear transformation; (f) GBR. Table 4. Model performance evaluation
    based on one experiment with median performance. Table 5. Average model performance
    score based on multiple experiments for each model. 3.3. Multivariate Adaptive
    Regression Spline Similar to MLR, we built a MARS model using the training data.
    The hyperparameters tuned for the MARS model included the interaction complexity
    (degree) and the number of terms to retain in the final model (nprune). We evaluated
    the degree from 1 to 3 and nprune values from 2 to 20. The final settings for
    the degree and nprune were 3 and 8, respectively. The MARS model was built with
    a backward elimination feature selection process. The backward pass prunes the
    model by eliminating the terms one by one until the best subset is found for the
    model. The generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion was used to evaluate each
    subset and was also considered as the variable importance measure. Figure 7 shows
    that the first three most important variables include LST daytime from Feb to
    May (X13), precipitation from Feb to May (X4), and wind speed from Oct to Jan
    (X9). Soil type (X2) eutric vertisols has an importance value of zero indicating
    that this predictor did not contribute to the predictive power of the model and
    was never used in any of the MARS basis functions in the pruned final model. Figure
    7. Variable importance plots: (a) MARS; (b) RFR; (c) GBR. Even though MARS, being
    a nonparametric technique, does not assume linearity and homoscedasticity, the
    residual plot can still provide valuable diagnostic information about how well
    the model fits the data. Figure 6 shows that the residuals are randomly scattered
    around zero, indicating that the variance of the error is approximately constant
    across all levels of the independent variables. This is a desirable property.
    3.4. Artificial Neural Networks The training of the ANN model was executed using
    the nnet and caret packages in R. The nnet package is designed to support a single
    hidden layer sandwiched between the input and output layers. In the preprocessing
    stage, the model is set to center and scale predictors, which is a common strategy
    to normalize variable scales. Suited to regression tasks, the output layer of
    the neural network uses a linear activation function. The model incorporates key
    hyperparameters, such as weight decay for regularization, and the size, which
    determines the number of nodes in the hidden layer. We set the range for ‘size’
    from 1 to 10, and evaluated the ‘weight decay’ at 0, 0.01, and 0.1. After the
    tuning and training process, the model identified optimal hyperparameters: a decay
    value of 0.1 and a size of 10. A residual plot was generated to check the assumption
    of homoscedasticity. As shown in Figure 6, the residuals were distributed randomly,
    suggesting that the assumption of the constant variance of errors is reasonable.
    3.5. Random Forest Regression The RFR model was trained using the randomForest
    package in R based on the training dataset, applying LOOCV as the resampling method.
    The hyperparameters for the RFR model included the number of randomly selected
    predictors at each split (mtry), the node size, and the number of trees (ntree).
    These hyperparameters were collectively tuned within a for loop. For mtry, a grid
    range of 1 to 10 was set and fine-tuned using the ‘caret’ package, whereas the
    node size was assessed at 5, 6, and 7, and the ntree parameter was evaluated between
    50 and 200. Following this comprehensive grid search, the optimal settings were
    found to be an mtry value of 8, a node size of 5, and a ntree value of 60. To
    assess the importance of the predictors, a variable importance plot was generated,
    revealing LST at daytime from Feb to May (X13), NDVI from Jun to Sep (X20), and
    precipitation from Feb to May (X4) to be of higher importance compared to the
    other variables, as depicted in Figure 7. In response to the inherent bias of
    the RFR model, as detailed in Section 2.4.4, we employed a post-processing step
    to correct for this bias. This involved applying a linear transformation to the
    RFR predictions. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression model with the predicted
    water level from the initial RFR model as the independent variable and the actual
    water level as the dependent variable. The parameters of the transformation were
    estimated on the training sample. The estimated coefficients for the intercept
    (β0) and predicted water level variable (β1) were −29.65 and 1.3, respectively.
    Comparing the residual plot for the original RFR model and the post-processed
    model, we see that the bias of the original RFR model has been mitigated. 3.6.
    Gradient Boosting Regression GBR was constructed using gbm package in R. The hyperparameters
    such as the minimum number of observations in a node required for a split (n.minobsinnode),
    the boosting model’s complexity (interaction.depth), the number of iterations,
    and the learning rate were optimized via grid search. We assessed n.minobsinnode
    at values of 5 and 10, interaction.depth within a range of 1 to 3, iterations
    at 50, 70, 100, and 120, and learning rates at 0.1 and 0.01. The final optimal
    hyperparameters, which led to the best model performance, were 5, 2, 100, and
    0.1, respectively. To evaluate the importance of the predictors, a variable importance
    plot was generated, revealing NDVI from Jun to Sep (X20), precipitation from Feb
    to May (x4), and LST at daytime from Feb to May (X13) to be of higher importance
    compared to the other variables, as depicted in Figure 7. 4. Discussion 4.1. Important
    Variables Analysis In our study, we assessed variable importance using methods
    such as MI, significance of predictors through MLR, and GCV-based importance scoring
    for the MARS, RFR, and GBR models. While ANNs can be powerful predictors, they
    are not typically preferred for identifying important variables due to their ‘black
    box’ nature, which complicates the interpretation of individual feature contributions.
    Therefore, we did not assess variable importance for the ANN model. The results
    of the variable importance analysis for each method were presented in Section
    3. Collectively, the findings suggest that three variables, namely, LST at daytime
    from February to May (X13), NDVI from June to September (X20), and precipitation
    from February to May (X4), consistently show strong importance across different
    models. Previous research also highlights temperature [56], precipitation [56,57,58],
    and NDVI [59,60] as primary factors influencing groundwater levels. Some inconsistencies
    are observed between the analysis and the importance values from the machine learning
    models. This may stem from their differing methodological approaches to examining
    variable importance. Mutual information is a non-parametric method that quantifies
    the degree of dependence or relatedness between two variables. It can capture
    both linear and non-linear relationships, but it does not account for interactions
    between variables. Therefore, a variable might be rated as less important in mutual
    information analysis but may prove critical in a model where interactions between
    variables are considered. Machine learning models like MARS, RFR, and GBR not
    only consider individual variables’ contributions but also consider the interactions
    and combinations of variables. Consequently, these models can identify variables
    as important even if their individual relationships with the outcome variable
    are not strong, provided their combined effect with other variables is substantial.
    This highlights the importance of applying diverse methods when investigating
    variable importance. Each method brings its own strengths and can offer unique
    insights. Mutual information can identify variables that have a strong individual
    effect, whereas machine learning models can capture complex interaction effects.
    4.2. Model Performance Evaluation and Comparison As previously highlighted in
    Section 2.2, multiple experiments were carried out for each machine learning algorithm.
    For the residual plots (Figure 6), observed versus predicted plot (Figure 8),
    Taylor diagram (Figure 9), and the comparison in Table 4, we selected a model
    with close to median performance across all models. To provide a more comprehensive
    understanding of each model’s performance, we also calculated the average performance
    score from the fifteen experiments. These averages are presented in Table 5. Figure
    8. Observed (m) versus predicted (m) plots on full data set for (a) MLR; (b) MARS;
    (c) ANN; (d) Original RFR; (e) RFR with linear transformation; (f) GBR. Figure
    9. (a) Taylor diagram for the training data; (b) Taylor diagram for the testing
    data. The circle on the x-axis represents the observed or the reference dataset.
    The x-axis indicates the standard deviation of the predicted data, whereas the
    y-axis represents the centered root mean square difference between the predicted
    and observed data. The radial distance from the origin (angle with the x-axis)
    represents the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed data.
    Together, these three axes provide a comprehensive view of model performance.
    The results presented in Table 4 show that GBR outperforms the other models with
    a high R-squared value of 0.76. In the Taylor diagram (Figure 9b), the point representing
    GBR on the testing dataset is closer to the observed point on the x-axis compared
    to other models, indicating a higher similarity in standard deviation between
    the GBR model output and the observations. While the performance of the RFR with
    linear transformation is slightly inferior to the GBR, it still outperforms the
    remaining models. This observation aligns with literature findings [61,62,63],
    wherein gradient boosting consistently emerges as the top performer among the
    machine learning models used for water level predictions. In contrast, MLR appears
    insufficient for modeling our data effectively. The MARS model exhibits some predictive
    capability, though it does not fully capture the data’s complexity. With an R-squared
    value of 0.99 on the training data and 0.61 on the testing data, the ANN model
    shows clear evidence of overfitting to the training data. This occurs despite
    the model having a only single hidden layer and parameters that have been optimally
    tuned to avoid overfitting. The overfitting may stem from the small and potentially
    less diverse dataset, causing the model to memorize training data rather than
    learn to generalize from it. Future work might resolve this by enriching the dataset
    and/or simplifying the model. Table 5 presents the average performance score based
    on multiple experiments conducted for each model. Consistent with the findings
    from the single experiment (Table 4), GBR has the best performance among the models.
    The RFR model’s performance is slightly lower than that of GBR. MARS, on the other
    hand, exhibits the weakest average performance among the five models. Collectively,
    these results suggest that GBR and RFR are most suitable for predicting depth
    to water table for our data set, aligning with findings from previous research
    [7,15,61,62,63]. It is worthy of note that other studies in the literature achieved
    better model performance than the results reported here, but these studies were
    based on time series data. When groundwater levels from a previous time period
    are available as a predictor, it is natural that predictions will be more accurate.
    We have not found other studies using machine learning to predict groundwater
    level in which no data on prior groundwater levels was available. For purposes
    of guiding drilling decisions, the ability to predict groundwater levels from
    publicly available hydrogeological and climate data, without the use of prior
    groundwater levels, is essential. 4.3. Grid Points Prediction Evaluation Based
    on the Best Model As detailed in Section 2.2, the grid points were generated to
    comprehensively represent the study area. We utilized the primary GBR model presented
    in this paper (Table 4) to generate predictions for these grid points. Given the
    map’s discretized nature, we evaluated prediction performance solely based on
    these grid points. This involved comparing the observed water levels from the
    existing 75 boreholes with the predicted water levels for their closest respective
    grid points (Figure 10). Table 6 illustrates the evaluation of water level predictions.
    It is worth noting that the predicted water levels are slightly worse on both
    the training and testing data in comparison to the performance reported in Section
    4.2. This is to be expected: it is naturally more accurate to predict based on
    predictor variables at the well location rather than based on predictor variables
    some distance away. However, this analysis shows that our model can be useful
    even if, as may be the case in practice, predictor values are available only at
    grid points and not at a specific well location. Thus, despite the slight drop
    in prediction accuracy, model results can still be valuable to support decisions
    about drilling locations in the region. While we have not seen such comparisons
    reported previously in the literature, we argue that comparing grid point predictions
    with their nearest actual measurements offers practical insights for drilling
    decisions. Figure 10. (a) Residual plot for the predicted water level for the
    nearest grid point; (b) Actual static water level versus predicted water level
    for the nearest grid point. Table 6. Nearest grid point performance evaluation.
    4.4. Final Map of the Predicted Water Level Utilizing QGIS, we generated a 100
    m × 100 m resolution map based on the grid points (Figure 11). The predicted groundwater
    levels of the grid points were broken into 20 m categories, and we color-coded
    the figure for the purpose of display. The regular block pattern in some areas
    of the map is due to the low resolution of some of the predictor variables. The
    map suggests that areas of shallow groundwater (under 30 m) are predominantly
    located in the northern and southern regions, with some patches in the central
    area. Conversely, the eastern region mostly features deeper groundwater. We found
    no previous studies specifically targeting the Bilate region for groundwater level
    predictions. A prior investigation assessed groundwater potential in Bilate using
    integrated GIS and remote sensing techniques [64]. While a direct comparison between
    that study and ours is challenging due to differing objectives and methodologies,
    it is noteworthy that Gintamo [64] identified the Middle Eastern part of the region
    as having low groundwater potential. This observation is consistent with our findings,
    where the predicted groundwater level in the middle eastern region is among the
    deepest. This high-resolution map can serve as a practical guide for borehole
    drilling for sustainable irrigation, particularly beneficial for stakeholders
    such as drilling companies, government entities, and local farmers. Figure 11.
    Predicted groundwater level for Bilate Ethiopia. 5. Conclusions Our research demonstrates
    the applicability of AI to identifying viable drilling sites for sustainable irrigation
    and drinking water in water-deficient areas. Prior studies have typically utilized
    time series data for groundwater level prediction. However, the challenge in water
    scarcity regions lies in the lack of data due to formidable data collection constraints.
    These regions, marked by higher water demand, necessitate effective strategies
    for groundwater exploitation. Addressing this gap, we have utilized available
    non-time series data to construct and evaluate five machine learning models for
    groundwater level prediction. Of these, Gradient Boosting Regression consistently
    demonstrated superior performance, with an average R-squared value of 0.77 and
    an average median absolute error of 19 m across numerous experiments. The highest-performing
    model was subsequently employed to predict groundwater levels across the entire
    Bilate region. This process resulted in the development of a high-resolution map,
    anticipated to guide local communities and organizations in pinpointing the most
    suitable locations for sustainable irrigation drilling. Furthermore, these findings
    have the potential to enhance food security by providing valuable insights and
    guiding more informed agricultural and water resource management decisions. Land
    Surface Temperature during daytime from February to May, NDVI from June to September,
    and precipitation from February to May consistently demonstrated importance across
    models. There were inconsistencies between the variable importance from the MI
    method and the machine learning methods. The results of these approaches should
    be considered complementary rather than contradictory. Using a combination of
    methods allows for a more robust and comprehensive understanding of variable importance,
    leading to a more reliable model. In case of substantial discrepancies, deeper
    investigations can be conducted to reconcile the findings. There are some limitations
    of this study. Firstly, a potential concern is the relatively small dataset of
    75 boreholes, which are not evenly distributed throughout the Bilate watershed.
    This may present a limitation for making region-wide predictions. Secondly, the
    predictor variables we considered were limited to ones that could be readily computed
    from publicly available data. Thirdly, the ANN model showed a tendency to overfit
    the training data, indicating the need for more extensive hyperparameter tuning
    and model simplification. Lastly, our data, having been collected in 2007, may
    be somewhat dated. Efforts are underway to acquire more recent data to verify
    prediction accuracy. Future research in this region should aim to improve the
    predictive power of groundwater levels by considering additional predictor variables
    (e.g., distance to water and elevation above permanent streams), forecast groundwater
    recharge, and analyze the impacts of climate change. This will provide comprehensive
    guidance for decision-making related to borehole drilling. Author Contributions

    To achieve the sound planning and management of water resources, it is necessary
    to accurately estimate the main components of water balance, especially evapotranspiration
    (ET) (Li et al., 2022; Massari et al., 2022; Yan and Mohammadian, 2020a). ET is
    an important component in hydrological and ecological processes and plays a key
    role in the management of water use (Feng et al., 2016; Yan and Mohammadian, 2020b).
    It is known as a key parameter reflecting the variations in atmospheric research
    and an indicator of the combined effects of various atmospheric variables, including
    air temperature, sunshine hours, wind speed, and relative humidity (Ahmadi et
    al., 2021). Therefore, it is very important to accurately estimate ET to obtain
    a better understanding of the atmospheric and hydrological processes and a reasonable
    assessment of water demand (Shiri et al., 2013). However, estimating ET is generally
    considered a challenging task, especially when complete climatic data are unavailable.
    There are two types of methods for determining ET: one involves using a lysimeter
    to measure it directly, while the other relies on an indirect approach. The indirect
    approach is more practical than the direct approach due to its lower costs, and
    is thus more widely employed for determining ET. In the indirect approach, the
    ET is estimated indirectly by multiplying potential evapotranspiration (ET0) using
    a crop coefficient (Li et al., 2022). ET0 can be accurately estimated by the FAO-56
    Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998), which has been successfully used
    in many regions and has become the standard method for calculating ET0 (Allen
    et al., 1998; Feng et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019; Chen et al.,
    2020a, Chen et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2021). However, this method requires a complete
    dataset of the meteorological variables, including maximum and minimum air temperature
    (Tmax and Tmin), solar radiation (SR), wind speed (U2) and relative humidity (Hm).
    It is typically impractical to obtain all of these meteorological data for ET0
    estimation, so an estimation method based on fewer parameters is needed. Numerous
    empirical and semi-empirical methods have been used to estimate ET0 with incomplete
    weather variables. These models can be classified as temperature-based, radiation-based,
    and humidity-based, etc. (Landeras et al., 2008). Among these models, the temperature-based
    models have been widely favored due to the merits of acceptable performance, simplicity,
    and low requirement of climatic data. Examples of commonly seen temperature-based
    ET0 models include the Thornthwaite (1948), McCloud (1955), Hamon (1961), Hamon
    (1963), Baier and Robertson (1965), Papadakis (1966), Malmström (1969), Hargreaves
    and Samani (HS; 1982), Camargo et al. (1999), and Oudin et al. (2005) models.
    The HS model (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982; Wu, 1997; Allen et al., 1998) is one
    of the most widely employed and validated models. Its original equation and variants
    have successfully estimated ET0 in the Khuzestan Plain in the southwest of Iran
    (Khoob, 2008), the lower end of the Sevier River (Alfonso et al., 2011), Shiyanghe
    in China (Li et al., 2013), Shamil Ashekara Plain in Iran (Alizamir et al., 2018),
    West Texas (Awal et al., 2020), the city of Košice in Slovakia (Kaya et al., 2021),
    etc. However, as found by Djaman et al. (2015), these empirical and semi-empirical
    models with few input data often provided poor estimations of ET0 in some regions.
    Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further investigations to improve these
    models. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    (including machine learning, ML, techniques) have provided a new avenue for estimating
    ET0 in addition to the traditional ET0 methods. Examples of ML techniques that
    have been successfully employed in ET0 estimations include Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANNs) (Bachour et al., 2016; Ozgur and Meysam, 2018; Farias et al., 2020; Raza
    et al., 2020), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (García-Pedrero et al., 2017),
    Fuzzy Logic (Jangre et al., 2017), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) (Patil and Deka,
    2016; Dou and Yang, 2018), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) (Raza et al.,
    2020), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (Alfonso et al., 2011), Multivariate Relevance
    Vector Machine (MVRVM) (Alfonso et al., 2011), Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    (Dou and Yang, 2018), Online Sequential ELM (OS-ELM) (Ozgur and Meysam, 2018),

    Learning Machine (WELM) (Ozgur and Meysam, 2018). For example, Raza et al. (2020)
    developed an ANN model using monthly climate data from Pakistan and applied it
    to other climate stations in China, New Zealand, and the United States without
    any training data. The results showed that the ANN model demonstrated good performance
    in estimating ET0. García-Pedrero et al. (2017) used the CNN method to train on
    daily meteorological data from the central valley of Chile, and the results showed
    that the CNN model could satisfactorily estimate the ET0 map. Jangre et al. (2017)
    used daily data sets from both the Raipur region and the Raipur airport to estimate
    ET0, and the results showed that the DNN model can be used to estimate ET0 effectively.
    Meanwhile, Kim et al. (2020) utilized the RF method to estimate daily ET0 in Korea,
    and the experiments validated the feasibility of ML-based ET0 retrieval. In recent
    years, hybrid models have also been proposed to estimate ET0. For example, Yan
    et al., 2021a, Yan et al., 2021b proposed a hybrid algorithm WOA-XGB model, which
    integrated the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model and the Whale Optimization
    Algorithm (WOA), and it greatly improved the accuracy in the estimation of daily
    ET0 when long-term historical data were incomplete. Ahmadi et al. (2021) developed
    a hybrid algorithm for ET0 estimations that coupled the classical Support Vector
    Regression (SVR) with Intelligent Water Drops (IWD), and demonstrated that the
    proposed hybrid algorithm had better performance than the standalone SVR model
    in the estimation of monthly ET0. Wu et al. (2021) proposed a kernel extreme learning
    machine model coupled with the K-means clustering and firefly algorithms (Kmeans-FFA-KELM),
    and employed the proposed model to estimate monthly ET0. The novel model has been
    demonstrated to be faster and more accurate than the standalone models in handling
    large datasets in water resources studies on a regional scale. Recently, long
    short-term memory neural network (LSTM), which is an advanced version of the recurrent
    neural network (RNN) machine learning (ML) algorithm, has attracted the interest
    of many scholars and has also been utilized in many fields. For example, Ferreira
    and Cunha (2020a) assessed LSTM, 1D-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and other machine learning
    models using iterated, direct and MIMO forecasting strategies. The results showed
    that the deep learning models performed slightly better, and MIMO was the best
    forecasting strategy, which makes them useful tools for forecasting ET0. Ferreira
    and Cunha (2020b) employed RF, XGBoost, ANN, and CNN algorithms, using limited
    hourly meteorological data to estimate daily ET0 directly. The results showed
    that CNN models developed with 24-h hourly data and hourly Ra offered the best
    performance in all cases. Bellido-Jiménez et al. (2022) developed a state-of-the-art
    architecture, including LSTM and other models, deployed for multivariate input
    time-series forecasting (transformers) using past values of ET0 and temperature-based
    parameters. The study demonstrated these models can accurately forecast ET0 in
    different geo-climatic conditions, thereby helping to increase efficiency in tasks
    of great agronomic importance. Shahid et al. (2020) utilized a LSTM to estimate
    time-series data regarding COVID-19, demonstrating that LSTM is a promising tool
    for estimation of sequential data. Although LSTM has already been successfully
    applied in many fields, it has rarely been used for estimating ET0 with daily
    air temperature data. Specifically, there are very few works that develop and
    evaluate temperature-based LSTM algorithms. In addition, the standalone Hargreaves
    and ML models may not be capable of adequately estimating ET0. Therefore, the
    main objectives of this study were 1) to develop temperature-based LSTM based
    models for estimating daily ET0 using air temperature data; 2) to propose a HS-ML
    technique for estimating daily ET0; and 3) to evaluate and compare the estimation
    capabilities of the standalone HS model, the standalone LSTM approach, and the
    newly proposed HS-ML approach (HS-LSTM). As reference approaches, traditional
    machine learning (ML) algorithms comprising adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
    (ANFIS), genetic programming (GP), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), and
    one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN), as well as the HS-ML models (HS-ANFIS, HS-GP, HS-MGGP,
    HS-1D-CNN), were also developed and assessed for estimation of daily ET0. To the
    best of the authors'' knowledge, ML based ET0 models for Songliao Basin have not
    been previously reported, and this was the first time that the potential of LSTM
    and HS- LSTM in ET0 estimation was assessed. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study
    area and dataset This study was conducted in Songliao Basin (115°32′E ∼ 135°06′E,
    38°43′N ∼ 53°43′N), Northeast China. Songliao Basin, with an area of 1.25 million
    km2, is rich in mineral resources. It has temperate continental climate, with
    the average annual temperature of 6 °C. The average annual precipitation is about
    850 mm and average annual sunshine duration is about 2600 h. The weather data
    were obtained from 16 meteorological stations located in Songliao Basin. Fig.
    1 shows the geographical locations of the study area and the meteorological stations.
    The historical daily meteorological data ranges from January 1st, 1984 to December
    31st, 2019, including Tmax, Tmin, U2, Hm, and SD, which was collected from the
    National Climatic Center of the China Meteorological Administration. Table 1 shows
    the means of the climatic variables at each station. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith
    (PM) equation, which is the standard formulation to calculate ET0, was employed
    to compute the historical daily ET0 (ground truths) at the meteorological stations
    to train, validate, and test the models. However, it should be emphasized that
    most of these stations do not report forecasts of complete climate variables to
    the public, so it is not possible to estimate future ET0 at these stations using
    the FAO-56 PM equation due to the lack of future climate forecasts. Thus, models
    using limited climate data available from public weather forecast services (e.g.,
    air temperature) should be developed. The actual land evapotranspiration dataset
    (Lu et al., 2021) was also utilized to further evaluate the performance of the
    proposal approach in estimating actual land evapotranspiration. The dataset covers
    the period from 1980 to 2017, but this study only used the data from January 1,
    2015 because a large amount of data before this date are missing. Download : Download

    and HS formulations The FAO-56 PM equation can be expressed as (Allen et al.,
    1998) (1) where ET0 is the potential evapotranspiration (mm day−1); is the slope
    of vapour pressure curve at a given air temperature (kPa °C−1); Rn is the net
    radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1); G is the soil heat flux density
    (MJ m−2 day−1); γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1); T is the mean daily
    air temperature at 2 m height (°C); U2 is the wind speed at the 2 m height (m/
    s); es is the saturation vapour pressure (kPa); ea is the actual vapour pressure
    (kPa). The FAO56 report (Allen et al., 1998) has provided the other equations
    used to calculate the intermediate variables using the daily data of Hm, SD, Tmax,
    Tmin, and U2. The HS model for ET0 has various forms and variants, and the one
    used in this study can be written as (2) where T is the mean temperature (°C)
    and Rs is the incident solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). The equations to calculate
    Rs and other intermediate variables can be found in Hargreaves and Samani (1982),
    Allen et al. (1998), and Ugwu and Ugwuanyi (2011). The ET0 estimated by the HS
    model was hereafter referred to as the HS ET0. 2.3. Machine learning models This
    work proposed different ML models, including ANFIS, GP, MGGP, 1D-CNN, and LSTM,
    to estimate daily ET0. In the first phase, standalone ML models were established
    for ET0 estimations, whereas in the next phase, HS-ML models (hereafter referred
    to as HS-ANFIS, HS-GP, HS-MGGP, HS-CNN, HS-LSTM, respectively) were developed.
    The standalone HS model was employed as a baseline reference model. The performance
    of the proposed HS-LSTM approach was further tested by estimating the actual ET.
    LSTM is an advanced version of recurrent neural network (RNN) which deals with
    sequential time series data. It overcomes the vanishing gradient problem, and
    is able to work on both previous and future contents. The memory cells are controlled
    by the input, forget, and output gates. The input and output gates control what
    information to input and what to output. The forget gate determines how much of
    the information should be forgotten. A schematic of the HS-LSTM network established
    in this work is presented in Fig. 2. Three variables (including Tmax, Tmin, and
    HS ET0) were used as input variables, and the length of input time step was set
    as 14 (two weeks). Two LSTM layers were than used, followed by two dense layers.
    The rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function was employed, since it is
    one of the most widely used activation functions. The mean squared error (MSE)
    between the ground truths and estimated data was used as a function. The network
    was trained to minimize MSE using the Adam optimization algorithm with an initial
    learning rate of 0.0001. The batch size was set as 64 and the models were trained
    for 300 epochs. The other assessed algorithms have been well documented elsewhere
    (Dou and Yang, 2018; Yan et al., 2021a, Yan et al., 2021b; Yan et al., 2022).

    datasets were split. For each station, 80% of the data was used to train and validate
    the LSTM based model, and the remaining 20% was used as unseen data for model
    tests. In the training/validation datasets, 90% of the data was assigned as training
    sets, and 10% was assigned as validation sets. To eliminate errors due to measurement
    units, all data were normalized to fall between 0 and 1. The equation for normalization
    can be represented as: (3) where xn, x, xmin, and xmax are the normalized value,
    real value, minimum value, and maximum value, respectively. Download : Download

    in daily ET0 for the 16 meteorological stations. The training, validation, and
    tests of LSTM based models were performed using TensorFlow-GPU in Python 3.9,
    primarily on a desktop with a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 device. The ANFIS, GP, and
    MGGP models were implemented using MATLAB, and the 1D-CNN model was implemented
    using the same platform as LSTM (TensorFlow-GPU). The same model structures were
    employed for all the stations to evaluate the broad applicability of the considered
    approaches. The hyperparameters for the ML models were primarily determined by
    comparing the evaluation statistics for the validation datasets. 2.4. Performance
    evaluation statistics The root-mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination
    (R2) and mean bias error (MBE) were used as the primary performance indicators
    in this study to evaluate the performance of the models. The equations for RMSE,
    R2 and MBE can be written as (Ahmadi et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021a, Yan et al.,
    2021b) (4) (5) ‐ ‐ ‐ (6) where ETp indicates the ground truth data, ETe indicates
    the estimated data, and N denotes the number of data pairs. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Performance of the HS-LSTM approach for estimating daily ET0 This section
    presents the HS-LSTM algorithm in comparison to the classic ET0 model and other
    ML algorithms for ET0 estimations. The assessment of the algorithm in estimating
    actual ET is provided in Section 3.2, when we discuss the potential of the proposed
    approach for actual ET estimations. In this study, the standalone HS model was
    firstly used to estimate ET0. Fig. 3 presented the FAO-56 PM ET0 (ground truths)
    and Fig. 4 presented the comparisons of the estimated values versus the ground
    truth values at the 16 meteorological stations. The performance of the HS model
    was also evaluated by the RMSE and R2 values, which were also indicated on the
    same plots. As can be seen from Fig. 4, most of the data points resided very close
    to the line of agreement for low ET0 values, implying that the HS model can accurately
    estimate low ET0 values. However, it was quite obvious that at some stations,
    such as Xinlin station (Fig. 4a), Xaoergou station (Fig. 4c), and Sunwu station
    (Fig. 4d), more data points were located above the 1:1 line, indicating that the
    HS model tended to overestimate the high ET0 values at these stations. It was
    also apparent that in Fig. 4p (Dalian station), more data points were located
    below the 1:1 line, indicating that the model tended to underestimate the high
    ET0 values. The estimations at most of the other stations were in good agreement
    with the FAO-56 PM values. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 4. Scatter plots of the ground truth ET0 and the
    ET0 estimated by the HS model. As for absolute errors, the RMSE values ranged
    between 0.60 and 0.99 mm day−1. The RMSE value was relatively higher at the Xinlin
    station (0.98 mm day−1), Xiaoergou station (0.92 mm day−1), and Dalian station
    (0.99 mm day−1). The remaining stations all exhibited RMSE values lower than 0.92
    mm day−1. The R2 value for the Dalian station was quite low (0.75), but the remaining
    stations all showed R2 values higher than 0.80. In addition, the MBEs were also
    calculated. A positive bias indicates that the data error is overestimated, while
    a negative bias indicates that the error is underestimated. The MBEs at the Haierla,
    Qiqihar, Tongliao, Changchun, Chifeng, and Dalian stations were negative, indicating
    that the model generally underestimated the ET0 at these stations. The MBEs at
    the other stations were positive, implying that the ET0 values were generally
    overestimated at these stations. Overall, the performance of the HS model was
    not satisfactory, partially because the HS model ignored the influence of the
    variables Hm, SD, and U2. Thus, it requires further investigations to improve
    the estimation performance. Various traditional ML models have been assessed for
    estimations of daily ET0. Surprisingly, we found that the performance results
    of these traditional algorithms for ET0 estimations in this study were almost
    equivalent. We present the results provided by the MGGP algorithm as samples of
    traditional ML estimations, because MGGP has been proven to be a very powerful
    tool for solving complex nonlinear multivariate problems (Chen et al., 2016; Ghorbani
    et al., 2018; Javed et al., 2016; Shafiullah et al., 2019; Tzuc et al., 2019;
    Yan et al., 2021a, Yan et al., 2021b). The comparisons between the ground truth
    ET0 values and those provided by the standalone MGGP algorithm were shown in Fig.
    5 (in blue). The RMSE and R2 values were also calculated and shown. Download :

    plots of the ground truth ET0 and those estimated by the MGGP and HS-MGGP algorithms.
    Overall, the data points were located lower than those corresponding to the HS
    model. It was obvious that at some stations, such as Xinlin station (Fig. 5a),
    Shenyang station (Fig. 5o), and Dalian station (Fig. 5p), more data points were
    lower than the 1:1 line, indicating that the algorithm tended to underestimate
    the data trends at these stations. The estimated values at the remaining 13 stations
    were generally in good agreement with the ground truths. The RMSEs ranged from
    0.6 to 0.93, slightly lower than those corresponding to the HS model. However,
    the R2 values ranged from 0.71 to 0.87, which were also lower than those for the
    HS model. The MBEs at 9 stations were positive and those at the remaining 7 stations
    were negative. This was close to the HS model, which obtained 10 positive and
    6 negative MBEs. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the MGGP estimations were
    more accurate than the HS model. A HS-ML model (here, HS-MGGP) was proposed based
    on the standalone MGGP and HS models, and its performance was evaluated using
    the ET0 at the 16 stations. In Fig. 5 (in red), the ET0 obtained from the HS-MGGP
    approach is shown against the true ET0. As can be seen, the data points were closer
    to the 1:1 match line than those obtained by the standalone HS and MGGP techniques.
    The RMSE values at the 16 meteorological stations were all below 0.80 mm day−1.
    These RMSE values were substantially smaller than the standalone MGGP and HS estimations.
    Furthermore, the R2 values were all above 0.85 except for Dalian station, which
    was 0.77. These R2 values were all higher than those corresponding to the standalone
    MGGP and HS estimations. These RMSE and R2 values proved that the performance
    of the HS-ML approach was superior to the standalone technique. The model significantly
    outperformed the standalone Hargreaves and MGGP methods, with the RMSE values
    decreased by 24.1% and 19.2%, respectively, demonstrating that the proposed approach
    can better estimate the data trends. The MBEs at 8 out of the 16 stations were
    greater than zero while those at the other 8 stations were less than zero. However,
    these MBEs were all within the range between −0.0004 mm day−1 and 0.0004 mm day-1,
    which were close to zero, and thus the technique has not been found to significantly
    overestimate nor underestimate the ET0 in the study area. Fig. 6 presents the
    variation of daily ET0 with time over the testing period, obtained from the ground
    truth, LSTM, and HS-LSTM datasets, along with the RMSE and R2 values. The daily
    ET0 at each station showed obvious periodic patterns, and the results obtained
    with the two ML algorithms closely follow the peaks and troughs for the ground
    truth data. Both the LSTM and HS-LSTM models estimated the rising limb and falling
    limb of the temporal variation of ET0 very well, indicating that the models can
    successfully capture the overall data trends. However, the LSTM model results
    deviated farther from the ground truth data. The HS-LSTM model consistently showed
    lower values of RMSE and higher values of R2 compared to the LSTM model. To obtain
    a quantitative measure of the difference between the ground truths and estimations,
    scatter plots of ground truth versus estimated ET0 at various meteorological stations
    are provided in Fig. 7. Overall, the agreement between the ground truths and estimations
    were quite good. The estimations obtained with HS-LSTM showed a better match with
    the ground truths than the LSTM model. In addition, the LSTM and HS-LSTM models
    showed a better performance than the MGGP and HS-MGGP models. Download : Download

    estimation can be improved by establishing and utilizing classical ET0 formulation
    and ML algorithms. To further compare the performance of different approaches,
    box plots of RMSE and R2 values obtained by different models are presented in
    Fig. 8. The lowest RMSE value was found at the Songjiang station corresponding
    to the HS-CNN approach. However, on average, the best algorithm is HS-LSTM. Therefore,
    the results confirmed that the proposed approach was superior to the classic method
    and other ML algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (564KB) Download :

    model in more aspects, the comparison of the descriptive statistics for the ground
    truth dataset and HS-LSTM estimations over the testing period is presented in
    Fig. 9. The model reproduced the mean values very well, but tended to underestimate
    the variances. It is quite common for ML algorithms to perform comparably worse
    for estimating extreme values due the lack of abundant extreme samples. Fig. 10
    shows the extreme values in the ground truth dataset and HS-LSTM estimations over
    the testing period, confirming that the model tended to slightly underestimate
    the extreme values, but the overall performance was satisfactory. Download : Download

    dataset and HS-LSTM estimations over the testing period. Generally, the HS model
    performed the best at the Hulin station and the worst at the Dalian station. The
    other algorithms showed similar trends of estimation performance. The models are
    all temperature-based, so theoretically, they tend to perform better at the locations
    where the ET0 is less influenced by the other variables, including Hm, SD, and
    U2. There is a very accurate estimation by HS-CNN at the Songjiang station, but
    this seems to be an occasional case because the model did not show the best performance
    at the other stations. In general, the proposed HS-LSTM approach exhibited a good
    performance for estimating daily ET0. The LSTM algorithm contains memory cells,
    which can control what information to input and what to output, and how much of
    the information should be forgotten. The algorithm can also overcome the vanishing
    gradient problem and is able to work on both previous and future contents. Therefore,
    it is more capable than the other algorithms in dealing with sequential time series
    problems, and thus exhibited better performance in this study than other algorithms.
    3.2. Performance of the HS-LSTM approach for estimating daily actual ET Section
    3.1 has demonstrated the good capability of HS-LSTM in estimating ET0, and it
    was expected that the algorithm can also perform well for ET because ET and ET0
    are highly correlated. ET can be estimated by multiplying ET0 with seasonal crop
    coefficients, which reflect the crop canopy characteristics and environmental
    factors (Allen et al., 1998). However, the information of crop coefficients is
    not available in the study area, and thus, it is difficult to estimate ET using
    ET0. Fig. 11 presents the HS ET0 versus the land evaporation (ET) at the 16 meteorological
    stations. Generally, the HS ET0 exhibited a similar trend as ET, but it is evident
    that the values of HS ET0 were higher than those of ET. This is consistent with
    the fact that ET0 quantifies the potential evaporative capability while ET is
    restricted by the actual conditions. A remarkable merit of a ML algorithm is that
    it can directly estimate ET using the source climate data (here, air temperature)
    without information of crop coefficients. Fig. 12 shows the temporal variations
    in ET over the testing period. The ML estimations followed the rising and falling
    limbs very well, and satisfactorily reproduced the peaks and troughs. The RMSE
    and R2 values confirmed that both the LSTM and HS-LSTM can capture the spatiotemporal
    variations in ET very well, but the HS-LSTM approach was superior to the LSTM
    approach. The quantile-quantile plot was presented in Fig. 13, which reconfirmed
    that the agreement between the results obtained by the proposed ML method and
    the actual ET data was very good. Section 3.1 showed that the proposed ML algorithm
    can accurately reproduce the descriptive statistics of the ET0 data, and an examination
    of Fig. 14 showed that the approach can also satisfactorily reproduce the descriptive
    statistics of the ET data as well. As shown in Fig. 15, the proposed approach
    exhibited a good capability in capturing the extreme events for ET at most of
    the stations, with relatively larger errors at a few stations. Download : Download

    the extreme values in the actual ET dataset and HS-LSTM estimations over the testing
    period. The actual ET can be estimated using the eq. ET = kc × ET0, where kc is
    the crop coefficient. Based on the actual ET and ET0 values, kc values can be
    estimated using the least-square method. For sample station Xinlin, the true kc
    (estimated based on the actual ET and ground truth ET0) was 0.74; those estimated
    by the Hargreaves, LSTM, and HS-LSTM models were 0.54, 0.74, and 0.72, respectively.
    For sample station Jiamusi, the true kc was 0.76; those estimated by the Hargreaves,
    LSTM, and HS-LSTM models were 0.69, 0.75, and 0.77, respectively. For sample station
    Hulin, the true kc was 0.93; those estimated by the Hargreaves, LSTM, and HS-LSTM
    models were 0.87, 0.98, and 0.98, respectively. These results cannot determine
    which model is better between the LSTM and HS-LSTM models, because the kc values
    between them were very similar, and there were errors arising from estimating
    kc. However, it is quite obvious that the LSTM and HS-LSTM models outperformed
    the traditional Hargreaves model. In summary, the proposed HS-LSTM showed excellent
    ability in estimating spatiotemporal characteristics of ET, and can satisfactorily
    reproduce the descriptive statistics of the data and capture the extreme events.
    Therefore, the proposed HS-LSTM approach exhibited a good performance for estimating
    daily actual ET. 3.3. Contributions and future work This study proposed a novel
    ML approach, HS-LSTM, for ET0 estimates that is superior to the classic formulation.
    In this work, the HS model was employed as a representative traditional ET0 model.
    As a classical formula for estimating daily ET0, the HS model has been widely
    used worldwide because of its acceptable accuracy and low requirements for meteorological
    data (Allen et al., 1998). Recently, Kaya et al. (2021) showed that the HS estimations
    were more accurate than the estimations provided by the other tested empirical
    equations (i.e., the Ritchie and Turc equations). However, many other studies
    showed that the HS model either overestimated or underestimated ET0. For example,
    the HS equation has been found to overestimate the ET0 in humid Western Balkan
    locations (Trajkovic, 2007), north-eastern Italy (Berti et al., 2014) and Southern
    Punjab Pakistan (Majeed et al., 2017), whereas it underestimated the ET0 in West
    Texas (Awal et al., 2020). In the present study, the HS model tended to overestimate
    the ET0 at 6 of the 16 stations, whereas it underestimated the remaining 10 stations.
    This issue of overestimation or underestimation may be partially resolved by local
    calibration, i.e., tuning the model coefficient for Rs to improve the model accuracy.
    However, the present study found that there was a good match between the ground
    truths and HS estimations for low ET0 values while there was a poorer match at
    some stations for high ET0 values. This observation highlighted the weakness of
    the ET0 estimation method based on the standalone HS model: the standard local
    calibration approach can either raise or lower the model estimations by adjusting
    the value of Rs (ranging from 0.16 to 0.19, Allen et al., 1998), but it cannot
    modify the estimations for high ET0 values without influencing the estimations
    for low ET0 values. In summary, the performance of the standalone HS model cannot
    be significantly improved by standard local calibrations since these operations
    can only exert linear changes in the estimations, and thus the proposed approach
    can further improve the current practice of evaporative capability estimations.
    The proposed HS-LSTM approach also outperformed the other ML algorithms. ML techniques
    have been well known to be capable of solving nonlinear problems, and this merit
    may remedy the limitation of the HS model. There have been many studies that utilized
    ML techniques for ET0 estimation. For example, Yan et al., 2021a, Yan et al.,
    2021b proposed the XGB-WOA model to estimate the daily ET0 at four stations in
    arid areas of China and four stations in humid areas of China, Wu et al. (2021)
    proposed the Kmanas-FFA-KELM model to estimate monthly ET0 for Poyang Lake Basin
    in South China, and Roy et al. (2020) used FA-ANFIS to estimate ET0 in a subtropical
    climate area. All of these studies showed that ML techniques were promising in
    estimating ET0. The MGGP technique was utilized as a representative traditional
    ML algorithm for detailed discussion. In most of the previous studies, the MGGP
    model exhibited excellent performance. Javed et al. (2016) applied MGGP to denoise
    mixed impulse noise in biomedical images. Compared with other existing traditional
    learning methods and biological learning methods, MGGP had better learning performance.
    Chen et al. (2016) applied MGGP to landslide displacement estimations. Compared
    with back-propagation neural network and radial basis function, it was proven
    that the MGGP algorithm was more accurate and efficient under the same conditions.
    Tzuc et al. (2019) utilized the MGGP algorithm to estimate the thermal gain of
    natural ventilation per square meter of flat roof. Compared with other multivariate
    analysis methods, the MGGP model had better statistical performance and higher
    correlation fitness, but the performance of the proposed HS-LSTM was better than
    the MGGP based approaches. Chen et al., 2020a, Chen et al., 2020b also estimated
    daily reference evapotranspiration using deep learning and classical machine learning
    methods, such as the deep neural network and temporal convolution neural network.
    The RMSE values were around 0.8 mm/d and the R2 values were around 0.8. These
    values were similar to those corresponding to the standalone ML algorithms reported
    in this work, but were significantly worse than those corresponding to the proposed
    HS-LSTM method. Interestingly, the current study found that the performance results
    of the standalone traditional ML algorithms were almost equivalent, and they were
    not found to significantly improve the performance compared to the HS model (Fig.
    8). The standalone ML algorithms even made worse estimations at some stations
    (e.g., the Haierla and Shenyang stations, when MGGP was used). This observation
    was inconsistent with most of the previous ML studies, which concluded that ML
    models outperformed traditional ET0 formulas. The similar performance of the ML
    algorithms was attributed to the fact that each of the ML models had already fully
    described the attributions of air temperature data to ET0 variations, and cannot
    figure out additional information from the dataset itself. Although the HS model
    only requires air temperature as the climatic variables, it uses latitude, elevation,
    and day of the year to calculate the solar radiation. Therefore, the HS model
    implicitly considers some spatiotemporal information, which explains the relative
    disappointing performance of the standalone ML technique at some stations and
    consistently lower R2 values compared to the HS model. A key contribution of the
    present study is that it proposed a HS-ML approach for ET0 estimations. An important
    benefit of the trained models is that they can estimate ET0 using only air temperature
    estimations, which can be readily obtained from public weather observation. Although
    the additional information used in the HS model can be directly provided for ML
    training, incorporating the latitude and elevation into the ML models cannot provide
    meaningful contributions as they were just constants for a station. The HS model
    can effectively convert the basic information into meaningful spatiotemporal information,
    and thus improve the performance of ML models, as shown in Fig. 8. Although the
    FAO-56 PM equation has been recommended as the standard equation to calculate
    ET0, it requires complete climatic data which are often not available, limiting
    its application in data-scarce regions. It should be emphasized that using the
    FAO-56 PM equation to estimate future ET0 is not practical because most of the
    stations do not report the forecasts of all future climatic data. Therefore, it
    is well known that developing new techniques that rely on a reduced number of
    variables, which are available from public weather forecast services, is of great
    importance.” As discussed above, the standalone empirical and ML techniques have
    inherent deficits, and thus the present study aimed to provide a new approach
    that can resolve their issues. Several hybrid approaches for ET0 estimations have
    already been recently proposed. For example, Wu et al. (2021) estimated monthly
    average daily ET0 in the Poyang Lake Basin in southern China and demonstrated
    that the Kmanas-FFA-KELM model performed better when compared to the FFA-KELM
    model. Ahmadi et al. (2021) developed a mixed SVR-IWD model for monthly ET0 at
    six stations located in Iran, and the results indicated that the proposed hybrid
    SVR-IWD models outperformed the independent SVR models. Therefore, it is quite
    common that coupled models exhibit better performance over the standalone models.
    However, most of the existing studies only coupled different ML algorithms, without
    utilizing the advantages of classic ET0 equations. In the present study, HS-LSTM
    models were proposed, which combined the best merits of the classical ET0 models
    and machine learning techniques. The results in this study showed that the RMSE
    values obtained by the model were significantly lower than those provided by the
    standalone methods, and R2 values were augmented, demonstrating the good performance
    of the proposed approach. On the one hand, the existing empirical or semi-empirical
    ET0 models were mostly derived using traditional regression techniques, and ML
    algorithms can compensate for the relatively weaker generalization capability
    of the traditional regression techniques. On the other hand, the classical ET0
    formulation has been widely tested worldwide, and coupling with these formulations
    was equivalent to providing an additional dataset for the standalone ML algorithms.
    Another contribution of this study is that it demonstrated the potential of LSTM-based
    models for providing daily ET0 estimations. The study demonstrated that the performance
    results of LSTM-based models were consistently better than the traditional ML
    techniques, primarily because LSTM-based models contains memory cells and are
    thus more capable of dealing with sequential data. Combined with the HS model,
    the accuracies were quite impressive. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
    LSTM-based model was an appropriate tool for estimating daily ET0. Overall, the
    proposed approaches, especially HS-LSTM, performed very well in estimating daily
    ET0. Compared with other ET0 estimation approaches that need more climatic variables,
    the proposed technique only requires temperature data, which can be easily obtained,
    so it can be more widely utilized. Compared with the HS model, which is one of
    the most recognized temperature-based ET0 models, the proposed technique can provide
    better performance. Compared with standalone ML algorithms, the proposed approach
    requires less data due to its coupling with the HS model. However, the present
    study also has some limitations and requires future studies. The models tended
    to slightly underestimate the extremes, and future investigations for further
    improving the estimations of extremes would be meaningful. Furthermore, in this
    paper, only the HS model was used as the classical ET0 model, and it is meaningful
    to perform future studies to test if other models can provide better performance.
    In this work, individual models were trained for the stations. These locally tuned
    models can be further employed to make estimations of future ET0 for the stations
    with only air temperature data. However, it deserves a separate study to develop
    a generally valid model, or to evaluate the potential of estimating data in a
    different region using a network trained in one region via the transfer learning
    technique. In the future study, the proposed method will be applied in other regions
    to improve its generalization capability. 4. Conclusions The present study proposed
    a novel HS-LSTM algorithm to estimate daily ET0 based on air temperature data.
    The proposed HS-LSTM model was employed to estimate the daily ET0 and actual ET,
    and its performance was compared with those of the standalone HS, LSTM, ANFIS,
    GP, MGGP, and 1D-CNN models, as well as HS-ML models. The results showed that
    the HS-ML model significantly outperformed the standalone HS and ML methods, with
    the RMSE values decreased by about 20% for ET0. The LSTM performed much better
    than the other ML algorithms. Estimating future evaporative capability using the
    FAO-56 PM formulation is currently impossible in the study region since most of
    the stations do not report forecasts of complete climate variables to the public.
    Thus, a key significance of the trained models is that they can estimate future
    ET0 and actual ET using only air temperature forecasts, which can be readily obtained
    from public weather forecasts. Therefore, the present study provided a new avenue
    of ET0 estimation that can provide accurate estimations with incomplete weather
    data. The superior performance of the proposed approach can be attributed to the
    excellent capability of the approach in extracting additional features and information.
    Future studies are recommended to test if other classic ET0 formulations and machine
    learning methods can further improve the proposed approaches, and to evaluate
    the potential of ting data in a different region using a network trained in one
    region via the transfer learning technique. Author statement All of the authors

    Preview 1. Introduction It’s very difficult for you to check out any sector of
    the economy without noticing the use of drones. Drones are employed in the agricultural
    industry for a wide range of duties, including spraying fertilizer, aerial surveillance,
    crop monitoring, land inspection, mapping, looking for damaged or rotting crops,
    and many others. The potential of different drone types in farming, agriculture,
    and gardening is being investigated. Drones like quad copters are the greatest
    option for crop fertilization because of their multi-rotor design. The massive
    construction of fixed-wing drones, which requires a large landing area, makes
    them impractical for agricultural fertilization. Some reports revealed that they
    expect the drone industry in the agricultural sector to grow from USD1.2 billion
    in 2019 to a whopping USD4.8 billion in 2024. All data obtained by the drones
    in farmlands is mostly used to make better agronomic decisions, which makes it
    part of the “precision agriculture” sector. Large-scale precision farming operations
    have become increasingly dependent on the usage of drones in a number of regions.
    Farmers may plan planting and treatment strategies to produce the best harvest
    possible using the information obtained from the drones'' recordings. According
    to some reports, using precision farming technologies has the potential to boost
    yields by up to 5%, which is a substantial increase in a market with narrow profit
    margins. One of the most popular uses of drones in agriculture is their swift
    movement to their desired locations. Drones with this skill can apply fertilizer
    and insecticides to crops to hydrate and provide them with the nutrients they
    need. Such additives can help crops thrive and stay healthy. To prevent worms,
    pests, and insects and prolong crop life, drone commanders have complete control
    over the drone spraying nutrients. Powerful drone capabilities help with the time-consuming
    procedure of evaluating the soil''s health. The character and health of the soil
    may be monitored, modified, and maintained using UAVs, which collect and analyze
    data from monitoring systems. The soil can benefit from drone technology by receiving
    the nutrients it needs to become healthier. Through data processing and 3D mapping,
    drones carry out the role of monitoring the condition of the soil. Agriculture
    is by definition a labor-intensive and time-consuming sector because it requires
    a high level of skill to do its tasks. Particularly seeding requires human labor
    because it is a lengthy procedure. To make this strenuous operation easier, drone
    technology is employed to sow the seeds of several crop species. They can quickly
    and efficiently plant seeds thanks to the drones'' built-in lasers, sensors, tanks,
    and other functions. Drones'' great ability to evaluate, diagnose, and survey
    crops for any deficiencies is another fantastic benefit of employing them to fertilize
    crops. Their laser-equipped sensors and high-resolution cameras help with the
    quick completion of a variety of activities. These defects are also mapped in
    real-time by unmanned aerial vehicles, and crop management decisions can be made
    using the data that is gathered and processed. In general, the time-consuming
    procedure of agricultural fertilization has been made easier thanks to drones
    and their applications. Farmers benefit immensely from their entrepreneurism and
    strong personalities for a variety of tasks and operations. The time-consuming
    procedure of agricultural fertilization in general has been made simpler by drones
    and their applications. Farmers benefit immensely from their strong will and entrepreneurial
    spirit in a wide range of tasks and operations. For one thing, drones are excellent
    for monitoring and sensing methods since they can swiftly cover a region to examine
    crop development and soil health. The majority of drones are utilized for this
    because their sensors can identify the absorbance of a particular wavelength,
    producing a color contrast image that clearly depicts potentially problematic
    areas. Ranchers have used drones to track cattle on ranches and inspect fences
    for damage, proving that this monitoring capability does more than just enable
    quick processing of spatiotemporal data. To further monitor livestock, rangers
    have also used night cameras and thermal imagers to find any animals disrupting
    or attacking herds. Continue Reading References Follow Reference Abdullahi, H.

  description: The construction of contour levees for rice irrigation represents a
    major landscape management activity with impacts on irrigation water use efficiency,
    crop management decisions, and food production. However, levee distribution information
    traditionally relies on local field surveys because remote sensing approaches
    are complicated by irregular spacing, shape, and landscape variability within
    the field. In this paper the authors develop a deep learning approach capable
    of identifying rice fields with contour style levee irrigation practices from
    open-source aerial imagery. To generate a levee-identification scheme, a hybrid
    ResNet/Unet model is built from the commonly known Residual Network (ResNet) architecture
    for multi-layer deep learning strategies. The model takes a 320 × 320 RGB aerial
    landscape image from the US National Agricultural Imagery Program as input along
    with label data to then generate a probability map of the distribution of farm
    fields that use contour levees within the image. In performing this task, the
    model generates a 0.991 receiver operating characteristic curve score. The model
    continues to perform well under the introduction of clouds, data augmentation,
    or minor reductions in spatial resolution. Throughout these tests, the model performed
    within 0.2 of its original score, except for when the image quality was reduced
    to 60 m wherein the model score dropped to 0.691. Via these tests the model demonstrates
    potential to function well given different spatial extents or potential satellite
    remote sensing with moderate (10 m) resolutions. This model provides a proof-of-concept
    for the use of aerial imagery and a deep learning strategy for irrigation-type

    Agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater withdrawal globally; therefore it is
    paramount to minimize the amount of freshwater used while maximizing crop yield
    (Campbell et al., 2017). However, each crop requires different growing conditions
    in terms of soil composition, climate, and water availability. For example, as
    one of the major staple foods that supply 20% of the calories consumed globally
    (Kubo and Purevdorj, 2004), rice requires up to 2–3 times as much water as other
    cereal crops like wheat and maize (Bouman and Tuong, 2001). This high water use
    is associated with widespread anaerobic cultivation practices as a weed control
    mechanism and driver of greenhouse gas emissions. Between 24% and 30% of global
    freshwater resources are used to irrigate rice (Bouman et al., 2007). Thus, many
    precision irrigation and conservation efforts aim to reduce the consumptive water
    requirements of rice production while limiting the potential for yield loss. As
    there are only rare instances where the field topography will allow for standing
    water for rice production, farmers must use other means to prevent water from
    draining off the field. In the United States with larger field sizes and a higher
    degree of mechanization, farmers typically implement various forms of levee systems
    which essentially act as small dams that hold water in each section of the field.
    The most common levee system consists of generally curved contour levees that
    follow the topographical elevation lines of the field to ensure equal elevation
    within each section. This system accounts for 47.9% of rice acreage in Arkansas—the
    largest rice growing state in the U.S. (Norman and Moldenhauer, 2019). Second,
    precision land grading on some fields allows the straight levee system with parallel
    levees perpendicular to the consistent slope (0.1–0.5%). The third system is known
    as “Zero-grade”, whereby precise leveling eliminates the need for levees entirely.
    The Zero-grade system enables faster water distribution and a constant flood depth
    across the field and can lead to water savings of 40% compared to contour or straight
    levees (Henry et al., 2016). Fourth, and less common in rice production, some
    farmers forgo levee systems and use a pivot sprinkler to deliver the precise amount
    of needed water (Vories et al., 2013). Finally, furrow irrigation uses surface
    irrigation through small furrow ditches without levee use, and has increased to
    over 15% of irrigation practices in Arkansas (Chlapecka et al., 2021, Stevens
    et al., 2018). Each of these systems requires different levels of labor, power,
    and water, and knowledge about shifts among them over time can inform water resources
    planning and sustainability assessments (Moreno-García et al., 2021). However,
    there is not currently a viable system for efficient, widespread categorization
    of these fields. Examining the distribution and prevalence of these systems provides
    a baseline dataset to guide improved efficiency in water use, e.g., by the implementation
    of multiple inlet rice irrigation (Shew et al., 2021), furrow irrigation (Chlapecka
    et al., 2021), alternate wetting and drying (Atwill et al., 2020, Carrijo et al.,
    2017), or modeling the effects of these approaches on water use (Carroll et al.,
    2020). Historically, the primary method of identification was the use of surveys
    by county or extension offices relying on owner-reporting of land use, or via
    ground-truthing with windshield surveys (Smith et al., 2007). For any large spatial
    extent where laborious hand-labeling is inefficient, remote sensing offers a viable
    solution to detect large-scale land cover and land use, as well as their changes,
    in an efficient manner (Weiss et al., 2020). However, traditional pixel-based
    methods have difficulty addressing this classification, because most irrigation
    infrastructure or equipment can only be holistically seen from a landscape view.
    Additional difficulties lie in the complex visual characteristics of various irrigation
    types regarding their geometry (e.g., field size, levee width and length, and
    levee curvedness), photometry, and texture. A typical contour-levee rice field
    usually only has 3 to 10% of the land in levees that are 36 to 40 in wide (Massey,
    2023). Applying deep learning approaches to high-resolution images has provided
    an opportunity to classify rice irrigation strategies through image segmentation
    and feature extraction (Liang et al., 2021, Meyarian et al., 2022). Thus, the
    objective of this study is to develop a deep learning-based method to classify
    irrigation practices using high-resolution aerial imagery. We next move toward
    model portability, where the developed method can be adapted to data acquired
    from other platforms, with variations in greeness, spatial resolution, and image
    contamination. Hence, our second objective is to test the model’s effectiveness
    in different image quality scenarios and scalability to be applied at different
    geographical locations. These scenarios include coarsened imagery resolution or
    the introduction of various forms of noise to the image. 2. Method The research
    workflow includes phases of image annotation, pre-processing, deep learning classification,
    hyperparameter tuning, and scalability testing (Fig. 1). First, our annotators
    labeled the imagery according to the presence of fields using contour levee irrigation.
    These images are then converted to grayscale and divided with their respective
    labels according to a 5 × 5 grid composed of . After dividing the images into
    training and testing sets, we began training the model, adjusting the hyperparameters
    as needed. Once the final model was developed, we stress-tested it according to
    three criteria: resolution reduction, cloud noise addition, and gaussian noise
    addition. Download : Download high-res image (728KB) Download : Download full-size

    levee rice field from B. Moreno-García in Lonoke County, Arkansas, 12 May 2019.
    2.1. Study area We chose Lonoke County in Arkansas, where rice is the dominant
    agricultural crop type and the region has diverse levee systems, to train the
    model and assess its scalability by testing the model in distinct physio-geographical
    areas (Fig. 2). Lonoke County is located in central Arkansas, on the west side
    of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain’s Grand Prairie, 32.5% of its harvested
    agricultural land is planted in rice (USDA-NASS, 2021). The region has intense
    water demands for crop production, declining groundwater table levels, and the
    increasing stress of climate change which collectively has amplified needs for
    irrigation strategies and conservation management approaches. With inter-annual
    and inter-region variability, rice is usually planted in late March to mid-May
    and harvested in mid-August to mid-October. At the state level in 2015, only 21%
    of rice acreage will continue growing rice in the following year and the majority
    will be rotated into soybeans (72%). The remaining small percentage (7%) follows
    other crops such as corn, grain sorghum, cotton, wheat, oats, and fallow (Norman
    and Moldenhauer, 2016). The high rotation rate of rice presents a challenge in
    moderate resolution remote sensing mapping as the locations of ground truth points
    vary year to year. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. We chose 11 Arkansas counties (in orange) for testing
    the algorithm and Lonoke County (indicated in dark orange) for training. The zoom-in
    view of Lonoke County has the 2015 Cropland Data Layer (CDL) to show the major
    crops, along with the location of analyzed data tiles in gray. Note: One tile
    in neighboring Prairie county was also used for training and one tile was partitioned
    into the training and testing sets (denoted as Training/Testing). 2.2. Image selection
    and annotation 2.2.1. Input imagery This study utilized the freely accessible
    United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Imagery Program
    (NAIP) aerial photographic imagery that was acquired between 31 July and 25 August
    2015 at 1-m spatial resolution (USDA, 2017). We consider NAIP to a be very high
    resolution imagery dataset due to its 1-m scale as defined in Fu et al. (2017).
    The NAIP program began in 2003 with a 5-year cycle and transitioned to a three-year
    cycle in 2009 with one year publication latency to acquire aerial imagery during
    the agricultural growing season in a wide range of areas in the U.S. Although
    the selected 2015 NAIP images come with four bands (red, green, blue, and near-infrared
    (NIR)), we tested the method only with the three natural color bands to reduce
    data volume. Moreover, some studies have shown only minor performance gains when
    deep learning algorithms trained on multispectral images were applied over trichromatic
    images. For instance, one landscape segmentation study found less than a 1% increase
    in the accuracy of grass identification from an image and a 3.9% increase for
    soil identification in multispectral models versus RGB models (Salamati et al.,
    2012). Conversely, a study to identify rice lodging from UAV imagery found that
    an RGB model achieved a measure of similarity that was 2% higher than its multispectral
    counterpart (Zhao et al., 2019). Several other studies found comparable results
    between multispectral and trichromatic imagery (Elihos et al., 2018, Liu et al.,
    2020). Lastly, constraining the analysis to the RGB domain increases the transferability
    of the proposed method to NAIP images acquired in years without the NIR band and
    to other RGB data sources. 2.2.2. Image annotation and sample selection Our images
    were visually annotated using multiple people who were trained to provide consistent
    annotation and deliver high accuracy of field type labeling. Here we focused on
    the identification of contour-levee fields due to their strenuous water requirements
    (annual irrigation for rice: 892 mm) that are 8% greater than the next highest
    irrigation technique, straight levees (Reba and Massey, 2020). Contour-levee irrigation
    is a conventional irrigation method where levees are typically 30–45 cm in height
    to maintain flood between levees. From an aerial view, these fields are characterized
    by distinguishable lines that seem to resemble a topographical pattern used by
    the annotators to classify irrigation type. We also used the CDL layer as supporting
    information to provide the user with the estimated distribution of crops such
    as rice and soybeans, with very high classification accuracy on the major crops
    (Lark et al., 2021). This information aids the user in the labeling process because,
    depending on the area, levee systems are nearly exclusive to rice and soybean
    production fields. Additionally, for field patches with vague or unidentifiable
    patterns, the analysts also used the CDL to assist in image interpretation - i.e.,
    by ensuring that those fields were planted in either rice or soybean. To support
    the selection and interpretation of training and validation samples, we designed
    a labeling program (Fig. 3), where the user can upload the image for display alongside
    the CDL (Boryan et al., 2011) for the corresponding spatial extent. The trained
    analyst first draws polygons following the edges of each field over the NAIP image.
    Next, the analyst is prompted to label the field’s irrigation and/or levee system.
    Fields that are difficult to identify were labeled as unknown and discarded in
    the subsequent process. To ensure the integrity of the dataset and mitigate human
    error during labeling, the interpretation is repeated multiple times using a wall-to-wall
    method, where a new analyst inspects each field across the image and labels any
    crop fields that the previous analyst may have missed. To guarantee the best interpretation,
    at least two analysts were trained together for sample selection by the project
    leader. An initial training sample selection was performed by one analyst and
    the interpretation results were passed to another analyst for cross-checking.
    Cross-checked results were submitted to the final analyst, who is the quality
    controller for final checking. To gauge the degree of agreement between our annotators,
    we implemented Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient. This statistical measure serves to measure
    the agreement between annotators for qualitative items, such as the field typings.
    Cohen’s Kappa is expressed as (1) Where Pr(a) is the probability of overall agreement
    of the annotators and Pr(e) is the probability of overall agreement if by chance

    with the same spatial extent as the NAIP area. Colors represent different crop
    types following the legend in Fig. 2. The label corresponds as follows: c for
    contour levees, s for straight levees, z for zero grade, and u for unknown. 2.2.3.
    Image pre-processing Due to the variation in the greenness of crop fields caused
    by the differences in acquisition date, cameras, flight height, and weather conditions,
    we used grayscale images in classification. Grayscale images can decrease the
    algorithm’s sensitivity to color changes between images, as well as any color-associated
    errors that occurred during capture. Additionally, the grayscale image emphasizes
    the shapes and patterns present within the fields more than colors, which is beneficial
    in distinguishing the specific levee systems. One study found nearly a 2% increase
    in accuracy with grayscale images over RGB images in identifying colorectal polyps
    with a CNN (Hsu et al., 2021). Similarly, a facial recognition study found that
    RGB and grayscale images had equivalent rates of recognition (Torres et al., 1999).
    To convert images from RGB to grayscale, we used a formula proposed in Pascale
    (2003), (2) Furthermore, we subset the raw 5000 × 5000 images into a 5 × 5 grid
    creating 25 1000 × 1000 subimages for computational efficiency. These images were
    then downsampled to 320 × 320 using the skip count method with a factor of 3,
    which extracted every 3rd pixel value and discarded the rest. 2.2.4. Training/test
    sample split The quality of training and test samples is paramount to the model’s
    success. In this study, training samples were selected to comprise as much diversity
    of land use types in as few images as possible to reduce model training time and
    time spent on manual sample annotation. Test samples are also diverse when in
    the season the images were taken, contributing to a robust classification evaluation.
    The Lonoke county images have the widest image capture interval with dates ranging
    from 13 July to 26 August, which in this region generally is after canopy closure
    and prior to harvest. When training deep learning models, providing the appropriate
    balance between the size of the training and testing sets is crucial to avoiding
    over- and underfitting. Here, overfitting with an overly complex model could occur
    by detecting fields during only a particular growth phase or season and can be
    detected through very high accuracy for the training and/or validation sets with
    low accuracies for the testing set (Hawkins, 2004). Conversely, underfitting could
    manifest as the model predicting every field as having contour levees simply because
    of the similarity in color. Despite its importance, there is little consensus
    as to the proper split for the data (Joseph, 2022). Studies have suggested that
    anywhere from 30% (Nguyen et al., 2021) to nearly 100% of the data should be for
    training (Dubbs, 2021). Thus, to optimize the trade off between model performance,
    training time, and avoiding overfitting, we trained the model 10 times for each
    10% increment of the training fraction ranging from 10% to 80% (Supplemental Fig.
    3). Through this process, we identified the 60/40 training/testing split as the
    most optimal. As shown in Fig. 2, whole tile representations were assigned to
    either training or testing, with the exception of one tile in which 15 of its
    subtiles were assigned to training and 10 were assigned to testing. 2.3. Network
    architecture 2.3.1. Model selection To select an appropriate deep learning architecture
    design, we performed an initial comparison between the VGG and ResNet network
    designs, both of which come with the Tensorflow-Keras installation (Abadi et al.,
    2016), a common deep learning framework. The main difference between these models
    is the number of weighted neural layers, which are 16 and 50 for VGG and ResNet,
    respectively. The appropriate number of layers depends on the complexity of the
    problem, which is not known a priori. Neither of these models classify on a per-pixel
    basis, but rather assign a label to the entire input sub-image. To effectively
    identify the label of each image object, we created UNet hybrid architectures
    that utilize native encoders from ResNet and VGG coupled with custom decoders
    similar to those in UNet. UNet was first introduced in Ronneberger et al. (2015)
    and is named for its architecture’s shape. The model down-samples the input (the
    downslope of the “u”) to extract the feature maps then up-samples the input from
    previous layers and applies the feature maps (the upslope of the “u”). The upsampling
    phase of the architecture allows it to classify on a per-pixel basis. Thus, these
    hybrids preserve the portion of the VGG and ResNet models responsible for their
    high performance while also extending them with UNet decoders that allow for pixel-based
    classification. To compare the VGG/Unet and ResNet/Unet hybrids, we trained them
    using a custom loss function which sums (1) the intersection-over-union (IoU)
    loss, that essentially measures the similarity between the labeled and predicted
    bounding boxes, and (2) the binary cross-entropy functions that are described
    in more detail in the next section. Preliminary results showed that the ResNet/Unet
    model consistently surpassed the VGG/Unet model throughout the training epochs,
    or iterations, by converging at 0.06 in 21 epochs versus 0.33 in 55 epochs (Supplemental
    Fig. 2). The ResNet architecture was first introduced in an effort to address
    the accuracy degradation that many deep models face. Essentially, as the depth
    (or number of layers) increases, the accuracy will become stagnant and then quickly
    decrease. To combat this problem, ResNet uses identity mapping, wherein each block
    or grouping of layers uses both the raw input and output of the previous block.
    This redundancy provides the retention of useful information while also preventing
    the over-abstraction of the data. Overall, ResNet has outperformed many models
    including Fitnet and Highway with more than a 1% reduction in error (He et al.,
    2016). Our hybrid ResNet/Unet (Fig. 4) uses 7 specific types of layers from the
    tensorflow library (Abadi et al., 2016): Zero-padding, 2-dimensional convolution,
    batch normalization, addition, concatenate, max pooling, and convolutional transpose.
    Zero padding appends zeros to the top, bottom, left, and right of the image, effectively
    centering it in a larger array. Next, the 2-dimensional convolution layer provides
    the functionality for the model to extract feature maps. Third, the batch normalization
    layer standardizes the input to maintain a mean close to zero and a standard deviation
    close to one (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). Fourth, the addition layer adds two arrays
    of the same shape to return an array of the same shape as the inputs. Next, the
    concatenate layer also takes two arrays as inputs and appends one input to the
    other along a specified axis. Next, the max pooling layer effectively downsamples
    its input by extracting the maximum value of a moving window. Lastly, the convolutional
    transpose, also known as deconvolution, works in the opposite direction as the
    regular convolutional layer. Thus, the layer essentially applies the feature maps
    that the convolutional layers had previously extracted. Download : Download high-res

    the output, a probability map classifying different segments of the grayscale
    input image, yellow for contour field and purple for background. 2.3.2. Model
    tuning The ResNet/Unet model hyperparameters were set as follows. First, the learning
    rate that controls how much the weights of the network are updated within each
    training iteration is set to 0.0005. Second, the number of these training iterations,
    known as epochs, acts as the maximum number of times that the weights can be updated,
    and is set to 100. Third, the batch size, referring to how many samples of the
    training set will be used within that epoch, was set to 5 images. Fourth, we established
    gradient accumulation into an exponentially weighted average to guide model learning
    using RMSProp (Tieleman et al., 2012, Zaheer and Shaziya, 2019), which is an optimizer
    protocol that was found to achieve the highest validation accuracy with the VGG-16
    model on a common image classification dataset (Li et al., 2021). Additionally,
    several self-tuning callbacks were used to dynamically augment the training process.
    First, we implemented early stopping, which cuts the training process short if
    the model stops improving for more than two epochs. Second, through the “reduce”
    callback we were able to lower the learning rate during a learning plateau, which
    prevents the model from overshooting the minimum loss. 2.3.3. Determining the
    optimal threshold for binary mapping To determine whether a field contains a contour
    levee patch from the probability map, we establish a threshold value to convert
    the output into a binary map. The probability value of each pixel will be adjusted
    to either 1, should its probability be higher than the threshold, or 0 in the
    case that its probability is lower. For example, with a threshold value of 0.6,
    all pixels with values above 0.6 were adjusted to 1 and all others were adjusted
    to 0. By iterating over the “binary metrics” (Accuracy, F1, IoU, and BER, discussed
    in a later section) for varying thresholds, we were able to identify the value
    that yields the greatest performance. 2.4. Model evaluation and accuracy assessment
    2.4.1. Probabilistic evaluation We evaluated the ResNet/Unet model’s performance
    based on our loss function consisting of the IoU, also known as the Jaccard index
    (van Beers and Marco A. Wiering, 2019) and the Binary Cross Entropy function.
    The IoU is a widely used metric that shows the model’s object detection by returning
    the similarities between the ground truth bounding box and the bounding box of
    the prediction. Binary Cross Entropy, also known as the Log loss, takes the negative
    log of the prediction probabilities. If the probability is 100%, the loss will
    be zero. As the probability decreases, the loss will increase thus penalizing
    uncertainty. Furthermore, we examined the model’s raw output, which is the probability
    map that predicts the likelihood of each pixel belonging to a field that contains
    contour levees, against the corresponding ground truth labels. The metric employed
    is the set of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (Bradley, 1997, Flach,
    2016) that compare the true positive rate (the proportion of pixels predicted
    and labeled as contour fields) and the false positive rate (the proportion of
    pixels predicted as fields but labeled as a non-contour field). By thresholding
    the model’s output as described in Section 2.3.3, we are able to convert the probability
    map into a binary map. Next, we can compare the binary predictions to their respective
    labels to calculate the true and false positive rates. This process is repeated
    for each possible value for the decision threshold (within the range of (0,1))
    leaving a set of true/false positive rate pairings that we can plot. Smaller false
    positive rates indicate more true negatives while higher true positive rates indicate
    more true positives. Thus, as the area under the receiver operating characteristic
    (AUC-ROC) curve approaches 100%, the ResNet/Unet model’s effectiveness increases
    as shown in supplemental fig. 3. A 1:1 line is also drawn to signify a random
    predictor (Mas et al., 2013). By visualizing and quantifying these metrics, a
    holistic assessment of model skill can be estimated. 2.4.2. Binary accuracy assessment
    on the classified map The binary map after thresholding was assessed using four
    metrics, separately overall accuracy, F1, IoU, and balanced error rate. Overall
    accuracy (OA) is a relatively standard accuracy metric for binary classification
    that is calculated by dividing the number of true classifications by the total
    number of classifications. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of Precision and
    Recall, which are defined as: (3) (4) Where TP indicates true positive, FP indicates
    false positive, and FN indicates false negatives (Sasaki, 2007). Precision shows
    the ratio of samples that are correctly classified as positive out of all of the
    samples labeled as positive. Recall shows the number of actual positives compared
    to the total number of labeled positives in the set. The values are further used
    to calculate the F1 score which allows us to examine the combined effects of misclassification.
    However, this metric is independent of the value of true negatives, so in our
    case, the pixels that are correctly classified as within non-contour fields will
    not be reflected in this metric. This metric is less prone to issues related to
    class imbalances than the standard overall accuracy metric, but it does not distinguish
    between false positive or false negative model errors (Japkowicz, 2006). Thus,
    in cases where the drawbacks of false positive and false negative classifications
    are not equal, this metric can be misleading. In our project, however, a false
    positive and a false negative are comparable. (5) Additionally, we calculated
    the Balanced Error Rate (BER) metric. This metric shows the average proportion
    of error between the classes, which is given by: (6) Where Np and Nn are the number
    of Field pixels and the number of non-field pixels. Because of the disproportionate
    number of field pixels per non-field pixels, the BER metric gives a less biased
    result than the standard mean accuracy. Since this metric displays the proportion
    of error, lower values indicate better model performance. 2.4.3. Comparison to
    other products We also evaluated performance by comparing our algorithm’s accuracy
    with previous studies. We first conducted a literature review in the field of
    agricultural landscape identification and summarized the accuracy values for the
    highest performed models. We then compared the mapping outcomes with two relevant
    studies. The first study took a deep network-based method IrrNet-Bi-Seg that used
    a bi-stream encoder–decoder architecture to quantify the contour-levee fields.
    By applying the IrrNet_Bi_Seg method on the same NAIP dataset, it achieved an
    average accuracy of 86.23% and 15%–17% improvement over benchmark methods (Liang
    et al., 2021). The second study is Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID-US)
    - 30 m resolution annual maps of irrigation distribution for the US centered around
    detecting irrigated fields (Xie and Lark, 2021). It used a semi-automatic training
    approach for training sample generation and ecoregion-stratified random forest
    classification using Google Earth Engine. The annual maps there achieved a mean
    Kappa value of 0.88, overall accuracy of 94%, and producer’s and user’s accuracy
    of the irrigation class of 97.3% and 90.5%, respectively, at the sub-national
    (large aquifer) level. 2.5. Scalability test The quality of remotely sensed images
    could be affected by various atmospheric conditions or the mechanical-optical
    systems, resulting in different levels of noise and obstructions being added to
    the image. Using the clear, undistorted image as our “normal” benchmark scenario,
    we conducted tests on a series of image artifacts, including: (1) Sensitivity
    to various spatial resolutions Our first sensitivity experiments consisted of
    reducing the image resolution to account for changes in sensing equipment. To
    simulate a reduction in quality of sensing equipment, we tested the ResNet/Unet
    model on reductions of resolution from 1-m to 10-m, 20-m, 30-m, and 60-m. To achieve
    this reduction, we created a duplicate image where the pixel values were averaged
    across varying window sizes following the step in Rosa et al. (2021). For example,
    to reduce the image to 10-m, we averaged consecutive windows of size 10px by 10px.
    This same method was applied for tests on 20-m, 30-m, and 60-m resolutions. (2)
    Sensitivity to various image contamination scenarios To test different degrees
    of noise via random noise augmentation to the images, we created a separate array
    which contains random samples from a normal gaussian distribution with a standard
    deviation (which can also be interpreted as the spread) of 0.3. Then, once combined
    with the image it creates a static effect. This occurs when the signal to noise
    ratio is low, which may not be common in modern equipment, but is still possible
    in older instruments (Curran and Hay, 1986). We test cloudiness simulations given
    that approximately 45% of the Earth’s land surface is covered by clouds at any
    moment (Stubenrauch et al., 2013). This effect may also be more relevant to continuous
    satellite observations (e.g., the Planet constellation, Houborg and McCabe, 2016
    ) than to aerial imagery taken deliberately on clear days. To simulate this contamination,
    a python library imgaug was used (Jung et al., 2020). We set the opacity of the
    layer to only 40% to achieve more representative conditions that can be encountered
    by a low flying plane, based on our visual assessment of likely opacity conditions
    in the resultant images. (3) Geographic scalability Download : Download high-res

    is used to compare performance across Training/Testing splits. The binary performance
    metrics are: (b) Accuracy, (c) F1, and (d) Intersection over Union (IoU). Lastly,
    we tested the ResNet/Unet model in samples from a different location, expanding
    from the singular location used in the training and testing sets. We seek to develop
    a model that applies globally, requiring that the model’s spatial transferability
    be scrutinized. Thus, we selected five images with a high degree of rice production
    from 11 different counties across Arkansas: Arkansas, Clay, Craighead, Crittenden,
    Desha, Greene, Jackson, Jefferson, Lawrence, Mississippi, and Woodruff. These
    images, referred to as the 55 testing tiles, were annotated and evaluated using
    the same annotation scheme and metrics described previously. In an effort to explain
    any variation in performance when applying the ResNet/Unet model to imagery outside
    of Lonoke we implemented three greeness metrics: excess greenness (EG), green
    chromatic coordinate (GCC) (Reid et al., 2016), and the Greenness Index (GI) (Louhaichi
    et al., 2001). These metrics are defined as: (7) (8) (9) where R, G, and B represent
    the red, green, and blue bands of the input imagery respectively. 3. Results 3.1.
    Dataset and model optimization Our final training and test dataset contains 723
    annotated polygons with 461 labeled as contour fields and the remaining 262 as
    other irrigation methods (228 as zero grade, 25 as straight levee, 0 as center
    pivot, and 9 as unknown) that will be grouped with background. Each polygon encompasses
    a crop field and the polygons averaged 20.35 ha in size with a standard deviation
    of 14.28 ha; their sizes ranged from 0.36 ha to 126.75 ha. These annotations were
    inspected by two trained annotators and received an average 0.841 Cohen Kappa
    inter-rater agreement score, which falls in the 0.81–0.99 interval of almost perfect
    agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). After the images were subsetted, there were
    a total of four hundred 320 × 320 px images. To balance the training and testing
    sets, we calculated the averaged AUC score over 10 training sessions for varying
    training/testing splits. Because model performance reached a plateau (AUC score:
    0.957) after 40% of the data was designated for training (supplemental Fig. 1),
    we elected to use this ratio for later tests. Due to the probabilistic nature
    of the raw model output, we also defined the confidence threshold ( ) to convert
    the model’s predictions from probabilities to binary outputs. Fig. 5 shows the
    effects of three different values across three different metrics where a binary
    map is required. The difference in performance between these thresholds was within
    0.01 for all cases. Considering the 0.7 threshold yielded the highest accuracy
    and F1 regardless of training/testing split, we used this threshold for our remaining
    tests. With the 40/60 training/testing split on the Lonoke County tiles and a
    threshold value of 0.7, the ResNet/Unet model produced a 0.991 AUC, 0.548 BER,
    0.970 Accuracy, 0.924 F1 (composed of Precision of 0.945 and Recall of 0.903),
    and 0.858 IoU. 3.2. Results of scalability tests In our scalability experiments,
    we assessed the ResNet/Unet model’s feasibility given different environmental
    and technological scenarios. Overall, the model presented high sensitivity to
    resolution reduction (Fig. 6 a), but continued to perform well given some degree
    of cloud cover or a small spread of gaussian noise (Fig. 6 b). Spatial scalability
    could present a challenge for the model considering that the worst performing
    of the 55 tiles tested has received a 83.1% AUC-ROC (Min Diff Site in Fig. 6 c),
    but on average the model continues to perform well with approximately an 8% reduction
    in the average case (Avg Diff Site in Fig. 6 c). Download : Download high-res

    to different spatial resolution In testing the impact of image spatial resolution,
    we observed a quick degradation in performance after resampling to less than a
    tenth of the ResNet/Unet model’s native resolution (i.e., from 1 m to 10 m or
    coarser). Specifically, AUC changes from 99.1% in the original 1-m resolution
    to 93.8%, 80.0%, 78.5%, 69.1% in the 10-m, 20-m, 30-m, and 60-m resolutions, respectively
    (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 provides a qualitative demonstration of the resampled images
    and the corresponding model predictions. Download : Download high-res image (527KB)

    to different atmospheric conditions Next, we tested the ResNet/Unet model’s sensitivity
    to different simulated atmospheric conditions. For both cloud contamination and
    gaussian static noise, we tested across a range of parameter values to find the
    threshold at which model performance decays. In the case of cloud cover, the maximum
    opacity of the cloud layer (denoted by ) was between 60% and 70%, receiving a
    94.3% and 95.8% AUC-ROC respectively (Fig. 6a, 8a,b,e,f). For gaussian noise,
    spread values ( ) between 0.3 and 0.4 degraded model performance to below 80%

    When testing the model outside of the training region, the performance slightly
    decreased from Lonoke County (AUC of 99.1%) to the 55-tile set (AUC of 91.2%).
    The values for OA, F1, IoU and BER are given in Table 1 and represented in the
    brown sets in Fig. 9. We investigated performance within the 55 tiles in terms
    of imagery capture date, excess greenness (EG) and green chromatic coordinate
    (GCC), the Greenness Index, as well as the presence of straight levees, but none
    provided explanatory power over the model residuals beyond 0.9–7.7%. Examples
    of these images are provided in (Supplemental Fig. 4). Table 1. Performance metric

    products From our literature search, we selected eight papers that are most relevant
    to irrigation or agricultural landscape classification, and we summarize their
    subject area and reported accuracies in Table 2. By comparing our Lonoke County
    mapping results against IrrNet_Bi_Seg results using the same testing data. IrrNet_Bi_Seg
    yielded an AUC, overall accuracy, F1, IoU, and BER of 93.5%, 94.4%, 88.7% (a precision
    of 85.7% and recall of 91.9%), 79.7%, and 54.1% respectively. The ResNet/UNet
    and IrrNet_Bi_Seg models performed comparably with ResNet/UNet having a slight
    increase in four of the five metrics. The comparison with 30 m resolution LANID
    data demonstrates that LANID detected 85.2% of the fields our ResNet/UNet model
    detected (Xie and Lark, 2021). In other words, 14.8% of contour field pixels detected
    by our model did not show up on the LANID map. Table 2. Reported accuracy of different

    et al., 2019) to using machine learning techniques to identify contour levee fields
    (Liang et al., 2021), and now testing different levee-identification approaches.
    Overall our system shows preliminary success in segmenting contour levee irrigation
    fields, as evidenced through the ROC curve, overall accuracy, F1, IoU and BER
    scores, receiving 99.1%, 97.0%, 92.4%, 85.8%, and 54.8% respectively. The model
    performed on par with many of the aforementioned models in the field of agriculture
    landscape segmentation and surpassed the highest model we found with a similar
    goal of striation detection within a segmented image (Table 2). The comparison
    with LANID data helps illustrate the role of spatial resolution in classification.
    Theoretically, all of the contour-levee fields our model detects should be a subset
    of the fields LANID detected. Further investigation revealed that a large number
    of the pixels belong to a single field with very apparent contour levees (Supplemental
    Fig. 5b.) that were thus likely misclassified by LANID. Any remaining pixels fall
    on the edges of other fields and are likely mismatched due to the difference in
    resolution. Coarser resolution imagery (e.g., 30 m for LANID) will have blurrier
    edges between fields, and the field boundaries are likely to blend with the crop
    fields, which causes overestimation in the size of the actual field (Supplemental
    Fig. 5a). Thus, a field boundary detection step using higher resolution imagery
    is likely important, and could follow recent model development in this area (e.g.,
    Jong et al., 2022). Several challenges remain for model validation (Supplemental
    Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Upon calculating the true positive and true negative
    scores of the Lonoke testing set, we can see that the model accurately discerns
    what is labeled as background, correctly classifying background 98.6% of the time,
    but it is slightly weaker in classifying contour fields (90.3%). There are a few
    scenarios that could cause this weaker detection rate, some of which are demonstrated
    in Supplemental Fig. 6. First, structures such as tractor paths or roads that
    may cut through the field could present as levees. Additionally, the model easily
    discerns formations such as buildings or streams as not being a field at all,
    let alone one irrigated with contour levees. However, fields using one of the
    other irrigation systems or even a field that was recently harvested and still
    has tractor tracks present would be more difficult to classify. Though our imagery
    was largely captured during times with a fully closed canopy, these field management
    effects are sometimes still visible, as discovered in the tests detailed in Section
    3.2.3. Additionally, the use of the higher resolution commercial satellites such
    as Planet could give us year-round imagery which may alleviate these issues, when
    they are available. It is also important to note that the model’s confusion may
    be a byproduct of filtering out non-contour levee fields in the training process
    (Supplemental Fig. 6). Had we preserved the other irrigation types, the more ambiguous
    areas of the image would likely have had labels, thus providing additional classes,
    such as straight levees, for the model to learn rather than relying solely on
    contour levees. Another potential cause of the weaker true positive rate of some
    of these images is the lack of positive pixels within a sub-tile. The labeling
    in 1b–5b of Supplemental Fig. 6 shows that these images contain only a small portion
    of a much larger contour field. Thus, due to the label corresponding to such a
    small area of the field, it is possible that no levees were even present in the
    image, but rather only part of the contour-leveed field. This issue can be attributed
    to the way the images were broken into a grid, and could be improved in future
    studies with a different type of labeling and image segmentation process (e.g.,
    with fraction thresholds). Upon further inspection, we noticed that the worst-performing
    images from the 55 testing tiles had less than 30% of the label occupied by contour
    labels (some example images demonstrating this impact are in Supplemental Fig.
    6). It is likely that the image subsetting function used to subset the large 5000
    × 5000 tiles into smaller sub-images skews the metric values, as the only positive
    case present in the label is a small portion of a field on the edge of the image
    in these cases (e.g., row b in Supplemental Fig. 6). We now compare the accuracy,
    F1, IoU, and BER for sets including and excluding samples with less than 30% of
    the label containing contour fields for both the Lonoke testing tiles and the
    55 tiles from across eastern Arkansas (Fig. 9). The exclusive set, meaning tiles
    with greater than 30% contour levee pixels, received 77.2%, 68.2%, 51.7%, and
    72.6% for Overall Accuracy, F1, IoU, and BER respectively (blue sets in Fig. 9b).
    Contrary to its inclusive counterpart discussed in Section 4.1, the Lonoke testing
    set with at least 30% of the label containing a contour field received an Accuracy,
    F1, IoU, and BER of 93.2%, 93.0%, 86.8%, and 54.8% respectively. Thus, while not
    uniformly better (i.e., across all four metrics), we recommend setting a threshold
    value of 30% labeled for each tile to minimize edge effects in future studies.
    Alternatively, instead of breaking images into a grid, a form of sliding window
    could be implemented. This approach could alleviate edge cases by ensuring that
    a more complete image of the field will also be seen by the model. Additionally,
    this approach would eliminate the risk that a small but complete contour levee
    field that occupies less than 30% of the pixels in a subtile could be discarded.
    A potential candidate for comparison with our study is the shifted windows Transformer
    (Swin) that brings a hierarchical to image processing (Liu et al., 2021). This
    architecture’s hierarchical approach builds on existing transformer models, which
    rely on fixed-sized patches of a given image, by dividing the image into non-overlapping
    patches of varying sizes. The model then refines its understanding of the input
    image at varying scales: smaller patches at the lower hierarchical levels and
    larger ones at the higher levels. This process is quite different than how the
    ResNet portion of our model convolves overlapping patches of an image. Although
    it is not clear whether CNN or transformer-based neural networks are more suited
    for a given task, there have been several studies leveraging Swin/UNet architectures
    for remote sensing applications in recent years. Similar to our use of ResNet
    for the extraction of feature maps, these studies use the Swin transformer for
    the same purpose. For instance, two recent studies proposed Swin/Unet hybrid architectures
    (He et al., 2022, Gao et al., 2021) to evaluate different datasets: the Vaihingen
    dataset and the Potsdam dataset (Chen et al., 2014b). The first contains 33 aerial
    images of varying sizes with near-infrared, red, and green bands. The images are
    labeled according to many different object classes such as buildings, roads, and
    trees. The second dataset contains 38 images of uniform size with red, green,
    and blue color bands. This dataset was also labeled according to many urban development-related
    classes such as buildings and roads. For the Vaihingen dataset, He et al. (2022)
    found mean IoU and mean F1 scores of 67.32% and 79.94% while Gao et al. (2021)
    achieved 66.66% and 78.67% for the same metrics. With respect to the Potsdam dataset,
    He et al. (2022) achieved 75.97% mean IoU and 86.13% mean F1 scores whereas Gao
    et al. (2021) yielded 71.46% and 82.08%. Although these values are slightly lower
    than what we found in this study, given the change in subject area from urban
    development to crop field mapping, the Swin transformer could provide valuable
    insight into the most applicable architectures for mapping irrigation patterns.

    Fig. 9. Shows the accuracy, F1, IoU, and BER performance metrics for (a) the 240
    sub-tile model development testing set from Lonoke County and (b) the 1375 sub-tile
    scalability test set drawn from the 55 testing tiles across the state. Performance
    metrics are shown to compare a case with a subset of contour-dense tiles (i.e.,
    at least 30% of the image label contains a contour field) vs. the full set of
    testing tiles. The contour-dense set (i.e., “ 30%”) contains 33 images in plot
    a and 258 in plot b, and its metrics typically have a smaller range and smoother
    distribution compared to the inclusive set (“All”), thus insinuating a higher
    consistency amongst its subtiles. In the violin plots, the white dot represents
    the median of the samples, the thick portion of the line represents the interquartile
    range, and the thin portion represents the 1.5× interquartile range. The kernel
    density in blue or orange is represented by the shape around the box plot. 4.2.
    What drives model sensitivity in high-resolution mapping? The model’s capability
    is retained even with variations and noise in the data. Reductions in resolution
    and other visual disturbances created minor changes in the performance metrics;
    the greatest change was 0.203 in the AUC when the gaussian noise with a 0.4 spread
    was added to the input imagery. The model seems to maintain its ability up to
    a resolution reduction to 10 m at which the performance begins to degrade. This
    larger resolution threshold (i.e., much greater than levee thickness) calls into
    question what characteristic of the labeled fields the model uses to make its
    prediction. Perhaps it weighs the curvature and overall pattern of the field more
    heavily than the thickness of the individual levees. In practice, this finding
    implies that the ResNet/Unet model is suitable for use with Sentinel-like images
    or finer (de Moura et al., 2022), but not Landsat Pouliot et al. (2019) or MODIS
    (Zhang et al., 2021). These outcomes are consistent with a recent machine learning
    approach to rice field identification and mapping in Pakistan that demonstrates
    at least an 8% F1-score improvement when using Sentinel-2 compared to Landsat
    and MODIS (Waleed et al., 2022). The model is robust against different levels
    of simulated clouds but handles differences in imaging systems better than environmental
    differences. The introduction of cloud cover, a likely scenario in practice, yielded
    results comparable to that of a 25% reduction in image resolution. Static noise,
    however, proved to minimally affect the results, likely because the static is
    spread over the entire image rather than in one concentrated area. Thus, the model
    seems to mostly disregard the affected pixel in favor of the classification of
    the neighboring pixels. Insensitivity to cloud cover further bolsters the model’s
    suitability for high-resolution satellite imagery, as cloud cover typically presents
    a challenge with this data source (Zhang et al., 2020). However, the stronger
    sensitivity to gaussian static could present a challenge due to random noise being
    an often overlooked limitation of aerial and satellite imagery (Anikeeva and Chibunichev,
    2021). 4.3. Theoretical implications and practical applications Precision farming
    requires a mix of historical and contemporary information, including harvest estimates,
    land use history, farmland sales, and landscape modification (Finger et al., 2019).
    Thus, our model could provide value to non-profit, public sector, or commercial
    actors who aid farmers in making informed decisions when dealing with critical
    natural resources. This identification could help map out and prioritize water
    and carbon conservation programs, due to the tight interplay between irrigation
    and the water and carbon cycles in these landscapes (Runkle et al., 2019, Moreno-García
    et al., 2021, Henry et al., 2016). Ongoing identification work can help monitor
    the success of programs that seek to induce practice changes or to aid in new
    program development by identifying regions slower to implement conservation land
    grading methods. Indeed, changing contour levee irrigation to other, more efficient
    delivery approaches such as multiple-inlet rice irrigation can improve irrigation
    efficiency and reduce water use by up to 24% (Massey et al., 2018). Improved levee
    detection could also improve hydrological models that require a clear understanding
    of water flow pathways through these agricultural environments, including estimates
    of seepage and percolation (LaHue and Linquist, 2021), flood mitigation potential
    (Chen et al., 2014a), and nitrogen runoff associated with irrigation (Ouyang et
    al., 2020, Kim et al., 2021). Better landform classification can also be useful
    in a geomorphological context, improving digital elevation models with implications
    in hydrology and erosion studies (Li et al., 2020). 4.4. Future research directions
    Since this research has primarily focused on methods development, there is still
    work to be done to further assess the scalability of the model. First, we need
    to examine the temporal scalability. All of the data we used in this study was
    acquired in a 26 day span in 2015, thus, the model should be tested on data from
    years other than 2015. This inter-annual test would provide necessary insight
    into how the model will perform in practice. Second, though we tested the model
    with images outside of the training county within Arkansas with the 55 testing
    tiles, a complete assessment of the model’s performance outside of Arkansas would
    demonstrate the extent of the geographic scalability. A state such as California,
    which ranks second in terms of rice production behind Arkansas (Illsley, 2020),
    would provide ample data for us to test while also being geographically distinct
    from Araknsas. Third, the model’s transferability into non-native resolutions
    should also be validated. We speculate that the model would perform well on Sentinel-like
    imagery, but further testing could prove this hypothesis. Lastly, this product
    has the potential to enable whole-region classification of irrigation systems.
    Thus, we have made the project open-source to make it both accessible to the people
    who need it and to allow people to make the necessary changes to suit their specific
    means. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dsdale/CropContourLeveeMapping
    on publication. 5. Conclusion In this study we investigated the use of a neural
    network to identify rice contour levee systems from aerial imagery. The results
    of our approach are promising, as they show that our model maintains a high level
    of performance despite added noise and reductions in image resolution. This open-source
    model lays the groundwork for a future region-wide landscape classification system.
    Our results demonstrate that we are on track to support irrigation and water resource
    management in the Midsouth USA region. Additionally, the model architecture is
    robust enough that it is moderately scalable to different environments provided
    the resolution of the imagery used is greater than 10 m. The noise addition analyses
    show that the model is moderately accepting of environmental variance such as
    cloud cover. The work enables analysis of landscape use patterns to drive models
    of agricultural productivity and sustainability in rice growing regions by providing
    a county-wide proof of concept and improving approximately 5.6% over existing
    methods. It also offers a guide for approaching any type of deep learning pattern
    identification problem, no matter the discipline. CRediT authorship contribution

    Article Open access 11 January 2024 1 Introduction IoT is an advanced technology
    for monitoring and controlling devices anywhere in the world. In many fields,
    it creates a remarkable mark due to its easy accessibility. Few technologies developed
    by IoT, such as remote sensors, drones and robots have made people''s lives easier
    and more beneficial. Moreover, these technologies have experimented on fundamental
    needs such as food that is obtained from the agricultural field. From the recent
    survey of World Bank, it is approximated that more than 50% of food is required
    to cultivate before 2050 based on present population rate. However, such huge
    production of the crop is a challenging task because of the current climatic changes.
    In such cases, Smart agriculture system plays a vital role to increase the yield
    by monitoring and predicting the production of the crops. IoT based crop yield
    prediction enables the farmers to enhance productivity. In general, an IoT based
    smart farming system is deployed in an agriculture field for monitoring the crop
    field with the help of sensors namely DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor),
    TOC (Total Organic Carbon) and nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) sensors.
    Using this setup, farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere. Gateways
    are responsible for receiving data from the crop area and forward them to the
    storage unit. The prediction engine is used to predict the results and sends information
    to the notification server. Agricultural supervision, particularly crop yield
    observation is essential for examining the food security in a region. Manually
    predicting crop yield is a challenging task due to several difficult aspects.
    Based on the water quality as well as availability, pest infestations, genotype,
    landscape, soil quality, climatic condition, etc., the crop yield may vary. The
    strategies and the processes are non-linear in nature, intricate and varied with
    time because of external aspects and correlated factors (Elavarasan and Vincent
    2020). Recently, several studies illustrate that ML approaches such as support
    vector regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), etc. have comparatively more enhanced
    potential than the traditional techniques. These approaches have the ability to
    predict linear and non-linear agricultural architecture. These methods were obtained
    from the learning process in the ML agricultural framework (Dang et al. 2020;
    Van Klompenburg et al. 2020; Bhojani and Bhatt 2020). On observing the most outstanding
    frameworks in agriculture, artificial and deep neural networks are the commonly
    utilized models (Gopal and Bhargavi 2019). Some of the ML models used to predict
    the crop yield are neural architecture search (NAS) (Ren et al. 2020), linear
    discriminant analysis (LDA) (Yan et al. 2020), spectral clustering (Li et al.
    2018a, b; Li et al. 2019) and artificial neural network (ANN) (Gopal 2019). ANN
    is a network model that generates approximation by bias as well as a weight optimization
    for a node-link structure including input, hidden and output layers. Deep learning
    (DL) is a subgroup of ML that is used to predict the crop yield based on the varying
    arrangement of raw data via the intensive learning process in a deep network (Shook
    et al. 2020). Moreover, these DL algorithms have the capability to design a probability
    model using field data. In addition to this advantage, DL approaches provide data
    on plant performance under various climate changes (Nevavuori et al. 2020). For
    example, Reinforcement learning is one of the major areas of artificial intelligence.
    It is the preparation of ML models for decision-making sequences and is the significant
    class of algorithm that is used to streamline the logic for dynamic programming
    (Elavarasan and Vincent 2021). Besides, extreme learning machine (ELM) is also
    a ML approach capable of enabling neural network training for predicting the crop
    yield. It accelerates the learning process and provided better outcomes. However,
    these approaches have several disadvantages like less sustainability, computationally
    expensive, high complexity and false prediction (Suchithra and Pai 2020). To overcome
    these challenges, an efficient ML based crop yield prediction model is proposed
    in this work. Agriculture is the major source that increases the economic system
    of India. In order to overcome the issues of high cost and complex management
    of conventional agricultural planting, IoT is applied for realizing real time
    detection, crop growth intelligent management and change the conventional agricultural
    planting mode. Various mathematical and empirical yield approaches have been evaluated
    for several crops. These models requires an enormous amount of knowledge about
    soil and crop, which makes it hard for implementing for various localities. Many
    satellites based remote sensing methods have also been developed for yield modelling.
    But these approaches are not able to provide enough spatial details for small
    farms to optimize crops. Recent development of ML models enables researchers to
    solve and understand complex predictions. Motivated by this, aKNCN is used in
    the research work for soil quality estimation and ELM-mBOA is used for crop yield
    prediction thereby achieves better results.The major contributions of the proposed
    work are: The proposed work provides an IoT based farming system that ensures
    the deployment of effective crop yield prediction model. This work involves pre-processing,
    Feature selection and classification. The data is pre-processed and the features
    are selected by Feature selection algorithms. Then IoT based smart agriculture
    system using two-tier ML model is proposed for the better prediction of crop yield.
    Ml based Classification model Adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier
    (aKNCN) is used to classify the soil samples for different classes by considering
    the properties of soil dataset. Extreme learning machine algorithm (ELM) model
    is proposed for predicting the crop yield and the weights of the model is updated
    using modified Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (mBOA) to improve the prediction
    system with less error values. Paper outline: Sect. 1 presents the introduction
    and highlights smart agricultures in brief. Recent related works during (2019–2021)
    are discussed in Sect. 2. Section 3 presents the proposed framework along with
    important measurable. Section 4 discusses the experimental analysis and results.
    Section 5 provides the applications of the proposed methodology and Sect. 6 concludes
    the presented work. 2 Related works Abbas et al. (2020) predicted the crop yield
    via proximal sensing and the ML algorithms. The objective was to extract significant
    data that are responsible for controlling the yield of crop. The properties of
    potato tuber crop and the data of soil have been gathered by proximal sensing.
    A large dataset was utilized for the prediction performance. Support vector regression
    (SVR), k-nearest neighbour (K-NN), linear regression and elastic net ML algorithms
    were utilized for the classification and prediction of crop yield. The metrics
    like R2, MAE and RMSE were determined for the performance evaluation. The performance
    achieved for KNN was poor due to the increased number of functions in predicting
    crop yield. Rezk et al. (2021) presented an IoT based smart agriculture system
    using ML algorithm. The drought and the crop productivity were predicted by WPART
    and it was a combination of wrapper and PART techniques. Feature selection and
    classification were the two important phases in the prediction process. Wrapper
    feature selection technique selected the optimal features for further classification.
    PART was a partial decision tree approach used for classification and prediction.
    Accuracy, precision, sensitivity and F1 score were considered for the experiment
    of WPART. The crops taken for experiment were Sugarcane, Jowar, Bajra and Soybean.
    Some samples in the dataset were misleadingly labelled, thus the false prediction
    rate was high. Bu and Wang (2019) developed deep reinforcement learning based
    ML technique for a smart farming IoT system. To classify and predict the crop
    yield, cloud computing and artificial intelligence were combined. The key goal
    of this research was to minimize resource consumption and maximize food production.
    A hierarchical Bayesian based multi-task reinforcement learning method has been
    utilized for modelling the Markov decision process. Then, the Q-value regression
    function was examined using policy distillation. However, computational complexity
    was considered as one of the major drawback of this approach. Also, performance
    on a human level was not achieved in solving complex task and adapting to dynamic
    environments. Nevavuori, et al. (2019) proposed a deep learning technique for
    crop yield prediction. The key objectives of this research were crop yield prediction,
    biomass evaluation, crop and weed detection. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    was modelled for extracting the features, training, hyperparameter tuning and
    regularization to predict the yield of wheat and barley crops. MAE and MAPE are
    the evaluation metrics used for simulation analysis. But, the presented CNN does
    not perform well for the large dataset. Also, the performance efficiency of this
    method was not good. Dos Santos et al. (2019) introduced AgriPrediction model
    for IoT based smart agriculture system. It was an end-to-end model that predicted
    agricultural crops. It was the integration of prediction as well as short and
    medium wireless network range system. The components of the AgriPrediction model
    have been designed according to the ARIMA prediction model and LoRa IoT technology.
    Initially, the data were gathered using sensors, then the discrete moving average-based
    prediction has been performed. If the predicted crop goes wrong, then the notification
    was given to the farmer’s mobile phone. This model was computationally expensive
    and less sustainable. Moreover, the accuracy of this AgriPrediction model was
    not evaluated in this research. The future scope of this research is to generate
    a mobile application for crop’s real-time monitoring. Saranya and Nagarajan (2020)
    presented a neural network with population based incremental learning (NN-PBIL)
    method to improve predictive performance. The neural network was used to classify
    and predict the crop yield. The weight of the neural network was updated by the
    PBIL approach. The Hadoop framework has been utilized for the prediction performance.
    Neural network along with ANN and multiple linear regressions (MLR) were implemented
    for the crop yield prediction. Low convergence and getting stuck within local
    minimum were the major drawbacks in this presented model. Filippi et al. (2019)
    proposed the empirical modelling scheme for predicting the yield of barley, wheat
    and canola crops. In this research, several fields are considered for the prediction
    performance instead of single field in isolation. Random forest models and publically
    available data with temporal and spatial data collected on-farm were combined
    for the yield prediction of canola, barley and wheat. The experimental results
    showed that the accuracy obtained by this predictive model was low. Sun et al.
    (2019) predicted the soybean yield both during the season and at the end of the
    season using deep CNN-LSTM based on remote sensing data. The training data such
    as MODIS surface reflectance (SR) data, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data
    and weather data were correlated and transformed to histogram based tensors according
    to the Google earth engine (GEE). The performance of crop yield prediction at
    large scale was not evaluated in this research. Time and computational complexity
    was high and fed the raw remote sensing data into DL mode was a complex task.
    However, there are some limitations with these approaches like computational complexity,
    high expensive, dependencies between target and input variables, proper model
    representation and accuracy, affected by data quality. Due to these drawbacks
    the proposed model introduces 2 classification models with optimal weight selection
    for crop yield prediction. 3 Proposed framework The ingredients of soil such as
    phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen, crop rotation and atmospheric temperature
    etc. play a vital role in cultivation. ML methods are an essential decision support
    device for the prediction of crop yield like supporting decision on what crops
    to grow. Many ML algorithms are employed to support the prediction of crop yield.
    In the proposed smart agricultural framework, pre-processing, FS and a two-tier
    model is implemented for crop yield prediction. Here, akNCN is proposed, which
    is an improved version of KNCN. Generally ELM is an influential model with more
    fast learning methods, higher performance and less training error when compared
    with other algorithms. Therefore these two classification algorithms are proposed
    in this work to improve the accuracy of the system and provide better results
    than the existing models. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the proposed
    crop yield prediction model. Initially, Pre-processing is done to remove the noise
    in data and the features are selected on the basis of features selection methods
    like CBFA and VIF. Finally, the classification uses two tier systems. In the first
    tier, the proposed aKNCN model is used to classify the soil quality based on IoT
    system collected soil nutrients. In the second tier, ELM-mBOA is utilized for
    crop yield prediction and the accuracy is improved by optimal weight selection
    using mBOA. This model improves the accuracy of the system with minimum error
    values. Fig. 1 Architecture of the proposed methodology Full size image 3.1 Pre-processing
    The data is gathered from various sources and pre-processed. Pre-processing is
    a necessary phase in ML since it can’t handle noisy data. Noisy data means it
    has errors and outliers. Before the data can be used for classification, it must
    be pre-processed to insert missing values, remove unwanted data, extract functions
    and keep the appropriate data range. In this work isnull () approach is used to
    check the null values then the label encoder() is used to convert categorical
    data (string format) into numerical data (numeric format). Since Python does not
    handle categorical data, it must be converted into numeric format. Once the data
    is converted to numeric format, it is applied for feature selection. 3.2 Feature
    selection (FS) ML is a computational learning model that works on the prediction
    of statistical value. The FS model is applied to identify necessary features,
    which are powerful in correlation with crop production. The main reason to employ
    FS is that it enables the ML algorithm to train faster, minimizes the model complexity
    and makes it easy to interpret. It also increases the system accuracy when the
    proper subset is selected and reduces overfitting. The computation time of the
    algorithm is less necessary than its classification for normal size feature sets.
    But the feature selection is necessary for large datasets. Various statistical
    approaches can be employed in FS like filter, embedded and wrapper methods. Filter
    methods choose the intrinsic characteristics of the features computed by univariate
    statistics instead of performance of cross-validation. These methods are faster
    and less computationally expensive than wrapper methods. When dealing with high-dimensional
    data, it is computationally cheaper to use filter methods. Hence, in this work
    filter based FS methods like CBFA algorithm and VIF algorithm are used. CBFA chooses
    the best feature set which is mainly correlated with yield. VIF verifies the multicollinearity
    among independent features. Therefore, it eliminates all multicollinear features.
    3.2.1 Correlation based feature selection algorithm (CBFA) CBFS orders feature
    subset based on the correlation heuristic evaluation function. This function is
    towards a subset that has features which have high correlation amongst class and
    uncorrelated with each other. The features which are not relevant must be removed
    since they have less correlation amongst class and high correlation with other
    features. Feature acceptance is based on the extent to which it identifies classes
    in areas which are already not identified by other features. The CBFS is computed
    as: $$ M = \\frac{{Nr\\overline{c}}}{{\\sqrt {N + N(N - 1)\\,r\\overline{f}} }}
    $$ (1) where \\(N\\) is the total number of features, \\(r\\overline{c}\\) is
    the average correlation, \\(r\\overline{f}\\) is average feature to pair wise
    correlation. 3.2.2 Variance inflation factor algorithm (VIF) VIF computes the
    strength of the multi colinearity in the analysis of least squares regression.
    It gives an index that computes how much the variance of an evaluated regression
    coefficient is enhanced due to colinearity. VIF model is employed for removing
    correlated independent features. This method is fast and it exploits one pass
    search to the predictor. In addition, this method is computationally efficient
    in testing every predictor to the model and it avoids the overfitting issue. It
    is achieved by regressing each independent variable, let Y on the remaining independent
    variables (W and Z) and checking how much of it (of Y) is explained by these variables.VIF
    is measured by $$ V = \\frac{1}{{1 - R^{2} }} $$ (2) From the expression it is
    shown that the higher the VIF, higher the R2 which means the variable X is collinear
    with Y and Z variables. If all the variables are completely orthogonal, R2 will
    be 0 resulting in VIF of 1. 3.3 Tier 1-classification In this work, aKNCN (Rosdi
    et al. 2021) is used to classify the soil classes from the different parameters.
    The proposed aKNCN overcomes the challenges of conventional KNCN and enhanced
    the performance of KNCN classification. KNCN is a non-parametric classifier that
    depends on the centroid distance. This states the nearest neighbours of the test
    samples should satisfy the following criteria—it should be close to test samples
    and the nearest neighbour distribution should be symmetrical in test samples.
    But it is complex to determine neighbours in a feature that satisfy these properties.
    Though KNCN achieves good accuracy it lags in classification time. Hence aKNCN
    is developed for improving the classification time by adaptively adjusting the
    nearest centroid neighbour for every input sample to enhance the classification
    accuracy. Two properties of aKNCN are given as follows: Property 1 TheaKNCN method
    satisfies a stable searching phase only when \\(j^{th}\\) distance of nearest
    centroid is more than pre-defined limit which is multiplier product of \\(k_{l}\\)
    and the first nearest centroid \\(z_{ncn,1}\\) to the test sample \\(d(y,z_{ncn,1}
    )\\). The size of neighbourhood is represented as $$ d(y,z_{i}^{s} ) > k_{1} \\times
    d(y,z_{ncn,1} ) $$ (3) where \\(d(y,z_{i}^{s} )\\) is the nearest centroid distance
    among test samples, \\(z_{i}^{s}\\) and \\(y\\). The multiplier product is higher
    or equal to 1 and the 1st centroid distance is \\(d(y,z_{ncn,1} )\\). Property
    2 The aKNCN method satisfies searching phase only when the entire sample class,
    \\(M_{i}\\), is found amongst \\(j\\) nearest neighbour and the whole samples
    per class to compete class is lesser than \\(M_{i} - 1\\). Then the property is
    defined as. $$ ( \\vee MCM_{i} (\\exists V_{wi} ) \\wedge (\\exists V_{wi}^{\\prime
    } ) $$ (4) \\(( \\vee MCM_{i} (x) = \\{ mcm_{x}^{y} |mcm_{x}^{y} \\in V\\}_{y
    = 1}^{j}\\) is \\(j\\) nearest neighbour of \\(V_{wi} = \\{ y_{y}^{i} |y_{y}^{i}
    \\in V\\}_{y = 1}^{{M_{i} }}\\) is a subset of \\(V\\) from \\(wi\\) with training
    samples, \\(M_{i}\\) and \\(V_{wi} ^{\\prime} = \\{ y_{y}^{i} |y_{y}^{i} \\in
    V\\}_{y = 1}^{{M_{i} ^{\\prime}}}\\) is a subset of \\(V^{\\prime}\\) from \\(wi\\)
    with training samples, \\(M_{i}\\). Finally, the soil quality is classified and
    the crop yield is predicted based on the classified properties for different classes.
    The yield prediction is performed using ELM, which is discussed in the next subsection.
    3.4 Tier 2-prediction In this phase, ELM is proposed to predict the crop yield
    based on the classified soil properties of different classes along with different
    parameters such as rainfall and temperature. In ELM, a new metaheuristic algorithm
    called mBOA is hybridized to tune the optimal set of ELM parameters such as thresholds
    and weights that enhance the performance accuracy with fast convergence. The optimizationmBOA
    is used to solve the convergence problems and provides robustness. ELM has learning
    speed and has a better generalization because there is no need to tune the initial
    parameters of the hidden layer. The hidden layer Feed Forward Network (FFN) is
    converted into the linear equation by minimum norm least squares. The aim of the
    ELM is to reduce the output norm weight and training error at the same time. For
    the samples \\(\\{ (Z_{i} ,T_{i} )|X_{i} \\in S^{m} ,T_{i} \\in S^{n} ,i = 1,2,
    \\ldots N\\}\\), the \\(P\\) neurons hidden layer with the output function is:
    $$ f_{P} (Z) = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{P} {\\beta_{i} r} (Z) = r(Z)\\beta $$ (5)
    where \\(\\beta = [\\beta_{1} ,\\beta_{2} \\ldots \\ldots \\beta_{P} ]\\) is the
    output weight vector between output neuron and \\(P\\). The hidden layer output
    vector to the input \\(X\\) is given by $$ r(Z) = [r_{1} (Z),r_{2} (Z) \\ldots
    \\ldots r_{P} (Z)] $$ (6) For enhancing the generalization and to reduce the training
    error of neural networks, at the same time both output weight and the training
    error must be minimized. $$ \\min :||h\\beta - T||,\\,||\\beta || $$ (7) According
    to Karush–Kuhn–Tucker, the Eq. (19) can be written as $$ \\beta = h^{T} \\left(
    {\\frac{1}{R} + hh^{T} } \\right)^{ - 1} T $$ (8) where \\(h\\) is the output
    matrix of the hidden layer, \\(R\\) is the coefficient of the reflection and \\(T\\)
    is the expected samples and the ELM algorithm output function is $$ f(Z) = g(Z)h^{T}
    \\left( {\\frac{1}{R} + hh^{T} } \\right)^{ - 1} T $$ (9) When the feature mapping
    function \\(r(Z)\\) is unknown, ELM kernel matrix on the basis of Mercer’s condition
    is given by $$ M = hh^{T,} :m_{ij} = r(Z_{i} )r(Z_{j} ) = L(Z_{i} ,Z_{j} ) $$
    (10) The output function \\(g(Z)\\) on the basis of KOELM is given by $$ f(Z)
    = L(Z,Z_{1} ) \\ldots \\ldots L(Z,Z_{n} )]\\;\\left( {\\frac{1}{R} + M} \\right)^{
    - 1} T $$ (11) where \\(L(Z,Z_{1} )\\) and \\(M = hh^{T}\\) are the hidden neurons
    kernel function of single hidden layer FFN networks. The functions like polynomial
    kernel, exponential kernel, linear kernel and Gaussian kernel will satisfy the
    Mercer condition. BOA (Arora and Singh 2019) is a nature based metaheuristic approach
    which influences the behaviour of mating and foraging of butterfly. One of the
    major properties of BOA varies from other optimization approaches that are every
    butterfly has its separate scent. The fragrance is expressed as: $$ f_{r} = sI^{b}
    $$ (12) where \\(f_{r}\\) represents the identified magnitude of fragrance, \\(s\\)
    is modality of sensor and \\(I^{b}\\) represents stimulus intensity with absorption
    of fragrance. The value of \\(s\\) ranges from \\([0,\\infty ]\\) but the value
    is identified by a particularity of the optimization issues in the BOA iterative
    procedure. The \\(s\\) in the optimal solution of the method is expressed as $$
    s_{t + 1} = s_{t} + \\left[ {\\frac{0.025}{{c_{t} .T_{\\max } }}} \\right] $$
    (13) where \\(T_{\\max }\\) is the maximum iteration and initial value of \\(s\\)
    is 0.01. Further, there are two stages in the process, global search and local
    search space. The mathematical calculation of global search is calculated as $$
    x_{j}^{t + 1} = x_{j}^{t} + (r_{i}^{2} \\times g_{b} - x_{j}^{t} )f_{r} $$ (14)
    here \\(x_{j}^{t}\\) is the solution vector \\(x_{j}^{{}}\\) of the \\(j^{th}\\)
    butterfly in iteration \\(t\\) and \\(r_{i}\\) is a random number and rages from
    [0,1]. Then \\(g_{b}\\) is the present best solution identified among every stage
    in the present stage. Then the local search space is expressed as $$ x_{j}^{t
    + 1} = x_{j}^{t} + (r_{i}^{2} \\times x_{i}^{m} - x_{j}^{t} )f_{r} $$ (15) Here
    \\(x_{i}^{m}\\) and \\(x_{j}^{t}\\) are the \\(m{\\text{th}}\\) and \\(j{\\text{th}}\\)
    butterflies selected randomly and when \\(x_{i}^{m}\\) and \\(x_{j}^{t}\\) is
    considered under same iteration, that means butterflies becomes a local random
    walk. When \\(x_{i}^{m}\\) and \\(x_{j}^{t}\\) is not considered under same iteration
    random walk may diversify the solution. Both local search and global search for
    mating and food partner via the butterflies in nature can happen. Hence a switch
    probability is considered to transform the intensive local search and normal global
    search.It is seen from Eqs. (14) and (15) that choosing random local and global
    search will affect BOA is trapped by local optima. Further the parameter \\(r_{i}\\)
    capacity for adjusting local and global is limited. Therefore some modification
    is needed. Hence the new optimal solution is obtained by the following equations.
    Therefore the new equation for global search is calculated as: $$ x_{j}^{t + 1}
    = w.\\;x_{j}^{t} + (r_{i}^{2} \\times g_{b} - x_{j}^{t} )f_{r} $$ (16) The new
    equation for local search space is expressed as: $$ x_{j}^{t + 1} = (w - 1)\\;x_{j}^{t}
    + (r_{i}^{2} \\times x_{i}^{m} - x_{j}^{t} )f_{r} $$ (17) where w is a weighting
    coefficient. Comparing with Eqs. (14) and (15), the updated Eqs. (16) and (17)
    has the features like the weighting coefficient is and it is able to adjust among
    local and global search when compared to the original BOA. The best solution is
    updated either by Eqs. (16) or Eq. (17). These two equation provides better convergence
    speed because of the weighting coefficient. Further this model has better convergence
    speed and avoid local optima. Therefore this mBOA provides better results due
    to the optimal value. The Pseudo-code modified BOA is algorithm 1. Algorithm 1:
    Pseudo-code of mBOA 4 Experimental results and discussion This section gives the
    performance analysis and discussion about the developed scheme. The entire implementation
    has been processed on a system with 8 GB RAM and Intel Core i5 CPU with 3.0 GHz
    speed. To implement the proposed scheme, PYTHON 3.8 is utilized. The dataset taken
    in this paper for the experimentation is soil dataset. The developed approach
    performance is implemented with metrics like RMSE, R2, MSE, MedAE, MAE, MSLE,
    MAPE and EVS, error measures and accuracy are utilized for the performance evaluation.
    4.1 Comparative analysis of aKNCN-ELM-mBOA and existing approaches The performance
    of proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA is compared with the state of the art techniques like
    ELM, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boost
    (GB) and random forest (RF). The simulation is performed on aKNCN -ELM-mBOA with
    these existing methods using the error metrics to determine the prediction efficiency
    of each method. Table 1 provides the analysis of error values attained by various
    approaches in terms of RMSE, MAE, MSLE, MAPE, MedAE, EVS and MSE. MSE is the mean
    of sum of the squared errors. MSLE is the squared logarithmic error’s predicted
    value. From the table, the MAE, MSE, RMSE, MSLE, MedAE and MAPE value obtained
    by the proposed aKNCN -ELM-mBOA is lower than the existing methods. While the
    R2 and EVS values attained by the proposed aKNCN -ELM-mBOA are higher than other
    strategies. Table 1 Error measures of various approaches Full size table Figure
    2 represents the accuracy measure for the proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA and the existing
    approaches. While considering the accuracy measure, the actual and the predicted
    data are nearly same then the system is said to be efficient for the crop yield
    prediction. It depicts the actual data and the predicted data of different techniques.
    From the graph, the proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA predicted the result more accurately
    than the existing methods. The proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA reached near to the actual
    data whereas the other techniques did not attain a better accuracy. AKNCN-GB achieved
    very low accuracy that other strategies. Therefore, the proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA
    is effective than the existing techniques. Fig. 2 Accuracy measure of proposed
    aKNCN -ELM-mBOA and existing methods Full size image Figure 3 illustrates the
    resultant graph of error measures for various approaches. From the graphical representation,
    the MAE of the aKNCN-ELM-mBOA is 0.064 and the MAE of the aKNCN -ELM-BOA, aKNCN
    –ELM, aKNC _ANN, aKNC-SVM, aKNC-GB and aKNC-RF are0.067, 0.097, 0.130, 0.165,
    0.231 and 0.293 respectively. Similarly the proposed model achieves the better
    value of MSLE and MedAE. In general, if the error occurred is less in the prediction
    system then it is considered as an effective model. Like this the proposed model
    achieved better achievement in all the cases. Thus the proposed method proves
    its achievement. Fig. 3 Graphical representation of various measures a MAE, MSLE
    and MedAE b RMSE, MSE and R2 c EVS and MAPE Full size image Table 2 presents the
    running time of the various approaches like aKNCN-ELM-mBOA, aKNCN -ELM-BOA, aKNCN
    –ELM, aKNC _ANN, aKNC-SVM, aKNC-GB and aKNC-RF. Comparing all the approaches,
    the running time of the proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA is found to be 58 ms. Further
    it takes only less time for completing the process. Hence it is proved that, this
    proposed methodology can be efficiently used in IoT based smart agriculture. Table

    of the proposed methodology Agriculture based on IoT with ML is the next emerging
    thing in smart agriculture and farming. In several real life applications, IoT
    is involved. In smart agriculture, using various sensors can monitor the agricultural
    activities like plant and irrigation monitoring. Comparing to traditional farming
    methods, the farming based on IoT is much productive. IoT sensor systems require
    to be simple to use to facilitate farmer to take advantage of it. Figure 4 depicts
    the applications of the proposed methodology. Fig. 4 Applications of the proposed
    methodology Full size image Some of the applications of the proposed methodology
    are listed below: Plant management: The proposed ML model with IoT offers suitable
    and controllable environment to grow crops by greenhouse technology. Livestock
    monitoring: ML with IoT is used for collecting data with respect to location and
    health of cattle. This data is further used to identify the animal’s sick. This
    monitoring minimize the labouring cost and also prevents the diseases spread to
    other animals. Crop and yield: This ML model can be apply in farm lands on the
    basis of gathered data over IoT by yield monitoring gathered using GPS. It is
    also used in production of crops. Soil monitoring: Using wireless sensor nodes,
    the soil data can be obtained, then the obtained data can be given to this proposed
    ML algorithm for predicting and analysing the properties of soil and classifying
    the soil types. Disease monitoring: Combining this ML model with IoT is used for
    identifying and managing disease in farming lands. This methodology is further
    used for selecting proper pesticide for protecting crops from infections and hence
    minimize the work of farmers. Animal monitoring: The tracking of animals on the
    farming land is essential. Many researches are carried out to track animals with
    a help of IoT based sensors. ML model with IoT can overcome this problem. Sensing
    the animal’s presence can be identified by IoT sonsors. 6 Conclusion This work
    focuses on predicting the yield of the crop based on two-tier ML approach named
    aKNCN and ELM-mBOA. In the first tier, the proposed aKNCN model is used to estimate
    the soil quality based on IoT system collected soil nutrients. In the second tier,
    the soil quality score along with other crop yield related parameters like temperature
    and rainfall are taken as the input of ELM model to predict the crop yield. The
    hyper parameter tuning of ELM prediction model is achieved by mBOA to enhance
    the prediction performance of ELM. PYTHON tool is used for the implementation
    of proposed system. Soil dataset is utilized for performance evaluation of the
    proposed prediction model. The proposed scheme attains better results than the
    other classification models on the basis of accuracy, RMSE, R2, MSE, MedAE, MAE,
    MSLE, MAPE and EVS. The RMSE and MAE of the aKNCN-ELM-mBOA is found to be 0.301
    and 0.064 respectively. Presently, the ML models overcome the problems in smart
    agriculture in numerous way, however this ML-IoT requires continuous internet
    connection and the developing countries does not have this requirement. Further,
    this model requires large amount of training data and also it is very complex
    for planning, building and managing the broad technology to IoT. In future, analysis
    based on time-series will be done to predict the future values. The use of different
    parameters like soil nutrients, soil quality, irrigated area and agricultural
    points can be used to extend the scope of the research as well as improve the
    accuracy of the system. In addition, deep learning based smart agriculture can
    be used with the IoT system in order to enhance the production quality. References

  description: The accurate prediction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from paddy

    realizing the large-scale prediction of GHG emissions from paddy fields remains
    to be a challenge. Here, we established machine learning models to predict the
    GHG emissions from Chinese paddy systems using a dataset including 782 CH4 and
    679 N2O emission observations based on 118 published studies across China. Our
    results identified XGBoost was the most suitable model with the outstanding efficiency
    and accuracy for predicting both CH4 (R2 = 0.754, RMSE = 0.485 kg ha−1) and N2O
    emissions (R2 = 0.762, RMSE = 0.423 kg ha−1) from rice fields in China. We found
    mineral and organic fertilizer rate, irrigation mode, straw returned proportion
    and tillage depth were key factors in regulating GHG emissions. Specifically,
    CH4 emissions trended to increase first and then decrease with increasing mineral
    nitrogen fertilizer rate, with the inflection point delayed under the application
    of organic fertilizer. On the other hand, N2O emissions continued to increase
    until the N fertilizer rate reached approximately 150 kg ha−1. The use of organic
    fertilizer, tillage, straw return in half and full quantity increased global warming
    potential (GWP) by 80.3 %, 33.8 %, 25.2 % and 111.6 %, respectively. Frequent
    drainage (FD) was identified as the most promising water management mode, with
    a higher potential for GHG emission mitigation of 39.5 % compared to continuous
    flooding, followed by mid-season drainage at 18.4 %. We found the combination
    of a mineral nitrogen fertilizer rate of 128 kg ha−1, FD water management, without
    straw, tillage, and organic fertilizer could achieve the most effective GHG emission
    mitigation, with a GWP of 3.13 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1. Our findings provided a
    new insight for predicting GHG emissions from rice fields on a large scale, and
    offered guidance for mitigating GHG emissions from rice production in China.

    With the acceleration of global climate change, the mitigation of greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions has emerged as a serious international environmental issue. Agriculture
    ecosystems are responsible for approximately 50 % and 60 % of the total global
    CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively (Wu et al., 2017). As the second-largest rice
    cultivation country in the world, China accounts for 19 % of global paddy production
    area (Zhang et al., 2011), while rice cropping systems are major sources of CH4
    emissions. It was estimated that 6–10 Tg CH4 and 32–51 Gg N2O-N emissions were
    produced from Chinese rice fields each year (Wu et al., 2018, Li et al., 2021).
    Therefore, rice fields have great potential for mitigating GHG emissions, underscoring
    the importance of identifying the key factors that regulate CH4 and N2O emissions
    and optimizing agricultural management practices (AMPs) in rice production to
    achieve substantial reductions in GHG emissions from paddy soil. In recent years,
    many studies have focused on the impact of fertilization, straw, irrigation mode
    and other field management practices on GHG emissions from paddy soil and have
    made recommendations for future rice cultivation. For example, since the application
    of nitrogen fertilizer significantly stimulates both CH4 and N2O emissions, some
    have proposed the optimal nitrogen fertilizer application rate at 225 kg N ha−1
    to achieve the balance of yield and GHG emissions (Zhong et al., 2016). In addition,
    some water-saving irrigation modes, such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD),
    intermittent flooding (IF), and mid-season drainage (MD, i.e., flooding-drainage-reflooding),
    have been advocated to reduce CH4 emissions and water consumption in paddy fields
    (Islam et al., 2020, Liao et al., 2020). However, the decision-making for the
    optimal management practices in different paddy fields remains to be a challenge,
    since the results of case studies are not necessarily suitable for other paddy
    fields considering the differences in soil and climate, and their conduction were
    time-consuming and labor-intensive (Liang et al., 2022). In order to predict the
    agricultural GHG emissions more effectively, some process-based agricultural ecosystem
    models, such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model2 (RZWQM2) and Denitrification-Decomposition
    model (DNDC) were developed to simulate crop cultivation, trace GHG emissions,
    and evaluate the effect of various AMPs on GHG emissions (Fumoto et al., 2008,
    Chun et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2020). However, the utilization of these models
    requires professional knowledge and sufficient experience in the crop growth process
    and agro-environment for users, as the calibration and validation of these models
    are very complex (Hamrani et al., 2020). Furthermore, these models have limited
    generalization, as they are only applicable to the specified sites or regions,
    making their application at a large scale is challenging (Cao et al., 2021). To
    overcome these limitations, new robust methods are necessary to predict GHG emissions
    accurately and enable their migration applications to the large-scale scenarios
    with differences in climate, soil, and AMPs. Numerous previous studies have demonstrated
    that machine learning (ML) algorithm have a strong capacity to capture complex
    nonlinear associations between input parameters and target variables without explicitly
    programming functional relations, which makes it a great alternative to agro-ecosystem
    models (Cao et al., 2021, Alabdrabalnabi et al., 2022). Recently, some classical
    ML algorithms have been employed to study agricultural GHG emissions. For example,
    Maier et al. (2022) adopted the random forest (RF) model to gap-fill N2O and CH4
    fluxes and identified the most important drivers for GHG emissions in maize and
    pea cropping systems. Jiang et al. (2023) compared the performance of three ML
    models, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), RF, gradient boosting regression (GBR) and their
    stacking ensemble model for predicting GHG emissions from paddy fields. With advancement
    of ML, neural network models (NNM), an important class of ML algorithms, have
    garnered extensive attention due to the strong self-learning ability (Pu et al.,
    2019). Hamrani et al. (2020) employed several classical ML models and NNM to predict
    GHG emissions from agricultural soils, such as RF, long short-term memory network
    (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN). However, these studies on the
    application of ML models to predict agriculture GHG emissions were mainly aimed
    at one-site field, and the factors involved were less comprehensive, which limited
    their generalization to the large scale. Being data-driven approach, the quality
    and quantity of data are critical for ML models, and the accuracy and generalization
    ability of these models would be influenced by the size of the dataset (Faber
    et al., 2016, Zhang and Ling, 2018, Gebru et al., 2021). Therefore, the availability
    of a comprehensive dataset is vital for the development of ML models in realizing
    the large-scale prediction of GHG emissions from paddy fields. To address these
    challenges, we proposed a novel approach to predict GHG emissions from paddy fields
    using robust ML models trained on an unprecedentedly comprehensive dataset. The
    trained models would enable the identification of the critical factors that impact
    CH4 and N2O emissions and exploration of the interactions among these factors.
    The objectives of this study were to: (a) construct a large-scale dataset that
    incorporates as many factors as possible related to GHG emissions from paddy fields;
    (b) compare the performance of different types of ML models, including classical
    ML and neural network models, to identify the best model for predicting CH4 and
    N2O emissions; (c) investigate how CH4 and N2O emissions were affected by various
    agricultural managements; and (d) provide guidelines for future rice production
    to mitigate GHG emissions. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data collection The dataset
    of GHG emissions from rice fields in China was generated from peer-reviewed journal
    articles, identified through keyword searches of the Web of Science and the China
    Knowledge Resource Integrated Database. The search term used were “China and rice
    and N2O” and “China and rice and CH4”. To ensure the reliability and relevance
    of the data, the following criteria were applied: (1) the experiments must have
    been conducted under field conditions, (2) the cropping system must be either
    single or double rice-cropping system, (3) CH4 or N2O cumulative emissions during
    the growing season should be available either directly or through calculation,
    (4) the time and location of the field experiment must be clearly specified. Based
    on these criteria, 874 observations from 118 studies published before June 2022
    were included in the dataset, coving 19 provinces in China. The distribution of
    experimental sites is depicted in Fig. 1, with double rice experimental sites
    concentrated in the South and single rice cropping sites mainly found in the East,
    Central and Northeast, consistent with the distribution of China’s rice cropping
    regions (Chen et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (495KB) Download

    version 4.06 from https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.06/cruts.2205201912.v4.06/tmp/.
    To improve the accuracy of GHG emissions predictions, we collected comprehensive
    information on various factors that may influence emissions for each selected
    publication, including meteorology, soil properties, rice type, the type of cropping
    system, the duration of rice growth period, planting pattern and AMPs (e.g., tillage
    mode; fertilization management; irrigation mode; residue management). Climate
    data for each site was obtained from the nearest weather station, including the
    annual average atmospheric pressure (PRS), air temperature (TEM), 0 cm ground
    temperature (GST), relative humidity (RHU), window speed (WIN), sunshine duration
    (SSD) and accumulative precipitation (PRE), available from the National Meteorological
    Information Center (http://data.cma.cn/). As detailed soil characteristics were
    not available for all paddy fields, we utilized the Harmonized World Soil Database
    v1.2 (HWSD) to fill in the gaps. This global soil dataset has a resolution of
    1 km and includes information on soil texture, pH, soil organic matter (SOM) content,
    and total nitrogen (TN). In order to select the key features in the dataset (Li
    et al., 2022), enhance the visibility, and improve the interpretability of results,
    we classified the dataset according to the feature types for the convenience of
    the following analysis. Specifically, rice variety was classified into two groups:
    indica (n = 483 in CH4 and 411 in N2O) and japonica rice (n = 144 in CH4 and 112
    in N2O). The type of cropping system was divided into single (n = 264 in CH4 and
    253 in N2O) and double rice (n = 532 in CH4 and 441 in N2O). Planting pattern
    was classified as transplanting (n = 758 in CH4 and 648 in N2O) and direct seeding
    (n = 34 in CH4 and 32 in N2O). Fertilization frequency was divided into low (times
    2, n = 296 in CH4 and 268 in N2O) and high frequency (times 3, n = 469 in CH4
    and 411 in N2O). Rice growth period was classified as short (days 100, n = 481
    in CH4 and 406 in N2O) and long period (days 100, n = 316 in CH4 and 289 in N2O).
    Nitrogen fertilizer application rate was grouped as low (rate 100 kg N ha−1, n
    = 32 in CH4 and 27 in N2O), medium (100 kg N ha−1 rate 180 kg N ha−1, n = 114
    in CH4 and 125 in N2O) and high level (rate 180 kg N ha−1, n = 67 in CH4 and 59
    in N2O). Tillage mode was classified as no-tillage (n = 52 in CH4 and 50 in N2O)
    and tillage (n = 419 in CH4 and 364 in N2O), while nitrogen fertilizer type was
    divided into only inorganic (n = 599 in CH4 and 579 in N2O) or complemented with
    organic fertilizer (n = 79 in CH4 and 65 in N2O). Residue management was classified
    as straw removal (n = 186 in CH4 and 174 in N2O) and returning (n = 111 in CH4
    and 92 in N2O), and irrigation mode was grouped into continuous flooding (CF,
    n = 124 in CH4 and 120 in N2O), MD (n = 239 in CH4 and 182 in N2O), AWD or IF
    (n = 57 in CH4 and 63 in N2O) and flooding-drainage-intermittent flooding (MD
    + IF, n = 296 in CH4 and 253 in N2O). 2.2. Data analysis We used the natural log
    of the response ratio ( ) to quantify the impact of different AMPs on GHG emissions
    (Hedges et al., 1999): (1) where and are the mean GHG emissions of each observation
    under the treatment and control, respectively. In the analysis of the effect of
    agronomic practices, without distinguishing the tillage depth and residue proportion,
    the experiments with either tillage or residue returning were considered as treatments,
    while no-tillage or residue removal were considered as controls. In irrigation
    modes, we regarded CF as the control group, while other modes such as MD, AWD
    or IF, MD + IF were considered as the treatment groups. Regarding the N fertilizer
    type, experiments in which the applied N was sorely from inorganic fertilizer
    were considered as controls, while those containing organic fertilizer were considered
    as treatments. Specifically, the total applied N in the treatment group was equal
    to the control group to reflect the effect of N fertilizer type. In terms of the
    N fertilizer application rate, the N fertilizer application rate of zero was considered
    as the control group. The weighting factor (w) of each effect size measured as
    the inverse of the sampling variance (v) was calculated as follows: (2) where
    and are the number of replications of the treatment and control; and are the standard
    deviation under the treatment and control, respectively. To present the results
    more clearly, the weighted effect size was transformed into percentage of change,
    which was calculated and plotted in the R studio (Yang et al., 2022). And the
    effect of the factor corresponding to the treatment was assessed by the 95 % confidence
    interval (CI). If the 95 % CI did not overlap zero, the effect was considered
    significant. (3) However, due to data limitations, certain parameters can only
    be compared to a certain extent. To analyze the data for CH4 and N2O emissions
    in different climates, soil properties, rice varieties, cropping systems, planting
    patterns, fertilization frequency and rice growth periods, boxplot distributions
    were constructed. This approach allows for the calculation of the range and central
    tendencies of the data distribution by determining the minimum, median and interquartile
    range (IQR, the difference between the 25th and 75th interval). Moreover, the
    IQR value reflects the impact of relevant factors on gas emissions to some extent,
    as a smaller IQR means a greater effect (Prananto et al., 2020). Additionally,
    a t test was conducted to further determine the difference between the treatment
    and control groups, with significance set at p 0.05. 2.3. Machine learning models
    With the purpose of identifying the most accurate models for predicting CH4 and
    N2O emissions, various ML algorithms were employed, which can be categorized into
    two types, classical ML models (CM) and NNM. Specifically, CM included support
    vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost),
    while NNM included backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and one-dimension convolutional
    neural network (1D-CNN). These five models have a good coverage on commonly used
    ML regression models, among these, SVR is a classical supervised learning technique
    that can fit complex non-linear relationships in a shorter amount of time and
    computation space compared to other models (Qadri et al., 2020). RF is an ensemble
    of uncorrelated forests of trees that can maintain good performance when handling
    the large datasets with numerous predictors (Speiser et al., 2019, Srivastava
    et al., 2021). Based on the gradient descent and boosting architecture, XGBoost
    can achieve superior performance by continually updating the prediction model
    during training. Furthermore, the addition of an overfitting regulation function
    effectively reduces the risk of overfitting in the XGBoost model (Kim et al.,
    2021, Yoo et al., 2023). As ensemble decision tree (DT) algorithm, RF and XGBoost
    model can quantify and sequence the feature importance (Ma et al., 2018), which
    is crucial for our research purposes. Unlike CM, NNM (BPNN and 1D-CNN) based on
    layer structures have a strong ability to learn and store complex mapping relations
    of input–output. This is because the weights and thresholds in the network are
    constantly updated to produce predictive results that are sufficiently close to
    the true values (Hu et al., 2019, Pu et al., 2019). 2.3.1. Data preprocessing
    In this study, a total of 782 CH4 and 679 N2O emission observations were used
    for modeling. For the samples with missing AMPs information, we filled in the
    missing values according to local traditional practices (Xu et al., 2010, Zhang
    et al., 2011, Paudel et al., 2022). Additionally, some parameters, such as irrigation
    mode, rice variety, the type of cropping systems, were classified-type and non-numeric,
    so one-hot encoding was used to convert them into a format that the computer can
    recognize. This encoding can also eliminate the influence of difference in digitized
    value on model performance (Yu et al., 2020). The irrigation mode was divided
    into three categories according to drainage frequency, including CF, MD and frequent
    drainage (FD). Specifically, FD included AWD, IF, and MD + IF. Besides, the final
    drainage before harvest was not considered. For dataset, those redundant features
    with no significant effect on GHG emissions can be eliminated based on the statistical
    analysis results. This approach aimed to enhance model learning efficiency and
    simplify learning outcomes, as demonstrated by Cai et al. (2018). To avoid overfitting
    and enhance model reliability, the dataset was randomly spilt into training set
    and testing set in the ratio of 7:3 (Zheng et al., 2021). 2.3.2. Model execution
    and hyperparameters determination Hyperparameters tuning is an essential part
    of modeling, as it directly affects the performance of the model (Yang and Shami,
    2020). However, each algorithm has its own specific hyperparameters, and the optimization
    process is different among them (Hamrani et al., 2020). To select the best-performing
    hyperparameter combinations, grid search was applied in CM and random search was
    applied in NNM, as their hyperparameter configuration spaces differ. The initialized
    searching space was set manually based on commonly used parameters in previous
    literatures (Hamrani et al., 2020, Che et al., 2022). Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation
    was utilized in tuning process to ensure the optimum hyperparameters were tested
    on the entirety of the training set, making the model’s generalization more reliable
    (Phillip et al., 2022). To prevent overfitting, the early-stopping strategy was
    integrated into the NNM training process to halt training when performance started
    to become non-improving or erratic (Nevavuori et al., 2019, Vilares Ferro et al.,
    2022). 2.3.3. Model evaluation To compare the performances for predicting GHG
    emissions among different models, the accuracy of each model was qualified by
    five commonly used regression evaluation indices, namely coefficient of determination
    (R2), adjust R2 ( ), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE),
    which were computed by the following formulas (Eq (4)-Eq (7)): (4) (5) (6) (7)
    where and denote the value of gas observation and prediction respectively, n indicates
    the number of observations in testing set, k is the number of factors as model
    input and is the mean of . was used as the score to determine the optimal hyperparameters
    combination in cross validation. Compared with , takes the number of input features
    into account, making up the deficiency of . Moreover, the discrepancy between
    and indicates whether some trivial features were contained in the model, leading
    to a more objective evaluation of the model''s fitting performance (Lashari et
    al., 2021). 2.4. Recommendation for mitigation emission strategies To aid in the
    development of mitigation emission strategies for paddy systems, several scenarios
    were created to investigate the effect of input feature variation on the prediction
    results of CH4 and N2O emissions. Based on actual practices in rice fields, five
    controllable input features were selected, including mineral fertilizer rate,
    organic fertilizer rate, straw returned proportion, irrigation mode, and tillage
    depth. Specifically, mineral fertilizer rate varied from 0 to 250 kg N ha−1, which
    covered 95 % of the variation range of mineral fertilizer rate in the dataset.
    For other features, different levels were selected based on the mean of the dataset
    or common field management practices, such as organic fertilizer rate (0 and 60
    kg ha−1), straw returned proportion (0, 0.5 and 1), tillage depth (0 and 20 cm),
    and irrigation mode (CF, MD and FD). Using the selected best model (with the highest
    ), the average prediction of CH4 or N2O emissions across the dataset was recorded
    for each management practice combination. To comprehensively evaluate the greenhouse
    effect introduced by the GHG emissions, the global warming potential (GWP) was
    calculated, following guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
    (IPCC, 2021). (8) 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Model input features selection
    3.1.1. Meteorological factors To identify meteorological factors that significantly
    affect GHG emissions, the statistical distributions of CH4 and N2O emissions were
    plotted in Fig. 2a, b for seven meteorological factors. The results indicated
    that atmospheric pressure was a key factor regulating CH4 emission. The 25th percentile,
    median and 75th percentile of CH4 emissions under low pressure (L_PRS) were significantly
    (p 0.0001) greater that those under high pressure (H_PRS), indicating that rising
    atmospheric pressure could suppress CH4 emissions, while falling pressure could
    promote its emissions, due to the effect of barometric pumping phenomenon (Xu
    et al., 2014). However, there was no significant difference in PRS (p = 0.6341)
    for N2O emissions. In addition, the temperature of the rice field also strongly
    affected the emission of these two GHG, especially N2O, which is mainly due to
    the harsh requirements of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria on temperature
    when carrying out related activities (Castaldi, 2000). Download : Download high-res

    of CH4 and N2O emissions from different meteorological conditions (a)-(b), soil
    conditions (c)-(d), growth period durations, rice types and planting patterns
    (e)-(f). Air humidity and precipitation can directly affect soil moisture, which
    is closely related to GHG emissions (Liao et al., 2020). The results showed N2O
    emissions under low precipitation (L_PRE) were significantly (p = 0.0109) stimulated
    due to increased soil aeration and nitrification (Hou et al., 2012). However,
    the median and 75th percentile of CH4 emissions under high relative humidity (H_RHU)
    and high precipitation (H_PRE) were lower than those under low relative humidity
    (L_RHU) and low precipitation (L_PRE), respectively. This contradicts the findings
    from some studies that high soil moisture contributes to create an anaerobic condition
    for the CH4 production from methanogenic bacteria (Zhang et al., 2012, Liao et
    al., 2020). The reasons for this phenomenon may come from two aspects. Firstly,
    the rice fields are often inundated, and the impact of precipitation and humidity
    on the soil is weakened. Secondly, the region with low precipitation and humidity
    has a greater probability of planting single-cropping rice, which emits higher
    CH4 than early or late rice (Fig. 2e). Moreover, wind speed and solar radiation
    were also important factors affecting water temperature in rice fields, and thus
    influencing GHG emissions (Kuwagata et al., 2008). Significant differences were
    observed in N2O emissions under different levels of SSD (p 0.0001) and WIN (p
    = 0.0355), while only under different WIN (p = 0.0164) for CH4 emissions, indicating
    that field conditions with greater solar radiation and wind speed would increase
    GHG emissions. 3.1.2. Soil properties In addition to soil temperature and water
    content, soil texture also plays a crucial role in regulating CH4 and N2O fluxes
    by controlling their diffusive transport in the soil (Kolb, 2009). As expected,
    significant differences were observed in silt (p = 0.0019) and clay (p < 0.0001)
    content for CH4 emissions (Fig. 2c), and in clay content (p = 0.0001) for N2O
    emissions (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, the results showed that CH4 emissions from acid
    soil were significantly (p = 0.0005) lower than those from alkaline soil. This
    could be due to the fact that neutral or slightly alkaline conditions can promote
    the activity of methanogens (Le Mer and Roger, 2001). Similar results were observed
    in N2O emissions. Moreover, the SOM (p 0.0001) and TN (p = 0.0238) content of
    soil also had significant effects on CH4 emissions, as SOM and TN provide substrates
    and nutrition for methanogens (Humphreys et al., 2019). Note: H_PRS and L_PRS
    indicated high ( 100 KPa) and low ( 100 KPa) pressure. H_TEM and L_TEM indicated
    high ( 17 °C) and low ( 17 °C) temperature. H_GST and L_GST indicated high ( 19
    °C) and low ( 19 °C) 0 cm ground temperature. H_RHU and L_RHU indicated high (
    75 %) and low ( 75 %) relative humidity. H_WIN and L_WIN indicated high ( 2 m
    s−1) and low ( 2 m s−1) wind speed. H_SSD and L_SSD indicated high ( 5 h) and
    low ( 5 h) sunshine duration. H_PRE and L_PRE indicated high ( 136 cm) and low
    ( 136 cm) precipitation. H_Silt and L_Silt indicated high ( 41 %) and low ( 41
    %) soil silt content. H_Clay and L_Clay indicated high ( 21 %) and low ( 21 %)
    soil clay content. H_SOM and L_SOM indicated high ( 31 g kg−1) and low ( 31 g
    kg−1) soil organic matter. H_TN and L_TN indicated high ( 2 g kg−1) and low (
    2 g kg−1) total nitrogen. H_PH and L_PH indicated high ( 7) and low ( 7) pH. 3.1.3.
    Agricultural management practices (AMPs) To investigate the impact of various
    AMPs on GHG emissions, we generated the statistical distributions of CH4 and N2O
    emissions under different AMPs in the form of boxplots (Fig. 2e–f) and orchard
    plot (Nakagawa et al., 2021) (Fig. 3). The results indicated that the cropping
    system type had a significant effect on CH4 emissions (p = 0.0014). Furthermore,
    planting pattern (p 0.0001), rice growth period (p 0.0001), and cropping system
    type (p 0.0001) significantly affected N2O emissions. Download : Download high-res
    image (286KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Effects of different
    agricultural management practices on CH4 and N2O emissions. The orchard plots
    showed mean estimate, confidence interval (bold line), prediction interval (fine
    line), individual effect sizes and their precision (inverse variance). As depicted
    in Fig. 3a, tillage, straw return, and organic fertilizer application increased
    CH4 emissions by 21.4 %, 76.1 % and 51.6 %, respectively, compared to no tillage,
    no straw, and no organic fertilizer. These practices improved soil fertility and
    provided dissolved organic C for microbial methanogens, thus prompting CH4 production
    (Feng et al., 2013). However, straw return and organic fertilizer significantly
    reduced N2O emissions by 33.7 % and 71.5 %, respectively, as the addition of organic
    fertilizer can inhibit the activity of denitrifying enzymes and reduce the nitrification
    potential, and thereafter mitigating N2O emissions (Zhang et al., 2022). Nevertheless,
    the effect of straw return on N2O emissions is still a subject of debate, as some
    studies have found that straw incorporation stimulated N2O emissions (Kim et al.,
    2014, Wang et al., 2016). This discrepancy among studies may be due to differences
    in residue retention mode, residue type, and soil properties, which require further
    investigation (Aulakh et al., 1991, Xia et al., 2014). In addition, the application
    of mineral N fertilizer significantly increased CH4 and N2O emissions, which were
    related to the level of N fertilizer (p 0.0001 for CH4; p = 0.0083 for N2O). At
    low and medium N application rates, CH4 emissions were increased by 14.1 % and
    18.0 % respectively, while the positive effect of high N fertilizer (14.9 %) on
    CH4 emissions was similar to that of the low N fertilizer level. Consequently,
    the increasing trend of CH4 emissions was not sustained continuously with increasing
    N fertilizer. Similarly, Yao et al. (2012) conducted a 3-year field study and
    found that methanotrophic bacteria had a higher nitrogen requirement than methanogens,
    implying that excessive nitrogen input could stimulate methane oxidation and reduce
    CH4 emissions. This pattern has also been observed in numerous previous studies
    (Kim et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2022). However, for N2O, the positive effect of
    N fertilizer was enhanced with increasing N fertilizer application rate, which
    was 40.9 %, 109.2 %, 113.5 % in low, medium and high N fertilizer level, respectively.
    Therefore, determining the optimal mineral N fertilizer rate is critical to minimize
    GWP of rice systems. In comparison to CF, drainage practices exhibited a significant
    reduction in CH4 emissions and an increase in N2O emissions. Among the irrigation
    modes investigated, both MD + IF (−59.9 %) and AWD or IF mode (−67 %) had a stronger
    mitigation effect on CH4 emissions compared to only conducting MD. These findings
    suggested a decreasing trend in CH4 emissions with increasing drainage frequency.
    The adoption of AWD and IF implies frequent drying-wetting alternations during
    the growing period, which affects soil carbon recycling processes (Zhang et al.,
    2012, Liao et al., 2020). These results were consistent with the meta-analysis
    by Wu et al. (2022), which found that frequent drainage disrupted the anaerobic
    environment necessary for CH4 production by methanogens. However, drainage-induced
    changes in soil moisture and redox potential can stimulate N2O emissions (Zhou
    et al., 2020). Due to data limitations, only MD + IF mode and AWD or IF mode were
    investigated for N2O emissions, and no significant difference (p = 0.2032) was
    observed between the two drainage modes. Based on the statistical analysis of
    all factors, we created four versions of the dataset. The first two, and were
    based on 20 and 18 selected features, respectively, for CH4 and N2O emissions
    prediction. The remaining two, and , were constructed using 28 original features
    for CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively. The specific features included in each
    dataset are shown in Table S1. 3.2. Prediction performance of ML models To investigate
    whether selected features can be used to predict CH4 and N2O emissions more accurately,
    four versions of dataset, , , , , were involved in each model training and testing
    respectively. 3.2.1. CH4 emissions Based on the trained models and testing set,
    the performance indices were calculated and presented in Table 1. Comprehensively
    considering the four performance indicators (R2, , MAE, and RMSE), for as dataset,
    XGBoost showed higher accuracy in predicting CH4 emissions among these five models,
    with R2 = 0.754 and  = 0.720, and lower MAE and RMSE than other models. When was
    used as the dataset, RF performed best with R2 = 0.749 and  = 0.719, although
    its MAE (0.334 kg ha−1) was slightly worse than that of XGBoost (0.304 kg ha−1).
    Notably, for almost all models, the R2 values based on dataset were greater than
    those based on . This was related to the definition of R2, which could not decrease
    even if some irrelevant variables were added to the model (Heinzl and Mittlböck,
    2002). Therefore, the indicator was introduced to solve the problem. However,
    a similar pattern was observed that based on was also greater than that based
    on , indicating that the removed features had little impact on CH4 emissions without
    statistical significance. Specially for RF, the indicator of dataset (0.719) exceeded
    that based on dataset (0.704), confirming that RF possesses the strong ability
    to extract characteristics by its ensemble property, even with less features (Zheng
    et al., 2021). Table 1. The performance of five ML models in CH4 emissions prediction.

    between 0 and 400 kg CH4 ha−1 were found around the diagonal, while few points
    with measured values exceeding 1000 kg CH4 ha−1 deviated from the diagonal. This
    deviation may be attributed to the fact that most of the CH4 emissions observed
    in the dataset fall within the range of 0 to 400 kg CH4 ha−1, accounting for 84.1
    %. Therefore, the models performed poorly when predicting those outliers, highlighting
    the weakness of ML models in handling outliers. It is noteworthy that the linear
    fit in the XGBoost model was remarkably closer to the diagonal than that in other
    models, indicating that XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in addressing
    complex nonlinear problems. Download : Download high-res image (523KB) Download

    emissions measured by XGBoost model (f). The line and shaded areas represent the
    linear fit with the 95 % confidence interval. Generally, the best model for CH4
    emissions prediction is -based XGBoost. However, considering that it is difficult
    to obtain such a comprehensive dataset as under most conditions, the performance
    of -based RF is also acceptable, which led to similar results with the best model
    by fewer features. 3.2.2. N2O emissions Based on the results presented in Table
    2, it can be observed that XGBoost outperformed other ML models in the prediction
    of N2O emissions for dataset, with an R2 value of 0.762 and an value of 0.722.
    On the other hand, for dataset, RF achieved more accurate predictive results with
    R2 = 0.746 and  = 0.719. However, SVR performed poorly in both (R2 = 0.694 and  =
    0.645) and (R2 = 0.686 and  = 0.655) datasets, mainly due to its over sensitivity
    to the regularization of model parameters (Shataee et al., 2012). It is worth
    noting that most models showed better performance based on dataset for N2O emissions.
    In the case of NNM, the performance of CNN and BPNN based on were significantly
    poorer than those based on , since information extraction from input features
    is an essential part for NNM, which was determined by its layer structure (Pu
    et al., 2019, Shahhosseini et al., 2021). Therefore, reducing the number of input
    parameters could significantly limit the performance of NNM. As shown in Fig.
    5a and c, the predicted N2O emissions were often underestimated in SVR and BPNN
    when the measured values exceeded 3 kg ha−1, and thus these points deviated from
    the diagonal. However, the performance of simulating outliers was greatly improved
    in XGBoost model, and the linear fit from dataset and were both closer to the
    diagonal (Fig. 5e). Regardless of the dataset type, XGBoost based on was selected
    as the best model to predict N2O emissions from paddy fields due to its excellent
    accuracy and explainability. Considering the data limitation, the -based RF is
    also a satisfying alternative, slightly inferior to the best model. Table 2. The

    From a perspective of prediction accuracy, the results of this study suggested
    that DT models, specially XGBoost, could effectively predict GHG emissions from
    rice fields. Moreover, DT models exhibited significant advantages over NNM models,
    which is in line with many previous studies (Sanderson et al., 2020, Ahn et al.,
    2021). The transparent structure and timeliness of DT model are recognized as
    key advantages over NNM, as it does not require the optimization of network geometry
    and related parameters (Gharaei-Manesh et al., 2016). More importantly, XGBoost
    has been shown to be scalable and effective for prediction with tabular data,
    as demonstrated by its superiority in various scenarios (Chen and Guestrin, 2016,
    Kawano et al., 2022). However, the unsatisfactory performance of NNM could be
    attributed to the insufficient amount of dataset, since NNM is known for its strong
    fitting ability when processing massive high-dimensional data (Pu et al., 2019).
    In terms of computation time, a similar trend was observed in predicting CH4 and
    N2O emissions. The computational time cost of NNM is the largest, followed by
    DT (RF and XGBoost), while SVR was the most computationally efficient model, due
    to its simpler model structure. Compared to RF, the time and memory consumption
    were reduced largely in XGBoost model by its paralleling and distributed computation
    method (Chen and Guestrin, 2016, Pu et al., 2019). Accordingly, XGBoost was found
    to be particularly suitable for predicting CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields,
    due to its high efficiency and precision. 3.3. Feature importance analysis To
    identify the key factors influencing CH4 and N2O emissions from rice fields, we
    qualified and ranked the importance of each input feature using the XGBoost model
    (Fig. 4f, Fig. 5f). Our findings provide insights into all common factors associated
    with GHG emissions from rice fields that have not been investigated in previous
    studies. Our results revealed that irrigation mode was the most highly important
    factor for CH4 emissions, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that
    drainage can efficiently suppress CH4 emissions by elevating soil redox potential
    and reducing water filled pore space (Wu et al., 2022). Additionally, planting
    pattern was identified as the most important driver for N2O emissions, possibly
    due to direct-seeding promoting N2O emissions by reducing water input compared
    to transplanting, as N2O emissions are closely tied to soil water status (Liu
    et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2022). However, the effect of planting pattern may be
    overstated due to data imbalance, with direct-seeding accounting for only a small
    fraction of the dataset in (3.8 %) and (4.1 %), hence not included in the investigation
    of mitigation strategies. Surprisingly, organic fertilizer was not ranked as a
    top factor for both CH4 and N2O emissions. Reviewing the dataset, we found that
    non-zero organic fertilizer only accounted for about 10 % in both and . Moreover,
    as a continuous variable, the distribution of non-zero organic fertilizer rate
    was sporadic, leading to inadequate training in the XGBoost model. Mineral nitrogen
    rate, tillage depth and straw returned proportion also played a critical role
    in regulating GHG emissions, consistent with the feature selection process. However,
    the general effects of these AMPs on GWP of paddy fields are complex and still
    unclear, underscoring the necessity to analyze the interactions of AMPs to develop
    mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions and minimize GWP of rice production
    systems. 3.4. Mitigation strategies for greenhouse gas emissions To explore effective
    mitigation strategies for reducing emissions from rice systems, the response of
    our best model to different combinations of fertilization, irrigation mode, straw
    management, and tillage mode was presented in Fig. 6. Our results indicated that
    with the increasing rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizer, the predicted CH4 emissions
    showed a trend an initial increase followed by a decrease, and the inflection
    point was delayed under the addition of organic fertilizer. This delay is due
    to the stimulation of CH4 emissions resulting from the provision of C substrates
    for the growth of methanogenic bacteria, as reported by previous studies (Feng
    et al., 2013). Furthermore, organic fertilizer has been shown to have a greater
    stimulatory effect on CH4 emissions compared to mineral fertilizer, mainly due
    to the differences in the readily decomposable carbon (Yu et al., 2003, Zhang
    et al., 2020). Nevertheless, N2O emissions continued to increase until the rate
    of N fertilizer reached approximately 150 kg ha−1. Due to data limitations, our
    model was less sensitive to variation of organic fertilizer, particularly in terms
    of N2O emissions, resulting in some lines that appear to coincide in Fig. 6b,
    6e and 6 h. Download : Download high-res image (702KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. The effects of different agricultural management practices on CH4
    emissions, N2O emissions and global warming potential were predicted by the XGBoost
    model. The water management of graph (a-c), (d-f), and (g-i) are continuous flooding,
    mid-season drainage, and frequent drainage, respectively. Y0, Y1, R0, R1, R2,
    T0, T1 represent non-organic fertilizer, the organic fertilizer of 60 kg N ha−1,
    straw removal, straw returned in half quantity, straw returned in full quantity,
    no-tillage and conventional tillage (20 cm), respectively. Under the conditions
    of CF, MD and FD, the return of half quantity of straw resulted in increase in
    CH4 emissions by 16.5 %, 24.0 % and 45.2 %, respectively, while the return of
    full quantity of straw increased CH4 emissions by 81.2 %, 135.7 % and 147.3 %,
    respectively. These results confirmed that the increase in the quantity of straw
    would enhance its stimulatory effect on CH4 emissions, in accordance with previous
    findings of Shen et al., 2014, Naser et al., 2007. Moreover, it is worth noting
    that the effect of straw under MD or FD was more pronounced than CF, mainly due
    to the water-saving irrigation under MD or FD, which created more aerobic conditions
    that facilitated the oxygen-consuming decomposition of straw (Zeng et al., 2022).
    Besides, no-tillage reduced CH4 emissions from the rice fields under CF, MD and
    FD by 19.4 %, 26.9 % and 33.0 %, respectively, and its mitigation effect remained
    significant under straw addition. For N2O emissions, under the conditions of CF,
    MD and FD, the return of straw in half quantity reduced N2O emissions by 20.0
    %, 16.7 % and 17.2 %, respectively, while the return of straw in full quantity
    reduced N2O emissions by 19.8 %, 16.5 % and 17.0 %. Unlike CH4 emissions, the
    quantity of straw had no significant impact on its mitigation effect on N2O emissions,
    suggesting that CH4 emissions are more sensitive to the application of straw.
    Additionally, no-tillage increased N2O emissions by 8.6 %, 6.9 % and 5.6 % under
    CF, MD and FD, respectively, due to the lower O2 concentration in the no-tillage
    soil that stimulated N2O production from denitrification (Mei et al., 2018). Compared
    to CF, the two water-saving modes, MD and FD, reduced CH4 emissions by 20.0 %
    and 21.8 %, respectively, but increased N2O emissions by 42.9 % and 44.9 %. Overall,
    our results indicated an apparent trade-off relation between CH4 and N2O emissions,
    and the predicted trends of both CH4 and N2O emissions with variations in field
    management practices were consistent with most previous studies based on field
    experiments or agroecosystem models. Therefore, we conclude that the predictions
    of our best model were reasonable and comparable to agroecosystem models based
    on associated biogeochemical processes (Zhao et al., 2020). In terms of GWP (Fig.
    6c, f, and i), FD was found to be the best irrigation mode for rice field, with
    a high mitigation potential of 39.5 % compared to CF, followed by MD at 18.4 %.
    This was mainly due to the frequent aerobic conditions in FD soil, which effectively
    inhibited CH4 emissions, thereby offsetting the stimulation effect produced by
    increased N2O emissions (Liao et al., 2020). Conversely, the application of organic
    fertilizer, tillage, half and full straw returning increased GWP by an average
    of 80.3 %, 33.8 %, 25.2 % and 111.6 %, respectively, under different mineral nitrogen
    levels and irrigation modes. Generally, the scenario “Y0R0T0″ with a mineral N
    rate of 128 kg ha−1 and FD water regime had the most potential for mitigation,
    with a GWP of 3.13 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1. It is noteworthy that the variation
    trend of GWP under each scenario was similar to that of CH4 emissions, as N2O
    emissions were several orders of magnitude lower than CH4 in rice fields. Therefore,
    mitigating CH4 emissions could be more effective in reducing the GWP of total
    GHG emissions in paddy fields. 4. Conclusions In this study, we presented a comprehensive
    dataset on CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields across China, including soil,
    meteorology, cropping system type, and field management details. We compared the
    performance of different machine learning (ML) algorithms and found that XGBoost
    outperforms other algorithms in predicting CH4 (R2 = 0.754, RMSE = 0.485 kg ha−1)
    and N2O emissions (R2 = 0.762, RMSE = 0.423 kg ha−1) from rice fields in China,
    with highest efficiency and accuracy. Although some input factors had negligible
    impact on GHG emissions, the results indicated the model trained on the original
    dataset, and , produced better results for most algorithms. However, due to data
    limitations, the performance of -based RF (R2 = 0.749, RMSE = 0.490 kg ha−1) and
    -based RF (R2 = 0.746, RMSE = 0.438 kg ha−1) was also satisfactory. Based on the
    best model XGBoost, mineral and organic fertilizer rate, irrigation mode, straw
    returned proportion and tillage depth were identified as important factors regulating
    GHG emissions. Specifically, FD was found to be the better irrigation mode for
    rice fields, with a higher mitigation potential for GHG emissions (39.5 % on GWP)
    compared to CF, followed by MD at 18.4 %. However, the application of organic
    fertilizer, tillage, straw returned in half and full quantity could increase GWP
    by 80.3 %, 33.8 %, 25.2 % and 111.6 %, respectively. The combination of a mineral
    nitrogen fertilizer rate of 128 kg ha−1, FD water management, without straw, tillage,
    and organic fertilizer could achieve the most mitigation effect, with a GWP of
    3.13 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1. Moreover, our model exhibited an obvious trade-off
    relationship between CH4 and N2O emissions, and the predicted trends of both emissions
    were in good accordance with mechanisms of GHG emission in rice fields, indicating
    our model is a promising alternative to agricultural ecosystem models. CRediT

    intelligenceSensor technologySmart city 1. Introduction The idea of the digital
    twin has been crucial in aiding engineers with the creation and oversight of complex
    systems as an outcome of model-based engineering [1]. In this method, physical
    twins are paired with virtual twins (digital representations of essential aspects
    and behaviors of the system, often implemented as software agents) as described
    in [2]. A digital twin facilitates the assessment of feasibility during the requirements
    analysis and initiation phase by enabling trade-off analysis and experimentation
    without requiring the actual operation of the system. The virtual twin aids in
    delineating specifications and removing ambiguity throughout the development process.
    Sensors connect the physical system to its virtual counterpart for real-time monitoring
    and enhancement of the physical system using the digital twin’s data and longitudinal
    analysis [3]. More examples of digital twin applications in cities have been provided
    in recent review publications [4], [5]. Numerous cases have been reported where
    single-metric solutions have been used to solve problems, such as streamlining
    production lines [6], managing wastewater [7], maintaining vehicles [8], and others.
    The digital twin technology has recently drawn attention for its potential in
    mass personalization, particularly in relation to distinctive wetland habitats
    [9]. While most of the earlier research on the subject of the digital twin focused
    on manufacturing, recent studies have explored the relationship between the digital
    twin and mass individualization in order to develop a com- prehensive reference
    architecture for digital twin applications [10]. A Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS)
    model demonstrated notable benefits in several industries, such as smart planned
    maintenance, real-time monitoring, remote control, and predictive functions [11].
    New capabilities are set to be added to the AQUADVANCED® Water Networks “Distribution”
    software, which is essential for managing drinking water distribution systems.
    Thousands of users will benefit from these upgrades before the summer of 2022,
    not only in France but globally as well [12]. Using artificial intelligence (AI)
    in digital twin models for smart cities can enhance the efficiency and sustainability
    of stormwater systems. A digital twin model that incorporates AI techniques can
    provide valuable insights for decision- makers and stakeholders, enabling them
    to make informed decisions regarding infrastructure planning, design, and maintenance.
    1. AI algorithms, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), can process
    vast amounts of data from various sources, including sensors, weather forecasts,
    and historical data. This enables the digital twin to make accurate predictions
    about stormwater flow, system performance, and potential issues. Consequently,
    decision-makers can proactively address potential problems and optimize system
    operations. 2. AI-enhanced digital twin models can dynamically adjust the stormwater
    infrastructure''s operation based on real-time data and predictions. This includes
    controlling retention basins, gates, and pumps, allowing for adaptive responses
    to changing weather conditions, and preventing flooding or damage to infrastructure.
    3. AI-powered digital twins can analyze data to identify patterns and trends in
    system performance, enabling predictive maintenance. By identifying areas requiring
    attention before failure occurs, maintenance efforts can be focused where needed
    most, reducing costs, and minimizing disruptions to the system. 4. AI algorithms
    can help identify the best solutions for multiple, often conflicting, objectives
    within stormwater infrastructure systems. This includes balancing water quality,
    flood mitigation, and cost-effectiveness while considering environmental and social
    impacts. The digital twin model can analyze various scenarios and provide decision-makers
    with optimal solutions based on the desired outcomes. 5. Digital twin models enhanced
    with AI can provide visualizations and simu- lation, enabling stakeholders to
    better understand the system''s performance and potential impacts. This promotes
    more effective communication, collab- oration, and decision-making among various
    parties involved in stormwater management. Integrating AI into digital twin models
    for stormwater infrastructure systems, smart cities can better manage and optimize
    their resources, ultimately improv- ing urban resilience and sustainability. As
    AI technology continues to advance, digital twin models will likely play an increasingly
    important role in addressing complex urban challenges, such as stormwater management,
    in an increasingly interconnected world. This paper explores the integration of
    Artificial Intelli- gence into Digital Twin models to enhance stormwater infrastructure
    systems within smart cities. With a focus on urban drainage systems, it provides
    an analysis of the current state of digital twin technology. Reviewing and organizing
    existing literature on smart stormwater management, the study clarifies terminology
    and practices. Case studies from various cities demonstrate how digital twins
    can be used to manage urban water systems practically. As well as identifying
    key research areas, the paper emphasizes how AI can revolutionize stormwater management
    in smart urban environments. An overview of digital twins and their importance
    in smart cities is presented in the introduction, along with information on how
    AI can enhance stormwater systems. A description of the literature review process
    and the time frame of selected publications is presented in the methodology section.
    A detailed examination of the technologies fundamental to digital twin models
    follows a detailed examination of how digital twin models integrate with AI. After
    discussing characteristics, terminology, optimization of Smart Water Management
    (SWM), short-term forecasting, decentralized systems, and the role of AI in stormwater
    management, the paper explores the application of digital twins in smart cities.
    The subsequent sections analyze the implementation of digital twins and the role
    of AI in cities such as Helsinki, Zurich, and Vienna. An examination of digital
    twins’ contributions to green infrastructure planning is included in one section,
    while another focuses on digital twin modeling and real-time data visualization.
    In a conclusion section, the paper examines the current state of digital twin
    technology, its potential limitations, and the implications for future research
    on AI-enhanced digital twin models for smart cities’ stormwater infrastructure.
    2. The literature review methodology Considering the recent developments in AI
    applications within Digital Twin models for stormwater infrastructure in smart
    cities, our methodology incorporates a literature review and a case study analysis.
    It ensures a rigorous examination of both theoretical insights and practical applications
    by exploring the field. We reviewed the literature using prominent databases,
    including Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, chosen for their extensive
    coverage across interdisciplinary research areas relevant to our subject matter.
    As part of our search strategy, we used terms such as “digital twin,” “AI in urban
    water management,” “smart city infrastructure,” and “stormwater system modeling”
    in combination with Boolean operators and specific filters (e.g., publication
    years 2015 to 2023) to identify the most relevant studies. A two-stage screening
    process - reviewing titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text review based
    on inclusion criteria such as relevance, contribution to the field, and citation
    impact - ensured that noteworthy works were included. Using a thematic analysis,
    key information was systematically gathered from the selected publications and
    synthesized. Through this process, core themes, challenges, and opportunities
    in leveraging AI for digital twins in managing stormwater systems were identified,
    bridging theoretical knowledge with practical insights. In addition, we highlighted
    the global application of digital twins in various geographic locations and urban
    environments because of our case study analysis. Academic journals, municipal
    reports, and project documents were consulted when selecting these case studies
    for their innovation, maturity, and depth of information. We examined how these
    practical applications addressed challenges and opportunities identified in the
    literature, providing a real-world perspective on theoretical findings. Based
    on insights from the literature re- view and observations from case studies, we
    were able to construct a nuanced understanding of the current state and future
    directions for AI in stormwater infrastructure digital twins. Besides providing
    an overview, this methodology also identified common challenges such as data integration
    issues and model accuracy, as well as opportunities such as enhanced decision-making
    capability and operational efficiency. Its strength lies in the systematic and
    rigorous examination it facilitates, combining the depth of literature review
    with the breadth of case study analysis. Despite this, we acknowledge that there
    may be limitations, such as database selection bias and publication bias inherent
    in the method. In order to address these concerns, future research could include
    additional databases and grey literature. As a result of using this structured,
    yet integrated methodology, we ensured an exploration of AI applications in digital
    twins for stormwater management, contributing valuable knowledge to the field
    and addressing the research question in its entirety. 3. Technologies that enable
    digital twin A city is composed of several blocks or neighborhoods that are distinguished
    by their social and technical characteristics. In smart buildings, rooms may contain
    devices affected by the environment, with additional interconnections like those
    in smart cities where power consumption reduction is linked to device usage, competing
    with, or aligned with room controls. A planner is more concerned with the consequences
    of their execution than with offering smart equipment. The second problem is to
    build realistic representations of the city and its components after embracing
    the idea of a multi-scale, multi-attribute, multi-objective, complex, sociotechnical
    system. Fig. 1 illustrates the digital twins of urban physical assets. An image
    of the physical city is depicted on the left, along with its buildings, supporting
    infrastructure, and citizens, while organizations and corporations are represented
    on the right, along with technical sensors and their derived metrics. For planning
    and governance, the digital twin ensemble provides computational decision support.
    In the lower part of Fig. 1, you can see how the interaction of crucial standards,
    metrics, and methods is illustrated. These benchmarks, measures, and techniques,
    which may be used in both physical and virtual contexts, are developed from green
    best practices. In the sections that follow, these ideas in greater detail are
    examined, as well as the standards shown in Fig. 1. In the rapidly evolving economy
    of today, organizations must prioritize sustainability in order to maintain a
    competitive edge, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Sustainable practices can reduce costs,
    enhance safety and security, and improve employee well-being [14]. Moreover, being
    green enhances an organization’s brand image, contributing to talent recruitment
    and employee retention [15], [16]. Despite increased awareness and acceptability,
    firms'' sustainability activities are not assessed using a single, widely accepted
    set of indicators. These metrics serve as the basis for creating rules and regulations
    in addition to being crucial for monitoring and evaluating businesses and their
    operations. Fig. 2 illustrates a preliminary definition of the structure of an
    urban digital twin by examining the physical city as the field in which finite
    quantities of resources flow among a wide range of agents, each with a different
    degree of influence over public policy decisions, with effects on each of these
    agents in terms of their quality of life. There is no doubt that the regulatory
    framework plays a important role in this matter. Download : Download high-res

    full-size image Fig. 2. The urban digital twin as model of physical objects and
    urban agents [17]. The urban digital twin as a model of physical objects and urban
    agents is shown in Fig. 2. The digital twin is developed and managed through a
    range of technological innovations that capture, process, and display data. Digital
    twins are supported by a set of fundamental elements already present in many organizations
    today, providing operational and data processing support. These digital twins
    are a class of emerging technologies typically implemented during an organization’s
    digital transformation process, allowing them to reach their full potential as
    comprehensive, live data models spanning various resources. Key technologies that
    form the foundation of the digital twin system include the Internet of Things
    (IoT), 5G technology, AI and Big Data Analytics, Visualization Tools, Digital
    Platforms, Social Sensing, Participatory Sensing, Spatio-temporal fluctuation,
    Semantic Model Approach, ML Approach, and Energy Bench- marking Approach, among
    others. IoT, a network of interconnected devices equipped with sensors, software,
    and other technologies, enables interaction and information exchange with various
    systems and platforms over the Internet. Equipment monitoring via IoT helps construction
    firms track usage, manage costs, and make informed decisions. Cloud computing
    and real-time monitoring assist in reducing theft, enhancing efficiency, and controlling
    resource expenses. 5G technology serves as an integral digital twin accelerator,
    offering ultra-high speeds, rapid response times, and the capacity to support
    high device densities. With constantly changing construction site environments,
    teams can leverage 5G to monitor real-time activities and execute virtual or autonomous
    construction operations. This technology enables seamless access to data-intensive
    edge and cloud applications, facilitating real-time communication among users
    globally [19]. Digital twin technology relies heavily on AI and big data analytics.
    The use of AI aids city managers in making informed decisions and automating operational
    tasks when combined with analytical tools. An audio sensor within the city infrastructure,
    for example, could alert operations center personnel to an incident and suggest
    potential responses. Drones can also be automatically activated by such sensors.
    The emergence of automation in construction relies on AI and extensive data mining
    technology [20]. In addition to digital twins, visualization tools play an important
    role as well. The main components of digital twins are real-time operation centers
    with video walls and 3D simulation software like BIM. These tools can be enhanced
    with augmented reality and virtual reality technologies, enhancing their accuracy
    and utility. Additionally, these technologies have impactful implications for
    operations, training architecture, and simulation. The Digital Platform connects
    all previously mentioned technologies, linking applications and data to eliminate
    the need for storage facilities. The platform also connects various businesses
    and socioeconomic and educational sectors, enabling an exploration of the ecosystem
    and surpassing individual system capabilities. Social sensing involves various
    sensing paradigms wherein data is collected on behalf of humans or computers.
    Mobile sensing devices are crucial in social sensing to monitor and sense mobile
    targets. Social sensing generally encompasses three types of data collection:
    participatory sensing, opportunistic sensing, and social data scavenging. Participatory
    sensing involves individuals actively participating in the sensing process and
    performing specific tasks essential for meeting application requirements [13],
    [21]. Spatiotemporal fluctuation measures landscape changes based on change patterns.
    These metrics indicate landscape structure changes in various ways, while the
    direction and frequency of fluctuations reveal spatial variations. This helps
    identify physical vulnerabilities that may cause hazards and risks in construction
    [21]. The semantic data model is a conceptual data model containing semantic information
    that imparts significant meaning to data and relationships among them. A semantic
    approach to information processing and execution implicitly defines the purpose
    of represented knowledge using semantic settings and prior information [22]. The
    goal of ML is to enable computers to adapt and improve based on experience, rather
    than directly programmable instructions. Computer systems that are capable of
    acquiring and interpreting data for self-learning are being developed. As a method
    to assess the energy efficiency of buildings over time by comparing them to other
    similar structures or modeled simulation of a reference building designed to meet
    specific standards, benchmarking, a method that compares one or more aspects of
    products, services, and strategies against industry-leading organizations, is
    applied to building energy consumption. Benchmarking is an effective tool for
    gauging the energy efficiency of buildings and identifying areas for improvement
    when it is applied to their energy consumption. Therefore, the digital twin concept
    utilizes a combination of advanced technologies such as IoT, 5G, AI, Big Data
    Analytics, Visualization Tools, Digital Platforms, Social Sensing, spatial–temporal
    fluctuations, Semantic Model Approach, ML Approach, and Energy Benchmarking Approach
    to create a comprehensive, real-time data model. The combination of these technologies
    enhances decision-making, optimizes resource utilization, and improves overall
    efficiency in the number of industries, including construction and urban planning.
    The use of digital twins will become increasingly important as organizations continue
    to adopt digital transformation processes and embrace emerging technologies. An
    explanation of modeling and visualization techniques is shown in Table 1. Table

    4. Digital twins and smart city A Digital Twin is a simulation technique that
    combines several disciplines, physical qualities, scales, and probabilities using
    physical models, sensors, and historical operational data. This simulation acts
    as a digital depiction of the product throughout its useful life. There are now
    many ways to understand the idea of a digital twin, and there is no agreed-upon
    definition. The physical things, virtual models, data, connections, and services
    make up the digital twin. A digital twin gives a two-way mapping between the real
    and virtual worlds, which is where it differs from a digital shadow. Digital twins,
    unlike digital shadows, enable physical entities to be controlled without human
    intervention [31], a feature not present in digital shadows. A virtual twin enables
    the representation of physical characteristics, structures, states, performance,
    functions, and behaviors of a system in a virtual environment [28], creating a
    dynamic model with high fidelity over a variety of dimensions, scales, and physical
    quantities. The model allows for effective observation, comprehension, control,
    and transformation of the physical world [28], [29]. In cities embracing technological
    advancements and urbanization challenges, humans, infrastructure systems, and
    technologies are increasingly interdependent. As a result of these interdependencies,
    management decisions may be less than ideal, resulting in increased uncertainty
    and inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, city decision-makers must
    change the way they understand, influence, and manage urban infrastructure. A
    Smart City Digital Twin (SCDT) integrates the real and digital worlds through
    iterative, data-driven feedback loops. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and
    mixed reality technologies combine IoT, analytics, and visualization capabilities
    to create a virtual representation of municipal infrastructure [31]. Decision-makers
    may be able to evaluate policies and projects that are driven by the community
    and stakeholder groups thanks to synergistic feedback loops between physical infrastructure
    and human systems. What-if scenarios and emergent behaviors may be used to predict
    how smart cities will function under various economic, environmental, and social
    circumstances. It is crucial to comprehend this idea in order to evaluate the
    success of smart growth initiatives and to close the gap between smart utopia
    and smart reality [32], [33]. The development of such integrated cyber-physical
    city infrastructures requires new technological and methodological advances, as
    well as multidisciplinary collaboration. Digital twin cities will be a “new starting
    point” for innovation in urban management, planning, and services in the development
    of smart cities [34], [35]. As a result, we will be able to visualize all aspects
    of city information and will be able to intelligently plan, manage, and deliver
    services within the city. As a key element of smart cities, digital twin cities
    are not only a goal of digital cities but also a critical component. To become
    smarter, cities must have these facilities and basic capabilities, marking a step
    in the transformation of urban information technology from qualitative to quantitative
    change, which creates greater opportunities for innovation in the development
    of smart cities [36]. 4.1. Characteristics of smart cities based on digital twins
    As a result of diverse perspectives, the concept of the digital twin has been
    interpreted in many ways. In their study, Tao et al. [29] explore various dimensions
    and analyze current understandings of digital twins. In Table 2, they describe
    the five dimensions of an ideal digital twin: model, data, connection, service/function,
    and physical. It has been noted by Tao et al. that digital twins exhibit unique
    characteristics at various stages, so it is important to understand and apply
    digital twins in the context of specific objects, applications, and requirements
    [29], [30], [31]. In real-world implementations, a digital twin need not exhibit
    all ideal traits; satisfying the users'' particular requirements is enough [28],
    [29]. The digital twin city concept, as a broader application of the digital twin
    idea in urban contexts, displays distinct features that originate from the ideal
    attributes of digital twins. Various industries, such as manufacturing, aerospace,
    healthcare, and transportation, have applied digital twin technology in recent
    years implementation of digital twins has led to improved efficiency, reduced
    costs, and enhanced decision-making in these sectors [32]. In the context of smart
    cities, digital twin cities can help with urban planning, resource management,
    traffic control, and environmental monitoring. By incorporating real-time data,
    digital twin cities can optimize infrastructure utilization and maintenance, leading
    to more sustainable urban development. The capabilities of digital twin cities
    can be bolstered by integrating cutting-edge technologies like AI, ML, and big
    data analytics. This enables improved forecasting, optimization, and adaptability
    in response to evolving circumstances [33], [34], [35]. To ensure the successful
    implementation of digital twin cities and to address the diverse needs of urban
    environments, collaboration among stakeholders such as governments, businesses,
    researchers, and citizens will be crucial. Table 2. Varied interpretations of
    the term digital twin. S.No. Perspective Understanding of Digital Twin 1. Representation
    Aspect A digital representation of a physical system or product that captures
    its geometry, composition, and structural behavior. 2. Data Dimension The integration
    of real-time and historical data, enabling continuous updating and synchronization
    of digital twins with its physical counterpart. 3. Linkage Aspect A digital twin''s
    connection and communication with its physical counterpart, as well as with other
    digital twins are seamless. 4. Functional Aspect The digital twin''s capacity
    to provide services and functions, such as predictive maintenance, performance
    optimization, and what-if scenario analysis. 5. Physical Dimension The ability
    of a digital twin to control and influence its physical counterpart, enabling
    real-world changes based on insights and decisions derived from the digital twin.
    Digital twin city consists of precise mapping, virtual-real interaction, software-
    driven representations, and intelligent feedback. Aerial, ground, subterranean,
    and river sensors are used to map urban infrastructure, such as roads, bridges,
    manhole covers, lamps, and buildings [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. Through this,
    it is possible to gain a complete understanding of the city''s operational status
    as well as a dynamic monitoring of it, which ultimately allows an accurate alignment
    of the virtual city with the physical city in terms of information. A virtual
    model of the physical city can be created by twin cities using software platforms
    that simulate the behavior of urban people, events, and objects in the virtual
    environment [42], [43], [44], [45]. By planning, designing, and simulating the
    digital twin city and proposing reasonable and viable countermeasures, intelligent
    feedback can provide smart early warning of potential negative effects, conflicts,
    and threats within the city. By integrating next-generation technology into the
    basis of the digital twin city, such as Internet of Items, cloud computing, big
    data, and AI, it is feasible to direct and optimize the design and management
    of smart cities [46], [47]. The provision of citizens'' services will be enhanced,
    as well as the development of smart cities will be further assisted [48]. As part
    of the following discussion, five exemplary applications are presented for illustrating
    how digital twins support the operation of smart cities [49]. 4.2. Clarifying
    the terminology Despite its widespread use in everyday speech, science, government,
    and practice, smart technology is unlikely to be used as often in stormwater,
    hydrology, or hydraulics. The use of smart technology in a broader sense might
    pique the interest of decision-makers, legislators, and the public [50], but such
    expansive terminology can cause misunderstandings when discussing scientific advances.
    It is important to use consistent language so that the audience understands the
    nature, scope, and goal of the ideas being presented. To tie our discussion to
    the literature sources on which it is based [51], [52], [53], A variety of terminology
    is used to reflect similar yet noticeably different uses of smart technology.
    In this way, stormwater management will be improved along with related disciplines
    including green infrastructure, urban planning, and urban ecology. It refers to
    features and technologies that can be retrofitted to improve the capabilities
    of other devices, assets, or networks by enhancing their sensing, monitoring (data
    collection), communicating, managing, analyzing, integrating, controlling, or
    optimizing capabilities. Due to the inclusion of a variety of technologies with
    different degrees of “smartness” in this definition, current research uses smart
    technologies in a fragmented and uneven manner. In everyday conversations, as
    well as in science, governance, and practice, the term smart technology is pervasive.
    However, it is arguably more prevalent in fields like energy, telecommunications,
    and HVAC than in stormwater, hydrology, and hydraulics. Using smart technology
    as a general descriptor can attract the interest of decision-makers, policymakers,
    and the public [50], but such broad terms can cause confusion when discussing
    scientific progress and needs. Consistent terminology usage is crucial for effectively
    disseminating knowledge, and ensuring that audiences understand the nature, scope,
    and intent of the proposed approaches. In this review, various terms are used
    to describe similar yet subtly different applications of smart technology, attempting
    to connect our discussion to the literature sources upon which it is based [51],
    [52], [53]. To prevent confusion, we will define the terms used in the following
    section. Authors should clearly define the terms they use in an evolving field
    like this to foster clear communication within the stormwater discipline and promote
    dialogue with related disciplines such as system optimization and control, green
    infrastructure, urban planning, and urban ecology. Smart technology refers to
    technologies capable of sensing, monitoring (data collection), communicating,
    managing, analyzing, integrating, controlling, or optimizing devices in a systematic
    manner. These integrated smart features and technologies can be retrofitted to
    enhance the capabilities of other devices, assets, or networks. This definition
    covers a wide range of technologies with varying levels of smartness, leading
    to fragmented and inconsistent application of smart technologies in current research.
    The development of a framework is reviewed within this paper to accommodate this
    array of technologies and capabilities, allowing for benchmarking and comparison.
    Real-time control (RTC): In stormwater management, smart is an advancement from
    the established research field of RTC [54], [55], [56]. Parker et al. (2021) describes
    actuators, controllers, sensors, and telemetry in RTC systems [57]. Passive/active
    control: Passive control systems generally depend on hydraulic conditions to change
    the discharge rate from a specific asset, including orifices, vortex flow controls,
    and weirs. Passive systems may incorporate some degree of smartness if monitored
    (e.g., through telemetry reporting water levels) [58]. Typically, active control
    systems involve a device like an actuator which is driven by a local or global
    control system, and does not encompass assets controlling flow velocities using
    mechanical principles, such as vortex flow controls [59], [60], [61]. Internet
    of Things: The IoT refers to the interconnectivity of devices (both physical and
    virtual) to the Internet and other connected devices [62]. It encompasses both
    hardware and software in the context of smart stormwater. Artificial Intelligence:
    AI has enabled stormwater management improvements such as optimization, prediction,
    and forecasting. By evaluating vast datasets, spotting trends, and generating
    predictions using AI approaches, stormwater systems can be managed more effectively
    [63], [64], [65]. AI can be used to optimize adaptive control strategies, enabling
    stormwater infrastructure to respond effectively to changing environmental factors
    such as rainfall intensity and duration. The result is a reduction in flooding
    risk and better management of water quality [66]. Geographic Information Systems
    (GIS): Stormwater infrastructure geo- graphical data may be managed, analyzed,
    and visualized using GIS [67]. It assists with flood risk assessment, the design
    of stormwater systems, their upkeep, and the identification of sensitive locations
    [68]. Remote Sensing: Remote sensing technology, which utilizes satellite imaging
    and aerial photography makes it possible to monitor vast regions and gather useful
    information on land cover, precipitation, and urban growth [69]. Stormwater management
    decisions can be guided this information current stormwater systems can be evaluated
    on the basis of this data [70]. Green Infrastructure: Green infrastructure consists
    of natural or constructed systems that mimic natural processes to manage stormwater
    [71]. Permeable pavement, bioswales, rain gardens, and green roofs are some examples.
    Further- more, these methods help to reduce stormwater runoff, enhance water quality,
    and mitigate urban heat islands [72], [73]. Sensors and Telemetry: Stormwater
    infrastructure can be equipped with sensors and telemetry systems to measure water
    levels and flow rates in real-time. Proactive management of stormwater systems
    can be enabled by RTC systems [74]. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
    Systems: SCADA systems centrally monitor and control stormwater infrastructure,
    allowing operators to effectively manage numerous assets, spot problems, and adapt
    to changing conditions [75], [76], [77]. Modeling and Simulation: The behavior
    of stormwater systems may be predicted using sophisticated hydrologic and hydraulic
    models, which can also be used to evaluate the operation of current infrastructure
    and provide information for the creation of new stormwater management strategies
    [78]. Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics: Data related to stormwater management
    can now be processed and stored in huge quantities using cloud computing [79],
    [80]. By analyzing big data uncover trends and make better decisions [81]. 4.3.
    Optimization of SWM Due to the advancement of network-scale monitoring, several
    best-practice RTC methods are being created. These methods include fuzzy logic
    control, genetic algorithms, and neural networks. Making sure that water systems
    are used sustainably and independently is a key component of optimizing SWM [13],
    [81]. As a result, it is possible to minimize leaks and losses, guarantee the
    quality of the water, enhance customer happiness, and increase operational effectiveness.
    Understanding water systems better, detecting leaks earlier, controlling water
    loss more effectively, and continuously monitoring water quality, and achieving
    economic gains from water and energy conservation, financial loss reductions (of
    up to 30 % on water bills), improved system efficiency, and customer service quality,
    among other things are additional benefits of the sophisticated information technology
    used in SWM systems [82]. Flood control, combined sewer overflows, and network
    capacity are a few of the optimization techniques that emphasize water quantity
    management over water quality management. A major reason for this discrepancy
    is the maturity of the components required for monitoring quantity, which includes
    sensors, actuators, and telecommunications. Due to reliability and scalability
    issues, water quality measurement technology, in particular sensors, hasn''t yet
    reached the point where it can provide real-time feedback [83], [84], [85], [86].

    of relevant studies on the optimization of SWMsystems. Reference Year Method Result
    Ramos et al. [89] 2022 Digital twin technology A fast detection of leaks combined
    with a rapid configuration and optimization of pressure control valves can lead
    to a water saving of up to 28 %, increasing the overall system efficiency. Siew
    et al. [90] 2012 Fuzzy-based constraint handling and a new entropy based mixed
    reliability index In this study, a modified two-loop architecture was looked at.
    These examples showed that the fuzzy technique and the new dependability score
    were both only partially successful in creating the best water distribution networks.
    Sangroula et al. [91] 2022 Genetic Algorithm based SOP-WDN program The technique
    was applied to three benchmark water distribution network optimization issues,
    and the outcomes were consistently good. Engineers can use the SOP-WDN to help
    with water distribution pipeline design and restoration. Xin et al. [92] 2022
    Mult objective Optimization Balancing water quality, energy, and cost factors
    in water distribution system design. Shirajuddin et al. [88] 2022 Genetic Algorithm
    As the problem of aging pipes worsens, NSGA-III should replace NSGA-II as the
    go-to technique for solving increasingly difficult WDS optimization issues, however,
    NSGA-II may still be used for easier optimization tasks. This constraint, in contrast
    to the virtually immediate nature of water level monitoring, results from the
    lag between gathering water quality samples and lab analysis. Proxy measurements
    including color, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen content have been used in recent
    years to develop this field, frequently in combination with real-time management
    of downstream treatment alternatives [87]. 4.4. The role of short-term forecasting
    in smart stormwater Data management at catchment scale has been improved by the
    integration of weather data and short-term forecasts into RTC [93], [94], [95].
    As a result, storm predictions and responses have become more accurate. A considerable
    period has passed since early flood warnings were developed for predicting future
    network states [96]. Meydani et al. [97] developed a real-time daily runoff forecast
    system by downscaling seasonal weather forecasts using Bayesian Belief Networks
    (BBN), particularly demonstrating BBN''s effectiveness in improving the accuracy
    of probabilistic precipitation forecasts. Zamani et al. [98] recently studied
    water quality forecasting. Various DL models were evaluated for chlorophyll-a
    concentrations, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memories
    (LSTMs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal convolutional networks (TCN).
    According to their results, the GRU model performed better, and the integration
    of these models into ensemble models using genetic algorithms improved forecasting
    accuracy. Particularly, the Mult objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II outperformed
    standalone DL and ensemble models based on GA. Having the ability to predict such
    events has reduced flood-related damage and improved emergency response. As computational
    models have become more powerful and cost-effective, coupled with high-resolution
    input data like weather radar, rainfall radar has been incorporated into the management
    of large sewer systems [99], [100], [101], [102]. Consequently, stormwater infrastructure
    has become more efficient and automated, enhancing urban communities'' resilience.

    models and improve their accuracy. Demir et al. [105] 2023 Lake water level (LWL)

    are effective and reliable. Time series predictions are improved when the periodicity
    component is included. It may also be possible to enhance the outcomes of cross-station
    modeling by using data from nearby sites as a means of transferring learning.
    Ahmadi et al. [106] 22,022 Groundwater Level The progress in ML and DL algorithms,
    coupled with computational advancements that integrate them with physics-based
    models provide unparalleled opportunities to utilize new information sources,
    such as InSAR data, to enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of groundwater
    monitoring and forecasting. Zounemat-Kermani et al. [107] 2021 Surface water hydrology
    and hydraulics According to the findings of this study, ensemble strategies are
    clearly superior to single-model learning in hydrology. Additionally, boosting
    techniques (such as boosting, AdaBoost, and extreme gradient boosting) are more
    commonly employed to solve hydrological problems than bagging, stacking Antwi-Agyakwa
    et al. [108] 2023 Flood Risk Prediction In the present study, they found that
    ML models have been extensively employed to predict floods, while probabilistic
    models such as Copula and Bayesian Networks (B.N.) play a crucial role in evaluating
    the uncertainty associated with flood risks, which warrants further study due
    to their inherent uncertainty. In addition, the advancement of remote sensing,
    GIS, and cloud computing creates an ideal platform for integrating data and tools
    for flood forecasting. Rainwater harvesting systems can benefit from RTC technology
    in terms of water provision, flood protection, and environmental flow. Predicting
    rainfall before storm events allows this system to release water before storms
    occur, preventing uncontrolled overflows. A more efficient management of water
    resources can be achieved due to this approach, thereby reducing flood risks.
    Many advanced applications have relied on 24-hour forecasts, while long-term forecasts
    remain largely unexplored. It is possible that the exploration of these longer-term
    forecasts may result in further benefits and improvements to the performance of
    the system. RTC systems harvest less rainwater than passive systems, but they
    deliver environmental water for streamflow restoration and flood mitigation [99],
    [100]. It has been primarily the use of weather data for prediction rather than
    for actuating the operation of network features that have been the primary focus
    of the initial deployment. The accuracy and responsiveness of these systems can
    be further enhanced using auto-calibration feedback loops developed by some models
    using observed measurements within drainage catchments. Furthermore, several modeling
    studies have demonstrated that nowcasting approaches can be implemented to actuate
    and control detention ponds and drainage systems using rainfall radar [101]. As
    far as stormwater management is concerned, this is an important development. Recent
    reviews have demonstrated that nowcasting has significant potential, and a limited
    number of pilot studies have already been carried out on a commercial scale. Climate
    change also drives big changes in cities [109]. SWM and urban resilience will
    be impacted by this technology as it continues to evolve. 4.5. Decentralized smart
    stormwater systems The majority of literature on smart stormwater management systems
    incorporates RTC primarily into large infrastructure systems. These trends have
    led to centralized systems for water supply, treatment, and sewerage, sometimes
    called gray systems [110], [111]. In recent years, the emphasis has shifted from
    large assets to maximizing network capacity by utilizing multiple large assets
    across traditional sewer network components, including pipes, combined sewer overflows,
    and tanks. As such, RTC has been extensively demonstrated as a cost-effective
    method for increasing network capacity while maintaining options for future adaptation
    through retrofitting or updating control rules. There are some strategies for
    transforming existing urban areas into decentralized stormwater runoff management,
    but these are usually country- or city-specific [112], [113], [21]. The transition
    of urban areas towards decentralized management approaches, therefore, requires
    a systematic approach. Additionally, cities need assistance in assessing the practical
    potential for transforming their urban areas into decentralized solutions [114].
    A framework for smart water systems is shown in Fig. 3 [118]. Coordinated catchment-scale
    networks are believed to be the most effective way of using rainwater harvesting
    and attenuation basins. Offline optimization based on asset status, upstream conditions,
    or forecasting is currently the predominant method for coordinating assets. Despite
    equivalent volumes of distributed measures in individual tanks, distributed smart
    control systems offer some advantages [115], [116]. The decentralized control
    is becoming more widely accepted as a reliable solution because it requires minimal
    communication and has been shown to perform better in managing assets, such as
    capturing water during high- magnitude events, compared to passive operation alone.

    Fig. 3. A New Framework of Smart Water System [118]. This is commonly referred
    to as “sweating the assets.” However, most studies have only looked at the benefits
    at the individual asset level, ignoring the advantages of coordinated control
    across networks. Therefore, further research is needed to explore how these benefits
    can be optimized [117]. 4.6. Modeling AI in stormwater In many newly developed
    towns, stormwater retention ponds are a best manage- ment practice, but their
    widespread usage may be harmful to aquatic life. Many input parameters must be
    collected and calibrated for existing models, which are process-based. Researchers
    studied thermal modeling tool that incorporates readily available climatic data
    based on AI. AI-process-based models can often predict the temperature of shallow
    water bodies, such as small lakes and ponds [118], [119], [120], [121], [122],
    [123]. These types of models use climatological information and empirical equations
    to study convection, advection, and evaporation heat transport before utilizing
    numerical techniques to solve the heat equation. The quality of the input variables,
    some of which are hard to collect or prone to mistakes, has an impact on the accuracy
    of the model. As well as ANN models, evolutionary computing algorithms are influenced
    by Darwinian processes of natural selection and biological operations. In [125],
    genetic programming (GP) was introduced as the first advancement of the genetic
    algorithm. Random numbers (also called chromosomes) are used to form populations
    in the GP model. By comparing the fitness of each chromosome to a target value,
    fitness is evaluated. According to Darwin’s principle of survival of the fittest,
    computer programs are genetically reproduced through genetic crossover. GP models
    have been used to predict velocity in laboratory-scaled vegetated floodplains,
    develop rainfall-runoff relationships from synthetic data, assess salt intrusion
    in estuarine environments, simulate rainfall-runoff processes, and predict total
    organic carbon concentrations in lakes with flexible beds covered with vegetation.
    There is not a perfect link between hydrological parameters, climatic circumstances,
    and flow behavior in complex hydraulic systems like man-made wetlands. Hydrodynamic
    equations including the Manning''s roughness coefficient and the coefficient may
    be used to simulate the hydraulic behavior of these wetlands. Hydrodynamic models
    need a lot of data to be calibrated and validated in remote, biodiverse habitats
    like artificial wetlands. In comparison to hydrodynamic models, data- driven models
    may be better able to depict the nonlinear interactions between various hydraulic
    and hydrologic parameters connected to wetlands [118], [119], [120], [121], [122],
    [123], [124], [125]. Table 5 is a new attempt to contrast the usage of AI models
    in a wetland system since no other studies have thoroughly studied the use of
    data-driven models for forecasting hydrological parameters. In addition to using
    AI techniques, wetland hydraulic characteristics were compared with the conventional
    stepwise regression model as a baseline. Even though there have been numerous
    research efforts on neurocomputing models for predicting sediment concentration,
    as well as evaluations of their accuracy, some of these models are still not accurate
    or are computationally expensive. In [126] features a comparison of four multivariate
    non-linear regression models, including FFNN, ARIMA, and Multivariate Non-Linear
    Regression. FFNN often provided better forecasts, according to the researchers
    (Table 5). Table 5. Summary of the reviewed studies in modelling AI in stormwater.

    twin implementation experience In this paper, each city was chosen due to its
    unique contribution to the under- standing of digital twin technology in urban
    management. Helsinki’s leadership in digital twin innovation, Zurich’s focus on
    3-D spatial data and open govern- ment data policies, Vienna’s approach to 3-D
    city modeling, the University of Crete’s application of IoT for sustainability,
    the UK’s integration of digital twins in heritage conservation, Barcelona’s use
    of supercomputing for urban planning, and Imola’s emphasis on walkability and
    urban design all contribute to a rich collection of insights and experiences.
    These cities represent a cross-section of geographical locations, urban challenges,
    and technological advances, making them ideal case studies for exploring the diverse
    applications and impacts of digital twin technology in enhancing stormwater infrastructure
    systems and contributing to the development of smart, sustainable, and resilient
    cities. In addition to their individual achievements and challenges, their selection
    is based on the breadth of knowledge and experience they bring to the study of
    digital twins in urban infrastructure management. 5.1. Digital twin in Helsinki
    The city of Helsinki, Finland is leading the way, spearheaded by Jarmo Suomisto,
    with its digital twin, which consists of both a Reality model and a semantic city
    GML model. As a benchmark for urban modeling, the city’s approach to digital twinning
    includes both visual and semantic data. Helsinki’s inclusion in this study is
    justified by its pioneering status in applying digital twin technology to urban
    planning and sustainability goals, particularly its ambitious carbon neutrality
    goals. Through the use of advanced software and open-data models, as well as its
    efforts to engage the public through digital twins on mobile devices, the city
    offers valuable lessons regarding the use of digital twins for improved urban
    simulation, public engagement, and data management. A reality model consists of
    two billion polygons and depicts the visual representation of the city, whereas
    a semantic model consists of layers of data that can be labeled, queried, modified,
    and expanded (see Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (524KB) Download

    information, and spatial views and allows immersive VR headset exploration. 5.2.
    Digital twin in Zurich Another facet of digital twin applications is Zurich’s
    digital twin, which incorporates 3D spatial data, theme elements, and public participation.
    Its alignment with the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European
    Community“ (INSPIRE) Directive, despite not being a member of the EU, and its
    proactive Open Government Data policies since 2012 illustrate how digital twins
    can facilitate data accessibility and interoperability. As a result of its innovative
    use of digital twin technology in evaluating architectural designs and its commitment
    to improving spatial data visualization’s visual and performative quality, Zurich
    illustrates the transformative potential of digital twins for urban planning and
    management. A focus on 3D spatial data is at the heart of Zurich’s digital twin,
    which incorporates various thematic elements. It serves as a reference point for
    connecting spatial and other types of data. Cadastral and engineering surveying
    processes are adjusted to accommodate the third dimension during digitization
    and further processing of space. Blindflug Studios incorporated a 3D architectural
    component of the City of Zurich’s digital twin in a dystopian cyberpunk recreation
    of Zurich that is focused on its Reformation. The objective is to pique the curiosity
    of those who are not generally drawn to the topic. A digital twin is shown in
    Fig. 5 in Zurich [130]. Download : Download high-res image (353KB) Download :

    on Geoinformation provides descriptions of spatial data, spatial data models,
    and spatial metadata, exceeding the INSPIRE Directive even though Switzerland
    is not an EU member state. Unlike other European countries, Switzerland already
    had a formal Spatial Data Infrastructure and a robust governance framework before
    implementing INSPIRE. In a digital city’s infrastructure, Open Government Data
    (OGD) refers to administrative data that does not require specific protection.
    Since 2012, data from the city''s public administration has been freely accessible,
    machine-readable, and available under an open license. OGD policies and guidelines
    have also been issued and implemented. The Office for Building Construction is
    utilizing digital technologies as part of a pilot project to facilitate the examination
    of submitted designs throughout the judging process. Through a web-based 3D map,
    the first tool enables users to review and submit 3D models of competition submissions
    (Fig. 6). The 3D map is projected onto a screen during the judgment process so
    that the jury may inspect the models, adjust viewpoints and sizes, compare designs
    simultaneously, and view spatial data like construction lines (Baulinien). Fig.
    6 illustrates how 3D spatial data are becoming more prevalent as a spatial solution.
    There are more than a dozen cities worldwide that use Zurich''s virtual city model
    in areas such as environmental studies (noise modeling, air pollution modeling,
    mobile phone radiation modeling), energy (solar potential modeling), and urban
    planning (shade analysis, visibility modeling), to name just a few. Download :

    spatial data in Zurich [130]. To explain the creation and tracking of spatial
    data, models, and metadata, 3D spatial data is used as a reference point for merging
    geographical and other types of data. Digital places can be created and maintained
    through metadata and lifecycle management. Real-time updates can be performed
    on the digital twin for some applications using sensors. Consequently, the third
    dimension is consistently captured and stored during the digitization of real
    space. The visualization of spatial data should be attractive and performant in
    order to enhance understanding and support for the digital twin. In order to encourage
    the dissemination of spatial data and the development of new applications, Open
    Government Data must be made available. There is a need for an automated mechanism
    for gaining access to and ordering data, as well as a simple and attractive method
    for searching and analyzing that data. 5.3. Digital twin in Vienna A method for
    generating 3D city models and other geodata products was proposed by Lehner &
    Dorffner [131]. In order to create a virtual 3D replica of the city’s elements,
    they used existing 3D surveying and mapping data to create a digital geoTwin.
    Besides developing photogrammetric roof models, they developed detailed building
    models based on construction plans and facade images. In order to create photorealistic
    models of buildings, generic textures were used. Furthermore, they developed models
    for two specific areas of landscape, vegetation, and city furniture. The 3D objects
    in these areas were not associated with any semantic information, however. The
    Digital geoTwin of Vienna is designed to develop a topological and semantic 3D
    model of the city based on raw measurements and other input sources. It is possible
    to create City Information Models (CIMs) by combining the Digital geoTwin with
    other datasets, such as census, socioeconomic, energy consumption, and maintenance
    management data. To capture smooth terrain forms and fill in missing information
    from terrestrial and photogrammetric surveys, both discrete surveying data and
    Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data are employed during the modeling process. For
    the Digital geoTwin, LOD2.4 F0 is selected as the preferred level of detail in
    order to address inconsistencies in footprints and to meet the requirements for
    generating lower levels of detail (LODs). An illustration of Schwedenplatz in
    3D is shown in Fig. 7. Following is a summary of the process for measuring various
    building features for the Digital geoTwin: • Rooftop: Stereo-photogrammetry is
    used to measure rooftops. The LOD2.4 takes into account roof overhangs, which
    require roof edge measurements, and captures the general roof shape and large
    superstructures. • Overbuilt structures: Using terrestrial, mobile mapping data,
    or Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), overbuilt structures must be mea- sured from
    ground level if air space extends into the structure. On top portions of buildings
    with protruding parts, stereo-photogrammetry can be used, while on the bottom
    portions, terrestrial methods can be used. • Footprint: In addition to terrestrial
    surveying, other methods are needed for building faces adjacent to public spaces.
    Data from mobile mapping can be used for facades facing streets but not adjacent
    public areas. ALS, oblique imagery, or stereo-photogrammetry can be used for facades
    that are not adjacent to public spaces and are orientated away from street areas.
    As a last resort, a fixed distance (Fd) can be employed if none of these datasets
    are available. Download : Download high-res image (460KB) Download : Download

    sustainability at the University of Crete The Technical University of Crete in
    Greece has integrated an IoT sensor system to improve its current building energy
    management system (BEMS). Between 2015 and 2020, OpenLink sensors were installed
    in three stages. On the TUC campus, more than 6,000 sensors have been put in more
    than 300 rooms spread over 16 student residential halls. The sensors are managed
    via a web interface that continually tracks energy use, takes into account room
    occupancy, and collects data for system application analysis. The ultimate goal
    is to increase campus sustainability by lowering operating expenses by identifying
    utilization inefficiencies and spotting irregularities in energy use (Fig. 8).

    [132]. Mavrokapnidis et al. [132] used the TUC building management system as a
    use case in their research, proposing a methodology for fusing static and dynamic
    building data from various sources. They tested this methodology using data from
    the OpenLink sensors. The high-level system architecture of the TUC building management
    system is depicted in Fig. 8. OpenLink sensors from different rooms wirelessly
    transmit data to their respective Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), which then forward
    the data to the system middleware via Modbus TCP/IP. The data is processed by
    the middleware and is kept in a database. A web-based server that centrally manages
    the building management system interprets the data using digital twins of campus
    structures. By merging data from the digital twin and the physical twin sensors,
    the front-end application creates graphical output, including building topology,
    electrical equipment, energy meters, and HVAC. Advanced analytics and calculations
    for optimum control may be done using this information (Fig. 9). Download : Download

    EUR 30 for hardware, installation, and setup is because of OpenLink’s development
    of the hardware and software infrastructure that supports these sensing devices.
    5.5. Digital twin in clifton suspension Bridge, UK This digital twin provides
    a shared and open ecosystem of data and information from various collaborators
    and stakeholders to connect the real and digital worlds. Public and private organizations,
    both large and small, can benefit from its scale and delivery of meaningful output
    and services. Due to the municipal interest and complementary activities around
    regeneration in the area, East Birmingham and TEED were selected to provide a
    better understanding of previous influencing projects, initiatives, and strategic
    plans. An illustration of Birmingham''s ecosystem of activities is shown in Fig.
    10. The snapshot captures a variety of local activities, and taking these activities
    into account will increase the value and relevance of the creation of a tangible
    digital twin. Each of the initiatives listed has been examined to determine its
    general focus and potential connections to the digital twin. Fig. 10 displays
    a color-coded overview of the outcomes. Download : Download high-res image (196KB)

    revolution was launched by Barcelona Supercomputing Centre (BSC), an entity that
    houses the MareNostrum supercomputer in a 19th-century chapel in Barcelona. This
    computing power allows urban planners to anticipate impacts and mitigate negative
    consequences by making decisions based on real data. A digital twin of the city
    has been created by BSC, allowing testing and validation of potential city planning
    scenarios before implementation. Over the next five years, the scheme will become
    a fundamental tool for urban planning, despite being still in its test phase.
    Across European cities, this technology-driven approach is expected to become
    standard practice in urban planning to benefit all citizens. Challenge. Air quality
    and emissions issues have been inadvertently pushed to other areas by previous
    traffic and pollution management measures, necessitating additional measures.
    There are a number of key challenges to be addressed, including: • Improving a
    community''s access to facilities and services. • Dealing with urban renewal and
    gentrification. • Putting into action major climate change initiatives between
    2030 and 2050. Approach. • Planning decisions, such as clean air measures, should
    be simulated prior to implementation, to identify and mitigate negative impacts,
    or to plan additional measures in advance. • Monitoring gentrification trends
    based on indicative measures, such as homestays. • Public transportation and services
    are underserved areas. • The use of open-access technologies, including OpenstreetMap,
    to encourage citizen participation; allowing them to challenge and contribute
    to planning processes. Impact. • To restructure cities so that people may live,
    work, and access all the services they require (such as shopping, health care,
    and education) within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. • Decision-making based on
    evidence, data, and citizen accountability. 5.7. Digital twin in Imola Italy Recently,
    urban design has made walkability a key consideration. The idea stresses the use
    of local transit, bicycles, or foot for the bulk of everyday requirements. Urban
    morphology, which encompasses the design of buildings, public areas, and roadway
    layouts, has an impact on walkability. In terms of urban morphology, connection
    and accessibility are crucial for walkability. A location is more likely to be
    frequented by pedestrians if it is geographically linked to other destinations.
    Contrarily, connectivity describes the availability and directness of paths connecting
    two sites. Using Rhino 6, the neighborhood''s urban land use is imported to ensure
    accessibility and connectivity. Public green nodes, public transit nodes, and
    public urban space nodes are thought of as destinations as pedestrian paths originating
    from residential parcels. Within a small local region, the likelihood of walking
    far enough to fulfill health recommendations is frequently assessed. Every distance
    level between the starting nodes and the destinations, ranging from 0 to 3 km,
    is given a distinct score according to this model. The map will then be overlaid
    with the PET map to create a green pedestrian network. Imola, a historically big
    city in Italy with a humid subtropical climate, is the subject of the case study.
    The city, which has a population of 70,000, has a total area of 204 km2. The city,
    which is part of the Bologna metropolitan area, has frigid winters and sweltering
    summers. The neighborhood in Imola that was chosen is in the city''s historic
    district and is distinguished by its low-rise structures and scant street tree
    canopy coverage (Fig. 11). Download : Download high-res image (689KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 11. The 3-dimensional model of the city includes
    connection routes, buildings, and urban vegetation [134]. The implementation of
    a digital twin in Imola, Italy, aims to enhance urban planning and address walkability
    challenges within the historical contextual 3D replica of Imola''s urban elements
    and objects, enabling city planners and stakeholders to visualize, analyze, and
    optimize various urban planning scenarios. By incorporating multiple data sources
    such as cadastral data, aerial imagery, LiDAR, and socio-economic information,
    the digital twin offers a dynamic representation of the city''s existing conditions.
    As a result of its low tree canopy cover and low-rise building structures, Imola''s
    digital twin focuses on its historical core. This problem is addressed by incorporating
    data on public green nodes, public transportation nodes, and public urban spaces
    into the digital twin. Imola''s city planners can identify potential improvements
    to the pedestrian network by analyzing the connectivity and accessibility of these
    nodes, leading to an increase in walkability and a greater quality of life for
    the city''s residents. Additionally, planners can use the digital twin to evaluate
    the impact of various urban interventions, such as adding green spaces, expanding
    public transportation, or redesigning streets to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists.
    In order to create a more sustainable and livable city, stakeholders can simulate
    these interventions in a digital environment to better understand their potential
    outcomes and make more informed decisions. As shown in Fig. 11, a three-dimensional
    model of the city has been developed, which includes connections, buildings, and
    urban vegetation [134]. The thermal comfort digital twin model presented in this
    study aims to effectively mirror the physical world through a three-step process:
    data collection, learning process and analysis, and post-implementation processes
    and decision-making. This innovative approach allows for an understanding of urban
    microclimates, walkability, and green pedestrian networks, ultimately supporting
    urban planners in making informed decisions. Data collection involves gathering
    a variety of data sources, such as meteorological data, GIS data, remote sensing
    imagery, and socio-economic information. These datasets are crucial for constructing
    a detailed and accurate digital twin that reflects the physical environment and
    its microclimatic conditions. After collecting the necessary data, ML algorithms
    and other analyt- ical tools are employed to process and analyze the information,
    allowing the model to learn patterns and relationships between various factors,
    such as urban morphology, vegetation, and thermal comfort. The outcome is an understanding
    of the factors influencing walkability and green pedestrian net- works within
    the urban context. confirming the digital twin and utilizing it to assist in decision-making
    for urban planning and design is the model''s last stage. The digital twin may
    be improved to incorporate a wide range of data sources and simulations on many
    dimensions and themes by fusing offline microclimate models with real-time data
    sources. 6. Green infrastructure inventory In order to create an inventory of
    local green infrastructure components in the research region, the first step in
    was to identify botanical species and their locations (Fig. 12). The location
    of the urban green infrastructure samples was established in the field using a
    GPS device. The measured points were saved as a KML file for Google Earth. In
    addition to registering the species of each specimen, a unique identification
    number for each item of urban infrastructure was documented in an interoperable
    table using the KML format. The following phase entailed employing engineering
    and mapping techniques to determine the geometric dimensions of the specimens
    under study. By measuring the area (in square meters) of the crown projection
    over the orthophoto image with ArcMap GIS software, the surface area of each tree
    crown was documented (Fig. 12). Using Autodesk Recap software, the dimensions
    of each specimen from the LiDAR point cloud were measured in order to determine
    the specimens'' height (Fig. 12). A list that was obtained had dimensions that
    were quite similar to those of genuine specimens. This 3-dimensional Green Pedestrian
    Network (GPN) digital twin’s first section aims to estimate the Physiological
    Equivalent Temperature (PET). Based on Python 3.8.1 code, a hybrid model is developed
    which simulates each parameter in its own engine. The interrelationships of the
    parameters are programmed as an Python script in order to guarantee accuracy of
    input and output ordering in each phase, as well as the outcome of the model in
    the final step. There are three engines used in the model: EnergyPlus, Grasshopper,
    and OpenFOAM. Imola''s historic center is shown in Fig. 12 [134]. Download : Download

    1) Calculation of the body''s thermal state for a specific set of meteorological
    variables using the Munich Energy-Balance Model for Individuals (MEMI); 2) Entering
    the computed mean skin and core temperatures into the MEMI model and solving the
    energy balance equation system for air temperature with specific parameters (v
    = 0.1 m/s, vapor pressure (VP) = 12 hPa, and mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) =
    Ta) (Table 6). Table 6. Thermal perception ranges of physiological equivalent
    temperatures (PET). PET Thermal Perception Grade of Psychological Stress ≤18 °C
    Very cold High 18 °C − 23 °C Cold Moderate 23 °C − 26 °C Slightly cool Slight
    26 °C − 29 °C Comfortable None 29 °C − 32 °C Slightly warm Slight 32 °C − 38 °C
    Hot Moderate ≥38 °C Very hot High In Table 6, the ranges of the Physiological
    Equivalent Temperature (PET) for different grades of thermal perception by human
    beings and physiological stress on human beings can be classified as follows (with
    internal heat production at 80W and heat transfer resistance of clothing at 0.9
    [135]. Using the MEMI model. As a result of this method, the digital twin can
    accurately calculate the PET values across the urban environment, which will help
    to inform decisions related to improving walkability and establishing green pedestrian
    networks in urban planning and design. 7. Digital twin modeling and real-time
    visualization A real-time link between the virtual digital twin and the real world
    was suggested by Wang et al. [136]. IoT sensors capture data, which is recorded
    in real-time in a database. By evaluating, modeling, and making decisions based
    on real-time data, users may build a virtual representation of the actual world.
    Gao et al. [137] introduced the idea of a digital twin production line based on
    simulation and modeling of the production line and digital twin. The production
    process for the digital twin is then in real-time modeled and simulated. The usefulness
    of the suggested approach is illustrated with an illustration of a product assembly
    line. As part of NASA''s design, operation, and monitoring of airplanes, grieves
    initially put out digital twins in 2011. Scholars have created a large number
    of 3D models of Digital Twin technology. Digital twins were used by Sepasgozar
    et al., [138] to assess the feasibility of combining virtual and actual energy
    in industrial systems. A 3D representation of the digital twin utilizing the EnergyPlus,
    Honeybee, and Ladybug components from the grasshopper framework was recommended
    by Gholami et al. [134] for the Rhinoceros platform. Based on in situ datasets
    that demonstrate its dependability, a digital twin for the GPN is verified. Additionally,
    by giving urban planners and policymakers a precise and helpful approach for modeling
    pedestrian-level urban greenery impacts on human thermal comfort, it assures the
    effectiveness of policies in various urban contexts. Stakeholders can concentrate
    on their individual duties with the aid of the digital twin building system developed
    by Choi et al. [139]. The instances in this essay also concern Korean suppliers
    of car components. The system is simple to use for both major organizations and
    small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). The digital twin may be utilized to
    easily manage the production site in addition to watching CCTV. According to Yang
    et al.''s [140] description, true 3D was achieved by transferring structural and
    semantic geographical elements that facilitate human- machine compatibility and
    real-time perception of the IoT on 3D geographical sceneries. Digital elevation
    models, digital surface models, digital orthophotos, actual orthophotos, oblique
    3D models, and laser point clouds are a few examples of digital representations
    of geographic scenes. The use of scanners to gather data presents a number of
    novel opportunities and difficulties, according to Perc and Topolek [141]. This
    analysis examines the digital development of smart green buildings to generate
    continuous ecological development regions in green ecological cities. The major
    points of Intelligent Green Buildings (IGB) are described in this part, along
    with the use and function of digital twins in intelligent buildings. 8. Discussion
    and potential limitations of digital twins Digital twin modeling and real-time
    visualization as a powerful tool for modeling and simulating physical systems
    in real time, digital twins have gained attention in recent years. Through virtual
    representations of physical systems, data can be analyzed and manipulated in real-time,
    enabling more informed decisions and efficient management. There are, however,
    several limitations and challenges associated with digital twins that need to
    be considered, despite their potential benefits. The accuracy of digital twins
    is one of their potential limitations. A digital twin can only be as accurate
    as the data it is based on, so any errors or inaccuracies in the data will affect
    its accuracy. Any faults or malfunctions in the sensors or technologies used to
    collect data can also affect the accuracy of digital twins. Below is a summary
    of each application’s limitations: 1. Data-driven vs. data science: In order to
    accurately represent complex systems being modeled, data science rather than a
    data- driven approach is needed. 2. Complexity of digital twins: Creating an exact
    digital twin of complex systems, such as life on Earth, weather, climate, and
    human health may be more challenging than creating a simple, static digital twin.
    3. ML limitations: Modern ML models have impressive numbers of parameters, but
    they can''t capture all the interactions and effects, leading to inaccurate predictions.
    4. AI concerns: There is no universal AI, and AI systems are black boxes, which
    raises concerns about their potential harm and the need for meaningful human control.
    5. Optimization challenges: Due to the lack of science to determine the right
    goal function, the concept of optimizing the world is problematic. 6. Data-driven
    society limitations: Intangible qualities are important to human life, but data-driven
    societies may struggle to achieve them. 7. Disruptive innovations: Digital twins
    can make pessimistic predictions that do not take into account disruptive innovations.
    8. Humans vs. things: In a highly networked and complex world, managing people
    like things that pose ethical challenges. 9. Dual-use concerns: In order to prevent
    dual-use and improve transparency and accountability, digital twins, due to their
    powerful nature can cause large-scale damage. 10. Alternative uses of technology:
    The socio-ecological finance system promotes sustainable circular and sharing
    economies as an alternative to traditional technology-driven approaches. 11. Need
    for social innovation: The digital age can be fully tapped by promoting a multi-stakeholder
    approach to participatory resilience through social innovation. Therefore, Complexity
    is an opportunity for new solutions and digital assistance can support flexible
    adaptation and co-evolution, but it is important to recognize that societies are
    not machines, and a narrow optimization approach is not sufficient to manage them.
    9. Conclusion By building on the insights and contributions presented throughout
    the paper, our conclusion underscores the potential transformative impact of combining
    AI with digital twin models in the development of stormwater infrastructure systems
    within smart cities. Besides enabling more efficient resource management, this
    integration contributes to urban resilience and sustainability. Increasingly,
    AI technology is playing an increasingly pivotal role in augmenting digital twin
    models, providing sophisticated solutions to the multifaceted challenges of urban
    stormwater management. The present study reveals the current state and capabilities
    of digital twin technology in urban water systems management based on an review
    of existing literature and enriched by diverse case studies from cities such as
    Helsinki, Zurich, and Vienna. This paper lays a solid foundation for understanding
    how digital twins can be optimized through AI by clarifying terminology, practices,
    and fundamental technologies. The exploration of digital twins in managing smart
    water systems, from short-term forecasting to the enhancement of decentralized
    systems, underscores the critical role AI plays in revolutionizing stormwater
    management within smart urban environments. In addition to demonstrating practical
    applications of digital twins in urban water management, the case studies also
    highlight key research areas where AI can further revolutionize these processes.
    In this study, we examine digital twins’ contributions to green infrastructure
    planning and the pivotal role of real- time data visualization in the creation
    of more sustainable and resilient urban landscapes using AI-enhanced digital twins.
    The purpose of this paper is not only to examine the status of digital twin technology
    and its integration with AI, but also to project its trajectory in the future.
    In spite of the study’s limitations, it identifies crucial implications for future
    research on AI-enhanced digital twin models, particularly in relation to the stormwater
    infrastructure of smart cities. With the development of digital twin technology,
    combined with advances in AI, complex urban challenges can be addressed more effectively.
    We must continue to explore and refine the integration of AI into digital twin
    models in the future to ensure that these technologies can fully realize their
    potential in contributing to smarter, more sustainable urban environments. In
    this endeavor, we can anticipate not only the enhancement of stormwater management
    systems, but also the improvement of urban living conditions in general, a step
    towards the realization of truly smart cities. CRediT authorship contribution

    Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) is a preeminent parameter in agricultural and
    environmental sciences, embodying a fundamental metric for appraising atmospheric
    water demand. Encompassing the amalgamated influences of evaporation from a standardized
    reference surface and transpiration from an idealized crop, ETo is pivotal in
    unravelling the intricacies of water availability and consumption across diverse
    ecosystems. Accurately forecasting reference evapotranspiration is imperative
    for shaping sustainable water management strategies, optimizing irrigation practices,
    and advancing our understanding of hydrological processes on a broader scale (Gocic
    et al. 2015). Reference evapotranspiration incorporates a set of meteorological
    and physical parameters that collectively influence water loss from a given surface.
    Variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation intricately
    contribute to the complex equilibrium governing the transition of liquid water
    into vapour (Yu et al., 2020). A profound understanding of these meteorological
    factors not only facilitates but is also instrumental in the development of robust
    models for accurately forecasting ETo (Chia et al., 2020). The seamless integration
    of such models into scientific inquiries enables the precise quantification of
    water requirements for diverse crops, thereby assisting farmers and land managers
    in making judicious decisions regarding irrigation scheduling and resource allocation.
    Beyond agriculture, accurate forecasting of reference evapotranspiration plays
    a pivotal role in evaluating the overall water balance within ecosystems (Dou
    & Yang, 2018). This parameter serves as a foundational input in hydrological models,
    facilitating the assessment of watershed dynamics, groundwater recharge, and the
    overall resilience of ecosystems to changing climatic conditions. Researchers
    and policymakers rely on ETo predictions to make informed decisions about water
    allocation, land-use planning, and environmental conservation efforts. The landscape
    of models employed to predict future evapotranspiration is characterized by distinct
    categories, each supported by different methodologies and theoretical frameworks.
    Classical empirical models, rooted in historical data and statistical relationships,
    form one category, relying on historical climatic patterns to project future evapotranspiration.
    Physically-based models constitute another category, employing complex mathematical
    representations of evapotranspiration''s physical processes, often integrating
    meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar
    radiation. Recent advancements have witnessed the emergence of hybrid models,
    fusing empirical and physically-based elements, leveraging the strengths of both
    approaches for enhanced predictive accuracy. Furthermore, machine learning (ML)
    models have gained prominence, harnessing computational algorithms to discern
    intricate patterns within vast datasets and adaptively refining predictions (Goyal
    et al., 2023). In recent years, they have found application in research related
    to the evaluation of ETo or actual evapotranspiration (ETa) models, as evidenced
    by several notable studies (Feng et al., 2017, Kisi and Alizamir, 2018, Xu et
    al., 2018, Dou and Yang, 2018, Granata, 2019, Malik et al., 2019, Tikhamarine
    et al., 2019, Zhao et al. 2019, Tikhamarine et al., 2020a, Tikhamarine et al.,
    2020b, Yamaç and Todorovic, 2020, Bai et al., 2021, Aghelpour and Norooz-Valashedi,
    2022, Jia et al., 2023). Until now, the application of ML and deep learning (DL)
    algorithms for short- and medium-term ETo forecasting has been comparatively infrequent.
    Trajkovic et al. (2003) implemented a sequentially adaptive Radial Basis Function
    (RBF) Neural Network to predict ETo in Nis, Serbia. Notably, their prediction
    model did not incorporate exogenous climate variables. In a similar vein, Landeras
    et al. (2009) conducted a comparative analysis between Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANN) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for weekly average
    ETo prediction in the Alava region, Basque Country, Spain. In this research, climatic
    variables were also omitted, with the forecast model relying solely on lagged
    ETo values. Torres et al. (2011) utilized Multivariate Relevance Vector Machine
    (MRVM) and ANN for short-term ETo forecasting in Central Utah. Meanwhile, Luo
    et al. (2015) employed four ANNs for ETo prediction, exclusively incorporating
    predicted temperature data from public weather forecasts. Notably, both studies
    considered only temperature as an exogenous climatic input variable. Chen et al.,
    (2020a) employed three deep learning models, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Temporal
    Convolutional Neural Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network
    (LSTM), to estimate daily ETo in the Northeast Plain of China, characterized by
    a warm temperate zone with continental and monsoon climate characteristics. Subsequently,
    the same authors expanded their work, developing a TCN incorporating Principal
    Component Analysis and Maximal Information Coefficient to predict crop evapotranspiration
    using a two-year dataset from lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation (Chen
    et al., 2020b). At the same time, Ferreira & da Cunha (2020a) harnessed the power
    of LSTM networks, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN), and
    a hybrid CNN-LSTM algorithm. This comparative study, conducted in Minas Gerais,
    a state in South-eastern Brazil characterized by a very warm climate, extended
    the forecasting horizon to multi-step predictions of daily ETo, spanning up to
    seven days. Granata & Di Nunno (2021) developed three predictive models based
    on Deep Learning, utilizing both NARX and LSTM networks, to forecast actual evapotranspiration
    in two distinct climatic zones, with prediction horizons ranging from 1 to 7 days.
    They discovered that LSTM models exhibited greater accuracy than NARX models in
    subtropical climatic conditions. Conversely, NARX models consistently yielded
    more precise results in semi-arid climates. The accuracy of the models was influenced
    by various exogenous variables, with notable impacts from sensible heat flux and
    relative humidity. Additionally, the forecast horizon played a significant role,
    exerting distinct effects in different climatic conditions. Recently, Valipour
    et al. (2023) employed several hybrid models of deep learning and machine learning,
    specifically wavelet long short-term memory (WLSTM), wavelet group method of data
    handling (WGMDH), and wavelet genetic algorithm-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
    system (WGA-ANFIS), for forecasting reference evapotranspiration up to 10 days
    ahead at 30 sites across the United States. They achieved excellent results, with
    an average RMSE across the 30 sites for 1-day ahead forecasts equal to 0.541 mm/day.
    The research conducted so far on the topic of forecasting future daily ETo has
    generally focused on short-term prediction horizons, seldom exceeding 7–15 days,
    consistently revealing a significant decline in accuracy with increasing forecast
    horizon. The primary objective of this study is to overcome this limitation by
    proposing highly accurate ETo prediction models with horizons extending up to
    60 days. To achieve this goal, we aim to introduce two algorithms never before
    employed in ETo prediction: the Correlated Nystrom Views (XNV) and the MLP-RF
    Stacked Model. The performance of these algorithms will be compared with that
    of a model based on RBF, chosen as the benchmark algorithm. As ETo depends on
    numerous meteorological and climatic variables, two distinct variable reduction
    strategies are implemented: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and feature selection
    using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The impact of this predictor
    reduction on predictive accuracy is assessed. The chosen study area for this research
    is one of the most flourishing agricultural production regions in the Mediterranean
    area: the Agro Pontino (Fig. 1), located in Central-Southern Lazio, Italy. The
    decision to focus on one of the key sites in Southern Europe for the production
    of fruits and vegetables adds even greater practical relevance to the study. Download

    Location of the selected cell in the Lazio territory. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Study area and dataset The Agro Pontino, located in the Lazio region, central
    Italy, is a distinctive agricultural area characterized by flat plains and reclaimed
    marshlands. Historically, this region was a malarial swamp until ambitious drainage
    projects in the 1930s transformed it into fertile agricultural land. Geographically,
    the Agro Pontino is marked by expansive plains that stretch between the Tyrrhenian
    Sea and the foothills of the Apennine Mountains. Rich, alluvial soils support
    a diverse range of crops, contributing to the area’s agricultural significance.
    The climate is typically Mediterranean, characterized by hot, dry summers and
    mild, wet winters (Cioffi et al., 2017). This climate pattern, coupled with the
    fertile soils, makes the Agro Pontino conducive to a variety of agricultural activities.
    Agriculture in the Agro Pontino thrives with the cultivation of cereals, vegetables,
    and fruits. Olive orchards and vineyards dot the landscape, producing high-quality
    olive oil and wine. Livestock farming also contributes to the region''s vibrant
    agricultural economy. Consequently, a proper prediction of ETo in the Agro Pontino
    region is crucial due to its direct impact on water management and agricultural
    productivity. ETo influences the water needs of crops, and accurate predictions
    aid farmers in optimizing irrigation practices, ensuring efficient water use.
    Given the region''s historical transformation from marshland to arable land, understanding
    evapotranspiration dynamics becomes paramount for sustainable agricultural practices.
    Effective management of this process contributes to the resilience of crops, particularly
    in the face of the Agro Pontino''s Mediterranean climate, characterized by distinct
    seasons, further emphasizing the significance of precise evapotranspiration forecasts
    in promoting agricultural sustainability. The current study relies on the MADIA
    (Meteorological variables for Agriculture: daily time series for the Italian Area,
    (Parisse et al., 2023) gridded dataset. This dataset provides the times series
    of the main agro-meteorological variables derived from ERA5 hourly surface data,
    with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees, for the period 1981–2022. The dataset
    contains the daily time series of minimum (Tmin), average (Tmean) and maximum
    (Tmax) air temperature, minimum (RHmin) and maximum (RHmax) air relative humidity,
    wind speed at the height of 10 m above the surface of the Earth (WS10), solar
    radiation downwards (shortwave radiation, Rs), precipitation (P) and ETo computed
    based on the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998). The selected cell,
    located near the Tyrrhenian Sea, encompasses the city of Latina and a vast area
    characterized by intensive cultivation. Fig. 2 presents the monthly mean values
    of meteorological variables for the selected cell. Air temperature, Rs and ETo
    exhibit a consistent pattern, showcasing higher values in summer and lower values
    in winter. Conversely, RH, WS10, and P demonstrate an opposite trend, featuring
    higher values in winter and lower values in summer. This seasonal variation underscores
    the dynamic interplay of climatic factors, with air temperature and solar radiation
    peaking during warmer months while relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation
    reach their peak in the cooler winter period. Download : Download high-res image

    meteorological variables. 2.2. Principal Component analysis PCA is a powerful
    statistical method widely employed for multivariate data analysis and dimensionality
    reduction. Originating from the seminal work of Pearson (1901) and subsequently
    refined by Hotelling (1933), PCA has become a cornerstone technique in various
    scientific disciplines. At its core, PCA seeks to transform a high-dimensional
    dataset into a new coordinate system, capturing the maximum variance along its
    principal components. The first step involves the computation of the covariance
    matrix for the given dataset, expressing the relationships between variables.
    The subsequent stage entails the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix,
    yielding a set of eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues. These eigenvectors
    constitute the principal components, defining the directions in which the data
    exhibits the maximum variance. The eigenvalues quantify the amount of variance
    explained by each principal component, aiding in the selection of relevant components
    for dimensionality reduction. Following data standardization to ensure comparability,
    the PCA algorithm involves selecting the top k eigenvectors corresponding to the
    k largest eigenvalues. This selection forms the basis for a new subspace onto
    which the original data is projected, effectively reducing its dimensionality.
    For the problem under consideration (Zhao et al., 2021), given all the input variables,
    namely: Tmin, Tmax, Tmean, RHmin, RHmax, WS10, Rs, P, the correlation matrix is
    shown in the following Table 1. Table 1. Correlation matrix. Empty Cell Tmin Tmax

    Swarm optimization Within the domain of regression problems, delineated by datasets
    where Xi denotes feature vectors and yi are the target values, the fundamental
    objective is to distil a subset of features S from the original set that significantly
    contributes to the regression model’s efficacy. Inspired by collective behaviour
    in nature, PSO (Kennedy & Eberhart, 1995) operates as a population-based optimization
    algorithm. In the context of feature selection for regression, PSO unfolds through
    pivotal mechanisms: - Particle Representation: Each particle in the swarm encapsulates
    a potential feature subset where k ≤ m. The binary status of feature inclusion
    (1) or exclusion (0) is encoded in the particle’s position Xi. - Objective Function:
    The fitness or objective function f(Xi) evaluates the regression model''s performance
    using the selected features, typically gauged through regression-specific metrics
    such as root mean squared error (RMSE). - Velocity and Position Update: Particles
    iteratively refine positions based on historical best positions and the global
    best position. The velocity update equation is expressed as (1) incorporating
    inertia weight w, acceleration coefficients c1 and c2, and random values r1 and
    r2. The PSO algorithm iteratively hones feature subsets until a convergence criterion
    is met, be it a predetermined number of iterations or the satisfactory convergence
    of fitness values, signifying stability in the selected feature subset. The features
    selected here through the PSO are as follows: Tmean, RHmax, Rs. 2.4. Radial basis
    function Neural network (RBF-NN) The RBF-NN (Park & Sandberg, 1991) is structured
    as a three-layered feedforward network comprising an input layer, a hidden layer,
    and an output layer. The transformative power of the hidden layer is realized
    through radial basis functions, which project the input data into a higher-dimensional
    space, thereby facilitating the regression task. The radial basis function, a
    mathematical function centered at a specific point, exhibits an exponential decay
    as the distance from the center increases. The initialization of the Gaussian
    radial basis functions involves utilising the K-Means algorithm to identify optimal
    centers. The Gaussian function stands out as the predominant radial basis function,
    serving as the activation function for the hidden layer. The output layer of the
    RBF neural network is typically characterized by a linear combination of the activations
    from the hidden layer, with weights determined through either a least-squares
    approach or gradient descent. Notably, the RBF-NN distinguishes itself by necessitating
    a reduced volume of training data compared to other neural networks. This advantage
    arises from the feature extraction capabilities of the hidden layer, which effectively
    reduces the dimensionality of the input data. Furthermore, the RBF-NN exhibits
    a diminished susceptibility to overfitting, a phenomenon where a model becomes
    excessively intricate, fitting the training data meticulously but faltering in
    generalization to new data. 2.5. Correlated Nystrom views (XNV) The XNV algorithm
    (McWilliams et al., 2013) is a rapid semi-supervised solution for regression and
    classification tasks, effectively addressing the challenges posed by extensive
    datasets and the resource-intensive nature of acquiring labelled data. XNV is
    grounded in two pivotal concepts: the generation of two distinct views featuring
    computationally efficient random features and the incorporation of Canonical Correlation
    Analysis (CCA) for multiview regression on unlabeled data to bias regression towards
    valuable features. Motivated by the computational costs inherent in handling large
    datasets, XNV offers an appealing alternative to kernel methods by harnessing
    the power of randomization. It delivers comparable generalization performance
    while substantially reducing computational costs, strategically targeting the
    intricate task of obtaining labelled data for expansive datasets. The algorithm
    unfolds in a systematic two-step manner. Initially, it meticulously constructs
    two views using random features, applying the Nystrom method. Subsequently, Canonical
    Correlation Analysis is employed to bias the optimization procedure, with the
    aim of minimizing variance without a significant increase in bias, particularly
    effective when both views contain accurate estimators. At its essence, the Nystrom
    method is designed to approximate kernel matrices, foundational to kernel methods,
    through an adept low-rank factorization strategy. Given the cubic computational
    complexity associated with exact kernel computations on extensive datasets, the
    efficiency of the Nystrom method becomes increasingly indispensable. The method
    begins by selecting a subset, referred to as the “landmark set”, from the entire
    dataset. The kernel matrix is then computed solely for these selected landmarks,
    resulting in a substantial reduction in computational burden. The subsequent low-rank
    approximation is achieved by considering the cross-covariance between the entire
    dataset and the landmark set. Then, CCA plays a key role in revealing latent relationships
    between paired sets of variables and enhancing predictive modelling when confronted
    with data characterized by multiple perspectives or “views”. The basic principle
    of CCA involves identifying linear combinations of variables within each view,
    termed canonical variables, maximizing the correlation between the views. In the
    field of multiview regression, where disparate yet potentially complementary information
    is available, CCA becomes instrumental in integrating these views for enhanced
    predictive performance. CCA optimization aims to maximize the correlation between
    canonical variables, effectively capturing shared information between views. This
    emphasis on correlation aligns with the intuition that, in multiview scenarios,
    variables across views may exhibit interconnected patterns, and exploiting such
    correlations enhances the predictive utility of the model. 2.6. Multilayer Perceptron-Random
    Forest (MLP-RF) Stacked model The Stacked Model integrates MLP, RF, and Elastic
    Net (EN) as its constituent model elements. The initial stage involves training
    the base models, MLP and RF, on the same dataset. Subsequently, the meta-learner
    EN utilizes the predictions generated by these base models as input features,
    steering the ensemble model toward its final output. MLP (Murtagh, 1991), a prominent
    artificial neural network in supervised learning, features a layered architecture
    comprised of interconnected nodes or neurons. These layers process input data
    through a hierarchical series of transformations, culminating in the generation
    of predictions. The structural framework of MLP follows a specific pattern: the
    input layer receives raw data and transmits it to the initial hidden layer, where
    a sequence of nonlinear transformations occurs. Output from each hidden layer
    is successively forwarded to subsequent layers until the final prediction emerges
    from the output layer. Within each layer, adjustable weights and biases undergo
    refinement during training to optimize network performance. The training of MLP
    networks is commonly carried out by the backpropagation algorithm, a ubiquitous
    method in supervised learning. Backpropagation iteratively adjusts weights and
    biases to minimize the deviation between predicted and actual outputs. During
    the training process, the network is exposed to input data and corresponding target
    outputs. Subsequently, network predictions are compared to targets using a loss
    function. Gradients of the loss function with respect to network weights and biases
    are computed and utilized to update these parameters through the gradient descent
    algorithm. However, MLPs are not without drawbacks. In particular, they show a
    predisposition to overfitting of training data, and challenges arise when training
    deep networks with multiple layers because of the vanishing gradient problem.
    The RF algorithm (Breiman, 2001) is a sophisticated ensemble forecasting technique
    that amalgamates multiple individual regression trees, culminating in a coherent
    prediction for the target variable. The compositional structure of each regression
    tree encompasses a root node containing the training dataset, internal nodes establishing
    conditions on input variables, and leaves denoting the assigned real values for
    the target variable. The process of constructing a regression tree involves a
    stepwise partitioning of the input dataset into subsets, where each subset undergoes
    the application of a multivariable linear regression model to generate predictions.
    The iterative progression of the tree is marked by the continual division of each
    branch into smaller partitions, facilitated by the evaluation of all potential
    subdivisions within each field. At each iterative step, the subdivision minimizing
    the least-squared deviation is selected. The least-squared deviation is evaluated
    using the formula: (2) where N(t) denotes the number of units in the node, yi
    denotes the value of the target variable in the i-th unit, and ym represents the
    average value of the target variable in node t. R(t) is an estimator for the impurity
    in each node, and the iterative tree-building process persists until the minimum
    impurity is achieved or another predetermined stopping criterion is met. A pruning
    procedure is implemented to counteract potential overfitting. In essence, the
    RF algorithm encapsulates a dynamic and adaptive approach, harnessing the collective
    predictive power of individual regression trees. The utilization of multiple trees,
    each contributing its unique perspective, enriches the predictive capacity of
    the ensemble model, fostering robustness and resilience against overfitting. The
    EN algorithm (Zou & Hastie, 2005) is a prominent tool in machine learning for
    regression analysis. Distinguished by its seamless integration of two fundamental
    regression techniques—Lasso and Ridge regression—the EN algorithm emerges as a
    sophisticated solution, addressing the limitations inherent in its parent methods
    and providing a robust approach for handling high-dimensional data. Lasso regression
    introduces a penalty term into the loss function of the linear regression model.
    This penalty term, expressed as the L1 norm of the coefficient vector, induces
    the shrinkage of certain coefficients to zero, thereby facilitating feature selection.
    However, Lasso encounters challenges when confronted with correlated predictors,
    often selecting only one variable from a group of correlated ones. In contrast,
    Ridge regression introduces a penalty term into the loss function proportional
    to the square of the L2 norm of the coefficient vector. While it shrinks all coefficients
    towards zero, it does not reduce them exactly to zero. Ridge regression handles
    correlated predictors more effectively than Lasso but does not perform feature
    selection, thereby posing the risk of overfitting. The advantage of the EN algorithm
    lies in its fusion of L1 and L2 penalties into a unified term, harnessing the
    strengths of both methods. This unique amalgamation empowers EN to adeptly manage
    correlated predictors and execute feature selection. The regularization strength
    of EN can be finely tuned by adjusting the hyperparameter alpha, allowing control
    over the relative influence of the L1 and L2 penalties. EN proves particularly
    advantageous for datasets with numerous features and a relatively modest number
    of observations. 2.7. Evaluation metrics The accuracy of the forecast models was
    assessed using three distinct evaluation metrics: Kling Gupta Efficiency (KGE),
    RMSE, and Mean Percentage Absolute Error (MAPE). KGE is commonly employed for
    assessing the accuracy of predictive models in hydrological and hydro-meteorological
    studies due to its comprehensive evaluation capabilities and robustness. This
    metric integrates three fundamental statistical measures: Pearson correlation
    coefficient, variance discrepancy, and mean discrepancy, providing a holistic
    assessment of the model’s performance. RMSE quantifies the average magnitude of
    the errors between predicted and observed values by calculating the square root
    of the average squared differences between predicted and observed values, emphasizing
    larger errors due to its squared nature. MAPE measures the average percentage
    difference between predicted and observed values, providing insight into the magnitude
    of errors relative to the actual values by calculating the absolute percentage
    difference for each prediction and averaging these values across all predictions,
    expressing the result as a percentage. Overall, these three metrics provide an
    effective comprehensive evaluation of the model’s accuracy. In addition, the distribution
    of the Relative Error (RE) has been analyzed. Table 4 provides a comprehensive
    description of the evaluation metrics along with their corresponding equations.
    Table 4. Evaluation metrics. Kling Gupta Efficiency Assesses the overall accuracy
    of a model''s predictions, taking into account the correlation, bias, and variability
    between actual and predicted values in hydrological simulations. It provides a
    comprehensive measure of the model''s ability to capture key characteristics of
    the observed hydrograph, including timing, shape, and magnitude. Range: -∞ – 1,
    with higher values indicating more accurate models. (3) Root Mean Square Error

    lower values indicating more accurate models. (4) Mean Absolute Percentage Error
    The relative error between the predicted and actual ETo, normalized by the number
    of samples. Range: 0 – ∞, with lower values indicating more accurate models. (5)

    between actual and predicted reference evapotranspiration,  = standard deviation
    of the predicted reference evapotranspiration,  = standard deviation of the actual
    reference evapotranspiration, n = number of data vectors. 2.8. Model development
    To achieve a multi-step ahead prediction of ETo, the predictors include some lagged
    values of ETo, in addition to the current day''s ETo and exogenous climatic variables.
    Notably, for the sake of simplifying and expediting model development, lagged
    values of climatic variables were excluded from the input variables. It is crucial
    to emphasize that, despite this exclusion, the lagged values of ETo implicitly
    encompass these climatic variables. The optimal number of lagged values, denoted
    as n, and the hyperparameters of the models were determined through a Bayesian
    Optimization (BO) procedure. Bayesian optimization is a powerful method for optimizing
    functions that pose challenges in evaluation and incur significant costs. This
    approach adopts a sequential model-based strategy, leveraging a probabilistic
    model to grasp the characteristics of the function under optimization. As fresh
    data points emerge, the model undergoes progressive refinement via Bayesian inference,
    assimilating prior knowledge about the function and uncertainties surrounding
    the model. This algorithm adeptly navigates between exploring new territories
    within the search space and exploiting areas likely to yield optimal performance.
    Consequently, it uncovers the global optimum with fewer objective function evaluations
    compared to alternative optimization techniques. While a detailed procedure description
    is omitted here for brevity, interested readers can delve into essential literature
    for deeper insights (e.g., Snoek et al., 2012). In this study, the Root Mean Square
    Error (RMSE) was selected as the metric to be minimized. The multi-step ahead
    forecast was executed using a hybrid direct-recursive procedure. In this approach,
    a distinct model is formulated for each time step to be predicted. However, each
    model utilizes predictions from prior time steps as new lagged ETo values to forecast
    future ETo values. Given the unknown nature of future values during the forecasting
    process, the previously predicted values serve as a reasonable estimate for the
    actual values. The models were trained using 70 % of the time series data spanning
    from January 1, 1981, to May 26, 2010, while the remaining 30 % was reserved for
    testing, covering the period from May 27, 2010, to December 31, 2022. A preliminary
    analysis revealed that this partitioning led to optimal results, while further
    increasing the size of the training set did not yield any significant improvements
    in model accuracy. Recognizing the temporal essence of the prediction challenge,
    it was imperative to maintain temporal coherence within the training intervals.
    To ensure comparability and consistency, the data inputs were normalized using
    the following equation: (7) where xt, xmin, and xmax are, respectively, the values
    of the variable x at time t, the minimum value, and the maximum value. 3. Results
    Table 5 displays the evaluation metrics, with reference to the testing phase,
    for various forecasting horizons, different combinations of input variables, and
    various considered algorithms. As an illustrative example, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 delineate
    the comparison between forecasted and actual ETo values for all analyzed combinations
    of input variables and across all considered algorithms, corresponding to forecasting
    horizons of 7 days and 60 days, respectively. Fig. 5, conversely, depicts the
    time series of predicted and actual ETo values pertaining to models that incorporate
    all exogenous input variables with a forecasting horizon of 30 days. Table 5.

    All input variables. With reference to the 7-day forecasting horizon, models incorporating
    all input variables significantly outperformed both attribute-based models obtained
    from PCA and those based on features selected through PSO. Regarding algorithms,
    the MLP-RF Stacked Model demonstrated markedly higher accuracy than RBF, which,
    in turn, outperformed XNV when considering all variables. For models based on
    PCA attribute or PSO-selected features, XNV exhibited lower values in both RMSE
    and MAPE compared to RBF. Furthermore, the MLP-RF Stacked Model based on all input
    variables achieved excellent evaluation metric values, specifically KGE = 0.998,
    RMSE = 0.0904 mm/day, and MAPE = 3.97 %. Extending the forecasting horizon to
    14 days has revealed a modest decrease in predictive accuracy. The MLP-RF Stacked
    Model has once again demonstrated itself to be the most accurate algorithm for
    all combinations of input variables, clearly outperforming XNV. In turn, XNV exhibited
    lower forecasting errors compared to RBF but also generally lower values of KGE.
    Regarding models based on all input variables, KGE has undergone nearly negligible
    deteriorations, within the range of 0.1 % to 0.43 %, while the increase in RMSE
    has ranged from 3 % to 12.7 %, and that of MAPE from 3.98 % to 7.28 %. The MLP-RF
    Stacked Model experienced the highest percentage increase in RMSE, whereas XNV
    exhibited the highest percentage increase in MAPE. As for models based on attributes
    defined through PCA, KGE has experienced deteriorations within the range of 0.1
    % to 0.76 %, RMSE has incurred deteriorations ranging from 1.55 % to 4.84 %, while
    the increase in MAPE has fallen within the range of 3.31 % to 10.20 %. The highest
    percentage increase in RMSE was computed for RBF, whereas XNV exhibited the highest
    percentage increase in MAPE. Regarding models based on features selected through
    PSO, KGE has undergone reductions within the range of 0.21 % to 0.73 %, while
    increases in RMSE have been calculated within the range of 3.40 % to 27.83 %.
    For MAPE, increments have been observed within the range of 4.34 % to 16.74 %.
    The Stacked Model exhibited the highest percentage increases in both RMSE and
    MAPE. However, it has consistently demonstrated itself as the most accurate forecasting
    algorithm among the three considered, even for the 14-day forecasting horizon.
    On the other hand, both RBF and XNV have demonstrated less sensitivity to the
    reduction in the number of input variables. Extending the forecasting horizon
    to 30 days has resulted in only minimal reductions in accuracy compared to the
    14-day forecasts. Models incorporating all input variables still exhibit excellent
    metric values, particularly the MLP-RF Stacked Model (KGE = 0.997, RMSE = 0.1023
    mm/day, MAPE = 4.16 %), outperforming RBF, which in turn outperformed XNV. As
    observed in the predictive horizons of 7 and 14 days, in the case of the 30-day
    forecasting horizon, the model incorporating all input variables distinctly outperforms,
    under identical algorithms, those based on PCA attributes and features selected
    through PSO. Nevertheless, the latter approaches still yield highly accurate predictions.
    Furthermore, transitioning from 14-day to 30-day forecasts, models incorporating
    all variables experienced a negligible reduction in KGE, an increase in RMSE within
    the range of 0.39–0.75 %, and an increase in MAPE within the range of 0.87–2.48
    %. For models based on PCA-defined attributes, a reduction in KGE within the range
    of 0.1–0.33 %, an increase in RMSE within the range of 0.32–1.89 %, and an increase
    in MAPE within the range of 1.07–3.25 % were observed. Lastly, for models based
    on the limited set of variables identified through PSO, the reduction in KGE fell
    within the range of 0.1–0.31 %, the increase in RMSE ranged from 1.63 % to 2.24
    %, while the increase in MAPE ranged from 2.63 % to 3.53 %. The MLP-RF Stacked
    Model exhibited the least reduction in accuracy compared to models incorporating
    all input variables and those based on attributes defined by PCA. Similarly, XNV
    demonstrated the least decrease in accuracy among models based on the limited
    set of features selected through PSO. Finally, concerning the forecast horizon
    extending to 60 days ahead, the accuracy of the models was only marginally lower
    than that associated with the 30-day forecasts. All considered models provided
    exceptionally accurate predictions, with the most precise values achieved through
    the MLP-RF Stacked Model trained with all input variables (KGE = 0.997, RMSE =
    0.103 mm/day, MAPE = 4.18 %). A direct and immediate comparison of the accuracies
    of different algorithms for each input variable scenario and for each forecasting
    horizon can also be achieved through Taylor diagrams, as proposed in Fig. 6. Taylor
    diagrams were formulated by leveraging the geometric interplay among the correlation
    coefficient (r), standard deviation, and RMSE (usually indicated as Root Mean
    Square Differences, RMSD, in the Taylor diagrams analysis). The Taylor diagrams
    accentuate the precision and effectiveness of the examined models in comparison
    to the observed values. Owing to its efficacy, the Taylor diagram has garnered
    extensive adoption in hydrological investigations (Pham et al., 2022). Download

    diagrams for all models and forecast horizons. The analysis of Taylor diagrams
    confirmed what was already observed from the evaluation metrics analysis, with
    the MLP-RF Stacked Model emerging as the most accurate algorithm in all investigated
    circumstances. Conversely, RBF and XNV yielded comparable results in most cases,
    with XNV being preferable in scenarios with a reduced number of input variables
    selected through PSO. Additional insight into the accuracy of the models here
    developed was gained through an examination of the combined violin-box plots depicted
    in Fig. 7. These plots illustrate the Relative Error of various models across
    different forecasting horizons. Download : Download high-res image (716KB) Download

    in all models considered and for all forecast horizons. In particular, from Fig.
    7a, pertaining to models that incorporate all input variables, it is evident that
    the MLP-RF Stacked Model exhibited a negligible bias and the smallest Interquartile
    Range (IQR) values, characterized by a negligible increase with the forecasting
    horizon. Slightly higher IQRs were observed in the case of RBF, which also displayed
    a slight bias and a smaller number of outliers. XNV, on the other hand, exhibited
    a noticeably more pronounced bias, along with the highest IQR values, increasing
    with the forecasting horizon. Across all algorithms, the majority of outliers
    were positive (overestimation), primarily affecting lower ETo values. From Fig.
    7b, pertaining to models based on attributes obtained through PCA, it is evident
    that the MLP-RF Stacked Model, as observed in the analysis of other evaluation
    metrics, was markedly the most accurate. It exhibited nearly negligible biases
    and IQR values that were quite small and comparable to those obtained in the case
    of models incorporating all input variables. In this context, RBF and XNV demonstrated
    fairly similar performances, with RBF characterized by slightly lower bias and
    IQR values but also featuring a more significant number of outliers, both positive
    and negative. Fig. 7c, pertaining to models that need as inputs only Tmean, RHmax,
    and Rs, reveals that in this case, XNV demonstrated predictive accuracy slightly
    below that of the MLP-RF Stacked Model, with comparable bias values and slightly
    higher IQR values. XNV significantly outperformed RBF, which, in turn, exhibited
    higher bias and IQR values. 4. Discussion The outcomes analyzed in the previous
    section reveal that the three algorithms under consideration facilitate the development
    of highly accurate predictive models for medium-term forecasting horizons, even
    when accounting solely for limited climatic variables such as Tmean, RHmax, and
    Rs. This achievement is made possible by the availability of an exceptionally
    extensive training dataset, encompassing a very long time series of all relevant
    variables. Furthermore, the predictability is enhanced by the cyclic nature of
    the climatic parameter ETo. The elevated predictive performance is chiefly ensured
    by the MLP-RF Stacked Model but is also observed in the case of RBF and XNV. The
    overwhelming majority of studies assessing evapotranspiration through machine
    learning models based on a limited number of climatic variables focus on estimating
    the current value (e.g., Laaboudi et al., 2012, Wen et al., 2015, Granata, 2019;
    Chen et al., 2020; Ferreira and Da Cunha, 2020b; Sharma et al., 2022). However,
    the literature also presents examples of studies aimed at predicting future values,
    which can serve as benchmarks for the results obtained here. Torres et al. (2011)
    employed models based on a Multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (MVRVM) or MLP
    to forecast ETo in Central Utah with a forecasting horizon ranging from 1 to 7
    days. For the 7-day predictions, they achieved a minimum RMSE of 0.85 mm/day,
    a value significantly higher than the one obtained in this study. It is noteworthy
    that the authors considered 7 or 10 past values of ETo and air temperature as
    the sole exogenous variables in their input parameters. Traore et al. (2016) employed
    four distinct Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for forecasting up to 15
    days of ETo in irrigated areas near Dallas, Texas, USA. The authors considered
    three sets of input combinations drawn from Tmin, Tmax, Rs, and extraterrestrial
    solar radiation (Ra), achieving optimal results with the MLP algorithm. This algorithm
    resulted in a mean square error of 0.770 mm/day, significantly higher than the
    errors estimated for the algorithms utilized in this study. Ferreira & Da Cunha
    (2020a) employed models based on LSTM, 1D CNN, and a combination of the two algorithms,
    along with more traditional machine learning algorithms such as ANN and RF, for
    forecasting daily ETo up to 7 days in various regions of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
    Considering different combinations of input variables, the most comprehensive
    of which included a number of lagged values of ETo and climatic variables such
    as Tmax, Tmin, RHmax, RHmin, WS10, net solar radiation (RN), and Ra, the authors
    obtained an average RMSE value of 0.88 mm/day, significantly higher than that
    achieved in the present study. Mandal & Chanda (2023) employed six distinct machine
    learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multivariate Adaptive
    Regression Splines (MARS), RF, MLP, 1D CNN, and LSTM, for forecasting ETo up to
    28 days ahead across various agroclimatic zones of India. Similar to the present
    study, these authors utilized ERA5 data and obtained results exhibiting accuracy
    comparable to or slightly lower than those reported in the current investigation.
    Additionally, these authors observed a modest decline in accuracy with the extension
    of the forecasting horizon, consistent with the findings presented herein. The
    MLP-RF Stacked Model employed in this study, recently successful in forecasting
    streamflow (Granata et al., 2022), soil water content (Granata et al. 2023), lake
    water temperature (Di Nunno et al., 2023a), and groundwater levels (Di Nunno et
    al., 2023b), reaffirms itself as a highly effective predictive tool for hydrological
    variables, including ETo. On the other hand, a Stacked Model is a specific type
    of ensemble model, a category of ML models that have already proven effective
    in the multi-step ahead prediction of ETo (Nourani et al., 2020). Stacked machine
    learning models combine predictions from diverse base learners via a meta-learner,
    capitalizing on their individual strengths to enhance predictive accuracy. Their
    versatility allows for the integration of domain knowledge and feature engineering,
    facilitating the capture of intricate data patterns. However, their implementation
    entails challenges, including heightened complexity, computational demands, and
    vulnerability to overfitting if not judiciously regularized. On the other hand,
    the XNV algorithm, unused so far in hydrological applications, is distinguished
    by its ability to efficiently handle high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships,
    making it particularly well-suited for complex pattern recognition tasks. Additionally,
    the algorithm is known for its robustness to noisy data and its capability to
    provide interpretable models, aiding in the understanding of underlying data patterns.
    These features make it an effective alternative to many better-known and commonly
    used algorithms. There is no shortage of negative features, primarily the high
    sensitivity to the choice of hyperparameters. Feature selection procedures confirm
    their crucial role in improving the interpretability of predictive models in machine
    learning while retaining high efficiency and accuracy. Their foremost advantage
    lies in the capability of reducing the dimensionality of datasets while retaining
    essential information. By transforming correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated
    components, PCA simplifies the computational burden and enhances model interpretability,
    facilitating better insights into underlying patterns. Moreover, PCA aids in identifying
    latent features that contribute most significantly to variance, thereby mitigating
    the risk of overfitting. However, PCA also presents drawbacks. One notable limitation
    is the assumption of linearity, which may not hold true for complex, nonlinear
    relationships inherent in many real-world datasets. Consequently, PCA might inadequately
    capture the intrinsic structure of the data, leading to suboptimal performance
    in predictive tasks. Furthermore, PCA operates under the assumption of Gaussian
    distributions, which might not be applicable in all scenarios, potentially compromising
    its efficacy in capturing the true underlying data distribution. PSO efficiently
    explores the feature space, adapting dynamically to find optimal subsets and avoiding
    local optima. PSO’s flexibility in defining objective functions tailored to ETo
    modeling objectives enhances its utility. However, challenges may arise in noisy
    or redundant feature scenarios, requiring careful parameter tuning. It is noteworthy
    to observe that the use of PSO has underscored the significance of the exogenous
    variable relative humidity in multi-step ahead forecasts of ETo. This finding
    is consistent with recent results obtained by Elzain et al. (2024). In many cases,
    a reduction in variables is also expected to lead to an improvement in model accuracy.
    This could occur when the overall set of input variables does not adequately represent
    the studied phenomenon, or in cases of overfitting. However, these scenarios did
    not impact the study conducted here. The forecasting models presented can bring
    about numerous tangible benefits, particularly for irrigation service managers
    and the farming community. Accurate ETo prediction models provide a basis for
    precise irrigation scheduling, enabling farmers to align water application with
    the actual water demand of crops. This optimization minimizes water wastage, reduces
    energy consumption, and contributes to the conservation of water resources. Precision
    irrigation, guided by ETo models, ensures that crops receive the optimal amount
    of water needed for their growth stages. This targeted approach promotes higher
    crop yields, improved quality, and ultimately contributes to increased agricultural
    productivity. Accurate ETo models facilitate the judicious use of water resources,
    contributing to overall resource conservation. By avoiding over-irrigation, farmers
    can reduce runoff, leaching, and nutrient loss, thereby promoting environmental
    sustainability. Precision agriculture allows for the efficient use of inputs such
    as water, fertilizers, and energy. This targeted resource allocation minimizes
    unnecessary costs, making agriculture more economically viable for farmers. In
    addition, in the face of climate variability, precise ETo models provide a valuable
    tool for adapting irrigation practices to changing conditions. This adaptability
    is essential for mitigating the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity.
    In light of the foregoing discussion, the ETo prediction emerges as a cornerstone
    in scientific pursuits related to water management, agriculture, and environmental
    sustainability. Accurate forecasts of ETo empower stakeholders to implement proactive
    measures that enhance resource efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and contribute
    to the resilience of ecosystems in the face of evolving climatic patterns. As
    we navigate the challenges of a changing world, the meticulous consideration of
    ETo remains an invaluable tool in our quest for sustainable and responsible water
    stewardship. The primary limitation of this study lies in its focus on a singular
    study area characterized by a typical Mediterranean climate. The predictive accuracy
    may be adversely influenced by conditions marked by broader and irregular fluctuations
    in climatic variables. This aspect will be investigated in future research endeavours,
    which will also be directed towards exploring the effectiveness of the introduced
    models for long-term forecasting horizons. 5. Conclusions This study is grounded
    in the application of two innovative algorithms, the MLP-RF Stacked Model and
    the XNV, to forecast ETo up to a medium-term forecast horizon of 60 days in Agro
    Pontino. Situated in Central Italy, Agro Pontino is renowned for its vibrant agricultural
    production within the broader Mediterranean Europe. A third algorithm, the RBF-NN,
    was employed as a benchmark. Three distinct sets of input variables were considered.
    The key findings are as follows: - The models based on the complete set of exogenous
    climatic variables have proven to be the most accurate. Nevertheless, even those
    requiring only mean temperature, maximum relative humidity, and shortwave solar
    radiation as input have yielded very good results, even with regard to 60-day
    forecasting horizons. - The models based on MLP-RF Stacked Model have outperformed
    those based on XNV and RBF for all combinations of input variables and forecasting
    horizons. XNV outperformed RBF when considering only mean temperature, maximum
    humidity, and shortwave solar radiation as exogenous input variables. - The reduction
    in accuracy with the extension of the forecasting horizon is notably mild. This
    circumstance suggests the possibility of achieving accurate results even for significantly
    longer forecasting horizons with the developed models. The presented forecasting
    models offer significant advantages for irrigation management and agriculture.
    Accurate ETo predictions enable precise irrigation scheduling, reducing water
    wastage, and conserving resources. This targeted approach enhances crop yields,
    quality, and environmental sustainability, making agriculture more economically
    viable and adaptable to climate variability. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: Irrigation is the most significant consumer of freshwater worldwide.
    Deciding on the right amount of irrigation is crucial for sustainable water management
    and food production. The Penman-Monteith (P-M) reference crop evapotranspiration
    (ETO) is the gold standard in irrigation management and scheduling; however, its
    calculation requires measurements from multiple sensors over an extended reference
    grass surface. The cost of land, sensors, maintenance, and water to keep the grass
    surface green impedes having a dense network of ETO stations. To solve this challenge,
    this research aims to develop an input-limited ETO estimation approach based on
    historical weather data and machine learning (ML) algorithms to relax the need
    for a reference grass surface. This approach, called “SolarET,” takes solar radiation
    (RS) data as its sole input. RS is the only meteorological driving factor of ETO
    that does not rely on the measuring surface. To test the generalizability of SolarET,
    we test its performance over unseen arbitrary locations across California. California
    is chosen as the case study since it is one of the world's most hydrologically
    altered and agriculturally productive regions. In total, 19,088,736 hourly data
    samples from 131 automated weather stations have been used in this study. The
    ML models have been trained over 114 stations and tested over 17 unseen stations,
    each representing a California climatic zone. Our findings point to the superiority
    of decision tree-based algorithms versus neural networks. SolarET works best in
    irrigation-oriented regions of California (e.g., Central Valley) and is less accurate
    in coastal and desert zones. Our results demonstrate the higher accuracy of SolarET
    using hourly (RMSE = 0.93 mm/day) and daily (RMSE = 0.97 mm/day) RS data in comparison
    to well-known empirical alternatives like Priestley-Taylor (PT) (RMSE = 1.35 mm/day)
    and Hargreaves-Samani (HS) (RMSE = 2.69 mm/day).

    1. Introduction Irrigation is considered the most significant anthropogenic alternation
    to the natural hydrological cycle, accounting for about 70% of the global freshwater
    withdrawal (Siebert et al., 2010, Foley et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2022). Population
    growth and economic development require increasing food production in the future,
    and expanding sustainable irrigation is essential to satisfy this burgeoning demand
    (Schmitt et al., 2022, Karimzadeh et al., 2024). Reference evapotranspiration
    (ETO) is a decisive factor for water resources management in weekly and monthly
    resolutions and for irrigation scheduling in daily intervals. A common approach
    for irrigation management is to adjust the daily ETO with crop- and growth stage-specific
    coefficients to determine the potential crop evapotranspiration (ETC) (Ji et al.,
    2017, Fernández, 2023). Under the hypothesis that the crop is fully irrigated
    and without any growth-limiting factors (biotic and abiotic factors), the volume
    of water lost by the crop should be topped up with irrigation water (Haghverdi
    et al., 2021). Anything more than this \"correct amount\" (non-consumptive water
    use) is considered unproductive as it will be lost by evaporation, runoff, or
    deep percolation, while anything less than this amount will develop water stress
    and potentially yield loss. Therefore, a realistic estimate of daily ETO is essential
    for sustainable water management and food production. The FAO 56 Penman-Monteith
    (P-M) equation is the gold standard of ETO calculation (Penman, 1948, Monteith,
    1965, Allen et al., 1998). Compared to other empirical or semi-empirical equations,
    P-M is a physical-based equation that combines energy balance and mass transfer
    method and considers aerodynamic and surface resistance factors to calculate the
    evapotranspiration rate over a standardized cropped surface (Allen et al., 1998).
    Therefore, P-M requires a complete weather station (several sensors for measuring
    multiple parameters) to be installed over an extended reference grass surface
    to achieve reliable results. This surface should be homogeneously extended towards
    different directions (enough fetch) to satisfy the heat and vapor advection assumptions.
    Moreover, the grass should be well-watered to avoid any water stress. Meeting
    these conditions is troubling, especially where labor for maintenance is scarce
    or expensive, and land and water resources are limited, which is very common in
    agriculturally productive regions. Utilizing fertile land and scarce water and
    labor resources for weather stations is not appealing to growers and stakeholders.
    The other problem is the number of stations required for irrigation management.
    Due to the diversity of micro-climates in croplands, only a dense network of stations
    is practically helpful for irrigation management. To address the abovementioned
    challenges, this research aims to develop an ETO estimation approach that relaxes
    the need for a reference surface. ETO has four meteorological driving factors:
    solar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed (Ahmadi et al.,
    2022). From these factors, solar radiation (Rs) is the only one that does not
    rely on surface characteristics, as it is a function of incoming solar energy
    only. Therefore, our approach called \"SolarET\" uses RS, which is measured with
    only one sensor (i.e., pyranometer) placed on any arbitrary surface as the sole
    input parameter. There are numerous input-limited alternatives for ETO estimation
    in the literature, ranging from empirical models (e.g., Hargreaves and Samani,
    1985) to machine learning (ML) applications (e.g., Chen et al., 2020). Almost
    all well-known empirical models were developed decades ago over restricted training
    data samples, sampling locations, and computational resources (Priestley and Taylor,
    1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). These methods tend to aggregate all un-measured
    inputs and uncertainties deterministically into one empirical coefficient, which
    might result in inaccurate results. Also, none of these methods rely only on solar
    radiation data. On the contrary, these methods need information on air temperature
    and humidity. Since this information is a function of the surface, the empirical
    equations cannot relax the need for the reference grass surface. Similarly, ML
    alternatives available in the literature take air temperature and humidity as
    their inputs and are not primarily focused on bypassing the reference surface
    (Chen et al., 2020, Dong et al., 2022, Kushwaha et al., 2022). Our proposed approach
    uses decision tree- and neural network-based ML regression models to estimate
    daily ETO with hourly and daily RS data. The ML models employed in this study
    have shown superior performance for similar regression problems based on the available
    literature and ML competitions (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015, Zhang et al.,
    2020, Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020, Zhangzhong et al., 2023). Contrary to the
    available ML methods for daily ETO forecasting, which use only daily meteorological
    inputs, this research leverages hourly RS inputs to take advantage of the information
    gained from this finer temporal resolution data. Another essential difference
    between SolarET and available ML-based alternatives for ETO estimation lies in
    its generalizability. Our test set consists of unseen weather stations to ensure
    SolarET''s generalizability and applicability to new arbitrary locations in California.
    In other words, we train our models on data collected from some stations/locations
    and then test them using a previously unseen dataset from new stations. We use
    California as the case study to evaluate the applicability of SolarET. California
    is one of the most hydrologically altered regions in the world (Zimmerman et al.,
    2018). California is also one of the most agriculturally productive regions on
    the planet, with heavy reliance on irrigation (Lobell and Bonfils, 2008, Tindula
    et al., 2013). Another reason California is a suitable case study for this research
    is the reliable, long-term data available from several weather stations in California
    (Ahmadi et al., 2023). To examine the performance of SolarET, we test it against
    Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestley-Taylor (PT), and Romanenko empirical models.
    HS and PT models are developed using California data and are widely used and highly
    trusted for ETO estimation (Tabari et al., 2013). Leveraging high temporal resolution
    data, cutting-edge regression algorithms, and big training data availability,
    we hypothesize that SolarET can outperform empirical alternatives without requiring
    surface-dependent inputs. In other words, we hypothesize that SolarET can surpass
    comparable methods in terms of prediction accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability.
    2. Study area and dataset California was chosen as the case study of this research.
    It is one of the world''s most prominent agriculturally productive regions, heavily
    dependent on irrigation. According to the California Department of Water Resources
    (DWR), in an average year, approximately 9.6 million acres are irrigated with
    roughly 42 billion cubic meters of water. To assist irrigators in managing this
    immense water demand, DWR and the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) developed
    a program called the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS)
    in 1982. CIMIS consists of over 145 automated weather stations that measure meteorological
    inputs of the Penman-Monteith equation in a standardized condition. Daily and
    hourly reports of ETO and its meteorological driving factors are publicly available
    on the CIMIS website (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). More information about the
    CIMIS program can be found on the CIMIS website. For this study, daily and hourly
    data on required variables from 131 active CIMIS stations are acquired. While
    some of those stations are located in research facilities, most are installed
    on private lands (often growers) where proper maintenance (mainly grass and fetch
    requirements) is a limiting factor. For this work, stations are chosen according
    to their condition and maintenance records, and problematic stations (e.g., stations
    with poor maintenance, inadequate or infrequent irrigation, and non-grass reference
    surface) are eliminated to ensure the quality of the input data. The train set
    consists of 114 stations. The train set data is acquired from January 1, 1995,
    to December 31, 2022 (i.e., 28 years of data). Although all the stations in the
    train set have data until the end of 2022 (i.e., they are active stations), their
    installation date varies, and some of them have been installed after 1995 and,
    therefore, have less than 28 years of data. CIMIS divides California into 18 homogeneous
    climatic zones with similar meteorological and evapotranspiration characteristics.
    To test the applicability of the proposed methodology in estimating ETO at climatically
    diverse and unseen arbitrary locations, 17 stations, each representing a climatic
    zone, were chosen as the test set. Zone 11 is eliminated, as it does not have
    any reliable station. Names and characteristics of these climatic zones can be
    found in Table A1 in the appendix. Readers are referred to Ahmadi et al. (2022)
    for more information about these zones. To evaluate the generalizability of the
    proposed ML models, they have never been exposed to the test set, even for validation
    purposes. All the results reported in this paper represent the models'' performance
    on this unseen test set. To eliminate biases due to data length and climatic variability
    in longer time spans (e.g., wet or dry periods), the test set consists of data
    from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022 (five years) for all stations. In total,
    19,088,736 hourly data records have been used in this study, with 18,447,984 records
    used as the training set and the remaining 640,752 records employed as the test
    set. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of training and testing stations across California.

    3.1. Reference evapotranspiration The Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold
    standard for calculating ETO (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965). CIMIS calculates
    ETO using the P-M equation version described in the American Society of Civil
    Engineering-Environmental Water Resources Institute paper (Allen et al., 2005).
    CIMIS does not use the daily meteorological variables and daily P-M equation to
    calculate daily ETO. It reports the summation of 24 hourly ETO values from midnight
    to midnight as the daily ETO. Ahmadi et al. (2022) showed that the summation of
    hourly ETO values results in similar outputs as using the daily P-M equation.
    CIMIS uses Eq. 1 to calculate hourly ETO (Allen et al., 1998, Allen et al., 2005,
    Walter et al., 2000, Pereira et al., 2015). (1) Where Cd (the ratio of bulk surface
    to aerodynamic resistance) is equal to 0.24 and 0.96 during daytime and nighttime,
    respectively. : standardized reference evapotranspiration (mm h−1), which approximates
    grass ET : the slope of saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1) at mean air
    temperature (T) : net radiation (MJ m−2 h−1) estimated from solar radiation and
    other input variables : soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 h−1): G=0.1·Rn daytime
    and G=0.5·Rn nighttime : psychrometric constant (kPa°C−1) : mean hourly air temperature
    (°C) : mean hourly wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1) : saturation vapor pressure
    (kPa) at Ta : mean actual vapor pressure (kPa) from dew point temperature (°C),
    or relative humidity (%) and temperature (°C) : latent heat of vaporization (2.45
    MJ kg−1 for water temperature of 20 °C) This equation''s first and second fractions
    are the radiation and aerodynamic terms of the P-M equation. This research uses
    the daily ETO value reported by CIMIS (i.e., the summation of hourly values) as
    the target value or predictand of ML models. 3.2. Data preprocessing and feature
    selection To relax the need of reference surface to estimate ETO, this research
    uses only solar radiation data measured by a pyranometer as the input of ML models.
    This study uses hourly RS as input to leverage more detailed measurements and
    capture the variations in solar radiation during the day. Therefore, each sample
    consists of an input vector of size 24 and a target value, which is the daily
    ETO. To ensure the reliability of input data, all samples with zero RS values
    for daytime (i.e., from 8 AM to 5 PM) have been removed from the dataset. Therefore,
    of the 795,364 daily samples used in this study, 1224 samples were eliminated.
    As only 69 of these eliminated samples are from the test set, we hypothesized
    that this process would not bias the distribution of samples in the test set and
    the study results. To ensure the robustness of ML models and improve their accuracy,
    three data preprocessing steps were taken: 1) eliminating records with null values:
    Null values are removed from the dataset to ensure accuracy, eliminate inconsistencies,
    and transform the data into a suitable format for inputting into the models. This
    filtering removed 6752 records from the training set of ML models and 4830 records
    from the test set. 2) Eliminating records with ETO values higher than 15 mm/day:
    we hypothesize these values are due to sensor errors or poor maintenance conditions.
    This filtering resulted in the elimination of 10 records from the training set.
    3) Using robust scaler: While traditional scaling techniques such as min-max scaling
    or standard scaling rely on the mean and standard deviation of the data, robust
    scaling uses different statistics that are less sensitive to outliers. Specifically,
    it leverages the median and interquartile range (IQR) to scale the input data.
    By reducing the potential impact of extreme values on the performance of ML models,
    robust scaling helps to mitigate the influence of outliers in the input variables.
    Eq. 2 shows how scaled data records are calculated using the robust scaling method:
    (2) Where, as the names suggest, is the value before scaling, and is the median
    of the data distribution; is the value after scaling. and are the 75th quantile
    and 25th quantile of the data distribution, respectively. Two strategies are employed
    for selecting the inputs of ML models. In the first strategy, all zero RS values
    (i.e., nighttime) have been substituted with the daily mean RS value. In this
    strategy, which is called \"mean substitution,\" each input record for the ML
    models has 24 features. To implicitly capture the daylight period, the mean daily
    RS is calculated as the sum of all hourly RS values divided by the number of non-zero
    RS values. This procedure differs from calculating daily RS, where 24 is the denominator.
    As the second strategy, we used feature selection methods to assign quantitative
    feature importance measures to each hour (i.e., each feature). In this strategy,
    only the most essential features are used as the input to train the models. To
    analyze the model performance under different feature selection strategies, we
    used correlation-based (Pearson and Spearman), information-based (Mutual Information),
    and intrinsic (CatBoost) feature selection strategies. To compare the use of hourly
    RS values against coarser temporal resolution inputs, we also tested using daily
    RS as input. In the case of daily Rs, we used a sine function of Julian date as
    the second feature to capture the seasonality. Using a sine function of the Julian
    date has merits over using the raw Julian date, as it can simulate the cyclic
    nature of input records (Eq. 3). (3) Where is the Julian date and is the cyclic
    Julian date value used as the second feature along with daily RS for the daily
    ML models. 3.2.1. Pearson correlation The Pearson correlation coefficient or Pearson''s
    \"r\" measures the linear correlation between two data sets or two random variables.
    It is a normalized measure of covariance, and therefore, its value is always between
    −1 and 1, while 1 shows the perfect positive linear correlation and −1 indicates
    the perfect negative linear correlation. When there is no linear correlation between
    the two variables r equals zero. The Pearson correlation of two random variables
    X and Y ( is defined as: (4) Where is the covariance of two variables, and and
    are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively. We used the Pandas library
    in Python to calculate the Pearson correlation. 3.2.2. Spearman correlation Spearman''s
    rank correlation (rs) coefficient is a nonparametric (distribution-free) rank
    statistic that measures the strength of correlation between the ranking of two
    variables (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011). Although the Spearman correlation between
    two variables X and Y is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values
    of those two variables, i.e., R(X) and R(Y), the Spearman correlation is not a
    measure of the linear relationship. Spearman''s coefficient assesses how well
    an arbitrary monotonic function (linear or not) can describe the relationship
    between two variables. Eq. 5 shows how rs is calculated. Like the Pearson correlation,
    rs values are between −1 and 1. We used the Pandas library in Python to calculate
    the Spearman correlation. (5) 3.2.3. Mutual information Mutual information (MI)
    measures how much information about a random variable we can acquire by knowing
    another random variable. MI is a non-negative dimensionless quantity with units
    of information (bits) that quantifies the dependency between two variables. MI
    measures the amount of information gain or uncertainty reduction about one variable
    given knowledge of another. MI is a non-negative measure between 0 and 1. It is
    equal to zero if and only if two random variables are strictly independent, and
    higher values mean higher dependency (Kraskov et al., 2004). In contrast to the
    Pearson correlation coefficient or other linear correlation measures, MI is also
    sensitive to dependencies that do not demonstrate themselves in covariance; therefore,
    it is more generalizable and reliable for feature importance evaluation, especially
    in non-linear contexts like evapotranspiration equations. Detailed information
    about MI can be found in the references (Kozachenko et al., 1987; Kraskov et al.,
    2004; Ross, 2014). We used the Scikit-learn software library in Python to calculate
    MI. 3.2.4. CatBoost feature importance The CatBoost regression model performs
    automatic feature importance analysis on the input data during training. After
    training the model, the relative importance of each input feature can be acquired.
    This measure shows how much, on average, the model prediction changes if the feature
    value changes. Higher feature importance values indicate more significant changes
    to the prediction if the feature value changes. CatBoost feature importance is
    a non-negative value. Feature importance values are normalized so that the sum
    of the importance values of all features is equal to 100. This normalization enables
    a relative assessment of the importance values across various features. For feature
    importance analysis, we chose the hyperparameters of the CatBoost model according
    to outperforming CatBoost models trained on similar datasets on Kaggle, with no
    further hyperparameter tuning. 70% of the data was used to train the model, and
    30% as the test set for model evaluation. More information about the CatBoost
    model is provided in the following sections. We used the catboost library in Python
    to calculate the CatBoost feature importance. 3.3. Machine learning Five ML algorithms
    were chosen to test if only RS data can predict ETO over California. We selected
    highly used and well-known regression algorithms. These algorithms have demonstrated
    superior performance in literature and ML competitions with datasets similar to
    the one used in our study (Zhang et al., 2020). We also used an automatic hyperparameter
    tuning framework to optimize the hyperparameters of the CatBoost algorithm. We
    used this automatic hyperparameter optimization only for CatBoost since CatBoost
    was the best model in our pilot model training, utilizing only a portion of input
    data. Also, according to the literature and ML competition results, CatBoost has
    demonstrated superiority in similar regression problems. Specifically, Zhang et
    al. (2020) showed that the CatBoost model is the most accurate compared to similar
    ML models for daily ETO estimation. 3.3.1. CatBoost CatBoost is an open-source
    gradient-boosted decision tree with widespread applications for classification
    and regression tasks to many data types (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018, Dorogush
    et al., 2018). CatBoost aims to mitigate the challenges of overfitting and target
    leakage through its innovative techniques (Asghari et al., 2023). The algorithm
    introduces two main innovations compared to other gradient-boosted decision trees:
    ordered target statistics and ordered boosting (Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020).
    The term \"ordered target statistics\" refers to the technique CatBoost uses to
    encode categorical variables. \"Ordered boosting\" is a refinement of gradient
    boosting (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018). Through this technique, a decision tree
    model is recursively trained on the prediction residuals of data points. This
    approach allows the model to obtain unshifted residuals by applying the current
    model to new training examples at each step, leading to reduced overfitting. The
    main difference between CatBoost and other gradient boosting algorithms like LightGBM
    and XGBoost is that CatBoost uses symmetric or balanced trees. In other words,
    in CatBoost, the splitting condition is consistent across all nodes at the same
    tree depth. Symmetric trees are faster to train and less prone to overfitting.
    Nevertheless, symmetric trees are weaker learners than asymmetric trees, and therefore,
    they generally make worse predictions. However, as the main idea of gradient boosting
    is to combine numerous weak learners to make predictions, the CatBoost algorithm
    tends to make more accurate predictions than LightGBM and XGBoost in several cases.
    Detailed information about the CatBoost algorithm can be found in Prokhorenkova
    et al. (2018). We used the CatBoost package in Python to develop the CatBoost
    model. We employed Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework for automatic
    hyperparameter tuning of the CatBoost model (Akiba et al., 2019). Optuna allows
    users to dynamically construct the hyperparameter search space by offering a define-by-run
    API. Optuna has a user-friendly setup, and it provides efficient sampling and
    pruning algorithms for customization. Detailed information about Optuna and its
    algorithm can be found in Akiba et al. (2019). We did not use the test set in
    automatic hyperparameter tuning to ensure our ML models'' generalizability and
    avoid data leakage in our study. Instead, we utilized a cross-validation set consisting
    of 16 stations from the training data, where each represents a distinct climatic
    zone. This cross-validation set mimics the unseen test set. With Optuna, we conducted
    100 trials to optimize the CatBoost model hyperparameters. 3.3.2. Deep neural
    network The feed-forward neural network is the ancestor of all deep learning architectures.
    Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well-known and well-studied architectures with
    innumerable applications as predictive regression models and are commonplace in
    ET prediction and forecasting (Kumar et al., 2002, Kim and Kim, 2008). Although
    gradient-boosted algorithms, such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, are generally
    considered more suitable for tabular datasets (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022), such
    as the dataset used in our study, we also included a deep neural network (DNN)
    algorithm in our models to assess its performance relative to other methods. We
    used the TensorFlow library in Python to build our DNN model. Our model has three
    hidden layers with 16, 32, and 16 units, respectively. The activation function
    of input and hidden layers is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Mean Squared Error
    (MSE) is the loss function of the network. Ridge Regression (L2) and Lasso Regression
    (L1) are used as kernel and activity regularizers, respectively, with a regularization
    parameter of 0.01. The model uses Adam optimizer and is trained over 30 epochs
    with a batch size of 64. 3.3.3. LightGBM LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine),
    originally proposed by Ke et al. (2017) and developed by Microsoft as a free and
    open-source framework, efficiently implements the gradient boosting algorithm
    and reduces memory usage. Gradient boosting is an ensemble method where ensembles
    are constructed from decision trees. Models are fit through a gradient descent
    optimization algorithm, where the loss gradient is minimized as the model is tuned
    (Brownlee, 2020). We used the LightGBM package in Python to develop the LightGBM
    model. We used a maximum of 30 tree leaves and a maximum of 7 tree depths for
    base learners. We used 2000 boosted trees to fit. More information about the LightGBM
    method can be found in Ke et al. (2017) and Al Daoud (2019). 3.3.4. Random forest
    Random forest (RF) is a supervised learning algorithm used to solve classification
    and regression problems. RF is a bagging technique that trains many decision trees
    in parallel, and its results are based on an ensemble of the trained trees. When
    used as a regression model, RF returns the mean or average prediction of the individual
    trees as the model''s output. Detailed information about the RF algorithm can
    be found in the references (Ho, 1995, Breiman, 2001). We used the Scikit-learn
    software library in Python to build the RF model. We used 1000 trees in the forest,
    with a maximum depth of 9. 3.3.5. XGBoost XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
    is an open-source gradient-boosting software library. XGBoost provides a parallel
    tree boosting (also known as gradient-boosted decision trees) that efficiently
    solves classification and regression problems. More information about the XGBoost
    model can be found in the references (Chen et al., 2015, Chen and Guestrin, 2016).
    We used the XGBoost library in Python to build the XGBoost model. We used 1000
    trees in the ensemble, with minimum depth and maximum leaves of 7 and 9, respectively.
    The learning rate was set to 0.3. 3.4. Empirical models We evaluated the performance
    of our input-limited data-driven approach against available input-limited alternatives
    for ETO estimation. Three well-known and reliable methods were chosen for this
    aim: a radiation-based method (i.e., Priestley-Taylor), a temperature-based method
    (i.e., Hargreaves-Samani), and a mass transfer-based method (i.e., Romanenko).
    Although none of these methods eliminate the need for a standard reference surface
    and their meteorological inputs rely on the measurement conditions, the comparison
    between SolarET and the methods is beneficial as they are well-established, widely-used
    procedures for ETO estimation. 3.4.1. Priestley-Taylor As shown in Eq. 1, the
    P-M equation consists of a radiation term and an aerodynamic term, where the latter
    groups the elements that represent the surface-atmosphere interactions (Pereira,
    2004). By analyzing data collected over various surfaces, Priestley and Taylor
    (1972) proposed an empirical adjustment to the P-M equation (Mallick et al., 2014).
    The Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation neglects the aerodynamic term and corrects
    the estimated ET by a dimensionless coefficient α (the Priestley-Taylor parameter).
    This coefficient accounts for the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and air and
    surface resistances to estimate the ET from a short, well-watered grass surface.
    Experimental results from several sites worldwide resulted in an average value
    of α=1.26. We use this value in this research. Pereira (2004) states that 1.26
    is a good estimate for α in Davis, California. Eq. 6 depicts how the PT method
    calculates ETO: (6) Where is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve
    ( ℃ ), is the psychrometric constant ( ℃ ), is the latent heat of vaporization
    (2.45 ), is the net radiation ( ), and is the soil heat flux ( ). The Δ over Δ+γ
    represents the fraction of diabatic energy (Rn - G) contributing to ET from the
    grass surface, and the adiabatic contribution to ET is approximately 26% of the
    diabatic contribution. The daily ground heat flux is assumed to be G=0. 3.4.2.
    Hargreaves-Samani Hargreaves-Samani (HS) is an input-limited empirical equation
    to estimate ETO using air temperature and extraterrestrial radiation (Hargreaves
    and Samani, 1985). This equation is based on the Hargreaves original equation,
    approximating solar radiation with extraterrestrial radiation and maximum minus
    minimum air temperature. Since the HS equation is developed with daily lysimeter
    data from Davis, California, it is well-suited for and highly used in California,
    which makes it a good benchmark for validating our approach. The HS equation is
    as follows: (7) Where is reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), is the extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm/day, for equivalent evaporated water depth), , , and are the mean,
    maximum, and minimum daily air temperature (ºC), respectively. Since data from
    Davis, California, is used to calibrate the constant value of 0.0023, we use the
    same value in this research. 3.4.3. Romanenko Romanenko equation is a mass transfer-based
    empirical equation that uses air temperature and relative humidity to estimate
    ETO. The mass transfer-based methods are essentially based on Dalton''s gas law
    and employ the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface
    to the atmosphere (Mehdizadeh et al., 2017). Romanenko equation estimates daily
    ETO as follows: (8) Where RH is the relative humidity (%). 3.5. Performance measures
    In this study, two deterministic performance measures are employed to investigate
    the accuracy of ETO estimation models: root mean square error (RMSE) and mean
    absolute error (MAE) (Moriasi et al., 2015): (9) (10) Where N is the number of
    samples, and and are observed and predicted ETO values at ith sample, respectively.
    Lower RMSE and MAE values indicate higher accuracies and better performance. Although
    both RMSE and MAE indicate average model prediction error in units of the variable
    of interest, they have fundamental differences. Since RMSE squares the errors
    before averaging them, it gives higher weights to large errors. Consequently,
    RMSE tends to penalize large errors more severely than MAE. According to Chai
    and Draxler (2014), each of these metrics has its own merits in explaining the
    model performance; therefore, in this research, we use them in tandem. 4. Results
    and discussion 4.1. Data investigation Fig. 2 shows the number of data samples
    and the training data distribution for each climatic zone. This figure shows that
    zones 14, 6, and 12 have the highest number of stations and input data samples
    in the training set. On the other hand, there is no data from zone 4 in the training
    set, as all the samples from this zone have been eliminated in the data preprocessing.
    However, zone 4 is present in the test set. This can further evaluate the generalizability
    of the presented methodology for ETO estimation in unseen locations in California.
    Zones 12 and 14 cover a vast area of the Central Valley. The Central Valley is
    one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world, with ideal soil
    and climate for a variety of crops but limited water resources. With limited to
    no rainfall in the summer, the Central Valley''s agriculture relies on irrigation.
    About one-sixth of the US irrigated land lies in the Central Valley (Reilly et
    al., 2008). This heavy irrigation dependence explains this region''s high density
    of CIMIS stations. Download : Download high-res image (192KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Number of samples, stations, and distribution of the training
    data for each climatic zone. Fig. 2 suggests a relatively uniform distribution
    of solar radiation across California, with lower values in coastal zones (e.g.,
    zones 1 and 2) and higher values in deserts (e.g., zones 17 and 18). The lower
    RS values on the coast can be attributed to dense fog. The ETO distribution in
    California reveals more variability across different zones. The most anomalous
    zones in terms of ETO distribution are coastal zones with very low ETO and desert
    zones with very high ETO. Also, the box plots of Fig. 2 illustrate a broader ETO
    distribution for desert zones. Being abnormal regarding RS and ETO distribution
    and having fewer input data, we hypothesize that our data-driven models struggle
    with accurate ETO prediction in coastal and desert zones. 4.2. Feature selection
    The results of the feature selection methods are presented in Fig. 3, which suggests
    no sharp difference between the features'' importance, especially from Pearson
    and Spearman correlations. As expected, all feature selection methods find the
    hourly RS values from morning and around noon to be the most important features.
    Based on these results, we decided to use the six most essential features/hours
    as the input of the ML models. For example, the six most important hourly Rs values
    selected by the CatBoost feature importance method are 7, 8, 6, 9, 10, and 12,
    respectively (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The most important features (i.e., solar radiation from
    different hours of the day) selected by each feature selection method and their
    corresponding score. It should be noted that both Pearson and MI methods result
    in hours 8–13 of Rs as the six most important features, only with various orders.
    Therefore, the results for Pearson and MI methods are the same and combined hereafter.
    Because different methods suggest a uniform feature importance, we hypothesize
    that the mean substitution procedure (i.e., using all hourly RS values) might
    be superior to using only selected features as input. 4.3. Machine learning models
    The overall performance of the ML models and feature selection methods is depicted
    in Fig. 4 and Figure A1 in the appendix. As these figures show, CatBoost and RF
    have very similar performances in terms of prediction accuracy. It should be noted
    that while Optuna has automatically optimized the CatBoost model''s hyperparameters,
    RF hyperparameters are set manually. This would suggest that automatic hyperparameter
    tuning for this type of regression problem does not guarantee higher accuracy,
    and a manual hyperparameter tuning strategy can result in equally accurate models.
    Also, most of the available automatic hyperparameter tuning frameworks, including
    Optuna, are specifically designed to optimize the hyperparameters of deep learning
    architectures, where the high dimensionality of the hyperparameter space interferes
    with manual hyperparameter tuning strategies like grid or random search and might
    result in sub-efficient models (Akiba et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res

    (RMSE) values (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods
    over the whole testing set. Fig. 4 and A1 illustrate the overall superiority of
    using all the hourly RS values with the mean substitution method over selecting
    the most important hours. Among feature selection methods, ML models using CatBoost
    intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation perform better than MI and
    Pearson correlation. The quality and relevance of the selected features can influence
    the performance of ML models. In our case, the difference in performance between
    the feature selection methods can be attributed to 1) the ability to handle non-linear
    relationships: ML models can effectively capture non-linear relationships between
    features and the target variable. In this case, CatBoost''s intrinsic feature
    importance considers the inherent non-linear relationship between the input and
    output of the model and selects features that have the highest impact on the model''s
    performance. 2) Robustness to outliers and noise: These observations can also
    be attributed to CatBoost intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation''s
    more effective robustness to outliers than Pearson correlation and Mutual Information
    correlation. Considering the rank-based correlation in Spearman''s correlation
    or the model-specific feature importance in CatBoost, these methods may have selected
    more robust features that lead to better model performance. Using feature selection
    or mean substitution, the CatBoost model with the mean substitution method stands
    out as the most accurate hourly model. Additionally, the RF excels as the preferred
    choice between daily models. We compare these models as the best-performing frameworks
    with empirical ETO estimation models. Fig. 4 and A1 clearly show that the DNN
    model falls behind all ensemble decision tree-based algorithms (i.e., RF and gradient
    boosting-based frameworks). This finding agrees with previous studies where tree-based
    algorithms outperformed vanilla neural networks in predictive regression problems
    (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015, Pham et al., 2020; Jun, 2021). To better understand
    how SolarET performs in different climatic zones of California, we included one
    CIMIS station with around five years of data from each zone. These stations have
    not been used to train the model; therefore, SolarET''s performance in these locations
    can be claimed as its performance in any arbitrary location in those climatic
    zones. Fig. 5 and A2 depict the models'' accuracy for each zone in the test set.
    These results clearly show that the performance of various ML models and feature
    selection methods is similar in each climatic zone. In other words, we cannot
    claim that a specific combination of the ML model and feature selection technique
    is more suitable for a geographical location or particular climatic characteristics.
    All successful prediction frameworks (i.e., ensemble decision tree-based algorithms)
    have lower accuracies in estimating ETO in coastal (zones 1 and 2) and desert
    (zones 17 and 18) areas (Fig. 5 and A2). Download : Download high-res image (444KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values
    (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods over climatic
    zones of California. From an ML perspective, three reasons might contribute to
    the lower accuracy of SolarET in the coastal and desert regions: 1) the low number
    of training data from these zones: Fig. 2 shows limited training data in these
    zones- leading to their insufficient representation of data patterns. Other zones
    also have low numbers of training samples but high predictive accuracy (e.g.,
    zones 16, 13, and 10). Although, these zones are more similar to the majority
    of the training set in terms of ETO distribution (Fig. 2). Therefore, we hypothesize
    that the first reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in the coast and
    desert data is the low number of training samples resembling the statistical characteristics
    of the data from these zones. 2) Higher level of outlier values in both training
    and test sets: As depicted in Fig. 6, there is a higher percentage of outlier
    values in stations 17 and 18 compared to other stations, which could impact the
    performance of the ML models in these specific zones. These outliers introduce
    noise and may not follow the patterns that the ML models have learned from the
    training data, leading to less accurate predictions. 3) Lack of relevant features:
    According to Fig. 7, we hypothesize that one of the other reasons for less accurate
    predictions in zones 17 and 18 is the lower correlation between the daily RS and
    ETO in these regions. Various climatic variables, such as temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, and solar radiation influence ETO. In zones 17 and 18, hourly or daily
    solar radiation may not accurately capture all the required information to estimate
    ETO. All in all, it is worth mentioning that the combination of these reasons,
    rather than a single factor, may have led to inferior performance of the ML models
    in these zones. It is also expected that advection is a more considerable contribution
    to ETO in desert regions than in the Central Valley or along the coast, and the
    lack of information on temperature, humidity, and wind speed in the ML models
    should lead to more considerable errors in regions having large fluctuations in
    aerodynamic contributions to ETO (Berengena and Gavilán, 2005). Download : Download

    causes of this lower performance are discussed in Section 4.4. 4.4. Reference
    evapotranspiration prediction To evaluate our approach of using ML models with
    only pyranometer data for ETO estimation, we compared its performance against
    three empirical limited-input ETO estimation models. It should be noted that both
    approaches, ML and empirical models, were evaluated using the same test set but
    with different features. Fig. 8 and A3 depict the findings of this comparison
    over 17 climatic zones of the test set. In these figures, we displayed the results
    of only the best-performing data-driven models. In the case of hourly inputs,
    the CatBoost ML model with mean substitution is the best, and in the case of daily
    inputs, the random forest model gives the highest accuracy (Fig. 4 and A1). Download

    Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for empirical models and SolarET over climatic
    zones of California. As seen in Fig. 8 and A3, our hourly model generally works
    as well or even better than the most accurate empirical model (i.e., Priestley-Taylor).
    This is especially important as our model takes only solar radiation data as input,
    while PT takes information from minimum and maximum air temperature and elevation
    in addition to net radiation. Also, our hourly and daily models clearly beat Hargreaves-Samani
    and Romanenko in terms of prediction accuracy. Our findings suggest that SolarET
    works very well unless there are extremely high or low contributions of aerodynamics
    to the ETO (e.g., desert and coastal climates). This is not surprising, as SolarET
    can only mimic the radiation term of the P-M equation, as it takes no information
    about the aerodynamics term (Eq. 1). Still, Fig. 8 and A3 illustrate that SolarET
    works better than PT as a radiation-based ET estimation model in desert climates.
    The inferior performance of SolarET in comparison to PT in coastal regions might
    be due to the high humidity fluctuation in these regions due to variations in
    wind direction, e.g., from the land or from the ocean, which lead to significant
    variations in temperature and humidity. Moreover, the presence of intermittent
    clouds and fog in these regions might be another reason for the lower accuracy
    of our model as opposed to PT. The low accuracy of empirical models in desert
    climate might be due to two reasons: 1) these models are not calibrated for desert
    climate (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985, Tabari et al.,
    2013); and 2) these models do not adequately account for heat advection in hot
    desert climates (Tolk et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2023). We hypothesize that another
    reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in deserts and coast is not accounting
    for aridity. This pattern is the same for PT and HS in desert regions. This goes
    along with not considering the aerodynamics contribution to the daily ETO. We
    hypothesize that adding information about vapor pressure can solve this problem.
    Fig. 9 analyzes the performance of SolarET against available empirical alternatives
    over the entire test set in terms of prediction accuracy. RMSE and MAE measure
    the dissimilarity between input-limited alternatives and P-M equation prediction.
    We use these performance measures to assess which input-limited ETO estimation
    alternative can simulate the daily P-M equation more realistically. As Fig. 9
    demonstrates, our hourly and daily models beat all empirical alternatives in terms
    of similarity to the P-M daily ETO. Our hourly model is the winner of this comparison.
    Although the overall performance of the hourly model is close to the daily model
    according to Fig. 9, as Fig. 8 depicts, the hourly model results in identical
    or more accurate predictions for all climatic zones. Interestingly, the hourly
    model works much better than the daily model in coastal regions (zones 1, 2, and
    3 in Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the information gained from the higher
    temporal resolution input (i.e., hourly Rs) is beneficial in simulating climatically
    diverse samples and can boost generalizability. Download : Download high-res image

    and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values for empirical models and SolarET over the
    entire test set. Fig. 9 shows that the PT equation, which is a radiation-based
    model, is the most accurate empirical ETO estimation model. The superiority of
    SolarET and the high accuracy of the PT model signifies the suitability of radiation
    data for input-limited ETO estimation in California. This finding agrees with
    Ahmadi et al. (2022) findings on the high correlation between radiation and ETO
    over California. Fig. 9 illustrates that HS and Romanenko models are the least
    realistic representations of P-M ETO over California. However, it should be noted
    that since we aim to compare not only the accuracy but also the generalizability
    of models, the HS model was not calibrated in this study. We hypothesize that
    calibrating HS will improve its accuracy in ETO estimation. Analyzing the errors
    of the ML and empirical models can provide valuable insights into their performance
    and help identify areas for improvement. In this vein, we divided the ETO distribution
    into distinct ranges and compared the best-performing ML model, CatBoost, using
    hourly Rs, with the PT empirical model. Fig. 10 illustrates the percentage of
    values within each specific ETO range where the value of exceeds 0.5. In this
    equation, Refers to P-M value and is what the model predicts. This figure indicates
    the more accurate predictions of CatBoost compared to PT across various ranges
    of ETO values. Overall, CatBoost maintains its superiority not only in the whole
    distribution of ETO over the entire test set but also in cases of low or high
    values of ETO. Moreover, as Figure A4 in the appendix shows, the distribution
    of SolarET error is similar to a Gaussian distribution with a mean value close
    to zero. This distribution suggests the error is random, not a systematic over-
    or under-estimation of ETO. It is also worth mentioning that SolarET accuracy
    is comparable to the best-performing ML-based ETO estimation models available
    in the literature, while it does not use surface-related inputs such as air temperature
    (Chen et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download : Download

    5. Summary and conclusion This paper develops a generalizable data-driven approach
    to estimate ETO using only solar radiation data. Since solar radiation is the
    only driving force of ETO, whose measurement does not require a reference crop
    surface, the developed approach (i.e., SolarET) can cut the cost of land, irrigation,
    maintenance, and extra sensors while assisting irrigators and water managers with
    their farm-level and regional decisions. As incoming solar radiation is not a
    function of the surface, a simple pyranometer placed on any location can measure
    the inputs of SolarET. Using a test set from unseen arbitrary locations, we showed
    the generalizability of SolarET over California. Our findings reveal that SolarET
    beats the Hargraves-Samani and Romanenko models in terms of accuracy. SolarET
    works better than Priestley-Taylor, a well-known radiation-based ETO estimation
    method, without using any information about air temperature. Although SolarET
    works accurately in heavily irrigated regions of California and beats all empirical
    models in desert climates, it is less accurate in coastal regions. Future studies
    can include publicly available air temperature data as another input, along with
    measured solar radiation. Adding publicly available air temperature data can result
    in better performance in coastal and desert regions, where the contribution of
    the aerodynamics term of the Penman-Monteith equation is different from other
    inland regions of California. Moreover, developing models tailored to a specific
    region or climate might result in higher accuracies but at the cost of lower generalizability.
    The accuracy-generalizability trade-off of this data-driven approach is another
    area for future research. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mohammad Hossein

  description: This study aimed to assess the environmental effectiveness of vineyards
    utilising on-site weather stations integrated with a decision support system (DSS),
    and to identify the critical hotspots in smart farms that have already obtained
    integrated or organic certification. For this purpose, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
    methodology was applied. The research comprised three smart farms employing on-site
    weather stations and a traditional farm without advanced technologies, which served
    as a benchmark. The analysis revealed variations in environmental footprints driven
    by differences in farm management practices and soil characteristics. The results
    highlighted that smart farms, in compliance with integrated or organic certifications,
    focus on reducing inputs such as agrochemicals or water consumption. However,
    these reductions could shift the environmental burden to other impacts, such as
    those related to machinery use, which remained the most critical aspect across
    all vineyards considered. In some smart farms, critical issues involve other aspects,
    such as irrigation and fertilisation. The lack of awareness about the potential
    environmental impacts of the adopted technical options could make smart farms
    more impactful than traditional farms. Interestingly, this study found that solely
    implementing advanced technologies could fall short of achieving ecological objectives.

    weather station 1. Introduction The negative environmental impact of agriculture
    is an old issue that remains a serious concern because it is responsible for 29
    % of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and utilises 70 % of all available
    freshwater (Rinaldi et al., 2016). Population growth and the consequent demand
    for food, as well as climate change, which puts the quality and amount of food
    available at risk (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012; Maja and Ayano, 2021; Molotoks
    et al., 2021; Turi et al., 2014), could increase the environmental impacts of
    the agri-food sector. In this regard, the European Union, as part of “The European
    Green Deal” (EC, 2019), has introduced the “Farm to Fork Strategy”, aimed at creating
    a fairer, healthier and more environmentally friendly agri-food sector (EC, European
    Commission, 2020). Therefore, ecological transitions have become a priority for
    agricultural systems. In addition, the wine sector has become aware of the significant
    environmental impact of its activities. The effects of conventional viticulture
    on soil degradation and surface water pollution due to the intensive use and production
    of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides (Rugani et al., 2013; Villanueva-Rey et
    al., 2014), air pollution resulting from greenhouse gases and other emissions
    generated by agricultural machinery (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Renaud-Gentié et
    al., 2020), and excessive land and water consumption (Christ and Burritt, 2013)
    have also been demonstrated. Therefore, the need to measure the environmental
    sustainability of wine chains has increased in recent years. In this regard, different
    indicators and methods have been proposed and implemented, such as carbon and/or
    water footprints (Bonamente et al., 2016; Bosco et al., 2011; D''Ammaro et al.,
    2021a; Marras et al., 2015; Miglietta et al., 2018; Rinaldi et al., 2016; Rugani
    et al., 2013; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2013), a set of indicators defined in the program
    VIVA established by the Italian Ministry of the Environment to promote the sustainability
    of the Italian wine sector (Borsato et al., 2020; D''Ammaro et al., 2021b; Lamastra
    et al., 2016), and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (Casson et al., 2022; Fusi et al.,
    2014; Gazulla et al., 2010; Harb et al., 2021; Jourdaine et al., 2020; Masotti
    et al., 2022; Pattara et al., 2012; Roselli et al., 2020; Villanueva-Rey et al.,
    2014). The wine sector was the first to experience a significant ecologically
    oriented transformation, as the reputation of wine, more than that of other products,
    was closely tied to its origin and the climatic conditions of the relevant territories
    (terroir). Hence, operators consider climate change a deeply concerning issue,
    given its worldwide influence on wine production (Ollat et al., 2016; Santos et
    al., 2020). The environmentally sound turn is also dictated by increasing pressure
    from customers, whose purchasing choices tend to increasingly favour farms sensitive
    to environmental issues (Vecchio et al., 2023). Another reason that makes the
    ecological transition the right way for wine operators is the opportunity to expand
    their businesses by entering food and wine tourism. Garibaldi (2023) highlights
    that cellars and vineyards are the most interesting tourist places, as shown by
    numerous Italian vineyards being part of wine tourism itineraries. In addition,
    in the Sardinian region, which is considered a good destination for any wine enthusiasm,
    tourism is a profitable business for farms involved that generates 7–10 % of their
    turnover. As sustainability is a driver of choice for travellers attracted by
    these experiences, winegrowers interested in joining these tourist circuits must
    demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection by investing in ecological
    certifications and innovative technologies aimed at reducing the impact of their
    activities on the environment (Festa et al., 2023). The transition from conventional
    to integrated, organic, or biodynamic farming is considered an appropriate approach
    to reduce the negative impacts of viticulture (Borsato et al., 2020; Masotti et
    al., 2022; Notarnicola et al., 2017; Renaud-Gentié et al., 2020; Rouault et al.,
    2016; Volanti et al., 2022). In this regard, the European standards for integrated
    and organic agriculture principally focus on reducing synthetic fertilisers and
    pesticides but do not consider other aspects, such as GHG emissions. Accordingly,
    organic farms may not necessarily have better environmental performance than conventional
    farms (Renaud-Gentié et al., 2020; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013;
    Venkat, 2012). Thus, other strategies are needed to fully achieve environmental
    sustainability. Smart technologies are considered a very promising solution for
    achieving environmental and economic efficiency in agricultural activities (Lieder
    and Schröter-Schlaack, 2021). As a result, a shift towards “smart farming” methods
    is taking place. The implementation of new technologies, such as global positioning
    systems (GPS) (Balafoutis et al., 2017), satellite and airborne remote sensing
    (Sassu et al., 2021), geographic information systems (GIS) (Ozdemir et al., 2017),
    robotics (Pradel et al., 2022), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, drones,
    and artificial intelligence (Dantas et al., 2021; Drath and Horch, 2014), has
    enabled farmers to monitor field conditions and make strategic decisions for the
    whole farm or even a single plant (Khan et al., 2022; Martinho and Guine, 2021).
    Considering that successful farming depends on the monitoring of meteorological
    conditions, the application of wireless sensor networks (WSN), frameworks, and
    IoT platforms to detect various parameters such as soil temperature and moisture,
    air temperature and humidity, rainfall, and wind conditions has rapidly increased
    (Ebiesuwa et al., 2022; Nachankar et al., 2018; Prabu et al., 2021). These IoT-enabled
    networks can automate numerous farm activities through decision support systems
    (DSS) (Rinaldi and He, 2014). Therefore, in agriculture, it is becoming more common
    to use on-site weather stations integrated with a DSS, which allows growers to
    make well-informed decisions on several aspects of vineyard management, such as
    disease and pest control, irrigation scheduling, alerts on potential hazards such
    as freezing or hailstorms, control of the growth phase of grapevines, and grape
    ripening. Some studies have shown that the introduction of innovative technologies
    benefits farms by maximising yields and reducing impacts (Balafoutis et al., 2017;
    Canaj et al., 2021; Casson et al., 2022; Del Borghi et al., 2022; Núñez-Cárdenas
    et al., 2022). However, there are certain exceptions. Pradel et al. (2022) highlighted
    an overall increase in the environmental impact of a vineyard when weeding was
    carried out with robots rather than in a conventional manner. In addition, the
    use of technologies to reduce a given impact may increase the occurrence of different
    environmental harms (trade-offs). For example, in Australian vineyards, the reduction
    in water use achieved through the conversion from flood to drip irrigation increased
    GHG emissions owing to the increased energy consumption for water pressurisation
    (Longbottom and Petrie, 2015). Therefore, a multi-criteria assessment from the
    perspective of the life cycle stages of a product should be appropriate for exploiting
    all the environmental benefits offered by innovation, especially when the operations
    responsible for negative impacts are diverse, as in viticulture. Indeed, Bosco
    et al. (2011) and Vázquez-Rowe et al. (2012), in Italian and Spanish vineyards,
    respectively, indicated that fertiliser and pesticide production were the primary
    processes involved in global warming, whereas Rouault et al. (2016) and Balafoutis
    et al. (2017) observed that field energy was the leading cause of GHG emissions
    for French and Greek vineyards, respectively. The implementation of LCA has the
    potential to address these challenges and aid in the decision-making process for
    adopting technological solutions that optimise resource utilisation and minimise
    the environmental impact of crop production (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Canaj et
    al., 2021; Del Borghi et al., 2022; Núñez-Cárdenas et al., 2022; Pradel et al.,
    2022). This methodology, based on international standards (ISO, 2006), is widely
    used to assess environmental impacts and improve the environmental performance
    of goods and services throughout their life cycles (Finnveden et al., 2009; Guinée,
    2002; Tukker, 2000). It has also found various applications in the agricultural
    sector (Arzoumanidis et al., 2017; Notarnicola et al., 2017). In viticulture,
    LCA has primarily been employed to compare organic, biodynamic, and conventional
    farming methods (Masotti et al., 2022; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013;
    Sinisterra-Solís et al., 2020; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014; Volanti et al., 2022),
    and as an eco-design tool to evaluate the potential impact of precision agricultural
    strategies on vineyards (Rouault et al., 2020; Tziolas et al., 2023). Few studies
    have focused on utilising LCA to evaluate the environmental impacts of vineyards
    using advanced technologies (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Casson et al., 2022; Pradel
    et al., 2022), highlighting that awareness of the impacts linked to the farm management
    techniques adopted is fundamental to leverage all the benefits derived from the
    implementation of smart technologies. Therefore, it may be difficult to assert
    that smart farms have better environmental performance than traditional farms
    without this knowledge. Further studies are needed to deepen the knowledge of
    the opportunities offered to smart farms using the LCA methodology to highlight
    the environmental criticalities due to farm management and to obtain data on which
    to make informed choices to improve their environmental performance. This approach
    allows the benefits accrued from smart technologies to be exploited. Considering
    the usefulness of on-site weather stations integrated with DSS in vineyards, this
    study involved three smart farms employing this technology and, as a benchmark,
    a farm that did not utilise advanced technologies, with the following main objectives:
    1) Identifying critical hotspots from an environmental perspective that may persist
    in smart farms using remotely controlled on-site weather stations operating in
    the same geographical area under the same meteorological conditions that have
    already indicated their commitment to environmental protection through certification.
    2) testing the hypothesis that employing smart technologies alone enables farms
    to achieve environmental sustainability objectives fully. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Case studies LCA studies on vineyards in Northern Sardinia (Italy) were conducted
    using data from the year 2021. Three smart farms (Asm, Bsm and Csm) equipped with
    on-site weather stations including multiple sensor devices which could monitor
    wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, solar
    radiation, air pressure, light, soil moisture, and leaf wetness were selected.
    The data acquired through the WSN are automatically sent to the cloud and readable
    by a smartphone so that the operator can monitor the trends of the parameters
    of interest, make quick decisions, and act effectively. Agronomic technicians
    supervised the selected vineyards to obtain reliable information and data. As
    a benchmark for smart farms, a traditional farm (Dtr) was considered, which did
    not use any technological devices to acquire information on weather forecasts
    and soil conditions but relied entirely on the multi-year experience of an agronomist
    and the regional meteorological service. The farms involved, whose characteristics
    are detailed in Table 1, were located in a limited geographical area characterised
    by a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and hot, sunny summers tempered
    by sea breezes. The average values of temperature, humidity, and rainfall registered
    by the on-site weather stations owned by the farms during the grape growth cycle
    are listed in Table 1. The farms involved follow the path of sustainability guaranteed
    by environmental certification. Specifically, three farms obtained the SQNPI (Sistema
    di Qualità Nazionale di Produzione Integrata - National Quality System of Integrated
    Production) certification, established in Italy by Decree Law No. 4 (2011). This
    certification is granted to agricultural and agro-industrial production methods
    which comply with the technical standard of integrated production, an agri-food
    production system that uses production techniques aimed at minimising the use
    of synthetic chemicals and rationalising fertilisation in compliance with ecological,
    economic, and toxicological criteria. One of the farms (Csm) obtained the organic
    certification in compliance with the EU Regulation 2018/848. The farms involved
    in this study had areas ranging from approximately 3 ha to 40 ha, yielding 3400–10,000
    kg/ha of grapes. The production almost exclusively concerns grapes for certified
    Controlled and Guaranteed Denomination of Origin (DOCG), Controlled Denomination
    of Origin (DOC), and Typical Geographical Indication (IGT) wines. The production
    protocols for these certifications provide guidelines for grape cultivation techniques
    and yield limits. “Vermentino” is the predominantly grown grape cultivar in the
    farms involved; however, winegrowers manage all varieties cultivated under the
    same management schemes. The differences between farms were related to the soil
    texture, which ranged from predominantly sandy to mostly clayey, as well as the
    type of soil operations and the number of repetitions of each practice per year
    (Table 1). Fertilisation techniques range from fertigation and foliar fertilisation
    to buried fertilisation. Regarding irrigation, all farms adopted the drip irrigation
    system, with a variable (Farm Asm and Farm Bsm) or uniform rate (Farm Dtr). Unlike
    the others, Farm Csm did not include an irrigation phase. To identify the production
    steps that most influenced the environmental performance of each farm, the contributions
    to the various impact categories from soil operations (accounting for those linked
    to tillage, weed, and grass management), irrigation, fertilisation, and plant
    protection treatments were considered separately (Table 3). Regarding the phases
    related to fertilisation and plant protection treatments, the contributions to
    the considered impact categories of input products (manufacturing and use), diesel
    consumption for the use of machinery for spreading products, transport of products
    from the selling point to the farm, and product packaging were analysed in detail
    (Table 4). Table 1. Characteristics of the selected farms. Data from the reference

    the environmental performance of grapes from vineyards operating under the same
    climatic conditions and employing on-site weather stations and identify the aspects
    related to the different farm management techniques that significantly influence
    their environmental footprint. The functional unit (FU) chosen for this study
    was 1 kg of grapes produced; an FU based on mass was considered more suitable
    when only upstream processes were considered (Pizzigallo et al., 2008; Zambelli
    et al., 2023). Modelling was performed using SimaPro software (ver. 9.1.1.1) (PRé-sustainability,
    2023). A “from cradle to farm gate” approach was adopted (Fig. 1), i.e., from
    the production of raw materials to obtaining grapes. The vineyard planting stage
    and explantation stage were excluded from the analysis to avoid additional uncertainties
    from data with poor accuracy provided by the farms. Gazulla et al. (2010) excluded
    these stages by considering the long average lifespan (30–70 years) of vineyards.
    Replacement of dead or damaged vines was a usual activity carried out during the
    year. Therefore, the impacts of this activity were included in grape production.
    In general, these stages are included when analysing impacts related to transitioning
    from one agricultural technique to another (Falcone et al., 2016; Ferrara and
    De Feo, 2018). The soil operations considered for each farm are listed in Table
    1. All inputs (water, fuel, energy, fertilisers, and pesticides) and output flows
    (emissions into the air, water, soil, and waste) were considered for each agricultural
    stage or activity within the defined boundaries (Fig. 1). These data refer to
    the year 2021. Given the seasonal variability of crops and microclimatic conditions,
    which could also imply variability in the characteristics of agricultural practices
    (Ferrara and De Feo, 2018), it is advisable to use average data over three or
    more years (Borsato et al., 2020; Harb et al., 2021). However, referring to a
    single year is typical (Gazulla et al., 2010; Harb et al., 2021; Laca et al.,
    2021; Russo et al., 2021) because of the difficulty of conducting data collection
    over multiple years. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. System boundaries. Facilities and equipment used to manufacture
    farm tools and machinery, as well as products and infrastructure related to employees''
    needs, were excluded (Pradel et al., 2022). Waste produced by employees during
    field operations, such as disposable masks, gloves, boots, and overalls, was not
    considered as their quantity, in terms of mass, did not exceed 1 % of the total.
    Vineyard stakes were excluded from the study because they were in the planting
    stage (Fusi et al., 2014). Finally, the wires for tying the shoots were not considered,
    as it was difficult to quantify all the manufacturing materials used, as they
    were made of mixed materials (e.g. rubber, plastic, iron, and natural twine).
    Regarding the multifunctionality issue, the following choices were made: Farm
    Dtr-practiced fertigation integrates fertilisation into an irrigation system.
    The fertigation equipment was powered using a diesel generator. Thus, the allocation
    of diesel consumption between fertilisation and irrigation processes is required.
    The allocation could have been carried out considering the diesel needed to pump
    water for irrigation only and for fertilisation (Casson et al., 2022). Because
    such data were not available, we opted for an allocation criterion based on the
    mass (of water and fertiliser, respectively). In addition to being the most widespread
    allocation criterion, it also expresses a causal relationship between the flow
    to be allocated (amount of diesel consumed) and the functions provided (amount
    of water and fertiliser, respectively), as recommended by ISO 14044 (ISO, 2006).
    Therefore, based on the mass of water and fertiliser used in fertigation by Farm
    Dtr in the reference year, 1/6 of the diesel consumption for fertigation was allocated
    to the fertilisation phase, and the remaining 5/6 was allocated to irrigation.
    2.2.2. Life cycle inventory The input data collection (Table 2), initially conducted
    using a questionnaire to obtain the primary data, was subsequently completed and
    expanded through several direct interviews with the farms'' reference technicians.
    Pesticide emissions in the three areas (air, water, and soil) were computed using
    the environmental distribution suggested by Mackay''s model (level I) (Mackay
    and Paterson, 1981). Considering this distribution, substances for which data
    were not found were computed according to the Product Environmental Footprint
    (PEF) guidelines developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which assume that
    90 % of the substance is emitted into the agricultural soil compartment, 9 % into
    the air, and 1 % into the water (Zampori and Pant, 2019). The JRC guidelines,
    which propose specific emission factors for the main fertilising substances, were
    also considered for fertiliser emissions (Zampori and Pant, 2019). Secondary data
    were obtained from the Ecoinvent database (Ecoinvent database 3.5, 2018) and the
    Agri-Footprint database (Agri-Footprint 5.0, 2019); specifically, the collated
    data pertained to fuel, electricity, raw material production, transportation,
    and waste treatment. Table 2. Data inventory related to the selected FU (1 kg

    impact assessment The CML-2001 baseline V3.06/EU25 LCIA method was used for the
    impact assessment phase as it is the most widely used assessment method in this
    context (Ferrara and De Feo, 2018). The impact categories considered were abiotic
    depletion (elements and ultimate reserves) (AD), abiotic depletion (fossil fuels)
    (ADff), global warming (GW), ozone layer depletion (OLD), human toxicity (HT),
    photochemical oxidation (PO), acidification (AF), eutrophication (EP), freshwater
    aquatic ecotoxicity (FAE), marine aquatic ecotoxicity (MAE), and terrestrial ecotoxicity
    (TE). Normalisation, which is an optional step in the LCAs, was also performed.
    For normalisation, the absolute impact indicators for the various impact categories
    are compared to reference scores – the so-called “normalisation factors” (NFs)
    – describing the impacts associated with a reference system, e.g. a region (Sala
    et al., 2017; D''Ammaro et al., 2021b), to obtain dimensionless indices. Therefore,
    normalisation allows comparisons between impact categories by expressing them
    on a common scale. In this study, the NFs were based on the total impacts for
    the EU 25 area, according to the CML2001 method. 3. Results and discussion The
    characterisation results for the environmental footprint of each farm are shown
    in Table 3. The relative contribution of the vineyards to each impact category,
    presented in Fig. 2, highlighted that the smart organic farm (Csm) contributed
    to eight impact categories out of 11 impact categories more than the other farms.
    These results are in agreement with those of previous studies (Renaud-Gentié et
    al., 2020; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013; Venkat, 2012), highlighting
    that organic farms may have worse environmental effects than conventional farms.
    It should be noted that the impacts of the traditional Farm Dtr were similar or
    sometimes even lower than those of the smart farms, except for FAE, which had
    the greatest contribution by far. However, to identify the environmental criticalities
    and better understand which phases of production most affected the performance
    of each farm, an analysis of the contributions to the impact categories from soil
    operations (detailed for each farm in Table 1), irrigation, fertilisation, and
    plant protection treatments was conducted (Table 3). The analysis of the life
    cycle stages, presented in Fig. 3, shows that in Farms Bsm, Csm, and Dtr, soil
    operations made the greatest contribution to most of the impact categories. In
    contrast, irrigation, particularly the related electricity consumption, has the
    greatest impact in Farm Asm. Fertilisation in Farms Asm and Bsm and the use of
    pesticides in Farms Csm and Dtr had the second-greatest impact. Therefore, in
    line with Lamastra et al. (2016), pesticides and fertilisers did not have the
    most relevant effects at the vineyards considered. Criticalities persisting in
    the life cycle stages of smart farms are analysed and discussed in the following
    sections. Moreover, a comparison with the literature was made considering that
    grape production is heterogeneous, making comparisons with other studies difficult
    owing to different choices regarding FU, system boundaries, and other assumptions
    (Letamendi et al., 2022). Table 3. Contribution of the various farm activities

    emissions. 3.1. Fuel consumption and impact of soil operations Considerable differences
    were observed among the smart farms with regard to fuel consumption (Table 2).
    Organic Farm Csm had the highest diesel consumption (75 g/kg), which was approximately
    double that of Farm Bsm and approximately six times that of Farm Asm. The fuel
    consumption of Farm Csm was similar to that of Farm Dtr. Comparison of diesel
    consumption of the vineyards involved in this study with the other vineyards located
    in Sardinia. Indeed, the diesel consumption (105.6 g/kg) reported by Marras et
    al. (2015) was two to nine times higher than that of the farms considered in this
    study. On the contrary, in the Sardinian vineyard analysed by Benedetto (2013)
    and Fusi et al. (2014) (after converting into g/kg the data originally referring
    to 1 0.75-L bottle of wine as a FU, corresponding to 1.1 kg of grape), the consumption
    of diesel (around 11 g/kg) was similar to that of Farm Asm, but lower than that
    of the other farms. The fuel consumption of these vineyards was also higher than
    that of the farms located outside Sardinia. The diesel consumption (after conversion
    of data from L/ha to g/kg of grapes) for 15 conventional wines from 8 farms located
    in various regions of central-northern Italy (D''Ammaro et al., 2021b) varied
    between approximately 8 g/kg and 60 g/kg (on average 35 ± 17.5 g/kg), thus placing
    the conventional vineyard Dtr of our study towards the higher end of this range.
    Compared with other organic farms, the diesel consumption of Farm Csm was around
    four times higher than farms in the north of Italy (Masotti et al., 2022), and
    around five to eight times higher than the Spanish farms analysed by Villanueva-Rey
    et al. (2014) across two different years (15 g/kg and 9.2 g/kg, respectively).
    Notably, the farms considered in the aforementioned studies had higher yields
    than the smart farms considered in the present study. As the yield increases,
    the incidence of inputs and the related impacts per unit of harvested produce
    tends to decrease. Therefore, grape yield is a sensitive parameter that affects
    the environmental performance of vineyards (Bosco et al., 2011; Sinisterra-Solís
    et al., 2020). Diesel consumption was allocated to soil operations, irrigation,
    fertilisation, and pesticide application (complementary Table S1) to evaluate
    its contribution to the different impact categories of the fuel used for various
    agricultural operations. Across the four farms examined, 70 % (approximately 60
    % in Farm Bsm and more than 80 % in Dtr), on average, of the fuel employed and
    the related impacts were attributable to soil operations. The remaining fuel was
    used to distribute fertilisers and pesticides, as discussed in 3.3 Fertilisation,
    3.4 Plant protection treatments. More specifically, the incidence of the fuel-related
    impacts for fertiliser application ranged from approximately 7 % (Csm) to almost
    25 % (Bsm) (excluding Dtr, which carried out fertigation) of the overall fuel-related
    impacts. As regards the application of plant protection products, the percentage
    contributions ranged from approximately 14 % (Asm) to almost 20 % (Csm) of the
    overall fuel-related impacts. Focusing on soil operations, it can be seen that
    Farm Asm recorded the lowest impact for all categories (Fig. 3) since it carried
    out fewer operations than the other farms (Table 1). In contrast, organic Farm
    Csm, despite not conducting certain agricultural operations (such as tillage and
    pre-pruning), had the highest impact. This farm had to repeat the practice of
    mechanical weed control five times a year, which the other farms either did not
    carry out (Asm and Bsm) or carried out only once (Dtr). In the organic farm, this
    practice had to be repeated to prevent the grass from acting as a competitor for
    water and nutrients, since Farm Csm chose to avoid irrigation and had mostly sandy
    soil that has very low water retention capacity. Therefore, the extent of the
    environmental impacts largely depends on farmers'' management choices, as observed
    by Tuomisto et al. (2012). Owing to fuel consumption, soil operations generally
    had the highest impact on the categories AD, ADff, GW, OLD, HT, MAE, PO, and AF
    (Table 3), confirming the results obtained by Fusi et al. (2014) and Marras et
    al. (2015). Field energy was the input most related to GHG emissions, even in
    Greek farms (Balafoutis et al., 2017), regardless of whether conventional or precision
    viticulture techniques were used. Sinisterra-Solís et al. (2020) and Volanti et
    al. (2022) confirmed the primary role of machinery fuel on the negative environmental
    performances of both organic and conventional Spanish farms. In comparison with
    the literature, the GW impact category was mostly correlated with fuel consumption.
    Across the four farms analysed in this study, this category showed a value between
    0.28 and 0.61 kg CO2e (Table 3), within the range of about 0.1 to 1.42 kg CO2e
    per kg of grapes observed in conventional (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Borsato et
    al., 2020; Bosco et al., 2011; D''Ammaro et al., 2021b; Harb et al., 2021; Laca
    et al., 2021; Sinisterra-Solís et al., 2020) and integrated (Rouault et al., 2016)
    vineyards. The organic vineyard has a value of 0.61 kg CO2e, approximately 30
    % higher than the average of the other vineyards. Therefore, as confirmed by other
    studies (Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013), the common opinion that organic
    agriculture has a lower carbon footprint than conventional agriculture is not
    universal. On the contrary, the behaviour of Farm Csm differed from that observed
    in other organic farms whose value of GW was lower than that of conventional,
    and precisely 0.8–0.9 kg CO2e/kg and 0.138 kg CO2e/kg (average value over a 5-year
    period) of grapes in vineyards in the north of Italy found by Masotti et al. (2022)
    and Borsato et al. (2020), respectively. Finally, the GW of Farm Csm is not even
    comparable with that obtained in Spanish organic vineyards, where the values range
    between about 0.05 and 0.13 kg CO2e per kg of grapes (Sinisterra-Solís et al.,
    2020; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014). In the farms analysed by Villanueva-Rey et
    al. (2014), however, most of the operations were carried out by hand, thus reducing
    the use of diesel by 80 %. As suggested by other authors (Vázquez-Rowe et al.,
    2012; Neto et al., 2013), reducing fuel consumption is the primary strategy for
    improving the environmental performance of vineyards. Several solutions have been
    proposed to mitigate emissions from fuel combustion, such as reducing the number
    and types of operations in vineyards in each season (Rugani et al., 2013) and
    introducing livestock to manage grass (Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014; Longbottom
    and Petrie, 2015). These activities imply efforts by agronomists to revise vineyard
    management techniques. Adopting eco-driving systems for tractors (Dettù et al.,
    2022), most-performing engines, and biofuel-powered (Hosseinzadeh-Bandbafha et
    al., 2021), green hydrogen-powered, or electric (Baker et al., 2022; Gao and Xue,
    2020; Gorjian et al., 2021; Lagnelöv et al., 2021; Scolaro et al., 2021) tractors
    could contribute decisively to reducing impacts, a solution which, given the costs
    of high-tech machinery, is currently difficult to consider, especially in the
    case of small farms. 3.2. Water consumption and irrigation Water conservation
    is one of the primary reasons why smart farms use on-site weather stations. Irrigation
    was not carried out at the organic Farm Csm, whereas significant differences in
    water consumption were recorded among the other farms (Table 2). The consumption
    of Farm Asm was 10 times lower (0.05 m3/kg) than Farm Bsm. Farm Dtr performed
    best in terms of water consumption (0.0015 m3/kg) despite not using IoT devices
    to detect soil moisture. This difference did not seem to be attributable to the
    irrigation technique, as smart farms were using variable drip irrigation, whereas
    Farm Dtr adopted a drip-irrigation system with a uniform rate, which was found
    to have a consumption of approximately 9 % higher than the variable rate drip-irrigation
    system (Casson et al., 2022) implemented by smart farms. In this regard, the considerable
    effect was due to the different soil texture, which in Farm Asm was loamy (i.e.,
    “medium-textured”, with a balanced presence of sand, silt and clay), in Farm Bsm
    was sandy and, therefore, had a poor water-holding capacity and a tendency to
    remain dry during the summer season, while the soil in Farm Dtr was mainly clayey
    and was thus able to retain a great deal of water. The latter also utilises zeolite,
    which helps to keep the soil aerated and moist for a long time (Yasuda et al.,
    1998) by reducing the need for irrigation. Farm Bsm''s agronomist claimed that
    by using the on-site weather station with moisture-sensing sensors in the field,
    irrigation became more rational, preventing the over- or under-watering of different
    areas of the field; however, this did not result in less overall water consumption.
    This technician justified the high water consumption by stating that water stress
    shortens the life cycle of the vines, resulting in high economic losses for the
    farm. The techno-managerial approach of Farm Csm (no irrigation) does not seem
    appropriate for oenologists because high water stress can influence the organoleptic
    characteristics of grapes and, consequently, wine. Indeed, irrigation gives the
    red wine higher acidity and a better “bouchet” of polyphenols (Borsato et al.,
    2020; Cavaliere et al., 2010) and the white one a higher aromatic expression with
    a lower bitter taste (Zufferey et al., 2020). However, the example of Farm Csm
    demonstrated that even when operating in Mediterranean climatic conditions and
    with a soil texture which is predominantly sandy, water saving could be possible.
    Thus, in Farm Bsm, water management seems inefficient, and all the opportunities
    offered by on-site weather stations should be exploited. Another aspect that might
    affect water use is the grapevine cultivar, as identified by Balafoutis et al.
    (2017) in the northern Greek vineyards, where water consumption was different
    in the case of the Sauvignon and Syrah cultivars (0.23 m3/kg and 0.11 m3/kg, respectively).
    Sinisterra-Solís et al. (2020) observed that in Spanish vineyards where different
    varieties were cultivated, the differences in water consumption and other inputs
    were ascribed to the yield more than the varieties. In this research, the grapevine
    variety was excluded as a factor influencing the considerable differences in water
    consumption observed since Vermentino was the exclusive or predominant grape variety
    cultivated, and, in any case, all the varieties were managed the same way across
    the farms. Therefore, soil characteristics and vineyard management choices may
    be more important than other factors in determining water use. Considering that
    water scarcity and the excessive exploitation of aquifers are factors linked to
    ongoing climate change and that forecasts indicate a growing demand for water
    in the Mediterranean area in the near future (Mancuso et al., 2020), the reduction
    of water consumption is an important challenge for Sardinian viticulture. Therefore,
    various management options should be considered in vineyards, such as adopting
    effective cultivation methods that leave the soil settled to prevent the surface
    runoff of rainwater or avoiding trampling that reduces the macropores, which are
    considered true soil reservoirs (Giordano, 1999). As shown in Table 3, the irrigation
    phase generated impacts only in Farms Asm and Dtr because of the energy consumption
    required to power the irrigation system. Farm Asm drew water from a well that
    used electricity to run a pump to pressurise the irrigation system, and Farm Dtr
    used a diesel-powered generator to distribute water from the municipal supply
    network. In Farm Bsm, the impact of irrigation was zero because it did not consume
    energy, as it applied gravity-fed surface irrigation by drawing water from a reservoir.
    Irrigation, the most impactful phase in Farm Asm, was responsible for approximately
    50 % of its total impact on the categories linked to air emissions (Table 3),
    which may be attributable to the Italian power mix that is largely dependent on
    fossil fuels. Apart from the drip irrigation already practised by farms, Russo
    et al. (2021) recommended using deficit irrigation and the implementation of photovoltaic-powered
    irrigation to mitigate GHG emissions and make vineyards more resilient to drought
    phenomena. Deficit irrigation is possible in the Mediterranean regions, as demonstrated
    by Farm Csm. However, as stated previously, the effects of high water stress on
    the quantity and quality of production must be considered. The employment of renewable
    energy sources could be an appropriate choice from an environmental perspective
    and could even be integrated into vineyards through innovative specific agrivoltaic
    solutions (enovoltaics) (Padilla et al., 2022). The impacts of irrigation were
    greater in Farm Asm than in the Dtr (Table 3) because the latter applied fertigation.
    Indeed, as explained in Subsection 2.2.1, the diesel consumption to power the
    fertigation equipment was partly allocated to the fertilisation phase and the
    remainder to irrigation. Considering the experiences of the traditional Farm Dtr,
    fertigation could be another solution for mitigating the impact of irrigation.
    However, this technique is difficult to apply to land with a high slope, and only
    fertilisers with high water solubility can be distributed. However, the trade-off
    between water and energy consumption must be considered to meet the vine cultivation
    and grape quality requirements (Roselli et al., 2020). 3.3. Fertilisation In the
    fertilisation phase, different fertilisers purchased from the market were used
    in the vineyards. In addition, unlike the traditional Farm Dtr, smart farms utilise
    green manure to enrich the soil with nutrients. Farm Asm estimated the input of
    nutrients from pruning residues of a sample of vines for a more rational use of
    fertiliser. Generally, eutrophication is the category in which fertilisation has
    the greatest impact. EP impact was generated almost exclusively by fertilisation,
    which contributed more than 95 % of the total EP impact, except for the Farm Csm,
    where the contribution of fertilisation to EP was only 10 % of the total. The
    contribution of fertilisation to the total impact was by far the weakest in Farm
    Csm because, for the various categories, its contribution to the total ranged
    between 5 % and 10 % (on average 7 %), decidedly lower than the impact levels,
    ranging between 27 % and 42 % (on average 34 % excluding EP), found in Farm Bsm.
    Although the traditional Farm Dtr used only chemical fertilisers and did not use
    green manure, the contribution of this phase to the various impact categories,
    excluding EP, ranged between 0 % and 17 % (on average, 7 %) of the total, an impact
    similar to or sometimes lower than that of smart farms. To explain the different
    behaviours and better understand which factors related to the fertilisation phase
    had the greatest impact, the contributions to the different categories given by
    the use of machinery for distributing the fertilisers, the production of the fertilisers
    and their fate in the environment, the transport of fertilisers to the farm from
    the sale point, and their packaging were considered. Across all the farms considered,
    the contribution of transporting fertilisers to the farm and their packaging''s
    production and end-of-life was generally negligible (Table 4). In contrast, the
    major impact on most categories was due to the fuel for the machinery used for
    fertiliser application. Farm Dtr had a lower impact owing to machinery use than
    smart farms (Table 4) because it practised fertigation. The change in fertiliser
    management from conventional to fertigated led to a reduction in emissions derived
    from the application of products, thus, confirming the findings of Casson et al.
    (2022). Table 4. Contribution of the fertilisation and plant protection treatments

    −1,88E−08 4,20E−10 sm = smart farm; tr = traditional farm. When considering only
    the impacts of the products, the data reported in Table 4 provide evidence that
    the products utilised by Farm Csm (algae) had the lowest impact. In this vineyard,
    the fertilisers'' contribution to the total impact of the various categories did
    not exceed 3 %. At the same time, in the other farms, excluding EP, it ranged
    between 1 % and 20 % of the total. Fertilisers contributed, on average, for 5
    % of Farm Asm and Dtr and 10 % of Bsm to the total. In Farm Bsm, the greatest
    contribution was from NPK-based fertilisers. These products were also used by
    Farm Dtr; however, the amounts employed were one-third of those employed by Farm
    Bsm (Table 2). Farm Dtr had a nutrient-rich, clayey soil with less need for fertilisers
    (Table 1). Furthermore, it uses zeolite, one of its properties being the prolonged
    action of the fertiliser, which prevents the leaching of nutrients into the soil
    (Soltys et al., 2020). NPK-based products affect different product categories.
    The contribution of these fertilisers to GW, PO, and AF is principally related
    to their production processes, particularly the consumption of fossil fuels and
    the extraction of phosphorus or potassium from rock materials (Bosco et al., 2011;
    Casson et al., 2022). Furthermore, urea production contributed to the HT category,
    especially with regard to the emission of metals (in particular, Ba, Ni, Cr VI,
    and Hg). P- and N-based compounds were responsible for the eutrophication caused
    by Farms Bsm and Dtr (Fig. 2). These products are translocated through runoff
    and leach into water, which significantly affects the EP category (Jourdaine et
    al., 2020; Ngatia and Taylor, 2018). Farm Asm, which used pelleted manure, contributed
    the most to the ecotoxicity categories (Table 4). Manure is considered a product
    with a high environmental burden, principally regarding CH4 emissions when spread
    on the soil (Volanti et al., 2022). Nevertheless, it was proved that pelletising-drying
    could lower the nitrogen and CH4 emissions from agro-biowaste compost (Ball et
    al., 2004) and mitigate the farm''s environmental impact by more than 63 % (Sarlaki
    et al., 2021). In addition, the pelleted manure used in Farm Asm was inoculated
    with the selected microbial strains. Compared to those not inoculated, this fertiliser
    allows a 40–60 % reduction in N2O emissions (Nishizawa et al., 2014). Therefore,
    the impact of Farm Asm may have been overestimated. Pelleted manure principally
    affected the EP category, like the NPK compounds. Therefore, approximately 97
    % of the eutrophication caused by Farm Asm was due to this natural fertiliser.
    Other natural products, such as algae employed by Farm Csm, had little effect
    on all environmental categories, including EP. Thus, vineyards employing natural
    fertilisers did not necessarily have a lower level of impact than those utilising
    synthetic fertilisers, as highlighted by the comparison between Farms Asm and
    Dtr. Therefore, farmers should consciously choose the type and quantity of these
    products while considering their environmental burden. 3.4. Plant protection treatments
    In smart vineyards, on-site weather stations integrated with DSS were used for
    irrigation and pest management. Indeed, microclimatic conditions, such as local
    temperature, sun exposure, and average annual rainfall, influence vine diseases,
    and the quantity of pesticides to be applied in the vineyard (Ferrara and De Feo,
    2018). As shown in Table 2, differences were observed in the types and quantities
    of pesticides used in the vineyards. Similar to other certified organic farms
    (Borsato et al., 2020; Masotti et al., 2022; Volanti et al., 2022), Farm Csm exclusively
    utilises mineral products, and this type of plant protection product is among
    the few pesticides allowed in organic farming. However, considering that Cu accumulation
    may alter soil life, using Cu compounds in viticulture remains controversial.
    Karimi et al. (2021) reported that an amount of up to 4 kg/ha/year of Cu should
    not substantially modify soil biological quality and function. Based on this consideration,
    the amount of copper used by Farm Csm (2.7 kg/ha/year) was lower than the proposed
    limit (Karimi et al., 2021). The same considerations are valid for Farm Asm and
    Dtr utilising an amount of Cu compounds equal to 0.05 kg/ha/year and 0.9 kg/ha/year,
    respectively. Smart Farms Asm and Bsm, as well as the traditional Dtr, utilised
    mineral and synthetic products, particularly mancozeb, folpet, and fosetyl-aluminium,
    as a single pesticide or a combination thereof (Table 2). These chemicals are
    often used in conventional viticulture, as observed in Italian (Borsato et al.,
    2020; Ferrara and De Feo, 2018; Fusi et al., 2014), French (Rouault et al., 2016),
    and Spanish (Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2012; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014) vineyards.
    Generally, the categories in which the pest control phase had the greatest impact
    were abiotic depletion and ecotoxicity. The contribution of these categories to
    the total burden was higher than the levels registered for the others, accounting
    for 1 % to 15 % on all the farms, except for the organic vineyard Csm, where the
    levels ranged between 20 % to 24 %. Notably, in this phase, traditional farms
    that did not use advanced technologies had similar or lower impacts than smart
    farms across all categories except for FAE and TE (Table 3). To identify the factors
    related to pest control that contributed the most to the different categories,
    the impacts of using machinery, products, and the transport and packaging of pesticides
    were considered (Table 4). As previously observed for fertilisation, these latter
    factors made a negligible contribution to the impact categories, whereas the greatest
    impact was attributable to the use of machinery to spread pesticides. This factor
    had the highest incidence in the organic Farm Csm, which was carried out twice
    as many times (12/year) with low doses of pesticides compared to the other farms,
    as it used highly leachable sulfur and copper-based products. Similar results
    have been observed in Italian (Volanti et al., 2022), French (Rouault et al.,
    2016), and Cypriot (Litskas et al., 2020) organic vineyards. Litskas et al. (2020)
    attributed the substitution of synthetic pesticides to an increase in fuel consumption.
    In the case of Farm Csm, the replacement of chemicals increased treatment frequency
    and, consequently, aggravated the impacts associated with the pest control phase.
    By considering only the plant protection products, generally, for all the categories,
    excluding abiotic depletion and those linked to ecotoxicity, the contribution
    of pesticides to the total burden ranged between 1 and 5 %. To summarise, the
    contribution of pesticides to the total impact caused by the vineyards was, on
    average, 15 %, 3 %, 4 %, and 17 % for Farm Asm, Bsm, Csm, and Dtr, respectively.
    Farm Asm had the greatest impact in five of the 11 categories (Table 4), principally
    due to the pesticides mancozeb and fosetyl-aluminium. Mancozeb, also used by Farm
    Bsm in quantities similar to Asm, mainly affects AD due to the extraction of sulfur
    and metals employed for its production, as this pesticide is a manganese/zinc
    ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate, and PO and AF for sulfur dioxide emissions during
    its production. Mancozeb''s contribution to MAE due to the toxic effect of this
    pesticide on aquatic organisms (Vieira et al., 2020) was negligible (1 % of the
    total burden), confirming the findings of Russo et al. (2021). Considering that
    mancozeb exposure has been linked to a wide range of environmental and health
    hazards, the European Commission issued Regulation No. 2020/2087 (2020), which
    banned mancozeb use from 2022. Despite this, in 2021 (the year of data collection),
    two smart farms were using this pesticide, contrary to the traditional Farm Dtr,
    which did not utilise this product. Folpet and fosetyl-aluminium were used in
    Farms Asm and Dtr. In particular, these pesticides affected the impact categories
    connected to ecotoxicity due to their emissions into the air, water, and soil
    (Table 4). The effect of these two vineyards on FAE depended entirely (99 %) on
    the use of Folpet, and the impact of Farm Dtr on TE was, for about 70 % of the
    total, depending on the use of fosetyl-aluminium; Asm and Dtr use these two products
    in different quantities. In particular, Farm Asm used approximately one-third
    of the folpet (0.025 g/kg) used by the other farm and tripled the quantity of
    fosetyl-aluminium (0.43 g/kg). The various quantities of these two pesticides
    used indicated that Farm Asm contributed the most to MAE, and Dtr contributed
    the most to FAE and TE (Table 4). Other viticulture studies (Renaud-Gentié et
    al., 2015; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2012; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014) have highlighted
    the effects of folpet on MAE. Organic Farm Csm, which exclusively used mineral
    products based on copper, sulfur, and bentonite, had the least impact on all categories
    except for AD, HT, and EP, which made the most significant contributions. AD is
    related to sulfur and copper extraction, whereas the production of copper (Beylot
    and Villeneuve, 2017) and bentonite, to a minor extent (Zhou et al., 2021), contributes
    to HT and EP. The effect of Cu compounds on these categories is mainly linked
    to the emission of toxic metals during production and storage (Beylot and Villeneuve,
    2017). Cu-related impacts may be overestimated because they are not adequately
    characterised by existing LCIA methods (Rouault et al., 2020). 3.5. Normalisation
    The normalized results (complementary Fig. S1) showed that the categories that,
    in general, presented the greatest relative impacts were FAE (especially for Farms
    Bsm and Asm) and MAE, followed by EP (except for Farm Csm). Plant protection treatments
    are responsible for virtually all contributions to FAE. MAE was mainly affected
    by soil operations (diesel), except for Farm Asm, which was irrigation because
    of related power generation. However, as highlighted in the literature, toxicity
    categories have a particularly high degree of uncertainty owing to incomplete
    inventory data for the reference system and lack of characterisation factors (Benini
    and Sala, 2016; Crenna et al., 2019; Scalbi et al., 2015; Van Hoof et al., 2013).
    Therefore, excluding the toxicity categories, the most affected impact category
    in Farms Asm, Bsm, and Dtr was EP due to the fertilisation phase. Fertilisation
    affected EP in both Farm Asm and Bsm through the phosphorus pentoxide included
    in the fertilisation product. In Farm Csm normalisation, the highest contribution
    was made by soil operations in all impact categories, confirming what was found
    with the characterisation. Excluding MAE, the most affected impact category was
    ADff, due to the use of fossil fuels. 4. Conclusion Considering the limited studies
    related to the effect of smart farming on environmental impacts, research was
    conducted to evaluate the ecological effectiveness of vineyards employing on-site
    weather stations integrated with a DSS and to identify the critical hotspots that
    may persist in smart farms which have already started on the path towards sustainability.
    The results obtained through the LCA methodology showed that soil characteristics
    can exert both positive and negative influences on various aspects of environmental
    performance, irrespective of the use of decision-supporting technological devices.
    Agricultural machinery or electricity use were the major sources of impact; therefore,
    the main strategy for vineyard sustainability involves adopting measures to reduce
    the use of field energy. In addition, the results of this study highlight that
    replacing agrochemicals with natural products would not be the most appropriate
    choice from an environmental perspective. The contribution of organic fertilisers
    to certain impact categories could be higher than that of synthetic products,
    as in the case of an integrated smart farm which utilised pelleted manure, which
    had the greatest effect on the categories linked to ecotoxicity. Moreover, the
    objective of reducing herbicide, fertiliser, pesticide use, and water consumption
    in compliance with integrated or biological certification requirements shifted
    some of the environmental burdens to other life cycle steps, as in the case of
    the organic farm, whereby the water footprint improved, but the carbon footprint
    worsened. Employing on-site weather stations to monitor climatic and soil conditions
    is insufficient for improving environmental performance. This study could enhance
    management and staff awareness of the importance of an integrated assessment throughout
    the life cycle stages of products to ensure a robust methodology to effectively
    leverage the advantage of technological innovation. Moreover, this study could
    be significant in assisting relevant stakeholders with decision-making to ensure
    a balanced trade-off between environmentally friendly and economically feasible
    options. A limitation of this study is that it was not possible to analyse the
    environmental performance of grape production before and after the installation
    of on-site weather stations to better understand how much these technologies could
    influence it. Further studies are required to deepen our knowledge of the environmental
    effects of smart farming to allow farmers to profit from the prime opportunities
    offered by smart technologies. Moreover, to achieve this objective, the economic
    aspects of grape production can effectively contribute to a comparative analysis
    of the sustainability of adopting technical management. The following are the

  description: Since agriculture is highly exposed to weather-related risks such as
    drought constraints, Decision Support Tools (DSTs) are now frequently used in
    irrigation management. The current use of DSTs mainly relies on deterministic
    weather forecasts that do not account for the associated weather uncertainties.
    Few irrigation DST users take uncertainty into consideration by utilizing an ensemble
    of historical weather observations (EHO) as input to their models. In order to
    account for the atmospheric state uncertainties, weather centers are progressively
    shifting to ensemble predictions. This is done by running several times the numerical
    weather prediction model with slightly perturbed initial conditions and model
    formulations. The final forecast hence takes the form of an ensemble instead of
    a deterministic single value. However, ensemble forecasts could present bias and
    dispersion errors and therefore need post-processing. In this work, we introduce
    a novel approach that uses ensemble weather forecasts as input to a vine irrigation
    DST, named “Water baLance for Intercropped Systems” (WaLIS), that computes a crop
    water stress index as output. Our results show that this approach has significantly
    better probabilistic performance than the use of EHO as input to the WaLIS model,
    especially between forecast days 5 and 7 (∼ 35% of gain in performance). We also
    investigate the effect of statistical post-processing on the probabilistic skill
    of the water stress index with two different approaches. In the first case, we
    directly post-process the output of the WaLIS model. In the second case, only
    weather forecasts are post-processed, before being used as inputs of the WaLIS
    model. Our results show that locally in 4 out of 10 tested sites in southern France,
    the raw ensemble forecasts could be significantly improved by the post-processing,
    and that generally there is no significant performance difference between the
    two competing post-processing approaches.

    stress model predictions is studied. • WaLIS model is used to simulate water stress
    in 10 southern France vine sites. • Weather ensemble forecasts are better than
    historical data in predicting water stress. • The most significant performance

    1. Introduction The production and management of agricultural systems is highly
    influenced by weather conditions. Moreover, global climate change and the occurrence
    of extended drought episodes increase agricultural risks and destabilization of
    farm incomes (Gobin et al., 2013). For this reason, irrigation management is becoming
    more prominent for improving crop yield with high water use efficiency. This requires
    high-performing Decision Support Tools (DSTs) typically based on crop soil water
    balance models. Indeed, such models can compute, using weather data (e.g. temperature,
    precipitation, evapotranspiration), a crop water stress index on a daily basis,
    that can guide irrigation decisions. Classically, crop water stress-based DSTs
    can provide information based on past or current meteorological data. Still, their
    ability to help for an efficient management of irrigation is highly improved when
    they can be coupled with weather forecasts. The current use of weather forecasts
    in DSTs is based on the classical deterministic Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)
    models, provided by the different meteorological centers around the world, e.g.
    Météo-France deterministic “Applications de la Recherche à l’Opérationnel à Méso-Echelle”
    (AROME) (Seity et al., 2011) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
    Forecasts (ECMWF) deterministic Integrated Forecast System (IFS). These deterministic
    NWP models provide spatial time series of different weather variables, without
    supplying information on the associated prediction uncertainty. However, due to
    modeling imperfections and uncertain initial atmospheric conditions, weather predictions
    present uncertainty that could increase with time (Bauer et al., 2015). When propagated
    into a DST, this uncertainty could cause misleading results in irrigation scheduling
    and, as a consequence, on the yield and quality of the crop. That is why the incorporation
    of the weather forecast uncertainty in irrigation DSTs is key for making better
    decisions. To account for the weather forecast uncertainty, some users employ
    an ensemble of historical weather observations as inputs to the DSTs for the desired
    period of prediction (Hongyuan et al., 2018, Chipanshi et al., 1997). In a crop
    water stress-based DST context, the output of the DSTs is then an ensemble of
    daily water stress indices. This ensemble represents several possible scenarios
    inspired by the past years, instead of a daily single value water stress index
    forecast. Based on these ensemble solutions, one can then associate probabilities
    of occurrence of one scenario or another. However, one drawback of this method
    is the possible gap between the current year’s observations and the historical
    observations used as alternative weather conditions. Recently, to account for
    the atmospheric state uncertainties, weather forecasting centers around the world
    have shifted to probabilistic predictions with the use of Ensemble Prediction
    Systems (EPSs) (Bauer et al., 2015), for example Météo-France AROME-EPS (Bouttier
    et al., 2012, Bouttier et al., 2016) and the ECMWF IFS-EPS (Buizza et al., 2000,
    Palmer, 2019). EPSs consist of running the NWP model several times with slightly
    perturbed initial conditions and model formulations for each simulation. The final
    forecast hence takes the form of an ensemble instead of a deterministic single
    value. In agriculture, these probabilistic approaches can provide farmers with
    multiple advantages such as making irrigation decisions with uncertain information
    or preparing backup plans for hazards. For crop protection applications, the works
    of Aleksovska et al. (2018) and Aleksovska (2020) indicate that using ensemble
    weather forecasts in DSTs for grape berry moth and wheat septoria can provide
    useful information for decision support with a prediction of the distribution
    of treatment dates instead of a single date. However, ensemble weather forecasts
    could present bias and dispersion errors and therefore need post-processing. This
    is usually done with statistical adaptation methods (Vannitsem et al., 2021).
    The idea is to use archives of past forecasts and observations to learn a relationship
    between the ensemble predictions and the actual true observation. This statistical
    relationship is then used to correct the new raw ensemble predictions. When ensemble
    weather forecasts are used as inputs of a downstream application model, the post-processing
    could be done in two different ways. The first approach is to directly post-process
    the outputs of the DST. The second approach is to post-process the input weather
    forecasts. However, there is no consensus yet about the best strategy, and only
    a few studies have examined this aspect. For instance, the authors of Baran et
    al. (2020) compared the performance of the two approaches for predicting heat
    index and obtained very close predictive performance. Also, the authors of Phipps
    et al. (2022) compared the two approaches in the context of wind power forecasting
    models. Their results show that post-processing the output of their application
    model could lead to better performance than post-processing only the weather inputs.
    The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the utility of state-of-the-art
    ensemble weather forecasts as input to an irrigation DST named WaLIS, which simulates
    vineyard water stress using daily weather inputs. For that purpose, we compare
    water stress simulations made with observations of weather variables and (i) water
    stress forecasts computed using the state-of-the-art ensemble weather forecasts
    or (ii) water stress forecasts computed using an ensemble of historical weather
    observations as input. Several other studies also discussed coupling weather forecasts
    to crop models (Jin et al., 2022, Jha et al., 2019, Togliatti et al., 2017). However,
    they were interested in wheat yield and not crop water stress which has a quite
    different context. In relation to our study, a similar forecast performance comparison
    was done in the work of Jin et al. (2022), where their results show that the usage
    of weather ensemble prediction leads to better performance than EHO. However,
    besides the different application model contexts between the two studies, significant
    dissimilarities in their setup exist: forecast validity period (seasonal in their
    case vs. medium-ranged in ours), different NWP model, ensemble size, and spatial
    resolution. On the other hand, in the context of crop irrigation, the authors
    of Guo et al. (2023) coupled short-term ensemble forecasts to an irrigation model.
    However, the objective of their study was quite different from ours, as they were
    more interested in quantifying risks of over- and under-irrigation associated
    with some specific scenarios on the irrigation dates. In this study, we also explore
    the potential of statistical post-processing in further improving the final water
    stress forecasts using the classical and generally well-performing Ensemble Model
    Output Statistics (EMOS) method described in Section 2.4. This study hence aims
    to provide a comprehensive, multi-site quantitative comparison of various approaches
    for combining ensembles and post-processing techniques in the context of vineyard
    irrigation. In the materials and methods Section 2, we first introduce the WaLIS
    irrigation model used 2.1, the dedicated database employed in this study is then
    presented 2.2. Finally, the verification scores used to quantify the forecast
    performance and the different post-processing strategies are formally presented
    (2.3 and 2.4 respectively). In the results Section 3, we first compare the probabilistic
    performance of ensemble WaLIS predictions computed either using an ensemble of
    historical weather observation data (named EHO hereafter) or state-of-the-art
    ensemble weather forecasts (named IFS-EPS hereafter) 3.1. This first objective
    is illustrated in Fig. 1, approach EHO-M vs. EPS-M (acronyms are defined in the
    figure). In Section 3.2, we investigate the effect of statistical post-processing
    on the probabilistic skill of the water stress index forecast using the two possible
    methodological approaches discussed earlier (Fig. 1, approach EPS-M-PP vs. EPS-PP-M).

    Soil Water”) by the WaLIS model (denoted M in the approaches acronym). The difference

    Water balance model (WaLIS) used as irrigation DST The DST used for calculating
    the water stress index is named WaLIS, and was developed by the French National
    Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE) and the French
    Vine and Wine Institute (IFV) (Celette et al., 2010). This water balance model
    is dedicated to inter-cropped vineyards. Indeed, vineyards are a crop for which
    water stress management is critical: it strongly influences yield and grape berry
    composition (Pellegrino et al., 2006). WaLIS principle is to simulate, at a daily
    time step, the variations of water content in the soil to compute the fraction
    of transpirable soil water (denoted FTSW hereafter). FTSW is a water stress index
    commonly used for vineyards (Lebon et al., 2003, Pellegrino et al., 2005). It
    has values between and , meaning there is no transpirable soil water, and meaning
    that all soil water is transpirable i.e. without any water stress. WaLIS has dozens
    of parameters representing the state of the system, and it takes as input daily
    meteorological time series of the mean temperature (T), total precipitation (RR24),
    and evapotranspiration (ETP) (Roux et al., 2014). WaLIS model computes FTSW as
    the ratio of daily available soil water over total available soil water. Available
    soil water is obtained by iteratively updating for each simulated day the soil
    water content using daily water losses (plant transpiration, soil evaporation,
    runoff) and daily water inputs (rain or irrigation). In this model, plant processes
    are derived for the vine and for the intercrop. More details of the model can
    be found in Celette et al. (2010). Practically, WaLIS simulations are launched
    on a given date of the growing season and provide forecasts of the water stress
    index up to the specified maximum lead time. WaLIS uses as input meteorological
    observations from the first of January up to the forecast starting date and a
    weather forecast from the first lead time up to the maximum lead time. In this
    study, all the original parameters of the WaLIS model are kept to their default
    value except for two environmental parameters: the grass cover rate (p) and the
    soil depth represented by total transpirable soil water (TTSW). Indeed, these
    two parameters are thought to have the main influence on the output of the model
    (Roux et al., 2014). To take into consideration the possible variability of different
    soil states, we choose to use in our simulations the following four possible scenarios:
    superficial soil and little grass cover (denoted gs), superficial soil and important
    grass cover (denoted Gs), deep soil and little grass cover (denoted gS), and finally
    deep soil and important grass cover (denoted GS). The values of the parameters
    taken for these four scenarios are shown in Table 1. Table 1. The values of changed
    soil condition parameters from the original WaLIS model are inspired from Roux
    et al. (2014). The initial values of available soil water were considered 75%
    of the total transpirable soil water in both compartments (vines and grass). All
    the other parameters are kept unchanged as in the original version (Celette et
    al., 2010). Parameter description Soil condition Value Grass cover rate (p ) gs
    0.1 gS 0.1 Gs 0.9 GS 0.9 Total transpirable soil water under grass cover (TTSWh
    in mm) gs 10 gS 20 Gs 90 GS 180 Total transpirable soil water under vines (TTSWv
    in mm) gs 90 gS 180 Gs 10 GS 20 2.2. Data and simulations As mentioned earlier,
    the meteorological data needed as input to the WaLIS model corresponds to the
    parameters: daily mean temperature at 2 meters (T, in degrees Celsius), daily
    total precipitation (RR24, in millimeters), and daily potential evapotranspiration
    (ETP, in millimeter). For that purpose, a dedicated database was built, made of
    (i) 4-year daily observed weather data at 10 vineyards locations in France, and
    (ii) associated two-week ensemble forecasts produced each day of the database
    (Fig. 3). For each year, only a 4-month period from June 1 to September 30 is
    considered, as this is the most critical time for irrigation management. It is
    worth mentioning that the observations and forecasts of ETP are calculated with
    the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Penman–Monteith equation (Allen et
    al., 1998) using several weather parameters, including global radiation, air temperature,
    humidity, and wind speed. Download : Download high-res image (546KB) Download

    in the study. 2.2.1. Observations The weather observations were provided by the
    real-time ground observation network “Réseau d’Acquisition de Données et d’Observations
    Météorologiques Etendu” (RADOME) of the French National Weather Service, which
    consists in stations on the french territory. If an observation is not available
    at a specific geographical coordinate, the nearest available observation to the
    point is used. Overall, on the hour time scale, only 11 observations were missing
    and had to be replaced by the nearest observation. 2.2.2. Ensemble forecasts The
    weather forecasts are taken from the ensemble system of the European Centre for
    Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), denoted IFS-EPS (Integrated Forecast System-Ensemble
    Prediction System) (Palmer, 2019), which runs perturbed forecasts (members) up
    to days ahead with a horizontal resolution of km. In the remainder of the paper,
    the 50 members of the IFS-EPS are considered equally likely. We focus on forecasts
    initialized daily at 00:00 UTC. 2.2.3. Simulations In order to gather a sufficiently
    large and diverse sample of data, this study will consider the summer periods
    of years , , , and , from the first of June to the end of September ( ensemble
    forecasts for each year). In addition, ten different locations in the south of
    France are included in the study, that present various climatic conditions for
    vineyards (Fig. 2). The weather data used in this study are illustrated in Fig.
    3. For each location, four different soil conditions are used in the calculation
    of FTSW index (see Section 2.1 and Table 1). Download : Download high-res image

    database used in this study in the assessment of approach EPS-M. For each location
    and forecast date of interest, ensemble WaLIS forecasts EPS-M are computed using
    the ensemble of 50 members IFS-EPS. Whereas ensemble WaLIS forecasts EHO-M are
    computed using the ensemble of historical observations from the last twelve years
    of the date of interest. To illustrate, if our focus is on forecasting the period
    from June 1 to June 15, 2020, the EHO-M ensemble would be constructed using data
    from June 1 to June 15 of each of the twelve preceding years, spanning from 2008
    to 2019. We limited our consideration of historical weather observation data to
    only twelve years because data for earlier years were missing from the RADOME
    network. Hence, the evaluation of the two different ensemble forecast approaches
    is assessed using prediction for each one of the two ensemble approaches (122
    days 4 years 10 sites 4 soil conditions). 2.3. Verification scores Specific scoring
    rules are used for the verification of ensemble forecasts with respect to a verifying
    observation (Jolliffe and Stephenson, 2012). In this study, in order to quantify
    the performance of the ensemble WaLIS forecasts, we consider the Continuous Ranked
    Probability Score (CRPS) which is defined as follows: where and are the cumulative
    distribution functions (CDF) of the predictive distribution and the observation
    respectively. is hence equivalent to the function . The CRPS is a negatively oriented
    score meaning that the lower the CRPS the better the performance of the forecast.
    This score penalizes both bias and dispersion errors. The CRPS of an ensemble
    is usually computed using the empirical CDF (for example using the R package scoringRules
    Jordan et al., 2019). However, for some assumptions on the distribution of the
    ensemble (e.g. Gaussian), analytical expressions of the associated CRPS expressions
    exist in the literature and can be used for the computation (Taillardat et al.,
    2016). As the ensemble size directly impacts the CRPS, comparing ensembles of
    different sizes requires attention. In the remainder of the paper, for the comparison
    of two ensembles of sizes and (with say ), a random draw of members among will
    be performed before computing the associated empirical CRPS. This is done so that
    the CRPS of the two different ensembles can be compared fairly with the same number
    of members. Another score used to quantify the performance of the forecast is
    the mean absolute error defined as follows: where is the ensemble mean and is
    the observation. To quantify the spread of ensemble forecasts, we compute the
    90% Interval Coverage (IC90), defined as the interval between the 5th and the
    95th percentiles of the ensemble forecast. In the remainder of the paper, the
    scores will be computed using a reference simulation, corresponding to the FTSW
    index obtained with a WaLIS simulation using the observations of the weather parameters
    T, RR24, and ETP for all lead times. 2.4. Statistical post-processing Several
    post-processing techniques exist for daily weather forecast data such as the Ensemble
    Model Output Statistics (EMOS), Bayesian Model Averaging, quantile mapping, copula,
    and others (Vannitsem et al., 2021). More recent methods also exist and show promising
    results for specific weather parameters such as the method developed in Jin et
    al. (2022) and Li et al. (2021) for post-processing rainfall extremes. There is
    no consensus on the most efficient method because each method has its advantages
    and limitations. In this work, we post-process raw ensemble forecasts using the
    Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) method owing to its simplicity and efficiency
    (Vannitsem et al., 2021, Gneiting et al., 2005). 2.4.1. The EMOS method The EMOS
    method is a distributional approach, that tries to fit the parameters of a predictive
    distribution of a weather variable given a sample of historical forecast/observation
    pairs. Let denote the ensemble forecast members of , at a given location, time,
    and lead time, is the ensemble mean and the ensemble variance. The EMOS method
    assumes that the predictive distribution of follows a parametric density function
    , whose expected value and variance are supposed linear functions of the mean
    and variance of the raw ensemble: The parameters , and of the predictive distribution
    are fitted to minimize the mean CRPS over a training period as suggested in Gneiting
    et al. (2005). 2.4.2. EMOS: choice of distributions Here we present the choice
    of EMOS distributions for both the direct and indirect post-processing approaches
    (Fig. 1 approach EPS-M-PP and EPS-PP-M respectively). First, considering the direct
    post-processing approach, we directly apply EMOS to the water stress index FTSW
    output by the WaLIS model. As explained before, the reference observation, in
    that case, is obtained using a WaLIS simulation forced by observations of the
    mean temperature, daily cumulative rain, and ETP. The distribution of observed
    FTSW seems to follow a gamma distribution that takes values between and and peaked
    near (Fig. 4 for an example of the distribution in the site of Chapitre). This
    peak was to be expected because of frequent droughts during the summer, which
    strongly reduce the available transpirable water. At each site, to confirm whether
    the FTSW data are well modeled by a gamma distribution, we performed a goodness
    of fit statistical test (Anderson–Darling (AD) test). The AD test showed that
    the null hypothesis of a gamma distribution could not be rejected at a 95% level
    of confidence. The gamma shape of the FTSW distribution is also consistent with
    the gamma shape of precipitation (Scheuerer and Hamill, 2015, Baran and Nemoda,
    2016), which is the main driver of FTSW. The gamma distribution is classically
    parameterized with the parameters shape and scale . As discussed in Baran and
    Nemoda (2016), a gamma distribution can also be parameterized by its mean and
    standard deviation using the following expressions: The EMOS predictive distribution
    of FTSW to be fitted for each forecast, lead time and location is then where is
    the mean of the FTSW ensemble and is its variance. Download : Download high-res
    image (175KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Density of reference
    FTSW at the site of Chapitre, aggregated over the different years and soil conditions.
    Overall, FTSW reference observations are used to plot this histogram. The red
    curve represents the fit with a gamma density function. In the second approach,
    each weather variable used as input to WaLIS (T, RR24, and ETP) is post-processed
    independently. The mean daily temperature is classically assumed to follow a normal
    distribution: For ETP, a normal distribution is also used since the observation
    data is bell-shaped: Finally, the distribution of daily cumulative precipitation
    is not trivial since this variable has a discrete-continuous nature and a positive
    probability of being zero (Scheuerer and Hamill, 2015). One should think of a
    non-negative predictive distribution that has a positive mass in the event of
    zero precipitation. In the literature, there are mainly two suggested distributions
    for post-processing precipitation: the censored shifted gamma distribution (Scheuerer
    and Hamill, 2015, Baran and Nemoda, 2016) and the generalized extreme value distribution
    (Scheuerer, 2014). In this paper, the censored shifted gamma distribution is selected:
    where is a shift parameter. The analytical forms of the CRPS with the above-used
    distributions are formalized in Scheuerer and Hamill (2015). 2.4.3. Train and
    test data Whatever the post-processing approach chosen (direct or indirect), the
    parameters of the EMOS distributions are estimated over a sliding training window
    of days before the forecast starting date. The optimal value of is found empirically
    by testing the performance of the EMOS model using several options. In this study,
    the values and days have been tested and the best performances were obtained generally
    with . In the remainder of the paper, the results presented are obtained with
    . The prediction skill of the post-processed forecasts is hence assessed over
    2 months from August 1st to September 30th for the years 2018 to 2021. WaLIS simulations
    are launched on each day of this period for each site and surface condition. For
    each lead time, the overall performance is thus estimated over 9760 ensemble predictions
    (61 days 4 years 10 sites 4 soil conditions). 2.4.4. Post-processing and ensemble
    copula coupling (ECC) When the EMOS is applied to the weather variables, an ensemble
    of calibrated members must be randomly sampled from the post-processed distributions
    to be used in the WaLIS simulations. In addition, the sampling procedure must
    restore realistic temporal and multivariate consistencies. This is achieved with
    the ensemble copula coupling (ECC) technique (Schefzik et al., 2013), which applies
    to the calibrated ensemble the correlation structure of the raw ensemble. Overall,
    the post-processing is done in three steps explained as follows: 1. The first
    step consists of univariate post-processing of weather variables (T, ETP, and
    RR24) where we try to find the best EMOS predictive distribution (in our case
    at each spatial site and each lead of the forecasts). This step was detailed in
    Section 2.4.1. 2. The second step involves quantization, where a sample of the
    same size as the raw ensemble (50 in the present case) is randomly drawn from
    the EMOS post-processed distributions of each variable, at each site and lead
    time. 3. The third step, which is ECC, performs a reordering of these samples
    to restore the same order as in the raw ensemble. This is done by reordering draws
    following the rank structure of the raw ensemble. Let us denote the draws (from
    step 2), at a given site, where t is the lead time from to . Let be the raw ensemble
    forecasts before post-processing, which has the temporal consistency we want to
    reproduce. For each lead time : (a) the members are ordered such that , where
    denotes the th ordered member, and we deduce the permutations (b) the members
    are ordered such that and re-ordered following the permutations from step 1 :
    . Overall, ECC recovers the flow-dependent multivariate rank dependence structure
    simulated by the raw NWP ensemble forecasts. This three-step post-processing technique
    results in 50 calibrated forecasts that can then be used as input to the WaLIS
    model. 3. Results In this section we present the performances of the WaLIS forecasts
    for different setups, using either approach EHO-M or approach EPS-M (Section 3.1).
    Then we show the performance of the two different post-processing strategies presented
    in the previous section (Section 3.2). 3.1. Evaluation and comparison of two water
    stress forecast approaches In Fig. 5, we show an example of the comparison between
    FTSW forecast computed either using approach EHO-M or approach EPS-M at 2 different
    locations. The regions in light yellow and dark red represent the IC90 interval
    of the forecast, using approach EHO-M and approach EPS-M respectively. The region
    in brown represents the superposition of the latter two regions. The two examples
    in Fig. 5 clearly show a better performance of the approach EPS-M over the approach
    EHO-M, with IC90 of the IFS-EPS configuration being more centered around observations.
    Another advantage of using IFS-EPS forecasts is the ability to more closely follow
    sudden and rapid changes, for instance the significant FTSW increase around days
    6/7 at Bordeaux (left panel) and day 3 in Aveyron (right panel). This sudden increase
    in FTSW is due to a period of heavy rainfall, which is not captured by the EHO
    forecasts that use past observations as weather inputs. We can also notice that
    the extent of the IC90 region is reduced with the IFS-EPS configuration, especially
    at short lead times, thus indicating a smaller uncertainty of FTSW forecasts compared
    to the EHO configuration. This result was somehow expected since EHO samples a
    climatological weather uncertainty, while IFS-EPS samples the uncertainty of the
    current forecast based on the current atmospheric conditions. Thanks to high-quality
    NWP and accurate initial state estimation, IFS forecast uncertainty is relatively
    small at first lead times and then increases, in some cases to reach a value close
    to EHO after 15 days. To examine if these particular findings could be generalized
    and also to quantify the performance of the two competing approaches, for each
    lead time, we computed the mean CRPS, the mean IC90 width, and the mean MAE over
    all the forecasts, all sites, and all soil conditions (see Section 2.2.3). The
    results are shown in Table 2. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download

    EHO-M (light yellow) and approach EPS-M (dark red), along with the reference FTSW
    observation (blue). The brown region is the intersection of the dark red and light
    yellow regions. The dashed vertical line represents the day before the first forecast
    lead day. The left panel is for the forecast of 2020-06-10 at the site Bordeaux
    with the soil condition gs, the right panel is for the forecast of 2021-07-10
    at the site of Aveyron with the soil condition gs. The mean CRPS score of the
    approach EPS-M is significantly smaller than the CRPS of the approach EHO-M for
    all lead times (see also the left plot of Fig. 6), which indicates a better performance
    of approach EPS-M. The significance was assessed using the paired T-test with
    95% confidence limits. Generally, this reduction of mean CRPS is also observed
    for each year, site, and soil condition, which indicates that the EPS-M approach
    is better than the EHO-M approach regardless of the date and spatial location.
    One exception worth mentioning is at the site of Chapitre, where the EHO-M approach
    has better performance than the EPS-M approach, but this is due to some bias in
    the raw EPS-M forecast that can be efficiently corrected with post-processing
    (see Section 3.2). Table 2. The different scores and statistics computed, as a

    width is wider for approach EHO-M compared to approach EPS-M, which can be seen
    from the values in Table 2 and also in the right plot of Fig. 6 (curves in red).
    However, at forecast days 14 and 15, the IC90 width tends to be comparable for
    the two approaches. This makes the performance gain (as measured by CRPS decrease)
    of approach EPS-M over approach EHO-M smaller around the latter leads ( ) than
    around leads 5 and 6 for example ( ), and mainly due to a better MAE. According
    to the ANOVA test, the different soil conditions discussed in Section 2.2.3 have
    a significant influence on the performance of both of the two competing forecast
    approaches. The test was done taking as factors (site, year, and soil condition)
    which are the variables in our simulation setup, and as output the CRPS of the
    FTSW forecast repeatedly for both competing approaches and on each of the 15 leads.
    The results of the test revealed that the -value of the “soil condition” factor
    is less than the significance level of 0.05 (for both of the two approaches and
    on each lead). We can conclude that there is a significant difference in mean
    FTSW CRPS between the 4 soil condition groups (“gs”, “Gs”, “gS” and “GS”). Additionally,
    when decomposing the total variance of the mean FTSW CRPS among the three factors
    (site, year, and soil condition), the soil condition factor had relatively the
    bigger part which indicates its significant influence on the forecast performance.
    The influence of the soil condition could be shown visually by the left plot of
    Fig. 6, where both FTSW forecast approaches for deep soils tend to have a better
    CRPS performance than those for superficial soils (blue curves below green curves
    for both solid and dotted forms). This could be explained by the capability of
    deep soils to stock more water than superficial soils which makes them less affected
    by weather uncertainties. Download : Download high-res image (503KB) Download

    soil conditions, superficial soil, and deep soil, respectively. 3.2. Evaluation
    and comparison of two post-processing approaches As discussed in the introduction,
    raw ensemble forecasts are sometimes biased and frequently under-dispersive. As
    an illustration, the left panel of Fig. 7 shows a particular example at the site
    of Chapitre of the IC90 of WaLIS simulations coupled to raw IFS-EPS forecasts
    (i.e using approach EPS-M). In that case, FTSW ensemble forecasts are under-dispersive
    at short lead times and biased at longer lead times (dark red region). Both examples
    in Fig. 7 (left and right panel) show that after performing the post-processing
    of FTSW forecasts with approach EPS-M-PP there is a significant improvement, with
    increased dispersion at early lead times and reduced bias at longer lead times.

    Fig. 7. Comparison of the FTSW IC90 forecast of approach EPS-M (dark red) and
    approach EPS-M-PP (light green), overlaid with the reference FTSW observation
    (blue). Forecast of 2019-09-25 at the sites Chapitre (left) and Agen (right) with
    the soil condition gs. PP ≔ post-processed. The objective evaluation of post-processing,
    either with approach EPS-M-PP or approach EPS-PP-M, shows an average improvement
    of ensemble forecasts for 4 out of the 10 considered sites (first two rows of
    Fig. 8). At these sites the CRPS reduction becomes significant ( -value of the
    paired T-test ) starting around day and up to the maximum forecast range. The
    largest improvement is observed at the site of Chapitre, where the raw forecasts
    are somehow biased and under-dispersive. For the other 6 sites, the raw ensemble
    forecasts are as good as the post-processed ones or even slightly better sometimes.
    To validate or contradict this observation of spatial dependence of the post-processing
    performance, we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the influence
    of the factors (sites, years, and soil condition) on the performance of EPS-M-PP
    compared to EPS-M (i.e the ratio of the CRPS scores). The results of our ANOVA
    show a site/year dependent influence on the performance of EPS-M-PP, as it shows
    that, generally over the leads, of the total variance could be explained by the
    “site” factor alone and of the latter could be explained by the interaction of
    the factors “site” and “year”. Other factors and interactions seem to have negligible
    influence. It is worth noticing that even at the sites where the post-processing
    does not improve the raw forecasts, the CRPS of the post-processed forecast stays
    significantly below the CRPS of the EHO-M approach, meaning that there is always
    a gain of approaches EPS-M-PP and EPS-PP-M over approach EHO-M. It is also interesting
    to notice that on a majority of sites and lead times, there is no significant
    difference between direct (EPS-M-PP) and indirect (EPS-PP-M) post-processing approaches
    (curves in light blue and dark blue respectively in Fig. 8). A third approach,
    consisting of post-processing both the weather parameters and the FTSW computed
    with the post-processed weather parameters, was also tested (not shown in this
    paper). This double post-processing shows no significant enhancement in performance
    compared to the two post-processing approaches tested earlier. When averaged on
    all 10 sites, the CRPS of the calibrated forecasts is slightly improved, while
    not statistically significant (not shown). Download : Download high-res image

    dates and soil conditions. 4. Conclusion, discussion, and perspectives Weather
    uncertainties have a prominent influence on agriculture and could lead to major
    risks on the yield and quality of the crop. In an irrigation DST framework, assessing
    these weather uncertainties is advantageous for farmers as it can provide the
    probability associated with each possible decision made on the date of irrigation
    for example. The economic value of incorporating weather forecast uncertainties
    information in irrigation DSTs is probably the major interest for farmers to optimize
    their economic return. Nevertheless, the purpose of this work was not to evaluate
    this economic impact. For that purpose, an economic model with specific information
    on crop production, costs, and possible losses would be required (Allen and Lambert,
    1971). This study first focused on introducing and evaluating a novel application
    of medium-range ensemble weather forecasts (IFS-EPS) in the WaLIS vines irrigation
    model, in order to account for weather forecast uncertainty. Our results show
    that relying on IFS-EPS forecasts leads to significantly better FTSW predictions
    than the classical use of an ensemble of historical weather observations as done
    in Hongyuan et al. (2018) and Chipanshi et al. (1997). These results, obtained
    using the WaLIS model, are encouraging to generalize the use of ensemble predictions
    in other irrigation DSTs or for crop-protection applications as already demonstrated
    in Aleksovska et al. (2018) and Aleksovska (2020) for example. We also evaluated
    the performance of two post-processing approaches to reduce bias and dispersion
    errors of ensemble forecasts. One approach directly corrects water stress index
    forecasts, while the other corrects the weather forecasts used as inputs to the
    WaLIS model. The two approaches are based on the widely-used EMOS technique. The
    results indicate a mixed impact of post-processing, with improvement for 4 out
    of 10 sites, especially from forecast day 5, and no improvement or slight degradation
    for the other sites. In addition, no significant difference between the two approaches
    was observed. This result is to some extent consistent with previous studies in
    the literature (Baran et al., 2020, Phipps et al., 2022), that provide mixed conclusions
    regarding the best way to post-process forecasts. It is likely that the optimal
    configuration strongly depends on the application model and the variables considered.
    The limited or negative impact of post-processing at some sites is likely to be
    due to the difficulty to post-process daily cumulative precipitation, due to its
    challenging nature as pointed out in Scheuerer and Hamill (2015), and FTSW, which
    is highly correlated to RR24. Interestingly, the site-dependent post-processing
    performance effect was also seen in another study in the context of hydrology
    (Matthews et al., 2022). In our case, this dependence was confirmed by an ANOVA
    that showed a significant effect of the site factor on the performance of post-processing.
    Also, we remarked that at the sites where EPS-M-PP performed worse than EPS-M,
    there was a tendency to have significantly larger amounts of average precipitation
    in the tested period (which could be less expected in this period of the year
    i.e. summer). We think that, at the latter sites, the worse performance of EPS-M-PP
    could be explained by a less good representation of the gamma distribution of
    the data due to unexpected amounts of precipitation at certain dates of the tested
    period. In addition, the performance of the EMOS post-processing may be sensitive
    to the hypothesis made on the nature of the predictive distribution. A possible
    way of enhancing the post-processing performance of FTSW and RR24 could be to
    consider other choices of distributions, such as generalized extreme value (GEV)
    or a mixture distribution, that may better represent their tricky nature. Another
    possible alternative could be to post-process these variables with non-parametric
    methods such as Quantile Regression Forests (Taillardat et al., 2016). For a potential
    operational use of ensemble forecasts as inputs to the WALIS model, post-processing
    of weather parameters might be a computationally cheaper option than post-processing
    the FTSW output directly. This is because, first, weather centers around the globe
    could provide post-processed weather forecasts for the classical weather parameters,
    which could be burden-free for the DST user. Secondly, because the output of the
    DST is correlated also to other model parameters, choosing to post-process the
    output requires different model evaluations for each model setup, i.e. for each
    crop state, which could become rapidly time and resource-expensive. Finally, an
    operational framework of using ensemble predictions as input to DSTs should be
    proposed to end users of these tools. This would allow them to have formal uncertainty
    information rather than trying to get some of it by checking different weather
    prediction sources without being able to integrate it into the DSTs. On another
    hand, other sources of uncertainty, such as the DST parametrization and initial
    conditions, should be also addressed. A sensitivity analysis could help us locate
    the most influential factors on the output of the DST, and then these uncertainties
    could potentially be taken into account when simulating the DST output. This could
    be done through a new ensemble constructed by the output that would be simulated
    using perturbations of these influential factors. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Arid regions like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) face a dire challenge
    of scarce water resources and unpredictable climate patterns. This study investigates
    the efficacy of advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques in enhancing rainfall
    prediction within hyper-arid environments. Leveraging an extensive 30-year dataset
    from 1991 to 2020, this study harnessed the power of XGBoost, LSTM, Random Forest
    (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron
    (MLP), Linear Regression (LR), and ensemble methods to significantly enhance the
    prediction accuracy of monthly rainfall over UAE. In the initial univariate analysis,
    focused solely on rainfall as the predictor, the ML models displayed encouraging
    performance during the training phase, achieving an impressive correlation coefficient
    (CC) of 0.88 for both XGBoost and the ensemble models. However, their predictive
    efficacy witnessed a decline during the testing phase, where the maximum CC reached
    0.45. In contrast, traditional models like Linear Regression and SVM, yielded
    subpar results in both training and testing, exhibiting correlation values lower
    than 0.3. To address these limitations, a multivariate analysis is conducted by
    incorporating additional meteorological parameters, including wind speed, temperature,
    humidity, and evapotranspiration. This augmentation proved highly beneficial as
    it substantially enhanced the models' predictive capacities during the testing
    period. The XGB achieves a CC of 0.76, LSTM improves from 0.21 to 0.71, and stacked
    models exhibit promising behavior jumping from an average of 0.44 to 0.82 during
    the testing periods. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis utilizing
    LASSO regression, which revealed that wind speed and minimum temperature emerged
    as the most influential parameters for monthly rainfall prediction in the arid
    context. These two meteorological factors exerted a substantial impact on the
    accuracy of our predictive models, underscoring their significance in understanding
    and forecasting rainfall patterns in hyper-arid regions, such as the United Arab
    Emirates. The identification of these key drivers further strengthens the foundation
    for effective water resource management and climate adaptation strategies in such
    challenging environments. This study provides valuable insights for water resource
    planning, agriculture, and climate resilience strategies in hyper-arid regions.
    Further research can build upon these results to enhance rainfall prediction models
    and support sustainable development in arid regions.

    analysis 1. Introduction Rainfall is a meteorological factor of paramount importance,
    with wide-ranging socioeconomic repercussions such as disruptions in transportation
    networks and infrastructural damage during floods (Le et al., 2020). As climate
    change advances, the anticipation of more frequent and devastating floods and
    extreme weather events looms on the horizon (Yucel et al., 2015). The world''s
    diverse climatic regions experience varying degrees of change in temperature and
    precipitation, leading to regional differences in the influence of excessive rains
    and drought occurrences (Faiz et al., 2021, Faiz, Oct. 2018). Climate predictions,
    encompassing durations from seasons to decades and spatial sizes from local to
    global, inherently involve probabilistic statements about future climatic conditions,
    encompassing mean differences and likelihood estimations. Traditional statistical
    methods (Feng, Nov. 2020, Wang et al., Jun. 2023, Wang, Sep. 2022, Fan et al.,
    Mar. 2023) have long been employed for rainfall prediction; however, the intricate
    non-linear nature of rainfall presents considerable challenges, prompting the
    exploration of various statistical and mathematical models (Wu and Chau, 2013).
    Nevertheless, the efficacy of these techniques has been hindered, primarily due
    to computational demands and time constraints. Additionally, the stochastic nature
    of rainfall, dependent on broad atmospheric circulation patterns and local elements,
    further complicates prediction. Despite these complexities, recent studies have
    demonstrated successful rainfall prediction using soft computing and data-driven
    techniques, highlighting the potential of machine learning (ML) models (Abbot
    and Marohasy, 2018, Gholami Rostam et al., 2020, Gutierrez-Lopez et al., 2019,
    Pirone et al., Feb. 2023, Diez-Sierra and del Jesus, Jul. 2020). Numerical weather
    prediction (NWP) techniques, based on physical equations and environmental models,
    have been instrumental in forecasting rainfall (Bauer et al., 2015). However,
    the non-linear character of rainfall renders NWP models susceptible to initial
    meteorological conditions, necessitating complex atmospheric models for improved
    predictions (J. Coiffier, Fundamentals of Numerical Weather Prediction - Jean
    Coiffier - Google Books. Cambridge University Press, 2011, Li et al., Aug. 2021,
    Shi et al., 2015). Alternatively, radar observations coupled with mathematical
    models have offered viable solutions (Cheung and Yeung, 2012, Chen et al., 2019,
    Chen et al., Feb. 2020, Woo and Wong, 2017, Bárdossy and Pegram, 2017). Beyond
    radar-observation-based approaches, the utilization of ML models for rainfall
    prediction has gained prominence in various hydrological applications, including
    flood and drought forecasting, flow prediction, reservoir routing, and urban drainage
    modeling (Piadeh et al., Sep. 2023, Palmitessa et al., Sep. 2022, Tang, Jun. 2023,
    Lim and Wang, Feb. 2022, Wang et al., Aug. 2022, Chen et al., May 2023). The occurrence
    and intensity of rainfall are influenced by several climatological factors, including
    temperature, humidity, sunshine, pressure, and evaporation (Pathan et al., 2021).
    Researchers have identified crucial atmospheric features, such as temperature,
    wind, cyclones, solar radiation, and water vapor, for accurate rainfall prediction
    (V. Singh, “Study of Various Rainfall Estimation Prediction Techniques using Data
    Mining,” International Journal of Engineering Research Technology, vol. 9, no.
    7, Jul., 2020, Thirumalai et al., 2017). ML models like Artificial Neural Networks,
    Random Forest, and Multiple Linear Regression have demonstrated their effectiveness
    in incorporating these atmospheric features (Li et al., Aug. 2021, Abebe and Endalie,
    Jan. 2023, Barrera-Animas et al., Mar. 2022, Cramer et al., Nov. 2017). Recent
    research has demonstrated the increasing interest in utilizing Deep Neural Networks
    (DNNs) because of its ability to grasp intricate nonlinear connections that are
    present in rainfall data. Deep neural networks (DNNs), which are a type of machine
    learning models, have the potential to enhance the accuracy of monthly rainfall
    predictions (Frame, 2022). They achieve this by effectively learning from large-scale
    datasets and extracting complex patterns. The perpetual debate on the changing
    field of the ML approaches and transformations to Deep Learning and DNNs, several
    studies have shown promising outcomes especially in the field of rainfall prediction
    (Van et al., Apr. 2020, Amini et al., Mar. 2024). For instance, Amini et al.,
    (Amini et al., 2024) developed univariate and multivariate DNN models to forecast
    sub-daily precipitation resulting in a notable 40 % improvement in prediction
    accuracy. Short term rainfall forecasting and nowcsating has also been successfully
    performed by utilizing the approaches like LSTM, CNN, PSO-SVR, and various ensemble
    approaches (Adaryani et al., Nov. 2022, Liu et al., Jun. 2022, Xu, May 2022, Amini
    et al., Sep. 2022, He et al., Jan. 2024). Neural networks have also demonstrated
    their effectiveness while preforming advanced rainfall prediction in the context
    of global phenomena like El-Nino (Fan et al., Apr. 2024, Wang et al., Feb. 2023).
    Globally, researchers have embraced ML techniques to improve daily, monthly, and
    seasonal rainfall predictions. While ML algorithms exhibit promise, the complex
    and nonlinear nature of rainfall remains a challenge, warranting ongoing investigation
    and refinement. Rigorous evaluations have compared the performance of various
    ML algorithms, revealing correlations between different climates and predictive
    accuracy (Cramer et al., 2017). Additionally, many studies have focused on specific
    regions, including China, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia, showcasing
    the potential of ML in arid regions (Abebe and Endalie, Jan. 2023, Elshaboury
    et al., 1900, Baljon and Sharma, 2023, Parviz et al., 2023, Dong et al., Jan.
    2023, Wang et al., 2021). For instance (Cramer et al., 2017) performed a rigorous
    evaluation of the six ML algorithms including SVR, NN, GP, and KNN, and compared
    them with a state of the art model in predicting rainfall across 42 cities with
    different climatic features. The study finds that the machine learning methods
    outperformed the current state-of-the-art and identified correlations between
    different climates and predictive accuracy. Another study was conducted by (Barrera-Animas
    et al., 2022) where they presented the comparison of XGBoost, AutoML, and LSTM
    models by using climate time series. Different versions of LSTM namely, stacked
    and bidirectional-LSTM networks were implemented to predict hourly rainfall volumes
    from five major cities in UK. The results showed that the stacked and bidirectional
    LSTM performed best with few hidden layers. Similarly, Parviz et al. (Parviz et
    al., 2023) recently reported to improve the hybrid models for rainfall forecasting
    in Iran. They utilized the ensemble of linear and non-linear ML models and concluded
    that the inclusion on non-linear model essentially improved the forecasts that
    the tradition ensemble modeling. A similar attempt was made to predict the rainfall
    rate in southern Saudi Arabia (Baljon and Sharma, 2023) while employing several
    ML algorithms and to show their greater accuracy over traditional statistical
    methods. Their findings suggest that Decision Tree and Function Fitting Artificial
    Neural Network Classifier provided the highest accuracy. Another study by Endalie
    et al. (Endalie et al., 2021) leveraged the usefulness of deep learning models
    to forecast the rainfall in Ethiopia. They successfully demonstrated that the
    developed LSTM model outperformed other machine learning regressors by a good
    margin. In addition to ML algorithms, some studies have also explored the use
    of hybrid models for rainfall prediction in arid regions. For example, Wu et al.
    (Wu, 2021) proposed a hybrid model that combines the extreme learning machine
    (ELM) algorithm and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to predict rainfall
    in a semi-arid region of China. The study showed that the hybrid model provided
    higher accuracy compared to other models, including the ELM algorithm and the
    support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. This research focuses on exploring
    the potential of various machine learning and ensemble models for monthly rainfall
    prediction in hyper-arid environments, using the UAE as a case study. These regions
    are often overlooked in scientific literature, despite their significance in the
    context of climate change and weather extremes. The study fills this gap by investigating
    the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches in accurately predicting
    monthly rainfall, which is essential for better understanding and managing the
    impacts of changing climate conditions in hyper-arid regionsThe algorithms, including
    Bayesian Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression,
    Long Short-Term Memory, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine regressor,
    Extreme Gradient Boosting, and stacked models, will be tested using historical
    meteorological data from 1991 to 2020. This research is pioneering in exploring
    ML-based rainfall prediction in the UAE, aiming to offer state-of-the-art insights
    to enhance water resource management, agriculture, and disaster preparedness efforts.
    By bridging the knowledge gap, this study aims to contribute to accurate and reliable
    rainfall prediction models tailored for arid regions like the UAE. 2. Study area
    description The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is located in the southeastern part
    of the Arabian Peninsula (Fig. 1). It is characterized by its arid climate, with
    hot summers and mild winters, and its unique landscape that includes vast deserts,
    coastlines, and mountain ranges (Baig et al., 2022). This study focuses on the
    analysis of monthly rainfall data in the UAE over a period of 30 years, from 1991
    to 2020. The study area includes six airport stations selected for their reliable
    and consistent rainfall data, namely Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Fujairah, Al Ain
    and Ras Al Khaimah. The analysis of rainfall data in the UAE is particularly significant
    due to the country''s reliance on water resources for its economic and social
    development. The UAE faces significant water scarcity issues, with rainfall being
    the primary source of freshwater for the country. Therefore, understanding the
    patterns and trends of rainfall in the UAE is essential for effective water resource
    management and sustainable development. Download : Download high-res image (385KB)

    along with the rain gauge locations and the elevation profile. The annual average
    rainfall in the UAE varies greatly depending on the location, with some areas
    receiving less than 50 mm of rainfall per year, while others receive over 200
    mm. The UAE experiences two distinct seasons: a dry and severe hot summer spanning
    from May to September, and a mildly cooler winter season occurring from November
    to March. The rainfall in the UAE is also highly variable, with most of the rainfall
    occurring during the winter months (Baig et al., 2023). The wettest months are
    typically December, January, and February, while the driest months are usually
    June, July, and August. In recent years, the UAE has experienced several instances
    of heavy rainfall events, causing significant flooding in some areas. In 2020,
    for example, heavy rain and flooding affected several parts of the UAE, including
    Dubai and Abu Dhabi, leading to road closures, flight cancellations, and property
    damage. Table 1 represents the locations of the rain gauges used in this study
    and the average annual rainfall for the period ranging from 1991 to 2020. Out
    of all the six stations, St-05 and St-06 lie in the mountainous region (Fig. 1)
    and therefore receive relatively higher average annual rainfall than the others.
    Similarly, to discern a better understanding of the rainfall regime during the
    study period, average annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall plots are presented
    in Fig. 2. Average seasonal rainfall has been structured into four domains namely
    winter (January-February), Spring (March-May), Summer (June-Sep), and Autumn (Oct-Dec).
    Apparently, the summer months are predominantly drier in the study region while
    most of the downpour is experienced during winter and to some extent in spring
    months (Fig. 2 (a) & (b)). Average monthly rainfall showed a surge during winter
    to early spring except st-04 where autumn months demonstrated equally matching
    peaks (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c spans the average annual rainfall in the range of 52
    mm to 115 mm where the highest annual average was recorded for St-05 and the lowest
    for St-01. Table 1. Detail of the gauge stations used in the study area. Station(s)

    selected stations. 2.1. Physical processes driving rainfall in the region The
    climate of the Arabian Peninsula is influenced by polar continental air masses
    during the winter months and tropical continental air masses during the summer.
    In winter (from December to mid-March), the region experiences a high-pressure
    system extending from the Siberian anticyclone in central Asia, but surface winds
    are primarily directed by the Saharan High over Africa, resulting in westward
    winds in the north and south-south-westward winds in the south (Kumar et al.,
    2015). Spring and summer bring a shift in weather patterns, with a low-pressure
    system known as the Persian Trough, an extension of the Indian summer monsoon
    trough, taking control from early June to September. During this time, high pressure
    shifts north-westward over the Mediterranean Sea, leading to the formation of
    a trough over the Arabian Peninsula and the emergence of strong north-westerly
    winds known as “Shamal” winds. From August to November, the thermal low over Asia
    weakens, and the high-pressure centre near North-eastern Africa moves south-eastward.
    The alternating influence of these air masses and seasonal shifts in pressure
    systems contribute to the diverse climate conditions experienced in the region.
    Moreover, the complex terrain of the region usually plays a significant role for
    the initiation of convective processes and therefore, convective precipitation
    is prevalent with wide spatial distributions especially around mountains (Kumar
    et al., 2015, Luong et al., 2020). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the strong
    morning surface winds result from the downward mixing of momentum from a night-time
    low-level jet to the surface, often causing dust emissions and reduced visibility
    (Francis, Mar. 2021, Nelli, et al., 2022). The prevailing large-scale winds in
    the UAE primarily blow from the northwest. During winter, the Arabian Gulf is
    affected by mid-latitude baroclinic systems, and after the passage of a cold front,
    north westerly winds strengthen due to the pressure gradient between the subtropical
    high to the west and the low pressure to the east. These events, known as winter
    Shamal events, happen frequently from December to early March, lasting either
    24–36 h or 3–5 days, depending on the behaviour of an upper-level trough in the
    region (Al Senafi and Anis, 2015). In the summer season, however, a pressure gradient
    between the monsoon trough extending from India to Pakistan and Iran and the subtropical
    high over the northern Arabian Peninsula leads to summer Shamal events. Although
    winter Shamal events are typically stronger, the summer ones play a more significant
    role in dust activities in the Arabian Peninsula (Abdi Vishkaee et al., 2012).
    Wind speed variability in the UAE shows a positive correlation from May to July
    with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) with a 6–7-year period (Nelli et al.,
    2022). The positive phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is also associated
    with weaker wind speeds in Abu Dhabi from September to November with a 5–6-year
    period. Moreover, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is positively correlated with
    wind speed in Abu Dhabi from November to January, with a 2–3-year period (Mohan,
    2020). However, these correlations vary spatially and are not consistent across
    all stations, indicating that the effects of these climate modes depend on location.
    Due to an association between the Arabian heat low (AHL) and midday sea-breeze
    circulation, summertime rainfall in the western United Arab Emirates (UAE) can
    happen, but seldom (Fonseca et al., 2022). This phenomenon is related to the intra-seasonal
    variability in the AHL''s strength, which is regulated by the active and break
    phases of the Indian monsoon, according to a study by Steinhoff et al. (Steinhoff,
    2018). In addition, Niranjan Kumar and Ouarda''s study from (Kumar et al., 2017,
    Niranjan Kumar and Ouarda, 2014) revealed that the region''s yearly precipitation
    changes greatly from year to year, with wetter conditions occurring during El
    Nino years and drier conditions occurring during La Nina years. Despite the relatively
    flat terrain in western UAE, the atmospheric conditions in this area are highly
    complex. Given the recent population growth in the region and the expected expansion
    of desert areas due to climate change, it is crucial to gain a deep understanding
    of the local meteorological environment and its variability over various time
    scales. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. System overview The proposed system consists
    of the following three modules as shown in Fig. 3 . The first module represents
    the input data preparation and pre-processing phase and the second module characterizes
    implementation and training of the machine learning algorithms on the rainfall
    data. The third module denotes the stacking of machine learning models to improve
    the prediction performance. The prediction results based on various evaluation
    metrics are depicted in the last module of the system. Download : Download high-res

    and system overview of the current study. 3.2. Machine learning models 3.2.1.
    LSTM LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN)
    that is designed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem commonly encountered
    in standard RNNs. The fundamental concept of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is
    the incorporation of “gates” within the network. These gates act as regulators,
    controlling the flow of information and enabling the LSTM to selectively remember
    or forget previous inputs as required during the learning process. The LSTM modules
    are comprised of three distinct types of gates: the input gate , the forget gate
    , and the output gate . The procedure for constructing the LSTM (Long Short-Term
    Memory) model is shown in Fig. 4. and also outlined through equations (1), (2),
    (3), (4), (5), (6). (1) Where and represents forget gate, weight of the forget
    gate, bias value, previous hidden state, and the new input value respectively.

    forest (RF) Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm utilized for various
    tasks like classification and regression. It operates by constructing numerous
    decision trees during training and outputs the mode of classes (in classification)
    or mean prediction (in regression) from the individual trees. The key concept
    behind Random Forest involves combining predictions from multiple decision trees
    to achieve enhanced accuracy and robustness. To accomplish this, Random Forest
    employs bagging (bootstrap aggregating), where subsets of the training data are
    randomly selected with replacement to train each decision tree. Additionally,
    feature randomization is used, selecting subsets of features at each tree split
    to reduce overfitting and improve tree diversity within the forest. The default
    procedure for constructing a Random Forest is as follows (Fig. 5): • Begin by
    randomly selecting a subset of features from the total features available. • Within
    this subset of features, identify the best split point for a node by maximizing
    information gain or employing another suitable criterion. • Divide the node into
    two child nodes based on the determined optimal split point. • Repeat steps 1
    to 3 for each child node, adhering to a stopping criterion like maximum tree depth
    or a minimum number of samples per leaf node. Download : Download high-res image

    The ultimate prediction from a Random Forest is generated by combining predictions
    from all individual trees within the forest. In classification tasks, the prediction
    is determined by the most frequently occurring class across all trees. In regression
    tasks, the prediction is calculated as the mean of the predictions from all the
    trees. 3.2.3. SVM regressor The Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor is a machine
    learning algorithm specifically designed for regression tasks. Its principle revolves
    around discovering a hyperplane that optimally separates data points in a high-dimensional
    feature space as depicted in Fig. 6. The primary objective of SVM Regressor is
    to identify the hyperplane that best fits the data points while minimizing the
    error between predicted and actual values. To accomplish this, the algorithm employs
    a technique known as the kernel trick, which involves mapping the original feature
    space into a higher-dimensional space for improved performance. Given a training
    dataset denoted as , where represents the input vector (representing model estimates)
    and represents the corresponding output (representing observations), with being
    the size of this dataset, the SVM regression function can be formulated as: (7)
    The SVM regression function incorporates a weight vector represented as , a bias
    term denoted as , and a nonlinear transformation function, , which maps the input
    space into a higher-dimensional feature space. Download : Download high-res image

    XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting
    algorithm designed to handle large-scale and high-dimensional data. It is a powerful
    machine learning algorithm that is widely used in industry for regression and
    classification tasks. The key idea behind XGBoost is to iteratively train weak
    learners (decision trees) and add them to a final strong learner as depicted in

    perceptron (MLP) MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) is a type of artificial neural network
    that is widely used in machine learning for both regression and classification
    tasks. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, each of which
    performs a nonlinear transformation on its input as shown in Fig. 8. MLPs consist

    regression algorithm that combines the L1 and L2 regularization techniques to
    balance their strengths and overcome their weaknesses. The L1 regularization technique,
    also known as Lasso, can lead to sparse solutions by forcing some of the regression
    coefficients to be exactly zero. However, it does not perform well when there
    are highly correlated features in the input data. On the other hand, the L2 regularization
    technique, also known as Ridge, can handle correlated features well but tends
    to shrink all the regression coefficients towards zero without eliminating any
    of them completely. Elastic Net aims to strike a balance between these two regularization
    techniques by adding a penalty term to the cost function that is a weighted sum
    of the L1 and L2 penalties as depincted in Equation (11) below. (11) In the above
    equation and represents number of data points, features, observed target value
    at ith data point, the predicted target value at point and the weight coefficient

    Boosting is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak prediction
    models to create a strong prediction model. Unlike other ensemble methods that
    combine models in a parallel fashion, Gradient Boosting uses an iterative approach
    where each new model is trained to correct the errors of the previous model. In
    this way, the algorithm builds a strong model by iteratively refining the predictions
    of the weak models as shown in Fig. 9. The basic idea of Gradient Boosting is
    to build an ensemble by iteratively adding weak learners to approximate the negative
    gradient of the loss function with respect to the current ensemble predictions..
    Mathematical representation of the gradient boosting prediction models is shown
    in Equation. (12) Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download : Download

    ridge regression Bayesian Ridge Regression is a linear regression algorithm that
    incorporates Bayesian principles to estimate the model parameters and handle uncertainty
    in the data. Unlike traditional linear regression, which uses point estimates
    for the parameters, Bayesian Ridge Regression uses a probabilistic model to represent
    the uncertainty in the parameters and compute posterior distributions over them.
    The simplified mathematical formulation for Bayesian Ridge Regression is depicted
    in Equation XX below. (13) The predicted target variable, denoted as , is calculated
    as a linear combination of the input features represented by the matrix , with
    the weights given by the vector w 3.3. Calibration of ML model parameters Calibration
    of ML model parameters is an essential and iterative process in rainfall prediction.
    It involves adjusting the values of various model parameters to achieve the best
    possible fit between the model''s outputs and observed rainfall data. The need
    for calibration arises due to the complex and localized nature of rainfall patterns,
    which can vary significantly from one region to another. By calibrating the ML
    model parameters, we can account for the unique characteristics of the study region,
    such as local topography, land cover, and atmospheric conditions, which influence
    rainfall patterns. The calibration process typically involves running the ML model
    with different parameter values and comparing the simulated rainfall against observed
    rainfall data. Various evaluation metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE),
    mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficients, have been used to assess
    the model''s performance. The goal is to identify the parameter values that minimize
    the discrepancies between the model predictions and observed rainfall. The calibrated
    parameters typically represent the optimized settings specific to the study region,
    maximizing the accuracy and reliability of rainfall predictions. These parameter
    values serve as a reference for future studies conducted in similar study regions,
    saving computational time and effort required for parameter optimization. Table
    2 shows the optimum values of various parameters for the ML models used in this
    study. It should be noted that these values were obtained after running multiple
    scenarios through a predefined ranges of the parameter values acquired from the
    available literature and essentially based on the best fit model that offered
    the minimum error values and maximum accuracy. Table 2. Optimum values of the

    overview of different machine learning (ML) models commonly used for various tasks,
    including classification and regression. Each model is described in terms of its
    parameters, basic structure, sensitivity, important factors, and potential use.
    XGBoost (XGB), LSTM, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines
    (SVM), Linear Regression, Elastic Net, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) are included
    in the analysis. These models offer diverse approaches to capturing patterns and
    making predictions. XGB and RF employ ensemble methods, LSTM leverages recurrent
    neural networks for temporal dependencies, SVM aims for optimal hyperplane separation,
    and MLP incorporates interconnected layers of nodes for non-linear relationships.
    Understanding the characteristics and potential use of each model is crucial for
    selecting the most appropriate approach based on specific requirements and dataset
    characteristics. Table 3. Critical evaluation of the selected ML algorithms. Model

    The input parameter used for univariate prediction was solely the observed precipitation.
    The model computes the prediction, denoted as Yi, by utilizing the real observed
    value Xi. To make predictions, the model takes into account the previous steps,
    and different steps were taken for the prediction purpose including 3, 6, and
    12 months. However, only the results from the 12 months previous time steps have
    been shown in this study based on their efficacy. 3.6. Multivariate prediction
    (MV) Unlike the univariate predictions, the selected ML models were tested with
    the multiple parameters as well namely, Wind Speed (WS), Maximum and Minimum Temperatures
    (MaxT, MinT), Average Temperature (AvgT), Relative Humidity (RH), and Potential
    Evapotranspiration (PE). The rest of the training criteria lies the same as in
    the univariate model. 3.7. Sensitivity analysis of the predictors To improve the
    prediction accuracy, it is crucial to identify the meteorological parameters that
    have the most significant influence on rainfall patterns. This task can be effectively
    addressed using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression
    analysis. LASSO regression is a powerful statistical technique that combines variable
    selection and regularization. It was developed as an extension of linear regression
    and has gained popularity in various fields due to its ability to handle high-dimensional
    datasets and perform feature selection simultaneously. LASSO regression promotes
    sparse solutions by encouraging coefficients of irrelevant or less important predictors
    to be exactly zero, effectively eliminating their impact on the prediction. In
    LASSO regression, the goal is to find the optimal set of predictors (meteorological
    parameters) that best explain the variability in monthly rainfall. The LASSO approach
    achieves this by minimizing the sum of squared errors (the residual sum of squares)
    while adding a penalty term that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values
    of the coefficients. This penalty term imposes a constraint on the magnitude of
    the coefficients, resulting in shrinkage towards zero. The key advantage of LASSO
    regression is that it automatically performs variable selection by setting some
    coefficients to zero, effectively excluding irrelevant predictors from the model.
    The strength of the penalty term (lambda or alpha) controls the degree of shrinkage
    and sparsity of the resulting model. As the penalty strength increases, more coefficients
    are set to zero, leading to a more parsimonious model with a reduced number of
    predictors. Equation 01 represents the general formulation that needs to be minimized.
    Eq. (1). Where, n represents the number of observations in the dataset, yi is
    the observed response variable for the ith observation, xij is the vector of predictor
    variables, βj represents the coefficients associated with each predictor variable,
    is the tuning parameter that controls the strength of the penalty term. 3.8. Data
    preparation Accurate data preparation is crucial for the development and evaluation
    of machine learning models. In this study, the following steps were undertaken
    to prepare the monthly rainfall data from 1991 to 2020 for training and testing
    the machine learning algorithms. The dataset was divided using an 80/20 training–testing
    split, with 80 % of the data used for training the models and 20 % for evaluating
    their performance. 3.8.1. Data collection The monthly rainfall data for the UAE
    from 1991 to 2020 was collected from National Center of Meteorology (NCM) Abu
    Dhabi and National Water and Energy Center (NWEC) of UAE University. This dataset
    contains the historical records of rainfall measurements for different regions
    in the UAE. 3.8.2. Data cleaning To ensure the quality and reliability of the
    data, a thorough data cleaning process was applied. This involved identifying
    and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Missing
    values were either imputed using appropriate techniques or removed from the dataset,
    depending on the extent of missingness and their potential impact on the analysis.
    3.8.3. Data normalization Machine learning algorithms often perform better when
    the input features are scaled to a similar range. To achieve this, the dataset
    was normalized using standardization or min–max scaling techniques. Standardization
    rescales the features to have zero mean and unit variance, while min–max scaling
    scales the features to a specified range (e.g., 0 to 1). 3.8.4. Train-test split
    To evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms, the dataset was
    split into training and testing subsets. The training subset, comprising 80 %
    of the data, was used to train and optimize the models, while the testing subset
    (remaining 20 %) was used to assess their generalization capability and predictive
    accuracy. It is important to note that the temporal order of the data was preserved
    during the split to mimic real-world scenarios where the model is trained on historical
    data and tested on future observations. 3.8.5. Data preprocessing Further preprocessing
    steps were applied to the training and testing subsets. This included reshaping
    the data into appropriate formats for the machine learning algorithms, such as
    converting it into numerical arrays or matrices. Additionally, any final adjustments,
    such as encoding categorical variables or addressing class imbalance, were performed
    during this stage. By following these rigorous data preparation steps, we ensured
    the reliability, consistency, and compatibility of the dataset for training and
    testing various machine learning algorithms. This facilitated accurate model development
    and robust evaluation of the rainfall prediction models over the UAE. 3.9. Model
    performance assessment The performance evaluation of the machine learning algorithms
    involved three key measures: correlation coefficient, Root Mean Squared Error
    (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The correlation coefficient assesses the
    strength and direction of the linear relationship between predicted and observed
    rainfall values, ranging from −1 to 1. A value close to 1 signifies a strong positive
    correlation, close to −1 indicates a strong negative correlation, and near 0 indicates
    a weak or no correlation. The correlation coefficient is calculated using the
    covariance and standard deviations of the predicted and actual rainfall values.
    However, it should be noted that this measure only captures linear relationships
    and may not account for nonlinear patterns in the data. The Root Mean Squared
    Error (RMSE) provides an estimation of the average magnitude of the prediction
    errors. It calculates the square root of the mean of the squared differences between
    the predicted and actual rainfall values. RMSE is sensitive to outliers as it
    squares the errors, giving more weight to larger errors. This measure is commonly
    used in regression tasks and provides a measure of the model''s overall accuracy.
    However, RMSE is not directly interpretable in the original units of the target
    variable and can be influenced by the scale of the data. The Mean Absolute Error
    (MAE) measures the average magnitude of the absolute differences between the predicted
    and actual rainfall values. It is calculated by taking the mean of the absolute
    differences. MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE since it does
    not square the errors. MAE provides a more interpretable measure of the model''s
    performance in the original units of the target variable. However, MAE does not
    distinguish between overestimation and underestimation and treats all errors equally.
    It is important to note that while these evaluation measures provide valuable
    insights into the performance of the machine learning algorithms for rainfall
    prediction, they have their limitations. The correlation coefficient only captures
    linear relationships and may not capture complex nonlinear patterns. RMSE is sensitive
    to outliers and can be influenced by the scale of the data, while MAE treats all
    errors equally and does not differentiate between overestimation and underestimation.
    Therefore, these measures are usually considered collectively, and the results
    are interpreted in conjunction with other evaluation metrics to gain a comprehensive
    understanding of the model efficiency. Table 4 lists the mathematical formulae
    of the three selected performance measures along with their ranges and best score.
    Table 4. Performance measures and their mathematical relationship. Performance
    Measure (s) Equation Range Best Value  Root Mean Square Error(mm)  – 0  Correlation

    and predicted values and their means are shown by and respectively and n is the
    number of observations. 4. Results and discussions 4.1. Univariate analysis In
    this step, we conducted an extensive evaluation of multiple machine learning (ML)
    models for the prediction of monthly rainfall. Initially, the focus was on utilizing
    only the rainfall parameter as a univariate predictor. The performance measures
    for stations 4 and 5 are shown in Fig. 10, Fig. 11 as the representatives of all
    the stations. The results obtained shed light on the performance of various models
    during both the training and testing periods. During the training phase, XGBoost
    (XGB) and ensemble models exhibited favorable performance, achieving a commendable
    correlation coefficient (CC) value of 0.87 and 0.88 respectively (Fig. 10). This
    indicates a strong association between the predicted and observed rainfall values
    during the training period. However, it is noteworthy that the performance of
    these models experienced a significant decline when applied to the testing period,
    with a maximum CC value of only 0.47 (Fig. 10). This decrease suggests a notable
    degradation in their predictive capabilities when faced with unseen data. In contrast,
    the performance of traditional linear regression, support vector machines (SVM),
    and elastic net models was unsatisfactory during the testing period. These models
    failed to capture the underlying patterns and relationships present in the rainfall
    data, resulting in poor predictive accuracy. Similarly for station 04 (Fig. 11),
    the results revealed a similar behavior for the training period. However, during
    the testing period, there was a slight increase in the accuracy of prediction
    for all the models. This might be attributed to the geographic location of station
    04 which lies in the mountainous region and therefore receives rainfall quite
    often although in small quantities. Similarly, the RMSE and MAE values followed
    a similar pattern as can be observed from Fig. 10, Fig. 11. Download : Download

    testing results for univariate model prediction for Station 04. The observed disparity
    in model performance between the training and testing periods can be attributed
    to several factors. Overfitting, a phenomenon in which models excessively adapt
    to the training data, is a potential explanation for the diminished performance
    during testing. Additionally, the lack of generalization ability of the models
    might have impeded their capability to effectively predict rainfall values in
    different temporal contexts. Moreover, it is possible that the training and testing
    datasets exhibited variations in their underlying distributions, which could have
    further impacted the models'' performance during the testing phase. To enhance
    the predictive accuracy of the models during the testing period, several steps
    can be taken. These include incorporating additional relevant features, such as
    historical rainfall patterns or meteorological data, to augment the predictive
    power of the models. Fig. 12 represents the time series plots for stations 4 and
    5 for the selected ML models and for a representative period from the study duration.
    The time series plots depict the observed and predicted monthly rainfall and clearly
    exhibit a notable disparity across the evaluated models. Specifically, the predicted
    values consistently underestimated the peak rainfall discharges. Furthermore,
    a significant lag was observed in capturing the peak values, indicating a delayed
    response in the predicted rainfall patterns compared to the observed data. This
    disparity between the observed and predicted values signifies the models'' limitations
    in accurately reproducing the extreme rainfall events. The underestimation of
    peak discharges suggests that the models may struggle to capture the magnitude
    of intense rainfall events, potentially due to inadequate representation of the
    underlying physical processes or the influence of additional factors beyond the
    available predictor variables. Additionally, the observed lag in the peak values
    implies that the models may not respond promptly to changes in rainfall patterns,
    resulting in a delay in predicting the occurrence and intensity of peak rainfall
    events. Download : Download high-res image (892KB) Download : Download full-size

    XGBoost (XGB) and Stacked models for a selected time duration. 4.2. Multivariate
    analysis In the subsequent section, the aim was to enhance the predictive performance
    of the machine learning (ML) models by incorporating multiple meteorological parameters,
    including Wind Speed (WS), Max and Min Temperature (MaxT & MinT), Average Temperature
    (AvgT), Relative Humidity (RH), and Potential Evapotranspiration (PET). This Multivariate
    Analysis (MV) was conducted using Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Gradient
    Boosting (GB), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the stacked models, which were
    selected based on their performance in the univariate analysis. The introduction
    of additional meteorological parameters resulted in substantial improvements in
    the models'' predictive accuracy, particularly during the testing period. Notably,
    XGB exhibited a significant increase in performance, with the correlation coefficient
    (CC) reaching 0.95 during the training phase and 0.76 during the testing phase
    (Fig. 13). Similarly, LSTM demonstrated enhanced performance, improving from a
    training CC of 0.68 to 0.75, and from a testing CC of 0.21 to 0.71. The stacked
    models also showcased promising behavior in both the training and testing phases.
    The inclusion of multiple meteorological parameters likely contributed to the
    observed improvements in model accuracy. These additional variables provide valuable
    contextual information and capture the intricate interplay between different meteorological
    factors, which can influence rainfall patterns. By incorporating these factors,
    the models gained a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes
    driving rainfall dynamics. Fig. 13 further reveals that during the training period,
    correlation values for XGB outperformed the values for all the stacked models
    which points out towards efficiency of the XGB model in accurately predicting
    the monthly rainfall under enhanced information scenario. Download : Download

    testing results for multivariate model prediction for Station 05. The enhanced
    accuracy can also be attributed to the models'' ability to capture the relationships
    and dependencies between the added meteorological parameters and rainfall. Wind
    speed, temperature, humidity, and evapotranspiration are known to have a significant
    impact on precipitation patterns, and their inclusion enabled the models to better
    capture the complex dynamics involved in rainfall prediction. The reduction in
    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values further confirmed
    the enhanced performance of the models. The decreased error metrics indicate that
    the models'' predictions were closer to the observed rainfall values, reflecting
    their improved accuracy and ability to estimate rainfall patterns more accurately.
    In a similar manner, the time series plots (Fig. 14) depicting the rainfall patterns
    for Station 04 and Station 05 revealed a strong correlation between the observed
    and predicted peak rainfall events, as well as their occurrence. These plots provided
    visual evidence of the individual and stacked models'' capability to accurately
    track the monthly rainfall patterns. The representative period showcased in these
    plots clearly demonstrated the models'' ability to capture the overall trend and
    variability in monthly rainfall. The models successfully replicated the observed
    rainfall patterns, aligning closely with the peaks and fluctuations observed in
    the data. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 14. Multivariate time series predictions of Random Forest (RF), LSTM,
    XGBoost (XGB) and Stacked models for a selected time duration. However, it is
    important to note that at Station 05, there were a few instances where the models
    underestimated the magnitude of certain peak rainfall events by a small margin.
    Despite this minor discrepancy, the models still exhibited a commendable overall
    performance in replicating the rainfall patterns at Station 05. This slight underestimation
    of certain peaks by all the models at Station 05 may stem from several factors.
    It is possible that these specific events were influenced by localized or unique
    atmospheric conditions that were not fully captured by the available predictor
    variables. Additionally, the complexity and inherent variability of rainfall processes
    make it challenging to precisely predict extreme events, leading to some degree
    of uncertainty in peak rainfall estimation. Nevertheless, the models'' ability
    to closely match the observed rainfall patterns for most of the time series reinforces
    their effectiveness in capturing the general characteristics and trends in monthly
    rainfall at both Station 04 and Station 05. Additionally, Fig. 14 also displays
    the ability of stacked model to capture the peak rainfall events better than the
    all the individual models. Fig. 15 (a) provides a comprehensive depiction of the
    ML models'' performance, comparing the transition from univariate to multivariate
    analysis in terms of percent increase or decrease across three performance measures.
    The panel representing the percent difference in correlation coefficient (cc)
    highlights noteworthy findings during the testing period, with RF and LSTM models
    demonstrating a substantial surge in cc values (27 % and 26 % respectively). However,
    it is important to note that the increase in cc values during the training period
    did not exceed 10 % for any of the models. In contrast, the analysis of root mean
    squared error (RMSE) values exhibited significant consistency in the decrease
    of errors for both the training and testing periods, ranging from −11 % to −17
    %. This indicates a notable improvement in predictive accuracy across all models.
    Conversely, for mean absolute error (MAE), the decrease in error values exceeded
    20 %, particularly for the Gradient Boost and stacked models. Download : Download

    analysis. Bar charts and individual model comparison (a), boxplots representation
    (b). The consistent decrease in RMSE values for both the training and testing
    periods signifies the models'' improved precision in estimating the magnitude
    of rainfall events. This reduction in error suggests that the models'' predictions
    align more closely with the observed rainfall values. Similarly, the substantial
    decrease in MAE values, especially for the Gradient Boost and stacked models,
    indicates a significant improvement in the models'' ability to accurately estimate
    the absolute errors between predicted and observed rainfall. This reduction in
    MAE demonstrates the enhanced predictive capabilities achieved through the incorporation
    of multiple meteorological parameters. A quick overview of the whole performance
    difference can also be observed in the form of simple box plots in Fig. 15 (b).
    The scatter plots (Fig. 16) provide valuable insights into the performance of
    the ML models, comparing the univariate and multivariate analyses. These plots
    illustrate the relationship between the observed and predicted rainfall values,
    allowing for a visual assessment of the models'' accuracy. The multivariate scatter
    plots reveal a reduced scatter and a narrower spread of data points compared to
    the univariate scatter plots. This indicates a higher degree of precision in predicting
    rainfall values when multiple meteorological parameters are incorporated into
    the models. Overall, the scatter plots demonstrate that the transition from univariate
    to multivariate analysis enhances the models'' ability to reproduce the observed
    rainfall patterns more accurately. The tighter clustering of data points and improved
    alignment between observed and predicted values in the multivariate scatter plots
    indicate the positive impact of including additional meteorological parameters
    in the modeling process. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    we extend the focus beyond traditional monthly rainfall forecasting and explore
    the domain of seasonal predictions for an arid region. Understanding and predicting
    the seasonal distribution of rainfall specifically during Winter, Spring, Summer,
    and Autumn, constitutes a critical facet of climate research (S. Yang, F. Ling,
    Y. Li, and J.-J. Luo, “Improving Seasonal Prediction of Summer Precipitation in
    the Middle–Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Using a TU-Net Deep Learning Approach,”
    Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems, vol. 2, no. 2, Jun., 2023, Deman
    et al., 2022). Seasonal variations in precipitation patterns have profound implications
    for various sectors, including agriculture, water resource management, and disaster
    preparedness. As climate change continues to manifest, unraveling the intricacies
    of seasonal rainfall becomes imperative for informed decision-making and sustainable
    resource utilization (He et al., Sep. 2022, Le, et al., 2023). By incorporating
    machine learning techniques into our methodology, we aim to enhance the precision
    and reliability of seasonal rainfall predictions, thereby contributing to a more
    robust understanding of the climatic dynamics in arid regions. Fig. 17 showcase
    time series graphs illustrating the predicted rainfall patterns across the four
    seasons, providing a comprehensive analysis of the climatic trends that shape

    Dark black line shows the observed rainfall for the four seasons while the colored
    lines represent the predicted rainfall for Random Forest, LSTM, XGB, and the stacked
    model. The graphical representation elucidates a marginal underestimation in the
    forecasted seasonal rainfall across all models when juxtaposed with the observed
    values. Within the context of Al Ain station (station 04), both the XGB and stacked
    models demonstrated a comparably closer alignment with the observed values during
    the winter and spring months. Evidently, the summer and autumn months exhibit
    a relatively drier climate within the study area, and noteworthy is the commendable
    performance of nearly all models during periods of low rainfall. Conversely, in
    the case of Fujairah (station 05), the Random Forest (RF) model exhibited the
    lowest accuracy, while the stacked and XGB models portrayed the highest precision,
    echoing the trends observed for station 04. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to
    observe that the models exhibited discernible proficiency during months characterized
    by reduced precipitation, namely summer and autumn. Notably, a collective observation
    emerges, indicating that the models struggled to accurately predict peak rainfall
    events, as evidenced by the prediction boxes for winter and spring months in Fig.
    17.The underestimation observed in machine learning models across all four seasons
    in the study region can be attributed to inherent challenges in capturing the
    complex dynamics of rainfall. Sparse and irregular rainfall patterns and characteristics
    of arid climates pose difficulties for models, especially those relying on linear
    relationships, to discern the non-linear and sporadic nature of precipitation
    events. Local factors such as topography, land use, and vegetation cover, which
    significantly influence rainfall, may not be adequately incorporated. Additionally,
    the models may oversimplify the intricate atmospheric processes governing rainfall,
    leading to inaccuracies. Finally, the limited input features and the potential
    omission of crucial meteorological variables can further hinder accurate predictions.
    4.4. Sensitivity analysis In order to conduct a sensitivity analysis for monthly
    rainfall prediction, LASSO regression was employed. The results of this analysis
    revealed that two meteorological parameters, namely wind speed and minimum temperature,
    exhibit the highest sensitivity in relation to the prediction of monthly rainfall.
    The sensitivity values obtained from LASSO regression were normalized to a scale
    ranging from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates the highest sensitivity and
    0 represents the lowest sensitivity. Notably, wind speed and minimum temperature
    obtained sensitivity scores of 0.8 and 0.75, respectively (Fig. 18). These findings
    emphasize the importance of wind speed and minimum temperature as influential
    factors in accurately predicting monthly rainfall. Download : Download high-res

    the sensitivity analysis using LASSO regression carry particular significance.
    Arid regions are characterized by limited water availability and are highly sensitive
    to changes in rainfall patterns. Understanding the influential meteorological
    parameters for monthly rainfall prediction in such regions is crucial for effective
    water resource management, agriculture, and ecosystem sustainability. The identification
    of wind speed and minimum temperature as the most sensitive parameters for monthly
    rainfall prediction in the arid study region underscores their importance in driving
    rainfall dynamics. Wind speed plays a vital role in the transport of moisture
    and atmospheric circulation patterns, which can significantly impact the formation
    and distribution of rainfall events. Variations in wind speed can influence the
    moisture influx and subsequent rainfall patterns in arid regions, making it a
    key factor for accurate prediction. Similarly, minimum temperature is a critical
    parameter in arid regions due to its influence on evaporation rates, soil moisture
    levels, and atmospheric stability. Low minimum temperatures can affect the condensation
    process and the formation of clouds, potentially leading to changes in rainfall
    patterns. Understanding the sensitivity of minimum temperature in relation to
    monthly rainfall prediction enables better insight into the climatic processes
    governing precipitation in arid regions. 5. Conclusion In this study, a comprehensive
    analysis of machine learning (ML) models for monthly rainfall prediction was conducted.
    The investigation involved both univariate and multivariate analyses, considering
    various meteorological parameters. Through rigorous evaluation and comparison,
    valuable insights were gained into the performance, strengths, and limitations
    of the ML models. During the univariate analysis, XGBoost (XGB) and ensemble models
    demonstrated promising results during the training period, achieving a correlation
    coefficient (CC) of 0.88. However, their performance declined during the testing
    phase, with a maximum CC value of 0.45. Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines
    (SVM), and Elastic Net models exhibited poor performance in both training and
    testing periods. To address these limitations, a multivariate analysis as adopted,
    incorporating additional meteorological parameters such as wind Speed, temperature,
    humidity, and evapotranspiration. This approach allowed for a more comprehensive
    understanding of the factors influencing monthly rainfall patterns. The results
    showed substantial improvements in the models'' performance during the testing
    period. XGB achieved a training CC of 0.95 and a testing CC of 0.76, while LSTM
    improved from 0.68 to 0.75 during training and from 0.21 to 0.71 during testing.
    Additionally, all the stacked models exhibited promising behavior in both training
    and testing phases. The root mean squared error (RMSE) values were significantly
    reduced, indicating enhanced predictive accuracy, and the mean absolute error
    (MAE) values also decreased by more than 20 % for certain models. Further analysis
    using LASSO regression allowed us to assess the importance of meteorological parameters
    in monthly rainfall prediction. The sensitivity analysis revealed that wind speed
    and minimum temperature were identified as the most sensitive parameters, highlighting
    their significant roles in accurately predicting rainfall. This knowledge is particularly
    valuable in the context of an arid study region, where understanding the influential
    factors in rainfall dynamics is crucial for effective water resource management
    and sustainability. For instance, minimum temperature plays a crucial role in
    determining the atmospheric conditions necessary for precipitation. As temperature
    decreases, the air''s capacity to hold moisture decreases, leading to the condensation
    and formation of clouds. Lower minimum temperatures can create a favorable environment
    for moisture to condense and result in rainfall. Therefore, variations in minimum
    temperature can significantly impact the likelihood and intensity of rainfall
    events in arid regions. Secondly, wind speed plays a vital role in moisture transport
    and circulation patterns within the atmosphere. It affects the movement of air
    masses, the advection of moisture from different regions, and the formation and
    dispersion of clouds. In arid regions, wind patterns play a crucial role in determining
    the availability and distribution of moisture. Higher wind speeds can enhance
    the advection of moisture, leading to increased chances of rainfall. Conversely,
    lower wind speeds may inhibit moisture transport and reduce the likelihood of
    precipitation. The findings reveal XGBoost and LSTM as particularly successful
    models for predicting monthly rainfall in the study area. XGBoost, a gradient
    boosting algorithm, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural
    network, demonstrated superior performance compared to other models considered
    in our study. These models exhibited robustness in capturing the complex temporal
    relationships inherent in rainfall data, resulting in more accurate predictions.
    Specifically, the ensemble nature of XGBoost and the ability of LSTM to learn
    long-term dependencies in sequential data proved advantageous for monthly rainfall
    forecasting in hyper-arid environments. The identification of XGBoost and LSTM
    as the most effective models represents a significant scientific finding, highlighting
    their potential for improving rainfall prediction in similar climatic contexts.
    By serving as a benchmark for future studies, our research contributes to advancing
    the understanding and application of machine learning techniques in the domain
    of rainfall forecasting, particularly in regions characterized by extreme aridity..
    Additionally, the study''s identification of key meteorological drivers, such
    as wind speed and minimum temperature, enhances our understanding of the factors
    influencing surface water dynamics. The research is pivotal for water resources
    management and climate adaptation in hyper-arid regions like the UAE. Given the
    increasing frequency of extreme weather events and climate change, accurate rainfall
    forecasts are indispensable for sustainable water resource management and climate
    resilience. Through our investigation, we assess machine learning and ensemble
    models for monthly rainfall prediction, aiming to improve hyper-arid rainfall
    forecasts. These models show promise in enhancing forecast accuracy, crucial for
    informed water resource allocation and climate adaptation planning. Our study
    also aids policymakers, water resource managers, and stakeholders by providing
    timely and precise monthly rainfall patterns, enabling proactive measures to mitigate
    water scarcity and drought. Additionally, our research sheds light on the potential
    of machine learning to bolster traditional rainfall forecasting methods, bolstering
    adaptive capabilities in hyper-arid communities and institutions. In conclusion,
    this study highlights the potential of ML models in monthly rainfall prediction.
    The incorporation of additional meteorological parameters significantly improved
    the models'' performance during the testing phase, enabling better estimation
    of rainfall patterns. The identification of influential factors, such as wind
    speed and minimum temperature, through sensitivity analysis contributes to a deeper
    understanding of the complex interactions driving rainfall dynamics, especially
    in arid regions. While our findings demonstrate the progress made in monthly rainfall
    prediction, further research is warranted to refine and enhance the models'' accuracy.
    Future studies may explore advanced ensemble techniques, incorporate additional
    relevant variables, and consider domain-specific knowledge to further improve
    the models'' performance. These efforts will support better decision-making in
    various sectors relying on accurate rainfall predictions, including agriculture,
    water resource management, and climate adaptation strategies. Funding This research

    1. Value of the Data • The dataset constitutes a reference basis to evaluate the
    effects of DI strategies on the yield and quality of industrial tomatoes grown
    in a Mediterranean area. Its peculiarity lies in the homogenous measurements of
    agro-physiological traits from nine years of field experiments, which have been
    complemented with physical soil properties, daily weather variables, and detailed
    irrigation scheduling. • This dataset is useful to scientists who develop and
    use agro-physiological models reproducing the effects of pedo-climatic conditions
    and soil water availability on the growth and development of industrial tomatoes.
    They can be used either for model calibration and evaluation or as a reference
    background to develop new process-based simulation models. • Agronomists and technicians
    from extension services in the area could benefit from this dataset where yield
    and major quality tomato traits are harmonized. They can use these data to gain
    knowledge and elaborate the best DI strategies to support farmers facing situations
    of water scarcity and high temperatures as a consequence of climatic changes.
    • The dataset can be used to test and validate the performances of commercial
    or public digital decision support systems to optimize irrigation water use for
    growing industrial tomato, which is one of the most cultivated and water-demanding
    crops in Southern Italy. 2. Background Italy is the largest tomato producer in
    Europe and a major tomato producing country worldwide, along with China, India,
    Turkey, and the United States. Most Italian tomato production occurs in the Capitanata
    plain in Southern Italy, where tomato cultivation is very intensive, especially
    regarding irrigation water requirements, which typically range from 400 to 600
    mm. During the growing season (May–August), tomato plants face significant challenges
    due to low precipitation, leading to frequent water stress during critical growth
    phases. According to climatic projections in Mediterranean areas, groundwater
    availability will be restricted, requiring better rationalization of water use
    to sustain tomato yields and quality. Currently, tomato farming irrigation scheduling
    involves fixed intervals between irrigation supplies regardless of the crop water
    demand, which results in over-irrigation. Therefore, it is necessary to improve
    water use efficiency by adopting water-saving strategies, such as deficit irrigation.
    3. Data Description This dataset has been collected during multi-year field trials
    conducted to assess the effect of alternative DI strategies on industrial tomato.
    DI is a widely investigated farming strategy that reduces water applications below
    optimal crop requirements during the crop cycle without compromising production
    [1,2]. The dataset comprises 100 experimental plots carried out in nine years
    and entails 32 DI treatments. The treatments include nine controls (well-watered),
    15 constant DI treatments (i.e., same irrigation regime during the crop cycle),
    and eight variable DI treatments. The dataset is released as a Microsoft Excel
    file (extension .xlsx) organized in eight sheets (Table 1) corresponding to the
    main typologies of data, i.e., irrigation water scheduling (volume and timing),
    physical soil characteristics, daily weather data, and agro-physiological variables
    (i.e., phenology, stomatal conductance, crop temperature, crop yield, and quality).

    Design, Materials and Methods 4.1. The field experimental design All field trials
    were conducted on a farm located in the Capitanata area (N 41° 32’ 37”; E 15°
    30’ 13”, Apulia, Southern Italy) in 2005–2006 and from 2012 to 2018, on industrial
    tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cv. Ulisse F1 (S&G Syngenta Seeds S.p.A., Switzerland).
    Tomato plants have been transplanted in coupled rows spaced at 1.8 m, with a plant
    density of 2.8 plants m−2 (0.50 m between rows, 0.40 m on the row). A randomized
    block design was applied in all experiments, with three or four replications (blocks),
    and testing different deficit irrigation regimes. In the experimental years 2005–2006
    and from 2012 to 2016, the tomato water consumption was calculated considering
    measurements of soil water tension at the effective rooting depth (soil layer
    depths: 0–20, 20–40, 40–50, and 50–60 cm), using WATERMARK sensors (PN:200SS,
    Irrometer Company, Inc.; Riverside, CA). These sensors were installed in each
    control plot before transplanting. In the experimental years 2017–2018, the cloud-based
    decision support system Bluleaf™ (Sysman Progetti e Servizi Srl, Rome, Italy),
    was used to estimate the tomato water consumption. This system is based on real-time
    acquisition of weather and soil moisture (0.3 m and 0.6 m depth) data collected
    by wireless sensors (AgriSense™, Netsens, Florence, Italy), which are used to
    compute daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc, mm d−1). Daily reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0, mm d−1) was calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation [4], using crop
    coefficient (Kc) values specific to Mediterranean environments. ETc was estimated
    as ET0 × Kc, following the FAO two-step procedure [4]. In all experimental years,
    the irrigation was triggered when soil humidity fell below 40 % of the available
    water depletion until soil water content was set to field capacity. A drip irrigation
    system was used, as a single plastic pipe arranged in the middle of each paired
    row, with drippers of 2 L h–1 flow rate spaced every 0.4 m. Additionally, volumetric
    flow meters were used to monitor the distributed water volumes for each irrigation
    regime. The fertilisation practices and the pest and weed control replicated farmers’
    typical management in the area, aiming at growing the crop without any abiotic
    and biotic stress. A detailed description of the field experimental trials follows.
    4.2. Experimental years 2005–2006 Tomato plants were hand-transplanted on April
    28 (2005) and on May 2nd (2006). The field trials comprised five deficit irrigation
    regimes plus a control where 100 % of the tomato water consumption was restored
    (named 100 %). Two constant DI treatments were applied, restoring 50 % and 75
    % of the tomato water consumption. Three additional variable DI treatments were
    tested, where 50 %, 75 % and 50 % (named 507550 %), 75%, 100%, and 75% (named
    7510075 %), and of 50 %, 100 %, and 50 % (named 5010050 %) of the crop water consumption
    has been restored. These treatments have been differentiated in the three main
    crop phenological stages: from the end of transplanting shock to flowering of
    the first truss (S1); from the flowering of the first truss to fruit breaking
    colours of the first truss (S2); and from fruit breaking colours of the first
    truss to harvest (S3), respectively. The fresh fruits were hand-harvested on July
    31 (2005) and on August 14 (2006). 4.3. Experimental years 2012, and 2014–2016
    Tomato plants were hand-planted on April 25 (2012), April 28 (2014), April 29
    (2015) and April 27 (2016). The field trials comprised the 100 % control treatment
    and a constant DI treatment where 75 % of the crop water consumption was restored
    during the crop cycle (named 75 %). The fresh fruits were hand-harvested on August
    3 (2012), August 7 (2014), August 3 (2015), and on August 4 (2016). 4.4. Experimental
    year 2013 Tomato plants were hand-transplanted on April 29 (2013). This field
    trial comprised three DI treatments, plus the 100 % control treatment. The constant
    DI treatments were 0 %, irrigated only at transplanting and during fertigation,
    and 50 % and 75 %, which were characterized by restoring 50 % and 75 % of the
    tomato water consumption, respectively. The fresh fruits were hand-harvested on
    July 31 (2005) and on August 14 (2006). 4.5. Experimental years 2017–2018 Tomato
    plants were hand-transplanted on May 3 (2017) and April 27 (2018). The field trials
    tested three DI treatments plus the 100 % control treatment. Two constant deficit
    irrigation regimes were applied: 0 %, irrigated only at transplanting and during
    fertigation, and restoring 75% of the tomato water consumption. An additional
    variable irrigation regime was applied: 7550 %, restoring 75 % (S1–S2) and 50
    % (S2–S3), of the tomato water consumption. The fresh fruits were hand-harvested
    on July 31 (2005) and on August 14 (2006). 4.6. Data collection Soil physical
    characteristics were evaluated by taking samples at 0–0.4 m depth before transplanting.
    Soil analyses were performed following the standard procedure from Italian Ministerial
    Decree, 1999 [5]. Daily values of maximum and minimum air temperature (°C), rainfall
    (mm), global solar radiation (MJ m−2 d−1), maximum and minimum relative air humidity
    (%), and average wind speed (m s−1) were recorded from May to August (Fig. 1)
    by a weather station placed close to the experimental trials. The phenological
    stages of post-transplanting (S0), vegetative growth (S1), beginning of flowering
    (S2), and fruit setting (S3) have been recorded by weekly visual inspections,
    and set when 50 % of the plants reached a given phenological stage. During S2,
    canopy temperature has been measured between 12:00 a.m. and 01:00 p.m. (i.e.,
    at maximum sunlight intensity) on June 13 (2005), June 26 (2006), June 18 and
    July 2nd (2012), July 1st (2013), June 30 and July 3rd and 14 (2014), June 25,
    July 2nd, 6, 8, 13, and 15 (2015), and June 24 and 27, and July 4, 6, 11 and 13
    (2016). Canopy and air temperatures were recorded using an infrared thermometer
    with a spectral response of 8 mm to 14 mm (Scheduler Model 2; Delta-T Devices
    Ltd.); these values were used to calculate the crop water stress index (CWSI)
    [6]. In the Experimental year 2012, stomatal conductance (mol m–2 s–1) was measured
    during S2 stage (June 18th and July 2nd). Measures were taken underside the first
    fully expanded leaf [7] using a steady-state diffusion porometer (Model SC-1;
    Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) and randomly selecting ten leaves per replicate.
    Tomatoes were hand-harvest when the rate of ripe fruits reached approximately
    95 %; the following morpho-physiological traits were measured on six plants per
    plot: the weight of ripe (marketable production), unripe (green production), and
    rotten fruits (rotten production), the total production as the sum of marketable,
    green and rotten production, and the mean fruit weight. Ten ripe fruits per replication
    were randomly chosen for the quality measurements. The colour parameters were
    measured using a CM-700d spectrophotometer (Minolta Camera Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan),
    as the CIELAB coordinates (i.e., a*, b*) on two opposite sides of the middle part
    of the fruit surface. Total soluble solids (°Brix) were measured with a hand-held
    refractometer with automatic temperature compensation (mod. DBR35, XS INSTRUMENTS,
    Carpi, Italy). Titratable acidity (g citric acid 100 ml−1 fresh juice) and pH
    were measured according to AOAC Official method 942.15 and 981.21, respectively
    [8]. Limitations One limitation of this dataset is the absence of multiple leaf
    area index and fruit biomass samples throughout the growing season. This constraint
    hampers the ability to calibrate the daily dynamic progress of tomato growth precisely.
    However, the dataset compensates for this limitation by offering harvested yield
    data across various conditions. This enables crop modelers to obtain reliable
    insights into the impact of alternative deficit irrigation regimes under diverse
    tomato growing conditions. Ethics Statement Authors have read and follow the ethical

    16 June 2022 1 Introduction Urban flood disasters threaten the safety of people’s
    lives and property around the world and hinder the sustainable development of
    society and the economy (Wu et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2020). The 7·20 rainstorm and
    waterlogging event in Zhengzhou City shocked the world. The extreme rainstorm
    caused 292 deaths in the city and the Direct economic losses amounted to $8 billion
    (Wang et al. 2022). Accurate flood forecasting is an important non-engineering
    measure for flood prevention and disaster reduction (Mignot and Dewals 2022; Wu
    et al. 2021). In terms of non-engineering measures, through real-time high-precision
    urban flood models or systems, accurate and effective early warning and forecasting
    of an urban storm and flood processes have become the key to reducing disaster
    losses (Cappato et al. 2022; Qi et al. 2022). The measured precipitation-runoff
    data with the high temporal and spatial resolution is the basis for reliable and
    accurate simulation and forecasting of urban flood models (Xu et al. 2023). The
    number of existing urban hydrological stations, monitoring capabilities and station
    network density, especially the serious lack of real-time monitoring of urban
    pipeline flow, is far from meeting the needs of urban flood warning and forecasting
    in the context of rapid urbanization (Yao et al. 2022). Because the calibration
    and verification problems in the modeling process of the urban storm flood model
    are directly related to the reliability of urban flood simulation (Sun et al.
    2022). The research on conducting rapid and efficient flood simulation in urban
    areas with limited or no data has always been a prominent focus in the field of
    urban storm flood simulation and forecasting (Bouizrou et al. 2021; Li et al.
    2020; Luan et al. 2019). Different from watershed hydrological models, the urban
    stormwater model requires more forecast and early warning information, such as
    the location and duration of waterlogging (Wang et al. 2021). Meanwhile, urban
    stormwater model development is mostly based on distributed concept (Brown et
    al. 2022; Gironas et al. 2010), resulting in spatial scale dependence of urban
    stormwater model (Beven and Cloke 2012). The underlying surface conditions of
    urban areas are complex, and the law of production and confluence has strong characteristics
    of human activities (Bouizrou et al. 2021). The division method and number of
    several sub-catchment areas have a great influence on the parameter tuning process
    of the model (Miller and Hutchins 2017). Assuming that the model has n parameters
    and the number of sub-catchments is N, Nn times of selection will be made for
    each parameter adjustment. The difficulty of parameter calibration will increase
    exponentially as the number of catchment areas increases, which is defined as
    \"parameter explosion\" by Liu et al. (2023). There is a significant correlation
    between underlying surface conditions and model parameters, which is not only
    the basic support of sub-catchments division, but also the physical support of
    SWMM parameters (Liwanag et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2020). With the transformation
    of the original underlying surface conditions by intense human activities, the
    spatial executive function of urban areas is transformed from natural to social
    (Du 2020). The law of production and flow confluence in urban areas changes obviously,
    and the model parameters have significant distribution characteristics of social
    attributes. The concept of \"urban functional zoning\" is exactly the division
    of regions according to the social dominant functions of cities, such as industrial
    areas, commercial areas, residential areas, leisure and entertainment areas, etc.,
    which is the regional differentiation combination of various material elements
    (Liu and Peng 2010). The urban functional area is a relatively independent organic
    whole with reasonable composition and layout, which well contains the characteristics
    of the underlying surface of \"social dominance—natural coordination\" of the
    urban area. Flood forecasting is one of the important non-engineering measures
    for flood control and disaster reduction, and the construction of urban storm
    flood model is the cornerstone of flood forecasting and early warning work (Ma
    et al. 2022; Reggiani et al. 1999). From the 1970s to the 1980s, representative
    urban storm flood models such as SWMM, ICM (Integrated Catchment Management) and
    MIKE models have been produced and widely used (Mei 2019). To achieve the purpose
    of rapid modeling and simulation of urban storm flood, In the process of building
    the urban storm flood management model, it is a recognized method to calibrate
    and verify model parameters based on a large number of measured flood events (Sun
    et al. 2022). However, this method needs to continuously adjust each sub-catchment
    according to the flood results, which is very time-consuming and complicated (Wu
    et al. 2021; Zaghloul 1983). Liu (2009) pointed out that an urban rainfall-runoff
    model verification method based on runoff coefficients was put forward under conditions;
    The model parameter calibration method combining surface runoff field observations
    and flood investigations has also been affirmed (Luan et al. 2017); With the help
    of physical processes and rainfall-runoff evolution mechanism research, Fu et
    al. (2020) obtained a verification method by generalizing the geometry of stagnant
    water. These methods are mainly used to deduce the model parameters through parameter
    transplantation, correlation analysis, empirical formulas, etc., and have achieved
    good results, but the complexity of manual parameter adjustment is still unavoidable.
    Ma et al. (2022) proposed a real-time correction method of uncertain parameters
    for flood process based on SWMM and neural network; Yuan et al. (2021) achieved
    automatic calibration of SWMM parameters based on BP (Back Propagation) neural
    network algorithm. Hou et al. (2021) introduced GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
    to accelerate parallel computing based on the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic
    model, and successfully applied it in Xixian New Area, Shaanxi Province. Ekwueme
    (2022) successfully addressed the vulnerability of selected rivers to flooding
    in the southeastern region of Nigeria through the application of machine learning
    methods. With the help of machine learning algorithms (Bassi et al. 2023a, b)
    and high-performance computers, the calibration efficiency of SWMM parameters
    can be improved to a certain extent. Liwanag et al. (2018) used GIS and SWMM to
    simulate the urban flooding of the Luinab catchment in Iligan City, Philippines.
    (Jato-Espino et al. 2018) accurately reproduced the severe storm flood event in
    Espo, Finland, using GIS and rainfall model. This shows that the support of GIS
    technology can enhance the functionality of urban storm flood model. These studies
    show that deep learning technology and GIS technology have broad application prospects
    in urban storm flood simulation. However, the coupling mode between deep learning
    and GIS technology and storm flood model needs to be further explored. We have
    developed a new model called K-SWMMG, which is based on the SWMM model and incorporates
    the k-means clustering algorithm and GIS spatial analysis techniques. This model
    enables two-dimensional simulation of urban flooding. When constructing the k-SWMMG
    model, we considered the subdivision method of urban sub-basins in conjunction
    with urban functional zones, which better reflects the complex underlying surface
    attributes of the city. The k-means clustering algorithm is used to explore patterns
    in the prior parameter samples and combines the principle of assigning model parameters
    with the values of individual urban functional zones. This approach avoids the
    tedious and complex repetitive adjustment of model parameters. The aim of this
    study is to provide new ideas and methods for urban rainfall-flood simulation.
    2 Methods and Materials 2.1 SWMM SWMM is a rainfall-runoff model developed by
    the US Environment Agency in 1971 (Gironas et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2020) and has
    been continuously improved for the simulation of single precipitation events or
    long-term water flow in cities (Ma et al. 2022). The dynamic wave method is used
    in the simulation of channel and pipe flow routings of SWMM model, and is governed
    by the Saint-Venant equations (Mei 2019) as shown in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2: $$\\frac{\\partial
    A}{{\\partial t}} + \\frac{\\partial Q}{{\\partial x}} = 0$$ (1) $$\\frac{\\partial
    Q}{{\\partial t}} + \\frac{{\\partial (Q^{2} /A)}}{\\partial x} + gA\\frac{\\partial
    H}{{\\partial x}} + gAS_{f}$$ (2) where Q is the flow rate in m3/s, A is the flow
    cross-sectional area in m2, H is water depth in m, x is the longitudinal distance
    in m, t denotes time in s, g is the acceleration of gravity in m/s2, and Sf is
    the friction slope. Accurate parameter calibration is the key to the successful
    establishment of SWMM in a region. SWMM parameters can be divided into deterministic
    parameters and uncertain parameters (Du 2020) (As shown in Table 1). Deterministic
    parameter values are obtained from field measurements or software analysis, and
    uncertainty parameter values are usually calibrated and determined by using observed
    rainfall and runoff data on the basis of empirical parameters (Moriasi et al.
    2007; Sun et al. 2022). Des-perv and Des-imperv respectively represent the storage
    depths of depressions in the pervious and impervious sub-catchments. Max.Infilt,
    Min.Infilt, Decay con, and Drytime collectively reflect the subsurface infiltration
    capacity in the Hortonian runoff model. N-perv and N-imperv reflect the resistance
    encountered by precipitation when passing through the pervious and impervious
    sub-catchments. Table 1 SWMM parameter information Full size table 2.2 K-means
    Clustering Algorithm K-Means clustering algorithm is a machine learning analysis
    algorithm for iterative solution, which divides sample data into multiple different
    computing processes according to the similarity of the characteristics of the
    samples in the known data set (Hu et al. 2021; Singh and Patel 2023). The computational
    process of K-means clustering is shown in Fig. 1. The K-means algorithm solves
    the problem of partitioning a set X containing n data points into K classes \\(C_{j}\\),
    where j = 1, 2, 3, …, K. The set X is represented as \\(X = \\{ x_{1} ,x_{2} ,...,x_{n}
    \\}\\). The uncertainty parameters of SWMM model has implicit clustering. The
    k-means clustering algorithm is used to divide the uncertainty parameter crowdsourcing
    data matrix into mutually exclusive types, so that the parameter characteristics
    in each type correspond to the lower urban functional area. During application,
    K sample points need to be randomly selected as K initial clustering centers,
    and then the cost function is defined: $$E = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{K} {\\sum\\limits_{{x_{i}
    = c_{i} }} {\\left\\| {x_{i} - c_{i} } \\right\\|^{2} } }$$ (3) where \\(x_{i}\\)
    represents a data object, \\(c_{i}\\) denotes the centroid of class \\(C_{i}\\),
    and E represents the sum of squared errors of all objects in the dataset. This
    objective function uses the Euclidean distance. Fig. 1 Flowchart of the K-Means
    clustering algorithm Full size image The process description of the K-means clustering
    algorithm is as follows: ① Select K initial cluster centers as mode feature vectors:
    \\(z_{1}^{(0)} ,z_{2}^{(0)} ,...,z_{c}^{(0)}\\). ② Assign each pattern in the
    pattern recognition feature vector set \\(\\{ \\overrightarrow {{x_{i} }} \\}\\)
    to a class in K based on the minimum distance principle, i.e., if \\(d_{il}^{(k)}
    = \\min [d_{ij}^{(k)} ]\\), \\(i = 1,2,...,N\\), then assign \\(x_{i} \\in \\omega_{l}^{(k
    + 1)}\\). \\(d_{ij}^{(k)}\\) represents the distance between the center \\(z_{j}^{(k)}\\)
    of \\(x_{i}\\) and \\(\\omega_{j}^{(k)}\\), and the superscript indicates the
    iteration number, resulting in a new cluster \\(\\omega_{j}^{(k + 1)} ,j = 1,2,...,k\\).
    ③ Calculate the centroids of each class after reclassification: $$z_{j}^{(k +
    1)} = \\frac{1}{{n_{j}^{(k + 1)} }}\\sum\\limits_{{x_{i} \\in \\omega_{j}^{(k
    + 1)} }} {x_{i} } ,j = 1,2,...,k$$ (4) where, \\(n_{j}^{(k + 1)}\\) represents
    the number of patterns in class \\(\\omega_{j}^{(k + 1)}\\). ④ If \\(z_{j}^{(k
    + 1)} = z_{j}^{(k)} (j = 1,2,...,k)\\), then terminate; otherwise, set K = K + 1
    and go back to step ②. K-Means algorithm requires manual pre determination of
    the initial K value, and this value may not coincide with the real data distribution.
    In this study, BIC criterion (Han and Coulibaly 2017) is used to determine the
    number of clusters in K-Means algorithm, so as to avoid the impact of subjectivity
    of artificially selecting K value on clustering results. BIC can be defined as:
    $$BIC = k\\ln (n) - 2\\ln (L)$$ (5) where, k is the number of training parameters,
    n is the number of samples, L is the likelihood function, and kln (n) is the penalty
    term. The smaller the BIC scole, the better the quality of the K-Means model.
    2.3 GIS Spatial Analysis Calculate the flood inundation range using the node overflow
    water volume V′ obtained from the SWMM, it is first necessary to find the corresponding
    flood water level H according to the flood water volume V′ and the water level
    and storage capacity curve of the catchment area, and then the connected domain
    can be calculated to obtain the inundation range (Wang et al. 2017). A water-level
    H corresponds to a submerged area S. According to the size of the DEM grid in
    the study area, the catchment area is divided into small grids, the volume of
    water in each grid is calculated separately, and then the volumes of water in
    all grids are added together. The total volume V is obtained, see Fig. 2. $$V
    = \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{m} {V_{i} } = cellArea \\cdot \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{m}
    {(H_{0} - h_{i} )}$$ (6) where: cellArea is the area of each DEM grid; H0 is the
    initial water level in m; hi is the elevation of the i-th DEM grid whose elevation
    value is less than H0. Fig. 2 Water calculation of DEM grid Full size image Using
    the spatial analysis function of GIS, a flood active inundation algorithm based
    on DEM is designed, and the equal volume method is used to realize the calculation
    of the corresponding submerged range and depth under the arbitrary overflow water
    volume of the pipe network nodes in the stagnant road. Compare the size of V′
    and V, if V′ > V, increase H0; if V′ < V, decrease H0, so that V continues to
    approach V′, and the final H0 is the flood water level H to be found. In the case
    of known overflow point position M and overflow amount V′, based on high-precision
    DEM data, according to the above method, the submerged range S and flood water
    level H can theoretically be obtained, but in practice it is often necessary to
    find a fast method for water level approximation. The binary search algorithm
    is an important algorithm in many problem-solving scenarios due to its advantages
    of fast convergence, simplicity and efficiency, wide applicability, and low time
    complexity. To improve the speed and computational efficiency of approximation,
    the objective function f(h) = V′ -V(h) is first constructed. From the continuity
    of V(h), it can be known that f(h) is continuous and satisfies f(Hbottom)·f(Htop) < 0
    (Hbottom is the elevation of the lowest point of the DEM in the connected domain,
    and Htop is the elevation of the highest point of the DEM in the connected domain),
    and then use the bisection method to quickly approximate the water level. The
    specific process is shown in Fig. 3. The calculation steps: ① Determine the interval
    [Hbottom, Htop], verify f(Hbottom)·f(Htop) < 0, the given accuracy ξ; ② Find the
    middle-value Hmid of the interval (Hbottom, Htop); ③ Calculate f(Htop), f(Hmid) = 0,
    then Hmid is the zero point of the function, f(Hbottom)·f(Htop) < 0, set Htop = Hmid,
    f(Hmid)·f(Htop) < 0, set Hbottom = Hmid; ④ judge whether the accuracy ξ is reached,
    that is, if |Htop-Hbottom|< ξ, then the approximate zero-point value Htop (or
    Hbottom) is obtained, otherwise, repeat step ②-step ④. Fig. 3 The process of calculating
    the water level H and the submerged area S by the dichotomy method Full size image
    2.4 Model Evaluation Indicator Selection The absolute error (AE) is the absolute
    value of the difference between the measured value and the true value. Here it
    refers to the absolute value of the difference between the simulated water depth
    of the model and the actual measured water depth (Hu et al. 2018). The mathematical
    expression is as follows: $$AE = \\left| {Q_{s}^{i} - Q_{o}^{i} } \\right|$$ (7)
    where \\(Q_{s}^{i}\\) and \\(Q_{o}^{i}\\) are the simulated and observed water
    depth at the \\(i - th\\) number. Relative error (RE) refers to the value obtained
    by multiplying the ratio of the absolute error caused by the measurement to the
    measured (conventional) true value by 100%, expressed as a percentage. Generally
    speaking, the relative error can better reflect the credibility of the measurement.
    It is mostly used in the evaluation of urban flood models to indicate the credibility
    of the simulated value of flood peak discharge (Jackson et al. 2019). It is described
    as follows: $$RE = \\frac{{Q_{s}^{i} - Q_{o}^{i} }}{{Q_{o}^{i} }} \\times 100\\%$$
    (8) The mathematical expressions of these metrics can be described as follows
    (Nash and Sutcliffe 1970): $$NSE = 1 - \\frac{{\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {(Q_{s}^{i}
    - Q_{o}^{i} )^{2} } }}{{\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {(Q_{s}^{i} - \\overline{{Q_{o}
    }} )^{2} } }}$$ (9) where \\(\\overline{{Q_{o} }}\\) is the mean value of the
    observed water depth, and \\(n\\) is the data points number. NSE measures the
    ability of the model to predict variables different from the mean, gives the proportion
    of the initial variance accounted for by the model, and ranges from 1 (perfect
    fit) to -∞. Values closer to 1 provide more accurate predictions (Gupta et al.
    1999). The coefficient of determination (R2) is often used to describe the degree
    of fit between data (Moriasi et al. 2007). When R2 is closer to 1, it means that
    the reference value of the related equation is higher; on the contrary, when it
    is closer to 0, it means that the reference value is lower. It is described as
    follows: $$R^{2} = \\frac{{\\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {(Q_{s}^{i} -
    \\overline{{Q_{s} }} )} (Q_{o}^{i} - \\overline{{Q_{o} }} )} \\right]^{2} }}{{\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {(Q_{s}^{i} - \\overline{{Q_{s} }} )}^{2} (Q_{o}^{i} - \\overline{{Q_{o}
    }} )^{2} }}$$ (10) where n is the total number of measured data, Si is the simulated
    water depth for data point i, Oi is the measured water depth for data point i,
    and is the averaged value of the measured water depth (Jackson et al. 2019). 2.5
    K-SWMMG By coupling K-means clustering algorithm, SWMM and GIS spatial analysis
    technology, we constructed a new urban stormwater model driven by \"parameter
    data + hydrological mechanism\", named K-SWMMG. The K-SWMMG model can simulate
    the hydrodynamic process of the urban drainage network and the waterlogging of
    the two-dimensional surface (including the depth and extent of the waterlogging),
    which structure is shown in Fig. 4. The workflow of the entire coupling framework
    for flood simulation can be divided into three steps: 1) Firstly, we use literature
    extraction method to investigate 676 samples of prior uncertain parameters of
    the SWMM model, including DP, DI, MaxI, MinI, DC, NP, and NI. 2) Secondly, the
    improved K-means clustering algorithm is used to calculate the parameter samples,
    and the universal rules between the characteristics of urban functional zones
    in the study area and the parameter clustering centers are analyzed. This helps
    determine the parameter values for different sub-catchment areas of the SWMM model.
    3) Finally, the applicability of the SWMM model is verified using historical flood
    events, and the overflow volume of nodes is visualized in a two-dimensional flood
    map using GIS spatial analysis techniques. This enhances the realism of urban
    stormwater simulation. Fig. 4 Research frame diagram. ICA, RA and PA respectively

    coordinates of Zhengzhou City are 112°42''-114°14'' E and 34°16''-34°58'' N, which
    belongs to the continental monsoon climate in the northern temperate zone, with
    hot and rainy summer and autumn, cold and dry spring and winter, with an average
    annual rainfall of 542 mm. The basic terrain tends to be low in the northwest
    and high in the southeast, with serious waterlogging during the rainy season (Wang
    et al. 2020). The study area is located in the west of Zhengzhou City and is a
    university campus with an area of 2.84km2. The climate characteristics of the
    study area are the same as those of Zhengzhou City. It has an independent rainwater
    pipe network system and more rainfall and discharge of observation data, which
    is an ideal area for studying urban floods. Most of its land use and drainage
    pipe networks are distributed in a rectangular grid, which is conducive to the
    establishment of urban flood models, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Study area Full
    size image 2.6.2 Data Availability Underlying Surface Data The land use data is
    visually interpreted by Google’s high-definition image map and corrected on-site,
    with an accuracy of 1 × 1m. The pipe network data comes from the Infrastructure
    Management Office. Flood Events Data According to research needs, we obtained
    the water depth of the outlet node of Study area through experimental monitoring.
    Table 2 shows the rainfall information of 6 flood events. Table 2 Characteristics
    of collected 6 flood events in the study area discharge station Full size table
    Design Rainstorm Data The formula of rainstorm intensity in China adopts the following
    form: $$q = \\frac{6696(1 + 0.794\\lg P)}{{(t + 25.8)^{0.948} }}$$ (11) where
    q is the rainfall intensity in mm/hr; P is the return period of rainstorms in
    yr; t is the rainstorm duration in min (Chen et al. 2018). We designed a total
    of 5 rainstorms with return periods of 5a, 10a, 20a, 50a, and 100a, the rain peak
    coefficient was 0.4, and the rainstorm duration was 180 min. 2.6.3 City Hydrological
    Response Unit (C-HRU) Division The division of C-HRU is one of the main steps
    of K-SWMMG model modeling, and the quality of the division has a relatively large
    impact on the accuracy of the results (Gironas et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2022).
    We refer to previous research and refine the following division steps: 1) The
    surface of the city has both natural and social attributes, and the two attributes
    are superimposed to divide the city''s functions; 2) Analyze the topography and
    confluence characteristics of the study area, determine the drainage area, and
    use the distribution of the drainage network trunk pipes and trunk roads as the
    division skeleton; 3) Control the number and spatial scale, and the ratio of the
    number of pipe sections and nodes to the number of sub-catchments is mostly 0.6–1.4;
    4) Divide the sub-catchment area so that there is only one urban functional area
    in the C-HRU. The division of land-use types is an important prerequisite for
    the division of C-HRU. The land use type of the study area is determined by visual
    interpretation of the 1 × 1m high-definition remote sensing method, and field
    inspections are used to make corrections, to ensure the division of C-HRU. The
    construction land, grassland, forest land, road and water land in the study area
    accounted for 34.1%, 22.1%, 28.7%, 13% and 2.2% respectively. The pipeline network
    is generalized into node elevation, pipeline shape, length, pipe diameter, etc.,
    and combined with pipeline network distribution information, topography, and surface
    type information, the study area is divided into 76 C-HRU, 382 nodes, 370 pipes
    and 1 total water outlet, of which the pipes and water outlets are free to flow.
    Ensure that each C-HRU is an independent urban functional area. Among them, ICA,
    RA and PA accounted for 30.7%, 37.3% and 32% respectively. As shown in Fig. 6.

    3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Parameter Clustering Results An inflection point
    occurs when K = 3, at which point the BIC value before and after K differs dramatically.
    In light of the K-Means model''s complexity, 3 clusters are found to be the ideal
    number for the 686 sample parameters. The essence of urban storm flood model construction
    is to generalize the urban storm flood phenomenon using the hydrological and physical
    parameters and mathematical principles (Dong et al. 2022; Piadeh et al. 2022),
    where the values of physical parameters show obvious clustering characteristics
    on different underlying surfaces (Hu et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2022). The clustering
    outcomes of the SWMM uncertainty parameters are displayed in Table 3 for the case
    where K = 3. The values of the seven parameters are as follows: 1.91, 2.73, 0.01,
    0.17, 31.68, 4.3, and 3.27 for the ICA attribute; 4.16, 5.97, 0.14, 0.48, 79.68,
    21.96, and 7.13 for the RA attribute; and 11.94, 12.07, 0.4, 0.84, 213.33, 74.73,
    and 13.55 for the PA attribute. These Seven parameters are divided into three
    ranges, and the different categories are caused by the differences in the underlying
    surface conditions. Table 3 Estimates of depressions and Manning coefficients
    Full size table Numerous improvements to the urban storm flood model using conventional
    physical mechanisms are now possible because to the ongoing development of GIS
    and machine learning technology (Buttinger-Kreuzhuber et al. 2022; Liwanag et
    al. 2018; Xu et al. 2022). The K-SWMMG model used in this study, which consists
    of the SWMM physical mechanism model, the K-means clustering algorithm, and GIS
    spatial analysis technology, has clear advantages in simulating urban storm floods.
    These advantages are primarily seen in two areas: high modeling efficiency and
    waterlogging visualization. 3.2 Model Performance Evaluation In the simulation
    of 6 flood events, Both SWMM and K-SWMMG showed good simulation effects (as shown
    in Fig. 7). However, K-SWMMG simulation results are generally closer to the observed
    water depth process line. In the simulation of the flood peak period, K-SWMMG
    is closer to the observed water depth than SWMM, but both are smaller than the
    observed water depth. In the flood receding stage, K-SWMMG is also closer to the
    observed water depth than SWMM, but both are greater than the measured value.
    Therefore, K-SWMMG has a better flood process simulation effect than SWMM. Fig.
    7 Observed and estimated hydro-graphs of the SWMM and K-SWMMG at the validation
    stage in 6 flood events Full size image Table 4 quantitatively compares the prediction
    performance of water depth for the 6 flood events of validation using SWMM and
    K-SWMMG. Four performance indicators of AE, RE, NSE and R2 were used to evaluate
    them respectively. When simulating with SWMM, the AE and RE of the simulation
    results of the water depth change process during the calibration period are both
    less than 0.07m, 15%, and the NSE is greater than 0.880; the AE and RE of the
    simulation results during the verification period are both less than 0.09m, 20%,
    and the NSE is greater than 0.850, which shows that the SWMM model can still guarantee
    the simulation accuracy. When simulating with K-SWMMG, the AE and RE of the simulation
    results during the verification period are both less than 0.06m, 12%, and the
    NSE is both Greater than 0.910, which shows that the parameter sample clustering
    method can significantly improve the simulation accuracy of the K-SWMMG model.
    This conclusion can be better reflected in the difference between the performance
    evaluation indicators of the two models. In the 6 flood events, when the SWMM
    model uses the sample parameter clustering method, the AE and RE are both decreasing,
    and the NSE is increasing. Table 4 AE, RE, and NSE of water depth simulation results
    of 6 flood events Full size table Figure 8 shows the correlation between the simulated
    water depth of SWMM and K-SWMMG for 6 flood events and the actual observed values.
    The abscissa is the actual measured value and the ordinate is the simulated value.
    Green and red composition elements represent SWMM and K-SWMMG respectively, and
    the simulated water depth data gather near the 45° line (black line, slope 1,
    intercept 0). The fitting equation of SWMM is y = 0.87x + 0.04, R2 is 0.924, and
    it has a good simulation effect on the whole. But it is dispersed at smaller and
    larger water depth points of 0–0.2m and 0.8–1.0m, and the simulation effect is
    not ideal. It can be seen from the K-SWMMG simulation results that the water depth
    points are more concentrated at the 45° line, and the fitting equation is y = 0.94x + 0.02,
    R2 is 0.967. Compared with SWMM, the slope of k-SWMMG''s fitting equation increases
    by 0.07 (8.04%), the intercept decreases by 0.02 (50.00%), and the R2 increases
    by 0.043 (4.65%), all of which indicate that the K-SWMMG model has higher simulation
    accuracy than SWMM. Fig. 8 Scatter plot of the observed and the simulated water
    depth during 6 validation flood events using SWMM and K-SWMMG Full size image
    The results show that K-SWMMG model has higher accuracy than SWMM model in simulating
    urban flood. In the process of using SWMM model, it is necessary to calibrate
    parameters manually, which will take a lot of time. At the same time, it is impossible
    to avoid the phenomenon of \"different parameters have the same effect\", which
    has obvious disadvantages. The K-SWMMG model proposed in this study essentially
    obtains samples from a large number of prior tuning results, mining the data clustering
    characteristics of uncertain parameters, and interpreting the characteristics
    as the differences of urban functional areas based on the improvement of the sub-catchment
    area division method, to better ensure the ability and efficiency of urban flood
    simulation. Through machine learning to determine model parameters, the complex
    parameter calibration process of the urban flood management model is avoided,
    the modeling time is shortened from hours to minutes, and the modeling efficiency
    is significantly improved. It is important to note that the prior sample parameters
    selected in this study involve a small spatial scale in the study area, so the
    differences of sample parameters themselves (possibly due to climate conditions)
    can be ignored. Urban flooding exhibits significant two-dimensional, and even
    three-dimensional, characteristics (Khayyal et al. 2022). However, due to the
    lack of monitoring data, our study only validated the pipeline flow at a one-dimensional
    level. In the future, it is expected to combine multi-source media data and utilize
    AI mining techniques (Kumar et al. 2023; Bassi et al. 2023a, b) to achieve data
    collection and model validation for the two-dimensional aspect of urban flooding.
    3.3 Urban Rainstorm Flood Simulation Results Figure 9a shows the process line
    of the rainstorm inundation amount. Before the flood peak appears, the curve in
    this stage is steep, indicating that the flood rises quickly and the flood rises
    the most rapidly when the rain peak appears. The flood peak is followed by the
    water withdrawal stage, in which only the pipe network drains the water, so the
    water withdrawal process line is relatively smooth, which means the water withdrawal
    is relatively slow. It can be seen from the flood peak markers of a rainstorm
    in different return periods that although the time of rain peak is consistent,
    the flood peak will appear earlier with the increase in the return period. Figure
    9b–f is the maximum inundation depth of a rainstorm flood (corresponding to the
    flood peak in Fig. 9a), which is obtained through coupling GIS spatial analysis
    of manhole overflow. With increasing return period, severe submergence (> 0.30m)
    area has little change; Less severe (0.05–0.30m) flooded area varies greatly.
    The effect of microtopography leads to the distribution of submerged water depth
    along the road \"groove\", which has a bad effect on traffic Fig. 9 Comparison
    of cumulative inundation water volume (a) and the maximum flood depth map (b–f))
    Full size image Table 5 makes detailed statistics of the inundation characteristics
    of heavy rains in each return period. There are significant differences in flood
    extent and depth across the study area. At present, the stormwater pipe network
    in the study area can absorb less than 5a of the rainstorm return period, but
    in history, it has happened more than 100a of rainstorm return period. Therefore,
    we take a storm in 5a and 100a for example to introduce the response of submergence
    to different rainstorm scenarios. In the case of a rainstorm in 5a, S is 0.417km2,
    accounting for 14.5% of the study area. Runoff coefficient α is 0.38, V is 13,939.1m3,
    accounting for 7% of the total water volume. The flooded coverage area is mainly
    roads. In the case of 100a rainstorm, S is 0.756km2, accounting for 26.6% of the
    study area. α is 0.51, V is 42,344.7m3, accounting for 12.4% of the total water
    volume. The submerged area extends from the road to the square, and the submerged
    water depth will increase significantly. As rainfall and rainfall intensity increase,
    inundation becomes more severe. Compared with SWMM, K-SWMMG simulation results
    achieve two-dimensional output. Meanwhile, dichotomy accelerated convergence calculation
    also ensures the computational efficiency of the model, which is of great significance
    for urban flood prediction and management. Table 5 Statistics of design storm
    flood events for return periods 5a, 10a, 20a, 50a, 100a Full size table 3.4 Runoff
    Coefficient of Urban Functional Area The city is the product of highly human activities,
    and the underlying surface has obvious patchy characteristics (Mei 2019). In the
    process of dividing the C-HRU hydrological response unit, this study improved
    the division method to make it correspond to the urban functional areas one by
    one, and discussed the runoff coefficient of different urban functional areas,
    as shown in Fig. 10. The hardening degree of ICA underlying surface is the highest,
    and the runoff coefficient is the highest, with an average value of 0.77; RA underlying
    surface has a certain degree of greening, and the average runoff coefficient is
    0.68; PA is dominated by greenbelt parks, and its land use is close to the natural
    attribute, with a large amount of infiltration water, so the average value of
    runoff coefficient is the smallest, 0.31. This indicates that the hardening of
    underlying surface caused by urban expansion has significantly changed the original
    natural hydrological process, and the study of urban hydrological response mechanism
    is a direction of great academic and practical value (Piadeh et al. 2022; Xu et
    al. 2023). Fig. 10 Distribution of runoff coefficient in urban functional areas
    Full size image 4 Conclusion This study couples the K-means clustering algorithm
    and GIS spatial analysis techniques with the SWMM model, forming the K-SWMMG model.
    This enables two-dimensional simulation of urban flooding and overcomes the difficulties
    in parameter calibration of the SWMM model. The conclusions of this study are
    as follows: The K-SWMMG model exhibits better accuracy in simulating the flow
    of stormwater networks compared to the SWMM model. The average simulation accuracy
    of the K-SWMMG model, in terms of AE, RE, NSE, and R2, is higher by 0.019m, 5.36%,
    0.068, and 0.042, respectively, for the six observed flood events. Moreover, compared
    to SWMM, the K-SWMMG model significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency
    of urban flood simulation, making it more valuable for promotion and application.
    However, a limitation of this study is the lack of two-dimensional inundation
    monitoring information, which hinders the validation of the model at the two-dimensional
    level. By coupling GIS spatial analysis technology, we realized K-SWMMG two-dimensional
    surface submerged water distribution output, which is more conducive to urban
    flood prediction and management. At the same time, the dichotomy method is used
    to accelerate the calculation of inundation depth of manhole overflow in the rainwater
    pipe network, which ensures the high efficiency of K-SWMMG in flood simulation
    and forecast. In the future, it is promising to utilize multi-source media data
    during urban flood events and employ improved data mining algorithms for urban
    flood simulation work. Data Availability Not applicable. The data in this manuscript

  description: Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) is a key parameter in hydrology.
    It has a variety of practical applications, ranging from understanding the hydrological
    cycle to estimating crop water needs for efficient irrigation in agriculture.
    The FAO PENMAN–MONTEITH (FAO-PM) method is largely adopted and is the recommended
    method by the FAO for ET0 estimation. However, it requires multiple measured meteorological
    parameters that are, in some conditions, difficult to obtain. This work fills
    this gap and leverages the potential of data-driven methods, namely machine learning
    and deep learning models, to accurately estimate ET0 while using a limited number
    of easy-to-obtain parameters. The study uses physical-based models (FAO-PM and
    Hargreaves) as ET0 learning data providers for data-driven models. First, physical
    models were fed with meteorological data covering the period 2013–2020 at an hourly
    scale to estimate ET0. The data were sourced from the in-situ local weather station
    of our study area in the Tensift basin (center of Morocco) and from the Copernicus
    ERA5-Land reanalysis data. Next, as a preprocessing step, feature engineering
    was performed using a decision tree-based approach. We evaluated the predictive
    importance of weather parameters for ET0 estimation. Scores between 0 and 1 were
    assigned to each parameter, indicating their efficacy. Notably, mean air temperature
    and global solar radiation stood out, collectively surpassing an 86% importance
    threshold. In contrast to the rest of the parameters that have a low importance
    of 10%. This emphasizes the critical significance of mean air temperature and
    global solar radiation as essential predictors for accurate ET0 estimation. Finally,
    during the modeling phase, three deep-learning models Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
    Gated Recurrent Unit, and Convolutional Neural Network are highlighted. Notably,
    the LSTM model exhibits superior performance, delivering comparable coefficients
    of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) results, surpassing its
    counterparts. In terms of univariate predictions using the Hargreaves and FAO-56
    PM methods, the LSTM consistently achieves high R2 values of 0.90 across all data
    sources, accompanied by impressive accuracy reflected in low MAE, MSE, and RMSE
    values ranging from 0.004 to 0.07 mm/day. In addition, the ensemble learning model
    XGBoost had the best prediction performance with R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 0.03 mm/day.
    This confirms that machine learning models outperform deep learning architectures
    for small and medium-sized datasets. The proposed models will be integrated into
    an under-development agricultural decision support system.

    progress and global population growth are increasing the demand for agricultural
    production, consequently, global food demand will increase by approximately 60%
    by 2050 (Tilman et al. 2011). It is estimated that global agricultural activities
    consume about 70% of freshwater (Provenzano and Sinobas 2014), and the irrigated
    area in the world represents only 16% of the agricultural area (Ebrahimian et
    al. 2014). This is reflected in many countries including Morocco where water resource
    management has become a major issue, especially for agriculture, which consumes
    87% of the country''s water resources. This resource can barely meet growing demands,
    which are constantly increasing due to diverse factors including population growth,
    economic progress, and the expansion of irrigated areas. Population growth is
    putting enormous pressure on the water reserves available to meet the growing
    needs of food production and domestic consumption (Mouna et al. 2016; Seifennasr
    et al. 2017). At the same time, increasing urbanization and the growth of water-intensive
    industries are amplifying competition for water resources, creating a delicate
    balance between industrial, urban, and agricultural water demands. Morocco''s
    economic progress has led to an increase in water requirements in many sectors,
    including agriculture, industry, tourism, and domestic needs. In particular, the
    expansion of irrigated areas appears to be an essential strategy for boosting
    agricultural productivity. However, this effort, while promising, risks exacerbating
    water scarcity problems due to excessive abstraction from groundwater sources
    (Malki et al. 2016). In addition, climate change impacts cause a reduction in
    water resources, especially in arid and semi-arid regions that account for 36%
    of the world’s land (Ebrahimian et al. 2014), and the risk of drought is expected
    to increase further due to global warming (Allen et al. 2011; Duchemin et al.
    2006). Water productivity (WP) is defined as the ratio between crop yield and
    total water use (Er-Raki et al. 2007), it is estimated that plants consume less
    than 65% of the available water supply (Er-Raki et al. 2010). However, his low
    estimate of water consumption makes it challenging to automate irrigation due
    to spatiotemporal variability in soil, weather, and plant data (Kharrou et al.
    2013). As in many other countries, Moroccan farmers are under pressure to optimize
    water use efficiency due to many challenges such as drought, soil evaporation,
    groundwater scarcity, and lack of access to water supplies (Bousbaa et al. 2022).
    At the same time, irrigation must be intensified to feed the crop water consumption,
    causing groundwater overexploitation. Precision irrigation helps farmers address
    these challenges by changing their water usage, allowing them to use less water
    to produce similar and better yields than before. Since the beginning of independence,
    Morocco has opted for an economic and social development strategy aimed at improving
    the agricultural sector by exploiting water resources, particularly in irrigation.
    One of the strategies that could help achieve better water exploitation is the
    estimation of plant water requirements for irrigation purposes, especially in
    semi-arid regions. It allows continuous monitoring in space and time and evaluation
    of water consumption to improve water resource management. The amount of water
    required for irrigation must satisfy diverse types of needs at the plot level.
    The work carried out for several decades until today on the determination of crop
    water requirements, through evapotranspiration estimation (ET), is oriented either
    towards experimental approaches that require very sophisticated and costly equipment
    (so-called direct methods) or towards approaches based on models (so-called indirect
    methods) (Allen et al. 2011). Recently, many studies have been carried out to
    measure or estimate the ET of crops such as wheat in the Haouz plain located in
    the Tensift basin (Duchemin et al. 2006; Er-Raki et al. 2007, 2010; Kharrou et
    al. 2013; Hssaine et al. 2018).Evapotranspiration can be measured directly using
    devices such as lysimeters (Ndiaye et al. 2017), evaporation pans (Ndiaye et al.
    2017), or atmometers (Diallo et al. 2015). However, the installation and management
    of these tools involve significant financial expenses and qualified personnel
    and, are usually reserved for research centers (Sabziparvar et al. 2010).For indirect
    estimation of evapotranspiration, i.e., quantification of ET0 and then estimation
    of crop evapotranspiration (ETc). ET0 is a significant indicator for understanding
    crop water requirements and achieving satisfactory yield (Tegos et al. 2015).
    The estimation of ET0 is crucial in calculating irrigation water requirements,
    determining crop evapotranspiration, and designing models for soil water balance
    (Chia et al. 2021). Several methods have been tested for estimating ET0 under
    different climatic conditions. For example, Maeda et al. (2011) employed simulations
    based on fundamental physical principles such as energy balance and mass transfer
    to calculate ET0. The FAO-56 PM method based on the Penman–Monteith equation,
    has emerged as the standard approach for estimating ET0 since its establishment
    by Allen et al. (1998). This method was recommended by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and is documented in Bulletin No. 56
    (ET0 FAO-56 PM) (Paredes et al. 2020). ET0 is defined as the potential evapotranspiration
    of a hypothetical reference crop with specified characteristics, including a height
    of 0.12 m, surface resistivity of 70 s/m, and albedo of 0.23. This reference crop
    is designed to resemble a perfectly developed, fully grown, and adequately watered
    grass or alfalfa surface (Allen et al. 1998). The FAO-56 PM approach, has been
    widely adopted due to its satisfactory results under various climatic conditions
    around the world (Garcia et al. 2004; Liu and Luo 2010), requires daily measurements
    of various weather parameters such as wind speed and direction, global solar radiation,
    relative humidity, air temperature radiation and precipitation. Unfortunately,
    such comprehensive meteorological data is often lacking or subject to significant
    gaps and inaccuracies, particularly in developing countries. Consequently, the
    practical application of the FAO-56 PM equation may be limited to regions where
    the required meteorological parameters are not readily available. This scarcity
    of data causes problems for the accurate estimation of ET0 using the FAO-56 PM
    method in these regions (Hargreaves and Samani 1985). To overcome the limitations
    of the FAO-PM model in estimating ET0 with limited observed data, numerous studies
    have been conducted, focusing on alternative methods that use reduced ground data.
    Among these approaches are the Hargreaves and Samani equation, the Priestley-Taylor
    equation, and the Thornthwaite equation, that have been promising in estimating
    ET0 based on limited meteorological data (Jabloun and Sahli 2008; Sentelhas et
    al. 2010). However, it is important to note that the accuracy of these methods
    varies significantly across specific regions, leading to the possibility of improper
    equations being used. Moreover, the simplicity of these equations can also lead
    to potential discrepancies, necessitating careful adjustment of method parameters
    before application. One such alternative method, the Hargreaves equation developed
    by Hargreaves and Samani (1985), requires less meteorological data, and offers
    potential solutions for estimating ET0 in data-scarce regions. The Hargreaves
    method relies on factors such as average, minimum, and maximum air temperature,
    as well as extraterrestrial radiation. However, this formula tends to overestimate
    ET in wet conditions and requires local calibration. Aside from physical-based
    methods, the estimation of evapotranspiration using artificial intelligence is
    nowadays one of the most researched areas, especially with the adoption of AI
    in the agricultural sector. AI innovations brought new tools and improved existing
    processes in many fields such as hydrology, agriculture, and the environment.
    The adoption of AI in the agricultural sector is made possible by the availability
    of data in the ecosystem of farmers, AI optimizes activities related to crop selection,
    water requirements, farming cycles, soil treatment, and others. These tasks are
    based on parameters such as climate, seed and soil conditions, Irrigation levels,
    disease risk, etc., enabling farmers to know what to plant, where and when to
    harvest, or to determine how much water a plant need. AI-based decision support
    tools, specifically Machine Learning models, have become valuable in sustainable
    precision irrigation management for efficient and effective use of water resources
    (Sharma et al. 2021). Traditionally, farmers relied on their experience to make
    irrigation decisions, but with the development of machine learning, predictions
    of crop water requirements based on weather and soil moisture forecasts have enabled
    better irrigation decisions. Accurate predictions are crucial for irrigation scheduling
    and improving water management practices. Machine learning models, including supervised,
    unsupervised, reinforcement, and federated learning, are popularly applied in
    precision irrigation management to solve challenging problems. Different methods
    with various data preprocessing steps and approaches have been proposed to estimate
    ET0 with high accuracy. Previous studies have examined the potential of machine
    learning models to estimate ET0. For instance, a study by Yohanani et al. (2022)
    employed the Foucault covariance system measures and artificial neural network
    (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models, to estimate evapotranspiration
    for greenhouse banana plantations. The ANN model outperformed the MLR model in
    most cases with an accuracy of 88%. However, the study was limited by the data
    set. Another study (Yamaç and Todorovic 2020) indicated that the K nearest neighbor
    (KNN) algorithm could be a suitable method for estimating ET when the available
    meteorological data is scarce. Deep learning models enhanced traditional machine
    learning by introducing more complex models that apply various functions to transform
    the input data into hierarchical representations. This allows data to be abstract
    at multiple levels, depending on the specific neural network architecture employed.
    Deep learning is a modern and promising technique that has shown successful results
    for image processing and data analysis. This approach has also been applied in
    various domains, including streamflow prediction (Nifa et al. 2023) and climate
    and weather forecasting (Meliho et al. 2022), and is revolutionizing the agricultural
    domain by being applied to the huge amount of generated data (Big data) to help
    assist decision-makers and farmers (Hachimi et al. 2023) throughout different
    phases of the season. One such application is to estimate the reference evapotranspiration.
    Recently, Saggi and Jain (2019) introduced the concept of deep neural network
    (DNN) in ET0 modeling by describing the relationship between a set of seven input
    parameters including average relative humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours, net
    radiation, leaf area index, plant height, and ET0. It was able to accurately predict
    ET0 with an accuracy of 98%, with a relatively simple architecture. Nevertheless,
    this method has a limitation regarding other scenarios where not all the atmospheric
    parameters are available in the data. Furthermore, a study conducted by Özgür
    and Yamaç (2020) examined the capability of artificial neural network (ANN) and
    deep neural network (DNN) models for estimating daily ET0. They compared various
    previously proposed ANN and DNN methods based on meteorological data collected
    from four stations in Turkey (Adana, Aksaray, Isparta, and Niğde) spanning 1999–2018.
    The study demonstrated that the proposed P-DNN-SeLU model had the highest accuracy
    of 0.9934 and the lowest root mean square error of 0.2073, making it the best-performing
    model across different climatic zones in Turkey. Research on recurrent neural
    network architectures (RNN) (Abbas et al. 2020) has highlighted the advantages
    of deep learning models compared to traditional machine learning and empirical
    methods. Considering the impressive learning capabilities of deep learning algorithms
    and the promising results of the ET0 modeling research mentioned previously, the
    authors chose deep learning architectures for this modeling task. In this study,
    we aim to perform spatialized estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0)
    from multi-source and multi-scale satellite imagery using ML and DL approaches,
    to help farmers improve the efficiency of irrigation planning and water resource
    management. Our main objectives include: ET0 calculation using the dual approach
    of the FAO-56 PM model based on reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients.
    ET0 calculation based on the use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms
    for the prediction of evapotranspiration from reanalysis data (i.e., Era5-Land)
    produced by Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at European Centre for Medium-Range
    Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). ET0 calculation based on combined data (in-situ and
    Era5-Land), of the region of interest. A comparative study to evaluate the potential
    and the effectiveness of seven models based on classical learning algorithms versus
    those based on deep learning algorithms. The structure of this article is as follows:
    “Materials and methods” is materials and methods where we describe the study area,
    present our proposed methodology, and finally explain the different data preprocessing;
    “Results and Discussion” presents the results obtained by our three approaches
    and “Conclusion” concludes this paper and presents the perspectives. Materials
    and methods Data In this study we have worked with different sources of data including
    reanalysis and in-situ data to extract the meteorological data such as wind speed
    and direction, global solar radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, and
    precipitation. Data from each source was pre-processed using different mechanisms.
    In the following subsection, we have provided a detailed description of the methods
    used for collecting and processing the data. (a) Reanalysis data Reanalysis is
    a process that integrates both observed and model data from various locations
    worldwide, using physical laws to create a unified and consistent dataset. It
    generates data that covers several decades, providing a precise representation
    of past climate. In this study we used reanalysis data from ERA5-Land. ERA5-Land
    is a dataset with a global coverage at a 9 km resolution that is in line with
    the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data starting from 1950 and onwards (Muñoz-Sabater
    et al. 2021). It is expected to provide daily updates with a 5-day delay in real-time
    by 2023. The ERA5-Land data is produced by using atmospheric variables like air
    temperature and humidity as inputs to regulate the simulated ERA5 land fields
    through a process known as atmospheric forcing. Table 1 shows the description
    of the Era5-Land data. Table 1 Description of Era5-Land data Full size table In
    the absence of atmospheric forcing constraint, model-based estimations can deviate
    significantly from reality. As a result, even though observations are not directly
    involved in creating ERA5-Land, they are indirectly influenced by the atmospheric
    forcing used to run the simulation. Moreover, to account for the difference in
    elevation between the forcing grid and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land,
    input variables like air temperature, humidity, and pressure are adjusted through
    a process known as the \"failure rate correction\". (b) Ground meteorological
    data The meteorological data used for this study were obtained from a local weather
    station located on site R3. These data were collected over an 8-year period, from
    January 3, 2013, to December 31, 2020, with measurements recorded at semi-hourly
    intervals. This complete data set comprises 48 records per day, resulting in a
    total of 140,160 records for the entire period. The availability of this in situ
    data from the local weather station provides a solid basis for accurate analysis
    and enables detailed exploration of the meteorological factors influencing the
    study area. Table 2 provides a detailed description of the meteorological variables
    included in this dataset, enabling a better understanding of the data collected.
    Table 2 Descriptive of meteorological data Full size table Study area The agricultural
    site known as R3, is located in the Sidi Rahal region of Morocco''s Haouz plain,
    approximately 40 km east of Marrakech as shown in Fig. 1. It covers an area of
    2800 ha and contains around 745 individual fields, primarily devoted for cereal
    production with a minority used for arboriculture and vegetables (Belaqziz et
    al. 2014; Amazirh et al. 2017). Fig. 1 The R3 irrigated perimeter location over
    the Tensift Al Haouz region in Morocco Full size image Typically, a significant
    portion of the site, ranging from a quarter to a third depending on the year,
    is left fallow or uncultivated. Cereals are usually sowed between November and
    January and reach their developmental peak growth at the end of March. Harvesting
    generally takes place in early summer, around May to June. The climate of this
    area is characterized by a semi-arid Mediterranean climate, with average annual
    precipitation of around 250 mm, mainly concentrated in winter and spring, while
    potential evapotranspiration (ET0) amounts to around 1600 mm. Soil composition
    is largely uniform, with a fine texture ranging from clay to silt, albeit with
    a low organic matter content (less than 2%) (Er-Raki et al. 2007). In addition,
    it is crucial to consider that the context of the Tensift basin is significant,
    as it exerts a notable influence on the study area. This basin also has a semi-arid
    Mediterranean climate, characterized by significant temperature fluctuations.
    During the summer months, temperatures can reach 38 °C in July, while during the
    cold winter months, average temperatures reach 5 °C in February, with notable
    temperature variations. These climatic and environmental dynamics create the general
    framework in which the R3 site operates. Further details about the research area
    could be found in Er-Raki et al. (2007), Amazirh et al. (2017) and Belaqziz et
    al. (2021). Methodology This study aligns with the approach of accurately estimating
    ET0 based on DL and ML models combined with physics-based models (Hargreaves and
    FAO-PM). And answer five research questions: Q1. What are the relevant parameters
    that impact ET0? Q2. What physical and AI-based approaches are commonly used for
    ET0 estimation? Q3. Which models are the most accurate in estimating evapotranspiration?
    Q4. Which approach is more precise: univariate or multivariate estimation of ET0?
    Q5. What is the significance and impact of combining physical-based models with
    AI-based models in ET0 estimation? To estimate the ET0 in the R3 site, we used
    three approaches (Fig. 2): Approach 1: Estimate ET0 based only on physical models
    (FAO-56 PM and Hargreaves). Approach 2: Estimate ET0 by combining data-driven
    models (ML and DL) with physical models (FAO-56 PM and Hargreaves) using in-situ
    data and reanalysis data separately. Approach 3: Estimate ET0 by combining data-driven
    models (ML and DL) with physical models (FAO-56 PM and Hargreaves) and combining
    in-situ data with reanalysis data. Fig. 2 Flowchart of the proposed methodologies
    to retrieve ET0 Full size image The proposed methodology is based on three essential
    steps: The first step consists of data acquisition and pre-processing of the meteorological
    data collected from the weather station. The ERA5-Land reanalysis data is used
    to fill the missing and inconsistent meteorological data. Moreover, data preprocessing
    consists of several steps. After obtaining a representative and more balanced
    dataset, the three approaches are applied. The first approach calculates ET0 based
    on the physical models (FAO-56 PM and Hargreaves) and selects relevant estimators
    to be considered by the AI models after data splitting. The second step is a training
    phase. We divide our data into three proportions (training, validation, and test)
    and apply our second and third approaches. The third step is dedicated to evaluating
    the performance of the three proposed approaches. We use several performance metrics
    to compare actual and predicted ET0 obtained at the study area level during the
    period 2013–2020. Approach 1: Physics-based model In order to calculate ET0, we
    used the Penman–Monteith (Eq. 1) (Allen et al. 1998) recommended in the FAO-56.
    While this method is reliable and widely adopted globally, it relies on meteorological
    data such as air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed.
    Unfortunately, this data is often unavailable in developing countries. To address
    this issue, an alternative physics-based method such as Hargreaves method (Eq.
    2) has been adopted as a substitute. This latter utilizes the average, minimum
    and maximum air temperature as well as extraterrestrial radiation. The Hargreaves
    method tends to overestimate ET when conditions are humid and requires local calibration.
    It is typically recommended when sufficient data such as solar irradiance, relative
    humidity, and wind speed needed for FAO-56 (PM) equation are not available (Hargreaves
    and Samani 1985) (Fig. 3). $$ET0=\\frac{\\left[0.48\\times \\Delta \\times \\left({R}_{n}-G\\right)\\right]+[\\gamma
    \\times \\frac{900}{T+273} \\times {U}_{2}\\times \\left({e}_{s}-{e}_{a}\\right)]}{\\Delta

    where we applied the physical models (FAO-56 PM and Hargreaves) after a preprocessing
    of station data on one hand, and reanalysis data (ERA5-Land) on the other hand
    to predict ET0 Full size image Approach 2: AI-based models In this approach, ET0
    is estimated by combining the physics-based models with artificial intelligence
    models (Fig. 4). The baseline estimate is calculated using the FAO56-PM and Hargreaves
    physical models, and the AI models are trained using relevant estimators to learn
    the relationships between meteorological data and ET0 using various techniques.
    The output of the physics models is then used as input for the AI models. By combining
    the estimated values from both models, a more accurate estimate of ET0 can be
    obtained by leveraging the strengths of both approaches. Fig. 4 The second approach
    where we estimate ET0 based on AI models combined with the physics models Full
    size image Machine learning models In this section, various machine learning algorithms
    were evaluated using the Data Science Toolkit library (El Hachimi et al. 2022).
    The study utilized four machine learning models for estimating evapotranspiration:
    XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that is particularly useful for time
    series prediction due to its ability to handle missing data and noisy features
    well. XGBoost has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve its performance
    (Ponraj and Vigneswaran 2020). Linear regression is a simple but powerful statistical
    method that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the
    output variable. It is widely used for time series prediction because it can capture
    trends and patterns in the data and is easy to interpret (Su et al. 2012) Random
    forest is a machine learning algorithm that combines several decision trees to
    improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. It creates a set of decision
    trees by randomly selecting subsets of features and observations, and then averages
    their predictions. It is widely used for classification and regression and can
    handle non-linear relationships and complex interactions between variables. In
    this study, the RF model was used as a regression tool to estimate ET0 from weather
    variables (Breiman 2001). Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular machine learning
    algorithm that works by finding a hyperplane that separates the input data into
    different classes or predicts a continuous output variable. It is particularly
    useful for time series prediction because it can handle high-dimensional data
    and can capture nonlinear relationships between variables (Vapnik 1999). Deep
    learning models In this study, a sophisticated RNN architecture adopted known
    as Long Term Memory Network (LSTM). The LSTM network is a sequential model allowing
    information to persist. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTM can store previous data
    in its memory unit and add/delete information during the learning process, making
    them particularly effective for processing sequential data such as time series.
    Our proposed LSTM architecture has four interconnected layers, each serving a
    unique function in the learning process. The first layer is an LSTM layer with
    512 neurons. To prevent overfitting, we incorporated a dropout layer with probability
    of 0.2, followed by another LSTM layer with 256 neurons. After this, we added
    a dropout layer, a flattening layer, a dense layer of 8 neurons and ReLu as activation
    function (f(x) = max (0, x)), and finally a dense layer with one neuron and a
    linear activation function (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 The applied LSTM architecture Full
    size image The second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN). Even if this
    type of neural network is generally used for two-dimensional data such as images,
    we have used it in our case with a one-dimensional convolutional layer searching
    for one-dimensional spatial relations. Each data point is represented by one row
    and 5 columns (1, 5). The Conv1D layer contains 64 filters where the kernel size
    is 2 (Fig. 6). In this type of convolution, the filter moves horizontally since
    our data are in the form of vectors, we then feed the resulting features to a
    dense layer of 8 neurons activated with the ReLu function, and the last dense
    layer performs the regression using a linear activation function. Fig. 6 The applied
    CNN architecture Full size image Another popular version of RNN is Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) proposed by Al-Shabandar et al. (2021). It is a closed recurrent unit
    that functions as an LSTM with no output gate and writes the entire contents of
    its memory cell to the larger network at each time step. We used a simple architecture
    based on a GRU layer with 64 neurons, a dense layer with 8 neurons and a linear
    activation function and finally a dense layer of one neuron and a linear activation
    function (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 The applied GRU architecture Full size image Feature
    engineering To achieve effective results, we have selected relevant estimators
    among the total features that have the most impact on ET0. The selection is based
    on the work of El Hachimi et al. (2022), which is based on decision tree technique
    and a weighted sum of decreases in node impurity, one of the metrics utilized
    to decide how to split a branch in tree-based models. The importance score for
    each variable is presented in Table 3. Table 3 Importance score for each variable
    Full size table We observed that the combination of global solar radiation and
    mean air temperature has a greater influence on ET0. Thus, we used these relevant
    estimators as input variables in machine and deep learning models to predict ET0.
    Approach 3: Combination of data After assessing the effectiveness of reanalysis
    data in predicting ET0, our study turns to a new approach aimed at exploiting
    the potential of reanalysis data to fill the gaps left by missing or incomplete
    station data. The central objective here is to transparently merge station data
    with reanalysis data from ERA5-Land, creating a smooth merge that resolves discrepancies
    or gaps in the dataset. This innovative strategy exploits the unique strengths
    of reanalysis data, which benefit from broader temporal and spatial coverage than
    localized station data. By ensuring synchronized temporal resolutions between
    reanalysis and station data, we ensure a consistent and reliable dataset, providing
    a more complete basis for accurate ET0 estimation. This integrative methodology
    not only underlines the central role of merging disparate data sources but also
    serves as a pragmatic solution for improving the accuracy and robustness of hydrological
    modeling, particularly in regions where station data availability may be poor
    or irregular (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 The third proposed approach which consists of estimating
    ET0 using the combination of data as input of the models Full size image Data
    preprocessing Handling missing values Handling the missing data is a crucial step
    in data preprocessing pipeline. It ensures that subsequent analyses are reliable
    and trustworthy. In our study, we recognized the importance of dealing with missing
    values and therefore used two distinct methods to solve this problem. The first
    method involves replacing missing data with values from the same period in the
    previous year. This method was used for both the first and second approaches.
    For example, if we had missing data for specific dates such as January 1 and 2,
    2013, we filled these gaps with the corresponding data for January 1 and 2, 2014.
    This decision was taken in order to maintain the consistency of the chronology
    of the data set while retaining a coherent overall structure. Our second method
    applied exclusively to the third approach, involved using reanalysis data to replace
    missing values. Reanalysis data is known for its high accuracy, and we integrated
    it seamlessly into our pre-processing process. Whenever we found missing values,
    we explicitly inserted the corresponding values from the reanalysis data. This
    additional step improved the completeness and accuracy of our data. Resampling
    Resampling involves a change in temporal frequency in time series data. After
    we processed the missing data, we resampled the resulting time series to the appropriate
    time series at the appropriate scale, which is the hourly and daily scale, to
    have more balanced data. Figure 9 illustrates the resampling process. Prior to
    resampling, the curve may have significant fluctuations in the air temperature
    measurement at a high sampling rate of half an hour. These fluctuations can make
    the time series difficult to interpret and use for analysis or modeling due to
    the presence of noise in the data. The curve may also appear too detailed for
    a long-term view. After hourly and daily resampling, the curve may appear smoother
    and more regular. This is because the raw data has been aggregated over a longer
    period, reducing fluctuations in the time series. Fig. 9 R3 district air temperature
    before and after resampling Full size image Normalization To enhance the performance
    and stability of the training stability process of learning models, we used normalization
    to transform the data to a similar scale. In this study, we used the Min–Max normalization
    which is used to scale all the values to the interval [0;1] using the Eq. (3),
    while keeping the ratio of the distances between the values. $${X}_{norm}=\\frac{\\left({X}_{n}-{X}_{min}\\right)}{\\left({X}_{max}-{X}_{min}\\right)}$$
    (3) where \\({X}_{norm}\\) is the normalized value, \\({X}_{n}\\) is the actual
    value, \\({X}_{max}\\) and \\({X}_{min}\\) is the maximum and minimum value of
    the attributes. In Fig. 10, we can observe the difference in scale between the
    global solar radiation variable and the air temperature variable. This difference
    can have an impact on the learning of the model, for that we have unified the
    scale between all the variables. Fig. 10 Boxplot of global solar radiation and
    temperature variables before and after normalization Full size image Evaluation
    metrics This study aims to solve a problem that belongs to the category of regression.
    To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models, we used various performance
    metrics that compare actual and predicted ET0 such as: Mean Square Error (MSE)
    is a widely used metric in regression analysis, designed to assess the accuracy
    of a predictive model. It measures the average squared difference between the
    predicted values and the actual values in the dataset. By squaring the errors
    and averaging them, MSE assigns a higher weight to larger errors, making it sensitive
    to outliers and providing a smooth gradient for small errors during optimization.
    The advantages of MSE lie in its differentiability, making it suitable as a loss
    function for optimization algorithms. However, its main disadvantage is that the
    error values are in squared units of the output, which can make it less interpretable
    compared to other metrics. A good regression model will have an MSE value closer
    to zero, indicating a higher level of accuracy in its predictions. MSE may be
    computed using the formula: $$MSE=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{e}_{i}^{2}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({y}_{i}-{\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\right)}^{2}$$
    (4) with: The variable to be predicted takes the values \\({y}_{i}\\) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
    \\({\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\) are the predictions, the errors are noted \\({e}_{i}\\)=
    \\({y}_{i}\\) – \\({\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the
    square root of the average squared differences between predicted and observed
    outcomes. It is a widely used evaluation metric in regression analysis and forecasting
    (Nevitt and Hancock 2000; Applegate et al. 2003) to measure the accuracy of predictive
    models. RMSE is preferred over MSE because it provides error values in the same
    units as the target variable, making it more interpretable and easier to compare
    to the original data. A lower RMSE indicates better predictive accuracy, while
    a higher RMSE signifies a greater discrepancy between the predicted and actual
    outcomes. It is calculated by the following formula: $$RMSE=\\sqrt{MSE}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({y}_{i}-{\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\right)}^{2}$$
    (5) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a regression metric used to measure the average
    absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Its advantages include
    robustness to outliers, easy interpretation in the same units as the target variable,
    and intuitive understanding. However, MAE treats all errors equally, which can
    make it less sensitive to small errors that might still be significant. Additionally,
    it may not be as effective in optimization scenarios compared to metrics like
    MSE. A lower MAE indicates better predictive accuracy, while larger MAE values
    signify a greater average discrepancy between the predicted and actual outcomes,
    then MAE is defined as follows: $$MAE=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|{e}_{i}\\right|=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|{y}_{i}-{\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\right|$$
    (6) Coefficient of determination (\\({R}^{2}\\)) is a regression indicator that
    measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the
    independent variables in a model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing a
    perfect fit. A higher R2 value indicates a better fit, showing how well the data
    align with the regression model. R2 is therefore a useful tool for understanding
    the explanatory power of the model. However, it should be used with caution in
    complex models and scenarios where the relationship between variables is non-linear
    or the data is highly dispersed (Nakagawa et al. 2017). \\({{\\varvec{R}}}^{2}\\)

    the different results obtained for ET0 estimation using physics-based models (Hargreaves
    and FAO-PM) combined with ML or DL models and applied first to local observations
    and reanalysis data and then to the combination of both. Machine learning results
    The machine learning models were implemented in python using the TensorFlow (Abadi
    et al. 2017) opensource library. The models were trained with a batch size of
    32 and ran for 50 epochs. The obtained results are presented in Tables 4 and 5,
    providing insights into the performance of machine learning models using both
    the Hargreaves method and the FAO-56 PM method. Table 4 Results of machine leaning
    using Hargreaves method Full size table Table 5 Results of machine leaning using
    FAO-56 PM method Full size table Table 4 provides the machine learning results
    with Hargreaves method using: (1) station data, (2) ERA5-Land data, (3) combined
    data. The table shows that the four machine learning models perform well with
    the three types of data using the Hargreaves method. XGBoost model gave the best
    results with R2 = 0.93 for the station data, 0.95 for the ERA5-Land data and 0.92
    for the combined data. This is because XGBoost is a powerful algorithm that can
    effectively handle complex non-linear relationships in the data. It uses an ensemble
    approach, gradient-based optimization, built-in regularization, and parallel processing
    to achieve high accuracy and robustness. Compared to other models such as Random
    Forest, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost''s combination
    of features makes it more interpretable, less prone to overfitting, and better
    suited to handle large and complex datasets. On the other hand, for the FAO-56
    PM method (Table 5), XGBoost model performs well for all three types of data in
    terms of accuracy and error with an R2 of 0.93 for station data, 0.87 for reanalysis
    data and 0.92 for the combination of data. Generally, the results obtained for
    both the station data and the reanalysis data are effective, which confirms the
    validity of using the reanalysis data in cases of unavailability of data and this
    is confirmed by the results of the combination of the data especially with the
    Hargreaves method. These results have considerable implications for environmental
    and agricultural applications, as they highlight the feasibility of using machine
    learning models to improve ET0 forecasts and water resource management. Deep learning
    results The Deep Learning models were implemented in python, we compiled the models
    using an ''Adam'' optimizer (Zhang 2018) with a learning rate of 0.0001 based
    on mean squared error loss. The hyperparameters we have chosen are acquired after
    a series of experiments, then we selected the best set of parameters and applied
    them to our architecture, including the number of neurons per layer as well as
    the learning rate. To assess the accuracy of the LSTM model, 20% of the dataset
    was used for the test. The performance of the LSTM model during the test phase
    for univariate prediction is presented in Table 6, and visually in Figs. 11 and
    12. Table 6 Univariate forecasting Full size table Fig. 11 Univariate forecasting
    with Hargreaves method using: A station data, B ERA5-Land data, C combination
    of data Full size image Fig. 12 Univariate forecasting with FAO-56 PM method using:
    D station data, E ERA5-Land data, F combination of data Full size image In the
    context of univariate predictions, the results highlight the predictive capabilities
    of various models within the framework of the Hargreaves and FAO-56 PM methods.
    In terms of R2, which measures goodness of fit, the LSTM model consistently achieves
    high values of 0.90 for all data sources (station data, ERA5-Land data and data
    combination) when using the Hargreaves method. This reflects a strong alignment
    between predicted and actual ET0 values. In addition, the LSTM model shows low
    values of MAE, MSE and RMSE, all between 0.004 and 0.07 mm/day, signifying a high
    level of accuracy in predicting ET0. Conversely, when the FAO-56 PM method is
    used, the R2 values of the LSTM model are slightly lower, but still significant,
    at around 0.78. The MAE, MSE and RMSE values remain consistent with the performance
    of the Hargreaves method. These results underline the ability of the LSTM model
    to provide accurate ET0 forecasts, particularly when compared with other models
    such as CNN and GRU. The outstanding performance of the LSTM model can be attributed
    to its ability to capture complex temporal patterns and dependencies in time series
    data, which is crucial for accurate ET0 estimation. The prediction of ET0 based
    on the predictions of the relevant estimators for the station data (site R3),
    gave ideal results using the different architectures used with similar accuracy
    and error (R2 = 0.90 and MSE = 0.004). Furthermore, the test records of the reanalysis
    data proved that the LSTM model was the ideal model. The model had the lowest
    MAE 0.04, RMSE 0.06, and MSE 0.004, and the highest R2 0.91. Similarly for the
    combined data, compared to the other models, the LSTM model was the best model
    with an accuracy of R2=0.89 and an error of MSE=0.004. On the other hand, the
    prediction of ET0 based on the FAO-56 PM method for the three types of data showed
    lower efficiency than those of the models developed by the Hargreaves method,
    but our LSTM architecture still outperformed in terms of accuracy and error (Table
    7). Figures 13 and 14 show a more detailed interpretation of multivariate forecasts
    with Hargreaves and FAO-56 PM methods, respectively. In Fig. 13, it is clear that
    our LSTM architecture shows a notable deviation between actual and predicted values,
    particularly for the data combination. This deviation corresponds to the lower
    precision and higher error of the model, with an R2 of 0.63 and an MSE of 0.008.
    It concludes that while the LSTM architecture generally excels, it can run into
    difficulties when dealing with specific data combinations, pointing to potential
    areas for improvement. Table 7 Multivariate forecasting Full size table Fig. 13

    FAO-56 PM method using: D station data, E ERA5-Land data, F combination of data
    Full size image In the context of multivariate prediction, Table 7 shows the performance
    of the various models using different methods. The LSTM architecture consistently
    achieves high R2 values when combined with the Hargreaves method, reflecting its
    ability to capture the underlying patterns. The CNN and GRU models show promise
    but with different levels of effectiveness. However, the robustness of the LSTM
    model is again evident when the FAO-56 PM method is employed, confirming its ability
    to compensate for methodological limitations as shown in Fig. 14. These results
    underline the potential of the LSTM architecture as a robust tool for accurate
    ET0 predictions, particularly in conjunction with the Hargreaves method. The discrepancies
    observed highlight the need to adopt approaches adapted to certain combinations
    of data. Comparing deep learning models In our analysis of deep learning models,
    we focus on the comparative analysis presented in Figs. 15, 16, 17 and 18. Fig.

    forecasting with the FAO-56 PM method using D station data, E ERA5-Land data,
    F combination of data Full size image Figures 15 and 17 clearly illustrate the
    exceptional predictive performance of the LSTM architecture when using the Hargreaves
    method for both univariate and multivariate predictions. Notably, the predictions
    align closely with the actual values, underlining a remarkable consistency that
    outperforms other models. This result is confirmed by the R2 of the prediction,
    which consistently lies within the remarkable range of 0.89 to 0.91. A closer
    look at this success reveals that LSTM''s fundamental ability to capture complex
    long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in time series data is behind its
    superior performance. This attribute fits perfectly with the research objective
    of accurately estimating environmental variables such as evapotranspiration. In
    contrast, CNNs are better suited for processing spatial data such as images, while
    GRUs are a simplified version of LSTMs that do not have as many memory cells and
    therefore may not be able to capture long-term dependencies as well as LSTMs.
    On the contrary, when using the FAO-56 PM method for univariate and multivariate
    predictions, as shown in Figs. 16 and 18, some deviations become evident between
    predicted and actual values. Despite these gaps, the LSTM model continues to display
    a superiority that outperforms other models, as shown by the convincing prediction
    results. LSTM''s ability to outperform its models is due to its ability to grasp
    the difficulties associated with time series, enabling it to generate more accurate
    estimates. Remarkably, the observed trend aligns perfectly with our main research
    objective, namely, to leverage data-driven approaches to improve ET0 estimation.
    The comparative success of the Hargreaves method can be attributed to its detailed
    understanding of local climatic conditions, which fits well with the objective
    of optimizing irrigation practices for efficient water use in agriculture. The
    better performance of this model compared with the FAO-56 PM method can be associated
    with its reliance on fewer meteorological parameters, making it less sensitive
    to data gaps or inaccuracies. In conclusion, the detailed comparison of deep learning
    models within the context of our research objectives showcases the LSTM model''s
    supremacy in capturing long-term dependencies, making it a potent tool for accurate
    environmental predictions. The contrast in performance between the Hargreaves
    and FAO-56 PM methods underscores the former''s ability to excel even with limited
    meteorological inputs, addressing the challenge of data availability and enhancing
    our ability to inform water resource management decisions. Conclusion The main
    objective of this study is the development of three different approaches for reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0) prediction, using reanalysis data extracted from ERA5-Land.
    In the first place we used physical models including FAO-56 PM and Hargreaves.
    Secondly, we combined physics models with ML and DL models. Lastly, we used a
    combination of reanalysis and in-situ data. The estimation was done using univariate
    prediction based on ET0 history, and multivariate prediction based on relevant
    estimators including global solar radiation and mean air temperature. The proposed
    approaches were able to offer successful results. The Machine learning approaches
    have a top accuracy of 93% using station data, 95% using ERA5-Land data, and 92%
    using the combined data. As for Deep learning approaches, they provide the same
    accuracy of 90% using univariate prediction. Moreover, the multivariate prediction
    shows efficient accuracy results of 90% using station data, 91% using ERA5-Land
    data, and 89% using the combined data. The obtained results are based solely on
    the previously mentioned two features, and the resulting AI models are less complex
    than most architectures of the state-of-the-art. Based on this study, reanalysis
    data contains enough information for ET0 prediction, and thus can be used for
    any prediction task. In addition, due to the influence of data, ML models are
    more accurate than DL models, as the training of DL models on the dataset between
    2013 and 2020 is insufficient, hence the use of tabular data performs poorly with
    DL models compared to ML models. Furthermore, CNN models have similar performance
    to RNNs while being faster by a large margin. To summarize, this paper suggests
    that the use of reanalysis data in the case of lack of meteorological data is
    efficient and provides effective results and allows minimizing the expenses of
    installation and management of evapotranspiration measurement tools. For the coming
    work, we will develop a decision support platform for spatialized estimation of
    crop evapotranspiration (ET) from multi-source and multi-scale satellite imagery.
    We also plan on using deeper and more advanced architectures for ET estimation
    to increase the accuracy of predictions. Furthermore, to help farmers improve
    the efficiency of irrigation planning and water resources management, the predicted
    ET0 will be used to predict crop yield. Data availability The data that has been
    used is confidential. References Abadi M, Isard M, Murray DG (2017) A Computational

    transformCONUS 1. Introduction Precipitation is considered a complex atmospheric
    phenomenon owing to its spatiotemporal dependencies, and its processes and mechanisms
    remain poorly understood. The precipitation must be accurately forecasted to ensure
    food production and safety, manage water supply, and mitigate flood risks (He
    et al., 2015). In particular, the daily precipitation must be reliably forecasted
    to facilitate water resource planning, runoff modeling, irrigation management,
    and crop insurance applications (He et al., 2015). Artificial intelligence (AI)
    techniques can provide valuable insights for precipitation forecasting and forewarning
    without detailed information regarding the hydrological/physical behaviors of
    the study area (Ali et al., 2020). Although many researchers have used AI models
    to forecast rainfall, they focused mainly on long-term horizons (i.e., monthly
    or annual). For example, He et al. (2015) developed a wavelet artificial neural
    network (WANN) approach with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and mutual information
    to predict the monthly precipitation at 255 weather sites spanning six climate
    regions across Australia. The authors used rainfall data from 1959 to 1998 (from
    1999 to 2008) for the training (forecasting) phase, and their hybrid model outperformed
    multi-linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques.
    Ali et al. (2020) applied the kernel ridge regression and random forest techniques
    to forecast monthly rainfall at three weather sites in Pakistan. The authors used
    rainfall data from 1962 to 2012 to forecast the rainfall in 2013. The hybrid models
    outperformed the standalone methods in predicting the monthly precipitation. Ni
    et al. (2020) utilized wavelet long-short term memory (WLSTM) to predict the monthly
    precipitation at two weather stations in China. The authors considered the rainfall
    data from 1951 to 2007 (from 2008 to 2017) for the training (forecasting) phase.
    The wavelet technique improved the ability of the long short-term memory (LSTM)
    technique for 1-, 3-, and 6-month-ahead precipitation prediction. Most of the
    studies on the use of AI algorithms for short-term (i.e., daily) rainfall forecasting
    have been based in Turkey. Partal and Kisi (2007) combined wavelet and neuro-fuzzy
    models to forecast 1-day-ahead precipitation at three weather sites in Turkey.
    The authors used the precipitation data from 1987 to 1998 (1999 to 2001) for the
    training (forecasting) phase. The wavelet transform enhanced the performance of
    the neuro-fuzzy method at all the stations. Kisi and Shiri (2011) and Kisi and
    Cimen (2012) used the same dataset (1987–2001) and considered the same weather
    sites to forecast 1-day-ahead precipitation via wavelet support vector machine
    and wavelet genetic programming models. The wavelet transform improved the performance
    of the methods compared with those of support vector machine (SVM) and genetic
    programming approaches. Precipitation data for the same period (1987–2001) were
    used by Partal et al. (2015) to forecast the daily precipitation at 28 (located
    in two climate regions) and five weather stations, respectively, in Turkey. One-day-ahead
    daily precipitation was successfully forecasted using WANN models. Altunkaynak
    and Nigussie (2015) predicted the daily rainfall using seasonal multilayer perceptron
    and wavelet multilayer perceptron models. The authors used rainfall data from
    1974 to 1992 (from 1993 to 2001) for the training (forecasting) phase to forecast
    the daily rainfall at two weather sites in Turkey. The seasonal multilayer perceptron
    (wavelet multilayer perceptron) yielded more accurate 2- to 5-day (1-day) ahead
    forecasts. Additionally, Altunkaynak and Ozger (2016) predicted the daily precipitation
    using wavelet multilayer perceptron model at two weather stations in Turkey. The
    authors used precipitation data from 1973 to 2002 to predict 1-day-ahead precipitation
    for 2003. The results showed that the introduction of the wavelet transform enhanced
    the forecasting accuracy. Most of the other studies on the use of AI techniques
    for daily rainfall forecasting have been focused on India and China. Chau and
    Wu (2010) combined the ANN and support vector regression (SVR) frameworks to forecast
    1-day, 2-day, and 3-day-ahead rainfall at two weather sites in China using rainfall
    data from 1984 to 2007. Half of the data was used to train the methods. The hybrid
    model outperformed the standalone ANN and SVR models at both sites. Charaniya
    and Dudul (2013) successfully predicted 1-day-ahead rainfall at a weather station
    in India using generalized feedforward network and focused time lag neural network
    approaches for 2006 using precipitation data from 1977 to 2005. Devi et al. (2016)
    compared distributed time delay, feed forward back propagation, cascade forward
    back propagation, and nonlinear autoregressive exogenous network models to forecast
    1-day-ahead rainfall at 14 rain gauges in India. The authors used rainfall data
    from 2009 to 2012 and considered 75 % of the data for training the models. The
    accuracy of all the methods was comparable. Peng et al. (2019) combined gene expression
    programming and extreme learning machine (ELM) models to predict the daily precipitation
    at 89 weather sites in China. The authors used precipitation data from 2003 to
    2007 to predict 2-day-ahead precipitation in three climate regions for 2008. The
    hybrid model more accurately predicted the precipitation than the single models.
    Unnikrishnan and Jothiprakash (2020) integrated ANN, singular spectrum analysis,
    and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) frameworks. The hybrid approach
    was trained using rainfall data from 1961 to 2012 and then used to forecast 1-day-ahead
    rainfall at nine weather stations in India for 2013. The hybrid method outperformed
    the ANN and ARIMA methods. Khan and Maity (2020) developed a hybrid convolutional
    ANN and multilayer perceptron network to forecast 1-day to 5-day-ahead precipitation
    at several weather stations in India. The authors used the data of 1941–2005 and
    considered 85 % of the data for the training phase. The hybrid method outperformed
    both of the standalone approaches. In terms of other Asian countries, Pham et
    al. (2020) predicted the 1-day-ahead rainfall at a weather station in Viet Nam
    by ANN, SVM, and PSO adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (PSOANFIS) models.
    The models were trained using the wind speed, maximum air temperature, minimum
    air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation data from 2004 to 2009.
    All models could accurately forecast the rainfall from 2010 to 2013. Ridwan et
    al. (2020) compared the accuracy of boosted decision tree regression, Bayesian
    linear regression, decision forest regression, and neural network regression models
    in forecasting 1-day-ahead rainfall in Malaysia. Specifically, the authors forecasted
    the daily rainfall in 2019 with the data from 2010 to 2018 at 10 weather sites.
    Boosted decision tree regression outperformed the other models at most of the
    study sites. In terms of European regions, Baratta et al. (2003) proposed an ensemble
    method based on singular spectrum analysis to predict the daily precipitation
    at 135 weather sites in the Tiber River basin in Italy. The authors used the data
    from 1958 to 1966 (1967) for the training (forecasting) phase. The ensemble method
    improved the prediction accuracy of multilayer perceptron models. Abdulkadir et
    al. (2020) predicted the daily precipitation at Ercan Airport in Cyprus using
    ANN, MLR, and ANFIS. The authors used rainfall data from 2008 to 2018 and considered
    75 % of the data for training. ANFIS outperformed the other methods in 1-day-ahead
    rainfall forecasting. In comparison, research on daily precipitation forecasting
    in the United States (US) is rather limited. Kuligowski and Barros (1998) applied
    the back propagation neural network (BPNN) technique to predict the daily precipitation
    at four weather sites in the Youghiogheny and Swatara basins in PA, US. The authors
    used daily precipitation data from 1987 to 1991 to train the model and forecasted
    the daily precipitation for 1992. The BPNN model outperformed the linear regression
    models. Notably, most of the existing studies used the data of only 1–3 year(s)
    in the forecasting phase (Baratta et al., 2003, Partal and Kisi, 2007; Artal and
    Cigizoglu, 2009; Kisi and Shiri, 2011, Kisi and Cimen, 2012, Charaniya and Dudul,
    2013, Partal et al., 2015, Altunkaynak and Ozger, 2016, Devi et al., 2016, Peng
    et al., 2019, Kalteh, 2019, Unnikrishnan and Jothiprakash, 2020, Ridwan et al.,
    2020, Abdulkadir et al., 2020). Additionally, precipitation data for the recent
    years (2010–2019) were not considered, even though more extreme precipitation
    events have occurred in the recent decade because of extensive climate variability
    and change worldwide (Donat et al., 2016, Valipour et al., 2020). Moreover, the
    existing studies focused on only 1–3 climate region(s), owing to which, the performance
    evaluation of the machine learning techniques was not rigorous (Altunkaynak and
    Nigussie 2015). Specifically, although the AI models could accurately forecast
    the daily precipitation in certain climate regions, their performance deteriorated
    in regions with other climatic conditions (Cramer et al., 2017, Nourani and Farboudfam,
    2019). Additionally, most of the abovementioned studies obtained only 1-step ahead
    forecasts. The performance of the AI models may not be similar in multi-step ahead
    rainfall forecasting and is expected to deteriorate (Chau and Wu, 2010, Altunkaynak
    and Nigussie, 2015). Moreover, the literature review highlighted the potential
    of hybrid models, especially the introduction of the wavelet transform, in increasing
    the accuracy of precipitation forecast compared to those of standalone AI models
    (Partal and Kisi, 2007, Kisi and Shiri, 2011, Kisi and Cimen, 2012, Altunkaynak
    and Nigussie, 2015, Altunkaynak and Ozger, 2016, Kalteh, 2019). Therefore, we
    applied the wavelet transform to build three hybrid AI models: wavelet group method
    of data handling (WGMDH), wavelet LSTM (WLSTM), and wavelet PSOANFIS (WPSOANFIS).
    The potential of LSTM, PSO, and ANFIS techniques in forecasting the rainfall in
    daily and monthly time scales has been previously demonstrated (He et al., 2015,
    Ni et al., 2020, Pham et al., 2020, Abdulkadir et al., 2020). However, none of
    the existing studies have used the group method of data handling (GMDH) for precipitation
    forecasting, despite its promising performance in forecasting other hydrological
    variables such as the streamflow discharge (Najafzadeh and Zahiri, 2015, Adnan
    et al., 2020), reference evapotranspiration (Ashrafzadeh et al., 2020; Ferriera
    and da Cunha 2020), and runoff (Moosavi et al., 2017). The aim of this research
    was to forecast the 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day-ahead precipitation at 28 sites with
    various climates over the contiguous US (CONUS). Daily precipitation data from
    1995 to 2019 were collected, and those for the last five years were used in the
    forecasting phase. This research augmented the existing studies in four main ways:
    1) it utilized the WGMDH technique to forecast precipitation for 1, 2, and 3 days
    ahead using a few weather parameters. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no
    other paper has employed the WGMDH model to forecast precipitation, 2) it evaluated
    the machine learning techniques at 28 stations across the CONUS with various climates.
    The previous investigations predicted precipitation, at maximum only at a few
    study stations, 3) three input structures were applied to assess the performance
    of machine learning techniques, and 4) it compared the performance of WGMDH with
    two commonly used models, namely WPSOANFIS and WLSTM. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Data The authors gathered 25 years of daily precipitation data at 28 study
    stations located in various climates over the CONUS from1995 to 2019. We used
    data from 1995 (2015) to 2014 (2019) for training (forecasting). We considered
    75 % and 25 % of the precipitation data for training and forecasting, respectively,
    similar to the distribution used in past studies (Ferreira and da Cunha, 2020,
    Chau and Wu, 2010, Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015). The study stations were chosen
    considering the availability of data while ensuring each climate region corresponded
    to at least two sites. Fig. 1 shows the locations of the study sites, and Table
    1 presents the general information of the study sites. The National Centers for
    Environmental Information (NCEI) identified nine climate regions across the CONUS
    by analyzing variations of historical data in different areas (Karl and Koss,
    1984, NOAA, 2023). In our study, we chose 28 study sites to cover all types of
    climates within the CONUS to show/compare the performance of the models in all
    climate types rather than just only one climate. Covering all nine types of climates
    allows us to have a much better understanding of the performance of models in
    different environmental and climatic conditions. The considered stations are located
    in 14 states with altitudes ranging from 8 m (in Philadelphia, PA) to >18 m (in
    Cortez, CO), respectively (Table 1). The selected sites cover a variety of climate
    conditions which have been noted to influence the performance of machine learning
    techniques in precipitation forecasting (Cramer et al., 2017, Nourani and Farboudfam,

    2.2. Wavelet transform technique The wavelet transform technique is a signal processing
    tool similar to the Fourier series, which can evaluate stationary and non-stationary
    data (Ni et al., 2020). The goal of this technique is to create higher resolution
    frequency and time information data than what can be obtained via conventional
    transform technique (He et al., 2015, Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015). A signal
    is divided by the wavelet transform technique into two forms of the mother wavelet
    transform called shifted and scaled forms. The wavelet transform technique increases
    the accuracy of predictions by denoising and smoothing time series data (see also
    Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015, Ni et al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that
    the wavelet transform technique may be utilized to calculate various parts of
    the time-domain signal at different frequencies and achieve a time-scale form
    of transient and localized event, which happen at various time scales (Cobaner,
    2013, Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015). The wavelet transform technique is able
    to decompose the original time-series into sub-series with various resolutions
    (He et al., 2015, Ni et al., 2020). Additionally, the wavelet transform technique
    can capture various features of time-series data such as discontinuities, breakdown
    points and trends better than other signal analysis approaches (He et al., 2015).
    The main wavelet transform function is given by, (1) where is called the mother
    wavelet whose dilation and contraction yields : (2) where a shows the dilation
    (if a > 1) or contraction (if a < 1), and b denotes the shift of the wavelet function
    (He et al., 2015, Cobaner, 2013). Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and continuous
    wavelet transform (CWT) techniques are used more than the other wavelet transform
    techniques. The CWT of a signal is expressed via (Cobaner 2013) (3) where ζ(t)
    is a signal, s and are the scale and translation parameters, respectively, and
    denotes the complex conjugate. DWT is suitable once we deal with integer transforms.
    It was obtained by discretizing the parameters a and b (Mallat, 1989). In its
    most common form, the DWT employs a dyadic sampling with parameters a and b based
    on powers of two: a = 2j and b = k × 2j, with j, k ℤ. j and k are the control
    coefficients for wavelet dilation and translation, respectively. By substituting
    a = 2j and b = k × 2j in Eq. (2), we obtained the dyadic wavelets (Eq. (4): (4)
    DWT of a signal can be expressed as, (5) where s(t) is a signal, and are the wavelet
    coefficients at level j and location k (Magosso et al., 2009). 2.3. LSTM method
    LSTM is a powerful deep learning technique (He et al., 2015) that is based on
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The recurrent hidden unit of RNNs shapes a loop
    to keep information relating to all previous elements in the sequence (Ni et al.,
    2020). RNNs can be deemed as deep neural networks with only one layer per each
    time step. They share the same weights over different time steps (Ni et al., 2020).
    While RNNs are robust dynamic systems, they are challenging to train because of
    their vulnerability to the exploding gradient phenomena. LSTMs were designed to
    overcome this problem (Ni et al., 2020) by replacing the traditional recurrent
    hidden unit with another unit called memory cell. The memory cell acts similar
    to a gated leaky neuron. It is worth mentioning that the memory cell is linked
    to itself in the subsequent step (He et al., 2015). The input gate utilizes the
    data to update the cell state (Ct). The tanh layer generates an updated value
    which may be added to the state, thereafter Ct is updated. Also, the output gate
    manages the data of Ct to be successfully transmitted to the new hidden layer
    (He et al., 2015). Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the WLSTM model, and Table
    2 summarizes the parameters of the best WLSTM model for predicting the daily precipitation.

    S1-S3). In all the four testing sites, the best results were obtained with Tanh
    as the “Activation function to update the cell and hidden state” and Sigmoid as
    the “Activation function applied to the gates”. Therefore, they were used at all
    the 28 sites. 2.4. GMDH model GMDH is a multivariable statistical technique, which
    is able to identify the nonlinear input–output relationships in complex systems.
    This model is on the basis of the nested structures of cubic and quadratic polynomials.
    Each layer in GMDH is a collection of input elements (the so-called nodes), and
    the output of each layer is used as a new input for the next layer (Assaleh et
    al., 2009). As GMDH does not need information of the exact physical model in advance,
    it can be considered an inductive self-organizing algebraic method. This model
    can learn the relationship underlying the system parameters in the training phase.
    During the training process, the optimal structure of the network is determined
    by minimizing the difference between the network outputs and measurements. Additionally,
    GMDH removes extra nodes from the network. Thus, this model is highly generalizable
    and may reflect the complexity of nonlinear networks within a simple system, which
    is computationally stable (Ashrafzadeh et al., 2020, Assaleh et al., 2009). Fig.

    PSO technique enhances the reliability of the predictions obtained using ANFIS
    (Moayedi and Rezaei 2020). Therefore, in the PSOANFIS framework, the PSO algorithm
    is applied to optimize the parameters of the membership function. PSOANFIS can
    be easily adapted to network structures of different sizes. First, the PSOANFIS
    algorithm initializes a set of particles, randomly selects particles, and adjusts
    a position for every particle (i.e., it assigns initial weights and biases). ANFIS
    has two types of parameters, i.e., consequent and premise parameters, which are
    optimized throughout the system learning process. The predicting network may fall
    into a local minimum solution once solving complicated problems. To overcome this
    shortcoming, PSO was employed in this study to update the ANFIS parameters (Moayedi
    and Rezaei 2020). The combination of backpropagation gradient descent and least-squares
    methods was used to train ANFIS. The numbers of training epochs and input membership
    functions were changed to achieve the best ANFIS structure. Fig. 4 schematically
    illustrates the WPSOANFIS model, and Table 4 shows the parameters of the best

    indices The forecasting accuracies of the models were assessed by four indices,
    i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of
    determination (R2), and Bias, defined as (Ali et al., 2020, Ni et al., 2020, Ridwan
    et al., 2020) (6) (7) (8) (9) where is the ith precipitation observation; is the
    ith precipitation forecasted using the WLSTM, WGMDH, and WPSOANFIS approaches;
    is the mean of precipitation observations; is the mean of the precipitation forecasts;
    and N is the number of data points. In general, RMSE and MAE denote the mean of
    the deviation between the daily precipitation observations and those forecasted
    using the AI models. RMSE and MAE vary between 0 and +∞, and values closer to
    zero indicate more accurate forecasts. R2 represents the quality of fit between
    the precipitation forecasted by the AI models and observations. R2 varies from
    0 to 1, with 1 representing a perfect fit. 2.7. Taylor diagram Correlation coefficient
    (R), RMSE, and standard deviation (SD) are illustrated on the Taylor diagram to
    better visualize the outcomes. The mathematical relation between these three statistics
    (Taylor, 2001) is (10) 3. Results and discussions 3.1. 1-day-ahead precipitation
    prediction at 28 sites across the CONUS Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 show scatter plots
    of the 1-day-ahead precipitation forecasts obtained from the WLSTM, WGMDH, and
    WPSOANFIS methods, respectively, at 28 stations in the CONUS. Fig. 5 shows that
    the WLSTM exhibits its best performance in the sites located in the Southwest
    (SW) climate region (i.e., Yuma Valley, Ault, Safford, and Cortez), with RMSE
    < 1.00 mm/d and MAE < 0.40 mm/d. The next best performance, in terms of the fit
    between the observed and predicted precipitation, pertains to the sites located
    in the West (W) climate region (i.e., Alturas, Bishop, and Santa Monica). Table
    1 indicates that the sites located in the SW and W regions have the lowest average
    daily precipitation compared with the other sites. In other words, the WLSTM model
    can better forecast the daily precipitation in areas with lower amounts of precipitation.
    This is in line with the results reported by Ni et al., (2020): The WLSTM was
    noted to more accurately predict the monthly rainfall at a drier weather site
    in China. Download : Download high-res image (996KB) Download : Download full-size

    model at 28 stations over the CONUS. Po and Pf are the observed and forecasted
    precipitation, respectively. Similar outcomes can be seen in Fig. 6, Fig. 7. The
    performances of WGMDH and WPSOANFIS are higher for stations in the SW and W climates
    than those in the other climate regions, in terms of the RMSE and MAE indices.
    Overall, WLSTM shows better results compared to the WGMDH and WPSOANFIS models
    in predicting the 1-day-ahead precipitation at 28 stations over the CONUS. Among
    the 28 stations, Dixon Springs, IL in the Central (C) climate (Table 1) has the
    highest MAE for 1-day-ahead precipitation forecasted by the WLSTM (Fig. 5). Fig.
    6, Fig. 7 also indicate that this site has the highest MAE after Wills Point,
    Gibson, and Rome (Fig. 6) in the case of 1-day-ahead precipitation prediction
    by the WGMDH and Rome (Fig. 7) when the WPSOANFIS is used. Raza et al., (2020)
    reported that Dixon Springs corresponded to the lowest accuracy of 1-day-ahead
    reference evapotranspiration forecasted by the GMDH, compared with two other weather
    sites in IL, USA and other sites in Pakistan, New Zealand, and China. This finding
    is attributable to the high SD of daily precipitation at this site, which impacts
    the ability of AI models in forecasting its precipitation (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig.
    7) and reference evapotranspiration (Raza et al., 2020). Table 1 also indicates
    that Dixon Springs has the largest SD for daily precipitation (9.95 mm), second
    only to Rome (10.16 mm). The highest R2 values for the WLSTM, WGMDH, and WPSOANFIS
    methods correspond to Wills Point (0.92), Harvard (0.90), and Bottineau (0.81),
    respectively. Notably, Wills Point is located in the South (S), whereas Harvard
    and Bottineau are located in the West–North–Central (WNC) climate region (Table
    1). In general, for the WLSTM (Fig. 5), 82 %, 75 %, and 100 % of the study sites
    have RMSE < 2.00 mm/d, MAE < 1.00 mm/d, and R2 > 0.75, respectively. Similar values
    are noted for 68 %, 61 %, and 71 % of the study sites for WGMDH. The worst results
    pertain to the WPSOANFIS, with 48 % of the study sites with RMSE < 2.00 mm/d,
    61 % of the study sites with MAE < 1.00 mm/d, and 11 % of the study sites with
    R2 > 0.75. For WLSTM, we changed the number of epochs from 1 to 10000, the number
    of hidden units from 1 to 1000, and the number of epochs for dropping the learning
    rate from 1 to 500. The optimum values of the above parameters are shown in Table
    2. We also tested three optimizer solvers, namely rmsprop, sgdm, and adam, and
    three Activation Function, including Sigmoid, ReLu, and Tanh. The best optimizer
    solver and Activation Function are indicated in Table 2. For WGMDH, we changed
    the number of delays from 1 to 100, the number of neurons from 1 to 1000, the
    number of layers from 1 to 200, the number of epochs from 1 to 10000, the size
    of mini-batch from 1 to 500, and the number of epochs for dropping the learning
    rate from 1 to 300. We tried three optimizer solvers including rmsprop, sgdm,
    and adam, and three Activation Function, namely Sigmoid, ReLu, and Tanh. The optimum
    values of the above parameters and the best optimizer solvers and activation functions
    are shown in Table 3. Finally, for WPSOANFIS, we varied the number of iterations
    from 1 to 1000, the population size from 1 to 400, the number of epochs from 1
    to 10000, the number of mutants from 1 to 100, the number of parents from 1 to
    100, and the number of clusters from 1 to 100. Their best values were shown in
    Table 4. The remaining parameters were selected on the basis of the default values
    in the MATLAB software (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4). Fig. 8 illustrates the time
    series of the precipitation measurements at Harvey and that forecasted by the
    models for the 1-day-ahead scenario. This site was selected as a representative
    for comparing the time series of rainfall forecasts from the three AI models with
    observations. Although WGMDH and WPSOANFIS can more accurately forecast precipitations
    greater than 30 mm compared with the WLSTM model, the WLSTM outperforms these
    models in capturing the other peak points. Overall, the WLSTM can more accurately
    forecast the 1-day-ahead precipitation at Harvey from 2015 to 2019 than WGMDH
    and WPSOANFIS. These findings are consistent with those shown in Fig. 5, Fig.
    6, Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (596KB) Download : Download full-size

    forecasting at 28 sites across the CONUS Fig. 9 shows heat maps of the statistical
    indices for 2- (top) and 3-day (bottom)-ahead precipitation prediction at the
    study sites. The WGMDH more accurately forecasts 2- and 3-day-ahead precipitation
    than WLSTM and WPSOANFIS in most of the stations over the CONUS. Analogous to
    the outcomes indicated in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, the best accuracy of all three
    techniques is seen at the stations located in the SW (i.e., Ault, Yuma Valley,
    Safford, and Cortez) and W (i.e., Alturas, Bishop, and Santa Monica) climate regions
    for 2- and 3-day-ahead precipitation prediction (Fig. 9). In other words, all
    the methods show their best accuracy in these two climates for all the three lead
    times (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9). Fig. 9 also shows the influence
    of the variations in the daily precipitation on the performance of the AI approaches.
    The highest RMSE and MAE for the WPSOANFIS model are observed for Dixon Springs,
    Rockdale, Gibson, and Rome for both 2- and 3-day-ahead precipitation forecasts.
    Notably, these four sites have the largest SDs of daily precipitation among the
    28 selected sites (Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    3.3. Overall assessment of the methods for daily precipitation prediction Table
    5 summarizes the performance metrics of the three methods for 1-, 2-, and 3-day-ahead
    precipitation prediction for all the study sites. In most cases, the models perform
    better in the training step than in the prediction step. The WLSTM (WGMDH) more
    accurately forecasts the daily precipitation than the other techniques for 1-day
    (2- and 3-day) ahead time scale(s). This result is consistent with those presented
    in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9. All models show low values of Bias
    for 1-, 2-, and 3-day ahead precipitation forecasts. Table 5. Performance of the

    0.24 −0.039 The 28-site average MAEs of the 1-day-ahead precipitation predictions
    from the WLSTM, WGMDH, and WPSOANFIS are 0.65, 0.77, and 1.31 mm/d, respectively.
    For the WLSTM, the 28-site mean RMSE and R2 are 1.47 mm/d and 0.91, respectively.
    The RMSE and R2 for WGMDH (WPSOANFIS) are 1.66 mm/d and 0.88 (3.09 mm/d and 0.59),
    respectively. Furthermore, the utilized machine learning methods more accurately
    predict the daily precipitation than the previously reported values. Kuligowski
    and Barros (1998) predicted the 1-day-ahead precipitation at four sites in PA,
    US by using the BPNN model. The RMSE was 2.55 mm/d (forecasting phase), larger
    than those of the WLSTM (1.47 mm/d) and WGMDH (1.66 mm/d). Kalateh (2019) predicted
    1-day-ahead rainfall at Barton Pond in MI, US using WELM, with RMSE = 2.77 mm
    and 3.05 mm in the training and forecasting steps, respectively. The WLSTM and
    WGMDH achieved better results in both phases (Table 5). Moreover, the proposed
    AI models yielded more accurate predictions when compared with the existing studies
    focused on other countries. Partal and Cigizoglu (2009) applied WANN to predict
    the 1-day-ahead rainfall at 28 sites in Turkey with R2 = 0.77 (forecasting phase),
    which is lower than those obtained by WLSTM (0.91) and WGMDH (0.88). Sedki et
    al., (2009) forecasted the 1-day-ahead precipitation at three weather sites in
    Morocco using BPNN with R2 = 0.87 (forecasting phase), which is lower than those
    obtained using the WLSTM (0.91) and WGMDH (0.88) models. Sehad et al. (2017) applied
    the SVM to forecast the 1-day-ahead rainfall at 304 sites in north Algeria. The
    RMSE and MAE for the forecasting phase were 2.23 mm and 1.14 mm, respectively.
    Better results were obtained using the WLSTM and WGMDH models. Pham et al. (2020)
    applied the PSOANFIS technique to forecast the 1-day-ahead rainfall at a weather
    site in Viet Nam, resulting in MAEs of 3.14 mm/d and 3.28 mm/d in the training
    and forecasting phases, respectively. These values are considerably larger than
    those (1.10 mm/d and 1.31 mm/d) obtained by WPSOANFIS in our study (Table 5).
    Similar findings are observed for 2- and 3-day-ahead precipitations. Chau and
    Wu (2010) forecasted the daily rainfall at two weather sites in China using a
    combined ANN and SVR model, with the forecasting RMSEs for 2- and 3-day-ahead
    rainfall being 3.34 mm/d and 3.72 mm/d, respectively. Lower values were obtained
    using the WLSTM and WGMDH models (Table 5). Altunkaynak and Nigussie (2015) predicted
    the daily rainfall at two weather sites in Turkey. The seasonal multilayer perceptron
    predicted the 2- and 3-day-ahead rainfall with R2 = 0.58 and R2 = 0.57, respectively,
    for the forecasting phase. Better results were obtained using the WLSTM and WGMDH.
    3.4. Evaluation based on Taylor diagrams Fig. 10 shows the Taylor diagrams plotted
    to quantify the degree of correspondence between the forecasted and observed daily
    precipitation values in terms of the RMSE, SD, and R. WLSTM (WGMDH) exhibits the
    largest R and smallest RMSE for 1-day (2- and 3-day) ahead precipitation(s). The
    highest R values for 1-, 2-, and 3-day-ahead precipitation predictions pertain
    to WLSTM (>0.95), WGMDH (>0.85), and WGMDH (>0.80), respectively. The observed
    precipitation has the largest SD compared with the precipitation forecasted by
    the three AI models. The SD of the AI models decreases as the lead time raises
    from 1 day to 3 days. In other words, the ability of the models in capturing the
    high SD of the observation data deteriorates with increasing lead times, particularly
    for peak points (see also Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (432KB)

    3.5. Percentage analyses of the model performance Fig. 11 shows pie charts of
    the absolute error of the precipitation forecasted by the models for all the study
    sites. In 83.1 %, 14.9 %, and 1.9 % of the days, the WLSTM forecasts 1-day-ahead
    precipitation with absolute errors smaller than 1 mm, between 1 mm and 5 mm, and
    more than 5 mm, respectively. Note that these results are based on all the days
    in the forecasting phase (5 years) for all 28 study sites. In the case of the
    2- and 3-day-ahead precipitation forecasts, WGMDH outperforms WLSTM and WPSOANFIS.
    Specifically, the WGMDH can forecast the 2-day-ahead precipitation with absolute
    errors smaller than 1 mm/d, between 1 mm and 5 mm, and more than 5 mm for 72.4
    %, 22.4 %, and 5.1 % of the days, respectively. The corresponding values for 3-day-ahead
    forecasting are 69.3 %, 25.1 %, and 5.6 %. These results are in agreement with
    those presented in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 and Table 5.
    Overall, the WLSTM, WGMDH, and WGMDH models are the most accurate techniques for
    predicting the daily precipitation in 1-step, 2-step, and 3-step ahead cases,
    respectively. Download : Download high-res image (499KB) Download : Download full-size

    the varying performances of AI models in multi-step ahead daily rainfall prediction.
    Although wavelet multilayer perceptron exhibited the highest accuracy for 1-day-ahead
    rainfall prediction, seasonal multilayer perceptron was the best model for 2-
    to 5-day-ahead prediction. The difference between the prediction performances
    of the WLSTM and WGMDH models pertains to their algorithmic characteristics. WLSTM
    analyses the input series in the order of one element at a time and then produces
    an output sequence with the previous data using the memory cell (He et al., 2015).
    On the other hand, in WGMDH, the data flow only in one direction from the input
    to the output layer. In WGMDH, the weights are adjusted using the method of least
    squares to minimize the residual between the measured values and output values
    generated by the model (Ashrafzadeh et al., 2020). WPSOANFIS can learn only constant
    weights within the training step (Ulina et al., 2020). However, the WGMDH and
    WLSTM methods are able to vary weights in different time series. This is necessary
    because there are anomalies among the time series (Tuli et al., 2020). It is worth
    mentioning that running the WGMDH and WLSTM techniques is highly time consuming
    compared to WPSOANFIS. The advantages and disadvantages of WLSTM, WGMDH, and WPSOANFIS
    were thoroughly explained in Valipour et al. (2023). The readers are referred
    to Valipour et al. (2023) for a detailed discussion on the advantages and shortcomings
    of each method. The findings of this study are expected to promote further research
    on the application of innovative meta-heuristic methods for forecasting the daily
    precipitation. Future works should be focus on using different novel techniques
    such as whale optimization (Mirjalili and Lewis 2016), Harris hawks (Heidari et
    al., 2019), gradient-based (Ahmadianfar et al., 2020), billiards-inspired (Kaveh
    et al., 2020), and darts game (Dehghani et al., 2020) algorithms for daily precipitation
    forecasting. These methods can be integrated with DWT and CWT to increase the
    accuracy of the AI techniques. Moreover, the technique performance can be compared
    to the proposed models to identify opportunities for increasing the lead times
    while maintaining a reasonable accuracy. 4. Conclusions Daily precipitation at
    28 sites corresponding to various climates over the CONUS were forecasted by WLSTM,
    WGMDH, and WPSOANFIS AI models. We collected 25 years of daily precipitation data
    from 1995 to 2019 for all study sites and used 75 % of them for training the models.
    The results showed that the WLSTM can most accurately forecast the 1-day-ahead
    precipitation, with RMSE = 1.47 mm/d, MAE = 0.65 mm/d, and R2 = 0.91 in the forecasting
    phase, based on averages of all the study sites. WGMDH outperforms WLSTM and WPSOANFIS
    for 2-day ahead forecasting with RMSE = 2.42 mm/d, MAE = 1.12 mm/d, and R2 = 0.74.
    Similarly, WGMDH performs better than WLSTM and WPSOANFIS for 3-day ahead forecasting
    with RMSE = 2.86 mm/d, MAE = 1.29 mm/d, and R2 = 0.64. The best accuracy of the
    three techniques are seen in the W and SW climates, where the study sites exhibit
    the lowest average daily precipitation compared with those in the other regions.
    The performance of the methods declines in the study sites with the largest SD
    of daily precipitation, particularly for 2-day and 3-day-ahead predictions. For
    the 1-day (2-day and 3-day) ahead precipitation predictions obtained by the WLSTM
    (WGMDH), an absolute error larger than 5 mm/d was observed in fewer than 2 % (6
    %) of the forecasting days for all 28 sites. The highest RMSE and MAE values from
    WPSOANFIS are observed for Dixon Springs, Rockdale, Gibson, and Rome for both
    2- and 3-day-ahead precipitation forecasts. Notably, these four sites have the
    largest SDs of daily precipitation among the 28 selected sites. In addition, SDs
    of precipitation measurements are larger than those of precipitation forecasted
    by the three AI models. The SDs of precipitation forecasts from the AI models
    decrease as the lead time increases from 1 to 3 days. This shows that the ability
    of the models in capturing the variations of the observation data deteriorate
    with increasing lead times, particularly for peak points. Overall, the WLSTM and
    WGMDH methods can be used for predicting other aspects such as drought, soil moisture,
    crop diseases, and solar radiation to assist hydrologists and agriculturists in
    optimal resource management. Reliable forecasts of the precipitation can help
    provide early warnings of water resource depletion, flood, and drought events
    to the government and stakeholders. Moreover, the results of this study can be
    expanded for other regions with similar climates to realize daily precipitation
    forecasting and irrigation scheduling. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    learning 1. Introduction Crop growth and production are influenced by agro-meteorological,
    soil and crop variables as well as agronomic practices related to water/nutrient
    supply and pesticide/herbicide applications. Specific attention is given to the
    availability of water since it is a limited resource in many arid and semi-arid
    regions, like the Mediterranean [1]. In these regions, nonoptimal irrigation is
    a common cultivation practice and water stress occurs frequently as a main abiotic
    factor that limits crop growth and yield [2,3]. Therefore, the evaluation of water
    stress and efficient water management is of crucial importance for agricultural
    production, especially in areas suffering from water scarcity. In the last few
    decades, coping with water scarcity has become particularly complex due to climate
    change and the variability of weather conditions [4,5]. The impact of climate
    change on Mediterranean agriculture is already evident in many areas, especially
    in arid and semi-arid regions [6]. Several studies reported evidence of climate
    change in the last few decades over the Mediterranean and tried to foresee the
    expected trend and its impact on Mediterranean agriculture in the future [1,7,8,9].
    Frequent droughts, flash floods, heat spells and spring frosts triggered a decline
    in agricultural production, further depletion of water resources, soil erosion
    and impoverishment, land abandonment and desertification and have increased pressures
    on food security and socio-economic development, particularly in marginal rural
    zones [10]. Numerous studies have been conducted on the impact of climate change
    on crop abiotic stresses and production at different scales [2,11,12,13]. Some
    authors [11,13,14] applied crop growth models to simulate crop growth dynamics
    and forecast agricultural production under climate change conditions. A common
    conclusion is that warm and dry climates adversely affect crop phenology and yield.
    Hence, the challenge is to optimise the use of resources (water and nutrients)
    while increasing yields and reducing environmental impacts [1,12]. In this context,
    the application of deficit irrigation [12,15], mulching [16,17] and the use of
    bio-stimulants [18,19,20,21,22] and other water-saving practices have become frequent
    with the aim of attenuating the negative impact of abiotic stresses, positively
    affecting plant physiological processes [19,20,21] and improving soil health [22].
    The adoption of a precision agriculture approach based on the continuous monitoring
    of weather and hydrological variables, water, nutrients and carbon balance represents
    the preconditions and priorities for interventions and research. Equally, proactive
    management tools (e.g., early warning systems and water/nutrient management decision
    support systems considering remote sensing and weather forecasting data) and on-ground
    measurements are of primary importance to attenuate the negative impacts of extreme
    weather events and various abiotic stresses [1,4,12,23]. The success of such measures
    is based on the interactive use of certified, innovative technological solutions
    (i.e., the new generation of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles, artificial intelligence,
    the Internet of Things and cloud-based applications) and the adoption of site-specific
    and resource-optimised management practices and varieties able to respond to adverse
    environmental conditions and to increase/stabilise yields and water productivity
    [2,4]. Potato (Solunum tuberosum L.) is a common Solanaceous crop. Moreover, it
    is one of the largest cultivated food crops in the world and has an important
    nutritional value [15]. Globally, potato production is about 388.2 million Mg
    of fresh yield from about 19.3 million ha [24]. In the Mediterranean region, it
    is cultivated on more than 1 million ha, with a production of about 32 million
    Mg of tubers [25]. Irrigation is necessary to meet crop water requirements due
    to erratic and insufficient rainfall for most potato-cultivated areas [26]. When
    water availability is limited and evapotranspiration demand is high, potato yield
    is negatively affected, even if briefly exposed to water stress because of its
    shallow root system [27,28,29]. Therefore, it is important to adopt the best water
    management solutions as a function of overall water availability, weather and
    soil data and the crop response to water stress during the entire growing season.
    An optimal water supply is particularly relevant during tuber development and
    bulking since these stages are predominantly affected by water stress [30,31].
    For the rest of the growing season, regulated deficit irrigation strategies might
    be a solution [15,25,32]. Hence, the estimation of daily crop evapotranspiration
    adjusted for water stress (ETc-adj) is of vital importance in water-limited agricultural
    areas. The knowledge of ETc-adj on a daily basis gives an idea of the effective
    water uptake from the root zone, which supports the optimisation of irrigation
    scheduling and the enhancement of crop water productivity. Hydrology and environmental
    studies, including agriculture, are characterised by complex processes which include
    many interactions. For example, crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is influenced by
    atmospheric and soil conditions, plant/canopy characteristics and applied agronomic
    measures (irrigation water quantity and quality, the supply of nutrients, plant
    diseases, pests and weeds management, etc.) [33,34]. Today, these interactions
    can be successfully described by modern mathematical tools, including the application
    of machine learning methods. In the last few years, various machine learning methods
    have been tested to estimate both reference and crop ET [35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44].
    In particular, these methods have been developed to enhance the prediction accuracy
    for the estimation of ETo with limited data availability and ETc under optimal
    water supply. For example, Yamaç [45] examined adaptive boosting (AB), k-nearest
    neighbour (kNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) methods for
    modelling sugar beet ETc in Türkiye. The models, considering eight scenarios of
    climate input data demonstrated their applicability for sugar beet ETc estimation.
    Saggi and Jain [46] studied regularisation random forest (RRF) and the fuzzy-genetic
    (FG) models for estimating maize and wheat ETc in India. They found that the proposed
    FG and RRF models are suitable for maize and wheat ETc prediction. Chen et al.
    [47] investigated temporal convolution network (TCN) models comprising long short-term
    memory networks (LSTM) and deep neural networks (DNN) for modelling maize ETc
    under mulched drip irrigation. They highlighted that the TCN models performed
    well in predicting maize ETc under mulched drip irrigation in China. Feng et al.
    [48] analysed the reliability of extreme learning machine (ELM) and generalised
    regression neural network (GRNN) for maize ETc estimation in China. The models
    confirmed better performance using meteorological and crop data as input variables.
    Aghajanloo et al. [49] applied artificial neural network (ANN), GANN and multivariate
    nonlinear regression (MNLR) models to predict potato ETc in Iran. The results
    indicated that all the models used could estimate ETc with the intended level
    of accuracy. While the aforementioned studies demonstrated the applicability of
    different machine learning methods to estimate ETc under optimal water supply,
    there is a lack of studies addressing the estimate of crop evapotranspiration
    adjusted for water stress (ETc-adj) using machine learning techniques. The present
    study aims to fill this gap. Crop evapotranspiration under optimal and water stress
    conditions is commonly computed using the methodology proposed by the FAO Irrigation
    and Drainage Paper 56 [33], which considers the impact of weather through reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo), crop characteristics through crop coefficient (Kc) and
    the water stress level through water stress coefficient (Ks). ETo is estimated
    using the Penman–Monteith (PM) equation as suggested by the FAO [33]. This method
    is physically based and has demonstrated its superiority when compared to other
    empirical methods and equations [34,50,51,52]. The crop coefficient (Kc) is a
    variable that encompasses numerous crop characteristics, including crop type and
    variety, crop growth stage, crop density and height, percentage of ground cover,
    etc. [33,34]. Nevertheless, water stress coefficient (Ks) depends not only on
    crop sensitivity to water stress but also on soil characteristics, including texture
    (soil water holding capacity) and effective management depth, which is linked
    to the rooting system growth. Therefore, estimation of crop evapotranspiration
    requires knowledge and interaction of weather, crop and soil data and their variability
    during the crop growing season. In most cases, only some of the above data are
    available, which affects the estimation of crop ET, especially under water stress.
    The aim of the present study was to examine the performance metric of machine
    learning methods (RF, SVM and AB) for the prediction of potato ETc under both
    optimal and limited water supply conditions, corresponding to full irrigation
    (I100), deficit irrigation with 50% of I100 (I50) and rainfed cultivation (I0).
    Five scenarios of available weather, crop and soil input data were considered.
    The study aimed to determine the best performance metric for each specific input
    data scenario for estimation of potato evapotranspiration under optimal conditions
    (ETc) and under deficit water supply (ETc_adj). Thus, unlike the previous study
    [53], which focused on optimal water supply, this study focuses on predicting
    ETc under water stress and various scenarios using weather, soil and crop data.
    To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to evaluate
    machine learning methods for prediction of ETc_adj, i.e., crop evapotranspiration
    under water stress, across different data availability scenarios. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Study Area and Experiment Design The data were collected from
    field experiments conducted in 2009 and 2010 at the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute
    of Bari (CIHEAM-Bari), located in Valenzano, Southern Italy (41°03′16″ N, 16°52′
    E, 72 m altitude) (Figure 1). According to the Köpper–Geiger classification [54],
    the research area has a Mediterranean climate. The average annual precipitation
    over 30 years is approximately 550 mm, mainly concentrated in autumn and winter
    seasons. An automatic agro-meteorological station collected daily meteorological
    data near the field trail site. The dataset included maximum and minimum air temperature
    (Tmax and Tmin), solar radiation (Rn), maximum and minimum air relative humidity
    (RHmax and RHmin), wind speed at 2 m height (U2) and precipitation (P). Figure
    1. The location of experiment site in Valenzano, province of Bari (Southern Italy).
    Potato cv Spunta was cultivated over two growing seasons. This cultivar is highly
    preferred by farmers in the Mediterranean region due to its tolerance to water
    stress and its potential for high yield [55]. The potatoes were planted at a density
    of 5 plants m−2, with rows spaced 0.8 m apart and plants 0.25 m apart within rows.
    The soil, classified as shallow (0.5–0.6 m depth) with a silty loam texture following
    the USDA particle-size classification (USDA, 2006), had a maximum root depth that
    was fixed at 0.5 m. The experimental season commenced two weeks earlier in 2010
    (3 March) compared to 2009 (17 March). The crop was grown under three water regimes:
    (i) optimal irrigation (I100), aimed at meeting the crop’s water requirements
    optimally, (ii) deficit irrigation (I50), supplying 50% of the crop’s water requirements,
    and (iii) rainfed cultivation (I0). The treatments were arranged in a split plot
    design with three replicates. Each plot measured 7 m by 7 m in the experiment.
    An Excel-based tool version 8.0 [56], employing the standard FAO 56 methodology
    [33], was utilised for irrigation scheduling. The tool utilises weather, soil
    and crop data to estimate ETc and employs a simple water balance model to determine
    soil water content in the effective root zone on a daily basis. The soil gravimetric
    method was used to periodically adjust soil water content in the root zone and
    to monitor and potentially adjust the soil water content estimated by the model
    [57]. For optimal irrigation treatment, localised drip irrigation was employed
    to maintain soil water content within the predefined optimum yield threshold of
    40% related to the total available water content in the root zone. The net irrigation
    supply was 330 and 237 mm in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Deficit irrigation was
    scheduled on the same dates as optimal irrigation but with irrigation amounts
    two times lower. Further details about the field experiment are available in Cantore
    et al. [25]. 2.2. Weather, Crop and Soil Data A synthesis of average weather data
    for both years is presented in Table 1. The growing season of 2009 experienced
    greater precipitation (for 101.4 mm) and higher air temperatures (for 2.2 °C)
    compared to 2010. Additionally, in 2009, solar radiation was higher by 3.2 MJ
    m−2 than in 2010, while relative humidity and windspeed were lower in 2009 than
    in 2010. The variation in weather variables is primarily attributed to the earlier
    start of the growing season in 2010 compared to 2009. Table 1. Average weather
    parameters describing the crop growing seasons of 2009 and 2010 (T: air temperature,
    Rn: solar radiation, RH: air relative humidity, U2: wind speed at 2 m height,
    P: precipitation). The crop growing stages were divided into four periods: initial,
    crop development, mid-season and late season. The starting date and duration of
    each crop growth stage are provided in Table 2. In 2009, the potato growing period
    was 3 days longer than in 2010 (115 vs. 112 days). Table 2. The length of potato
    crop growth stages during the 2 years of experiment. The crop coefficient (Kc)
    combines the effects of soil evaporation and crop transpiration during the crop
    growing season. The initial Kc was set to 0.5 according to the FAO 56 [33]. The
    mid-season crop coefficient (Kcmid) and the end-season crop coefficient (Kcend)
    were adjusted based on the potato height (h), the average value of minimum relative
    humidity (RHmin) and wind speed measured at a height 2 m (U2). The maximum crop
    height was 0.66 m during both growing periods. Consequently, the adjusted values
    of Kcmid and Kcend were 1.14 and 0.72 for 2009 and 1.11 and 0.76 for 2010, respectively
    [53]. The soil in the experimental field had a silty loam texture. Field capacity
    and wilting point were measured at 0.28 m3 m−3 and 0.13 m3 m−3, respectively.
    The allowed soil moisture depletion fraction for optimal irrigation (p) was set
    at 0.40, slightly higher than the value (0.35) proposed in FAO 56, reflecting
    the increased resistance to water stress of the potato variety (Spunta) compared
    to common potato varieties [25]. 2.3. Estimation of Soil Water Balance and Adjusted
    Crop Evapotranspiration A standard procedure recommended by FAO 56 [33] was followed
    for the estimation of crop evapotranspiration and soil water balance modelling.
    The main calculation steps are described below. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
    in mm day−1 was calculated using the Penman–Monteith (PM) equation. Under optimal
    water supply, crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was estimated by multiplying ETo by
    the crop coefficient (Kc). When the soil moisture depletion in the root zone (Dr)
    exceeded the optimum yield threshold (p), the ETc was adjusted to water stress
    (ETc_adj) and estimated using Equation (1): ETc_adj=Ks Kc ETo (1) The water stress
    coefficient (Ks) was computed as: Ks= TAW− D r TAW−RAW = TAW− D r (1−p)TAW for  D
    r >RAW (2) where p is the depletion fraction for no stress (0.4), TAW and RAW
    are, respectively, the total and readily available soil water (mm) relative to
    the rooting depth Zr, and RAW = p TAW. When Dr ≤ RAW, there is no water stress,
    Ks is equal to 1, and ETc_adj is equal to ETc. When Dr > RAW, water stress occurs
    and ETc_adj, estimated by Equation (1), is lower than ETc. The soil water balance
    in the root zone was estimated as: D r,i = D r,i−1 − (P−RO) i − I i − CR i + ET
    c adj + DP i (3) where Dr,i is root zone depletion at the end of day i, Dr,i−1
    represents the root zone depletion at the end of previous day (I − 1), Pi denotes
    effective precipitation, ROi stands for surface runoff, Ii indicates net irrigation
    depth, Cri accounts for capillary rise, ETc adj represents crop ET calculated
    by Equation (4) and DPi signifies deep percolation. All variables are measured
    in mm and subscript i corresponds to a specific day. In the study area, the water
    table was exceptionally deep and the field was flat with proper land management.
    Consequently, the impacts of CR and RO were disregarded. DP was estimated using
    the method proposed by Liu et al. [58]. 2.4. Machine Learning Methods 2.4.1. Random
    Forest The random forest (RF) method was initially introduced by Breiman [59]
    for forecasting problems. The working phases of the method are as follows: (i)
    it randomly selects training samples and creates an independent regression tree;
    (ii) a bootstrap sampling method is utilised for selecting each in dependent regression;
    and (iii) after determining individual trees, the results are estimated by averaging
    the outputs. RF can effectively address strong nonlinear problems and high-dimensional
    data issues without overfitting the data. In this study, the number of trees was
    set to 10 due to its superior performance. For further and detailed understanding
    of the RF model, refer to Breiman [59]. 2.4.2. Support Vector Machine The support
    vector machine (SVM) method was initially developed by Vapnik [60] and has demonstrated
    outstanding performance among machine learning algorithms [61]. SVM is a supervised
    machine learning algorithm utilised for solving regression and classification
    problems. Since the beginning of this century, SVM has been widely applied for
    data analysis in the fields of hydrology, meteorology and agriculture [62,63,64].
    The SVM method employs a set of kernel functions, which transform a low-dimensional
    input space into a higher dimensional space. It is particularly advantageous for
    addressing nonlinear separation problems. The method utilises various types of
    kernel functions, such as radial basis function (RBF), polynomial, sigmoid, nonlinear
    and linear. In this study, the RBF was employed to estimate crop evapotranspiration
    as it demonstrated superior performance compared to other kernel functions. Previously
    published studies have reported similar results, identifying RBF as the best-performing
    kernel function for prediction of ET [40,65,66]. For further and detailed information
    about the calculation process of the SVM model, refer to Vapnik [67]. 2.4.3. Adaptive
    Boosting The adaptive boosting (AB) model was first introduced by Freund and Schapire
    [68] and has become one of the most influenced methods among machine learning
    algorithms [61]. AB was the first successful boosting algorithm developed for
    binary classification and is commonly used for supervised classification problems.
    Essentially, the method classifies data by combining various weak-performing classifiers
    into a single strong classifier, thereby achieving high accuracy. Additionally,
    it can be applied in conjunction with other learning algorithms to enhance their
    performance. The working process of the method is as follows: firstly, the method
    randomly selects a training subset. Secondly, based on the correct predictions
    from the previous training, the method iteratively trains the dataset. Subsequently,
    observations misclassified by a weaker classifier are assigned to stronger classifiers.
    Finally, the process continues until the complete training data achieve the desired
    accuracy or reach the specified maximum number of estimators. In the current study,
    a decision tree was boosted using the AB method. Furthermore, the model attained
    optimal performance when the number of learning rates was fixed at 1 and the number
    of estimators was set to 50. 2.5. Input Scenarios and Model Development Three
    different machine learning methods (RF, SVM and AB) were applied to simulate and
    estimate daily potato evapotranspiration under three irrigation regimes (I100,
    I50 and I0). Weather data (reference evapotranspiration and precipitation), crop
    data (crop coefficient, water stress threshold (p)—fraction of total available
    water and root depth) and soil data (the total soil available water) were used
    as inputs. Table 3 summarises the input scenarios of data availability applied
    for each model. RF1, SVM1 and AB1 were fed only with weather data (ETo and P);
    RF2, SVM2 and AB2 were fed with weather data (ETo and P) and limited crop data
    (Kc); RF3, SVM3 and AB3 were fed with weather data (ETo and P) and full crop data
    (Kc, p and Zr); RF4, SVM4 and AB4 were fed with climate data (ETo and P), limited
    crop data (Kc) and soil data (TAW); and RF5, SVM5 and AB5 were fed with complete
    data, including weather data (ETo and P), crop data (Kc, p and Zr) and soil data
    (TAW). The aim of developing these scenarios was to assess the performance metrics
    of the selected machine learning methods under diverse input data availability,
    as often encountered in practical applications. Table 3. Summary of scenarios
    of input data for each machine learning method. To improve the modelling performance,
    standardisation was applied to all datasets using the following equation: z= x−μ
    σ (4) where σ represents the standard deviation value from the average, µ is the
    average value and x is the observed value. Total data from 2009–2010 of daily
    ETc under three irrigation regimes (I100, I50 and I0) were utilised, with 70%
    randomly selected for training and 30% for testing. Additionally, 5 k-fold cross-validation
    was employed. The workflow of the modelling procedure for daily potato ETc estimation
    is depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2. The workflow of data for daily potato crop

    The performance metrics of three machine learning models for comparing observed
    and simulated ETc-adj values were evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE),
    mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), modelling efficiency

    respectively. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Crop Evapotranspiration under Different
    Water Supply and Water Stress The cumulative ETo and potato crop evapotranspiration
    under three water regimes are presented in Figure 3 for two growing seasons under
    consideration. The values of ETo and ETc (I100) were higher in 2009 compared to
    2010, attributed to greater air temperature and solar radiation in 2009 relative
    to 2010 (Table 1). Indeed, air temperature and solar radiation are the variables
    with the most significant influence on reference evapotranspiration and crop ET
    under optimal water supply [53]. However, in cases of nonoptimal water supply
    and water deficit in the root zone, ETc-adj (I50) and ETc-adj (I0) were notably
    affected by precipitation patterns and crop and soil characteristics. Under water
    stress treatments, crop evapotranspiration values of I50 and I0 were lower in
    2009 than in 2010. This discrepancy can be attributed to an unfavourable precipitation
    pattern and higher overall evaporative demand in 2009 compared to 2010, which
    had a greater impact on potato crop growth under water deficit and affected ETc
    adj (I50) and ETc adj (I0) more in that year than in 2010. In 2009, water stress
    for rainfed crops commenced approximately 25 days after sowing, while, in 2010,
    it occurred approximately 60 days after sowing. Regarding I50 treatments, water
    stress began about two weeks earlier in 2009 than in 2010 (Figure 3). Despite
    higher precipitation in 2009 compared to 2010 (272.2 vs. 170.8 mm), its irregular
    distribution during the growing season had a greater impact on crops grown under
    water deficit in 2009 than in 2010. This observation aligns with Cantore et al.
    [25]. Figure 3. Cumulative reference (ETo) and potato crop evapotranspiration

    3.2. Assessment of Performances of Machine Learning Methods under Different Irrigation
    Regimes The machine learning methods (RF, SVM and AB) were evaluated with five
    scenarios of climate, crop and soil input data. All the results of modelling performance
    are shown in Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6 for optimal irrigation, 50% irrigation
    and rainfed conditions, respectively. The scatter plots of simulated crop evapotranspiration
    values by the RF, SVM and AB models compared to the ET values obtained by the
    FAO 56 procedure are presented in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6 for three water
    regimes (I100, I50 and I0), respectively. Similarly, the residual plots of crop
    evapotranspiration values by the RF, SVM and AB models are compared with the crop
    ET calculated by the FAO 56 method in Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 for I100,
    I50 and I0, respectively. Figure 4. Scatter plot of the daily ETc values in the

    Irrigation Regime (I100) The statistical results of crop evapotranspiration estimate
    under optimal irrigation (I100) using RF, SVM and AB models with five scenarios
    of climate, crop and soil input data are presented in Table 4 for training and
    testing subsets. The estimated ETc (I100) values varied significantly according
    to model types and input data availability scenarios. In general, among the scenarios,
    the SVM model showed the weakest performance confirmed with the lowest R2 and
    EF and the highest MSE, RMSE and MAE in all scenarios for training and testing
    subsets. In contrast, the AB model for the first (AB1), third (AB3), fourth (AB4)
    and fifth (AB5) scenario obtained better statistical performance compared to the
    other two models. For the second scenario, fed with climate data (ETo and P) and
    limited crop data (Kc), the RF2 model demonstrated the best performance. Table
    4. Performance metrics of applied machine learning methods for estimation of daily
    potato evapotranspiration for training and testing subset under optimal irrigation
    regime (I100) and five input data scenarios. The RF model demonstrated very good
    and stable performance for all scenarios of climate, crop and soil input data
    (RF1, RF2, RF3, RF4 and RF5). The lowest modelling performance was observed when
    ETc (I100) was predicted only with climate input data (RF1). In the case of RF,
    significant improvement of ETc (I100) was detected for the second scenario when
    Kc input data are added together with climate data. For this scenario (RF2), the
    statistical parameters MSE, RMSE, MAE, EF, R2 and slope were found to be 0.057
    mm day−1, 0.240 mm day−1, 0.163 mm day−1, 0.983, 0.984 and 0.987, respectively,
    in the testing subset. Then, after adding additional input data (scenarios 3,
    4 and 5), the performance of RF models did not improve and the statistical parameters
    showed similar performance. Among different scenarios, the highest performance
    was observed for the third scenario with climate (ETo and P) and crop (Kc, p and
    Zr) input data. The statistical indicators demonstrated similar performances of
    the RF model for the second (RF2) and fifth (RF5) scenario of input data. The
    good performance of the RF model to estimate sugar beet evapotranspiration under
    semi-arid conditions is reported by Yamaç [45]. Similar conclusions were presented
    recently by Ferreira et al. [69], who used RF algorithm to estimate meteorological
    data and reference evapotranspiration in Brazil. The performance of the SVM model
    slightly improved with the increase in input data (from scenario 1 to scenario
    5). However, this model showed poor performance for all scenarios of data availability,
    indicating its limited suitability for the prediction of crop evapotranspiration.
    The statistical performance of SVM5 model for ETc (I100) estimation showed the
    best performance with R2 (0.812), EF (0.737), slope (1.263), MSE (0.908 mm day−1),
    RMSE (0.953 mm day−1) and MAE (0.693 mm day−1) for the testing subset. A general
    overestimation of ETc was observed for all scenarios and for both training and
    testing subsets. The AB model demonstrated the best performance. The poorest performance
    of the AB model was for the first scenario of data availability (AB1) with MAE,
    MSE, RMSE, EF, R2 and slope equal to 0.254 mm day−1, 0.157 mm day−1, 0.396 mm
    day−1, 0.955, 0.956 and 0.992, respectively. Nevertheless, even for this scenario,
    the performance of the AB model was several times better (especially in terms
    of RMSE) than the performance of SVM with a full dataset (scenario 5). The performance
    of the AB model improved significantly for the second scenario (AB2) in the testing
    subset. The model was slightly improved in the third, fourth and fifth scenarios.
    The AB model showed the superlative performance for ETc (I100) estimate when scenario
    4 with inputs of climate, crop and soil data was used with R2 of 0.992, EF of
    0.992, slope of 1.004, MAE of 0.125 mm day−1, MSE of 0.029 mm day−1 and RMSE of
    0.171 mm day−1. A comparison of observed and simulated ETc (I100) values for RF,
    SVM and AB models are presented in Figure 4 for different scenarios. The SVM model
    created more scattered points than the other machine learning models, while the
    AB model produced the lowest scattering of estimates in comparison to other machine
    learning models. These results confirmed that the performance of the SVM models
    was poorer than that of AB and RF models. The residual plots of ETc (I100) values
    by RF, SVM and AB models are shown in Figure 8. The residual plot showed that
    the most errors occurred for scenario 1, while the least errors occurred for scenario
    5. This is in agreement with the availability of input data and obtained statistical
    parameters. 3.2.2. Performance of Machine Learning Methods under 50% of Optimal
    Irrigation Regime (I50) The statistical results of crop evapotranspiration under
    50% of optimal irrigation supply (I50) using RF, SVM and AB models with five scenarios
    of climate, soil and crop input data are shown in Table 5. Generally, the RF model
    exhibited the highest statistical performances in both the training and testing
    subsets for all input scenarios compared to the SVM and AB models. Similarly to
    the previous case of optimal water supply, the SVM models demonstrated the poorest
    statistical performance in both the training and testing subsets for all input
    scenarios. Table 5. Performance metrics of applied machine learning methods for
    estimation of daily potato evapotranspiration for training and testing subset
    under 50% of optimal irrigation regime (I50) and five input data scenarios. The
    RF model with only climate data (RF1) indicated the lowest performance with R2
    (0.706), EF (0.702), slope (0.996), MSE (0.540 mm day−1), RMSE (0.735 mm day−1)
    and MAE (0.531 mm day−1) obtained for the testing subset. However, the RF models
    employing climate (ETo and P) and crop (Kc, p and Zr) input data had the highest
    estimation accuracy when compared with the other scenarios, with MAE, MSE, RMSE,
    EF, R2 and slope equal to 0.405 mm day−1, 0.335 mm day−1, 0.579 mm day−1, 0.815,
    0.816 and 0.999, respectively. As seen from Table 5, the RF model performance
    increased when crop data were added as input to the weather data. However, no
    further improvement of ETc_adj estimate was observed when soil input data were
    added (scenarios 4 and 5). In fact, the value of total available water (TAW) does
    not provide significant additional information for the estimate of crop evapotranspiration
    if it is not supported by data about root depth (Zr) and crop optimum yield threshold
    (p), as is the case of scenario 4. The statistical result of ETc_adj estimation
    with the SVM model for five scenarios of input data indicated the highest performance
    when climate, crop and soil input data were employed for potato ETc_adj (I50)
    estimation (scenario 5). In that case, R2 was 0.716 with a slope of 1.292, EF
    was 0.622, MAE was 0.629 mm day−1, MSE was 0.686 mm day−1 and RMSE was 0.828 mm
    day−1 in the testing subset. However, SVM1, fed only with climate data, produced
    the poorest performance with R2 of 0.604, EF of 0.440, a slope of 1.522, MSE of
    1.015 mm day−1, RMSE of 1.007 mm day−1 and MAE of 0.777 mm day−1 in the testing
    subset. Similarly to the case of full irrigation supply, the SVM overestimated
    ETc_adj for both data subsets and all scenarios of data availability. The performance
    of the AB model for estimating potato ETc-adj (I50) values showed that the model
    fed only with climate data (AB1) had the lowest performance with R2 (0.697), EF
    (0.694), slope (0.946), MSE (0.555 mm day−1), RMSE (0.745 mm day−1) and MAE (0.548
    mm day−1) for the testing subset. The model improved slightly in the second and
    third scenarios when crop input data were added as input to the climate data.
    The best performance was observed for the AB3 with inputs of weather (ETo and
    P) and crop (Kc, p and Zr) variables, with MAE, MSE, RMSE, EF, slope and R2 equal
    to 0.447 mm day−1, 0.419 mm day−1, 0.648 mm day−1, 0.769, 1.010 and 0.775, respectively.
    The consideration of total available water (TAW) as input did not improve the
    estimation of ETc_adj. A comparison of observed and simulated ETc-adj (I50) values
    for RF, SVM and AB models is presented in Figure 7. The RF, SVM and AB models
    fed only with climate input data (scenario 1) produced more scattered estimates
    than for other scenarios of data availability. The ETc-adj (I50) values estimated
    by RF3, SVM3 and AB3 models were closer to the observed values than other scenarios.
    This confirms that the RF3, SVM3 and AB3 models can predict ETc-adj (I50) values
    better than other combinations of input data availability. The residual plots
    of ETc-adj (I50) values by RF, SVM and AB models are shown in Figure 6. The residual
    plot showed that the most errors occurred in scenario 1, while the least errors
    occurred in scenario 3. 3.2.3. Performances of Machine Learning Methods under
    Rainfed Condition (I0) The statistical results of ETc-adj estimation under rainfed
    (I0) conditions using RF, SVM and AB models with five scenarios of climate, soil
    and crop input data are presented in Table 6. Among the scenarios, RF1, AB2, AB3,
    AB4 and AB5 showed the highest performances, while SVM1, SVM2, SVM3, SVM4 and
    SVM5 demonstrated the poorest performances. Table 6. Performance metrics of applied
    machine learning methods for estimation of daily potato evapotranspiration for
    training and testing subset under rainfed condition (I0) and five input data scenarios.
    The modelling performance of RF decreased from scenario 1 to 4 in the testing
    subset. However, the RF model showed the best performance metrics when all input
    data, such as climate (ETo and P), crop (Kc, p and Zr) and soil (TAW), were added
    to the model. As a result, R2 was 0.906 with the slope of 1.036, EF of 0.898,
    MAE of 0.273 mm day−1, MSE of 0.157 mm day−1 and RMSE of 0.397 mm day−1 in the
    testing subset. Among the other scenarios, the RF4 model, fed with climate (ETo
    and P), crop (Kc) and soil (TAW) data, has the lowest performance with MAE of
    0.273 mm day−1, MSE of 0.157 mm day−1, RMSE of 0.397 mm day−1, EF of 0.898, slope
    of 1.036 and R2 of 0.906, respectively. It can be noticed that crop input data
    of p and Zr significantly affected the modelling performances of the RF model.
    The SVM1 model produced the lowest performance with MAE, MSE, RMSE, EF, slope
    and R2 equal to 0.517 mm day−1, 0.553 mm day−1, 0.744 mm day−1, 0.642, 1.768 and
    0.844, respectively, in the testing subset, while the SVM5 model produced the
    best performance with MAE, MSE, RMSE, EF, slope and R2 equal to 0.380 mm day−1,
    0.275 mm day−1, 0.525 mm day−1, 0.822, 1.342 and 0.904, respectively. In general,
    as in the previous cases referring to optimal water supply and deficit irrigation,
    the SVM model demonstrated the poorest performance, with a strong trend of overestimation
    of Etc-adj in the range from 34% (scenario 5) to 77% (scenario 1) for the testing
    subset. The AB model showed the lowest statistical performance for scenario 1,
    and this was improved for other scenarios when additional input data were used.
    Slightly better performance was observed when the model was applied for scenarios
    2, 3 and 5 compared to scenario 4, which confirmed the previous findings of this
    study referring to optimal and deficit irrigation. The statistical parameters
    of the AB model are similar for the second (AB2), third (AB3) and fifth (AB5)
    scenario of input data availability. The AB2 model showed the highest statistical
    performance in the testing subset with RMSE equal to 0.354 mm day−1, MAE was 0.243
    mm day−1, EF was 0.919, slope of 0.975 and with R2 of 0.920. An evaluation of
    simulated and observed ETc-adj (I0) values for RF, SVM and AB models is shown
    in Figure 5. In all scenarios, the SVM model indicated a more scattered prediction
    than other machine learning models, as well as a noticeable overestimation. The
    ETc-adj (I0) values estimated by the first scenario of the RF model and second,
    third, fourth and fifth scenarios of the AB model were closer to the observed
    values and followed the trend of a 1:1 regression line. These findings agree with
    statistical indicators (Table 6). The residual plots of ETc-adj (I0) values by
    RF, SVM and AB models are shown in Figure 9. The residual plot showed that the
    most errors occurred in scenario 1, while the least errors occurred for scenarios
    3 and 5. 3.3. Assessment of Stability of Machine Learning Methods under Different
    Irrigation Regimes The training and testing RMSE values of three water regimes
    (I100, I50 and I0) are demonstrated in Figure 10 for all the applied machine learning
    models. In general, the RF and AB models provided better prediction than the SVM
    model for all input scenarios. The change in testing RMSE over training RMSE is
    shown in Figure 10. The RF and AB models with all scenarios under optimal irrigation
    regimes (I100) had the largest percentage differences between training and testing
    RMSE values (from 25.4% to 61.5%). In the case of limited water supply (deficit
    irrigation and rainfed cultivation), the percentage difference between training
    and testing RMSE values was small (from 0.2% to 17.4). Figure 10. Differences
    in percentage RMSE values between training and testing subsets for RF, SVM and
    AB models and five scenarios of input data availability. In general, the SVM model
    demonstrated the poorest performance for all elaborated cases. However, it showed
    the smallest difference of RMSE between training and testing subsets. Moreover,
    in the case of rainfed potato cultivation, the RMSE of the SVM model was always
    lower for training than for testing subsets. This confirms that this model has
    very limited suitability to predict crop evapotranspiration. 4. Discussion Considering
    different data availability, the overall results demonstrated that the performance
    of models was improved with an increasing number of input variables. Nevertheless,
    the greatest impact on the simulation results was observed when weather data and
    crop coefficient values were available. The availability of soil characteristics,
    root depth and fraction of available water had a minor impact on simulation results.
    The SVM model showed the lowest predicting accuracy in all input scenarios under
    three water regimes. Substantial overestimation of crop evapotranspiration was
    observed, indicating low suitability of SVM for the prediction of crop ET. The
    AB model offered the best prediction accuracy for four out of five scenarios of
    data availability, while the RF model offered the best prediction accuracy for
    the scenario where weather and crop coefficient data were available under optimal
    irrigation regimes (I100). In the case of deficit irrigation and 50% of the optimal
    irrigation supply (I50), the RF model was superior for all scenarios of data availability.
    Under the rainfed condition, the RF model fed only with climate data had better
    prediction accuracy than SVM and AB models. However, the AB model had the best
    performance for the other four scenarios of data availability. In general, the
    machine learning models demonstrated better prediction of crop evapotranspiration
    under rainfed (I0) and optimal irrigation regimes (I100) than under deficit irrigation
    (50% of the optimal irrigation regime). In general, the assessment of performances
    of machine learning methods under different irrigation regimes showed that RF,
    SVM and AB models were able to simulate complex and nonlinear relationships among
    the climate, soil and crop parameters and to adequately estimate crop evapotranspiration
    under different water regimes. This can be explained by the ability of selected
    models to autonomously solve complex and nonlinear problems by gathering datasets
    from various sources [70]. The models’ performance improved with an increasing
    number of input variables [42]. The greatest positive impact on the models’ performance
    was observed when the crop coefficient data were added to weather data availability
    (scenario 2). Under nonlimited water supply, the soil water balance and, therefore,
    crop evapotranspiration depend substantially only on the weather variables and
    specific crop growing stage because there is no water stress and crop parameters
    (root depth, fraction of readily available water and total available water) are
    not relevant to support crop growth. As water supply is reduced, the importance
    of the crop’s root depth and availability of water within the root zone increases
    because they regulate the crop’s response to water and determine the capability
    of the crop to use water. In fact, under limited water supply, crop evapotranspiration
    is reduced as a function of water availability in the root zone and crop-specific
    sensitivity to water stress. The assessment of stability of machine learning methods
    under different irrigation regimes revealed the instability of the RF and AB models
    as they produced changes in prediction accuracy when new input data were applied
    under optimal irrigation regimes (I100). Similar findings were pointed out also
    by Hassan et al. [71] who mentioned that the RMSE of the RF model had large differences
    between training and testing values. For all models, the RMSE of the testing subset
    was lower than for the training subset only in the case of ETc estimate under
    optimal water supply. For the other two cases (deficit irrigation and rainfed
    cultivation), the difference in RMSE between training and testing subsets was
    only 2–3% and, for some scenarios, it was greater for testing than for training
    subsets. Therefore, it can be concluded that the performance of models is more
    stable under water stress conditions than under optimal irrigation supply. 5.
    Conclusions This study focused on the suitability of three machine learning algorithms
    (RF, SVM and AB models) to predict daily potato evapotranspiration under optimal
    and limited water supply and five scenarios of data availability. To the best
    of the authors’ knowledge, the machine learning methods (RF, SVM and AB) were
    firstly studied to estimate daily ET under limited water supply and water stress
    conditions (ETc-adj), which is particularly relevant for arid and semi-arid areas.
    The presented results are particularly useful for sustainable and efficient management
    of irrigation in areas where water resources are scarce and input data are limited
    to few weather, crop and soil parameters. In these situations, the application
    of machine learning models is of great importance to fill the gap of limited data
    availability to estimate crop evapotranspiration and improve irrigation scheduling.
    Future studies are needed to evaluate the performance of different machine learning
    models for ETc-adj estimation under different environments and various scenarios
    of climate, crop and soil input data. Particular attention should be given to
    the ET estimate from tree crops with fixed root depth, which might facilitate
    the application of machine learning algorithms in irrigation scheduling. Author

  description: Accurate drought forecasting is necessary for effective agricultural
    and water resource management and for early risk warning. Various machine learning
    models have been developed for drought forecasting. This work developed and tested
    a fusion-based ensemble model, namely, the stacking (ST) model, that integrates
    extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forecast (RF), and light gradient
    boosting machine (LightGBM) for drought forecasting. Additionally, the ST model
    employs the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm to interpret the relationship
    between variables and forecasting results. Multi-source data that encompass meteorological,
    vegetation, anthropogenic, landcover, climate teleconnection patterns, and topological
    characteristics were incorporated in the proposed ST model. The ST model forecasts
    the one-month lead standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)
    at a 12 month scale. The proposed ST model was applied and tested in the German
    federal states of Brandenburg and Berlin. The results show that the ST model outperformed
    the reference persistence model, XGBboost, RF, and LightGBM, achieving an average
    coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.845 in each month in 2018. The spatiotemporal
    Moran’s I method indicates that the ST model captures non-stationarity in modeling
    the statistical association between predictors and the meteorological drought
    index and outperforms the other three models (i.e., XGBoost, RF, and LightGBM).
    Global sensitivity analysis indicates that the ST model is influenced by a combination
    of environmental variables, with the most sensitive being the preceding drought
    indices. The accuracy and versatility of the ST model indicate that this is a
    promising approach for forecasting drought and other environmental phenomena.

    keyboard_arrow_down      Browse Figures Versions Notes Abstract Accurate drought
    forecasting is necessary for effective agricultural and water resource management
    and for early risk warning. Various machine learning models have been developed
    for drought forecasting. This work developed and tested a fusion-based ensemble
    model, namely, the stacking (ST) model, that integrates extreme gradient boosting
    (XGBoost), random forecast (RF), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)
    for drought forecasting. Additionally, the ST model employs the SHapley Additive
    exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm to interpret the relationship between variables
    and forecasting results. Multi-source data that encompass meteorological, vegetation,
    anthropogenic, landcover, climate teleconnection patterns, and topological characteristics
    were incorporated in the proposed ST model. The ST model forecasts the one-month
    lead standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at a 12 month
    scale. The proposed ST model was applied and tested in the German federal states
    of Brandenburg and Berlin. The results show that the ST model outperformed the
    reference persistence model, XGBboost, RF, and LightGBM, achieving an average
    coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.845 in each month in 2018. The spatiotemporal
    Moran’s I method indicates that the ST model captures non-stationarity in modeling
    the statistical association between predictors and the meteorological drought
    index and outperforms the other three models (i.e., XGBoost, RF, and LightGBM).
    Global sensitivity analysis indicates that the ST model is influenced by a combination
    of environmental variables, with the most sensitive being the preceding drought
    indices. The accuracy and versatility of the ST model indicate that this is a
    promising approach for forecasting drought and other environmental phenomena.

    model sensitivity analysis 1. Introduction Drought is a natural hazard and occurs
    in almost all regions of the world [1]. In Europe, severe droughts cause losses
    to agriculture, society, and ecosystems with profound impacts on crop production,
    the energy sector, and water supply [2,3,4]. In view of the drought threat, a
    suitable drought forecasting system is needed. Drought forecasting plays a key
    role in providing drought early warning to mitigate its impacts and to improve
    drought management [1]. Drought is a complex phenomenon and is among the least
    understood natural hazards due to its multiple causing mechanisms and contributing
    factors [5,6]. Drought phenomena can be categorized as meteorological, agricultural,
    hydrological, and socio-economic drought based on their duration and effects.
    Drought indices have been developed that quantify single or multiple droughts
    affecting variables in a standardized or threshold-based manner. The meteorological
    anomalies, land surface processes, and human activities interact and shape the
    development and evolution of drought [7]. These interactions are nonlinear and
    non-stationary, which complicates our understanding of drought estimation [8,9,10].
    Machine learning (ML) has proven effective in dealing and solving many types of
    nonlinear problems. ML allows for complex mathematical calculations on mega data
    (e.g., large datasets such as long-time series satellite products including millions
    of grid points) [11,12]. The use of machine learning approaches with open-access
    satellite products facilitates drought forecasting from the regional to the global
    scale [8,13,14,15]. Multi-model fusion-based models are a promising ML method
    that can capture nonlinear processes. Alizadeh and Nikoo [8] argued that fusion-based
    ML models are more efficient than individual ML models in dealing with drought-related
    non-stationarities. Stacking (ST) is a hierarchical fusion framework integrating
    the strengths of individual estimation models [16], and it is a member of the
    family of ensemble learning methods (i.e., bagging, boosting, and stacking). Generally,
    the performance of an ensemble model exceeds that of a single learner. Compared
    with boosting and bagging, ST takes advantage of the characteristics of multiple
    base learners to achieve better predictive accuracy and stability than any of
    the individual models. The hierarchical fusion framework has been recently applied
    in several fields, such as PM 2.5 estimation [17], agriculture yield prediction
    [9], and landslide susceptibility mapping [18]. The ST model features a black-box
    structure, which does not reveal the underlying physical processes [19]. The black-box
    nature may complicate the quantification of model uncertainties [20]. On the other
    hand, a model-sensitive analysis is helpful in quantifying model uncertainties
    by evaluating the relative importance of input factors on model output. In practice,
    that means all uncertain variables, mathematical functions, and boundary conditions
    are allowed to vary to evaluate changes in model prediction [21,22,23]. Early
    drought detection is fundamental to proactive decision making and disaster preparedness.
    This work developed a fusion-based one-month lead meteorological drought forecast
    model that incorporates multi-source features from satellite images and data products.
    The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was applied to
    capture drought characteristics in the study area [24,25]. The developed ST model
    integrates three algorithms, namely, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random
    forest (RF), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) to forecast the SPEI
    at the time scale of 12 months (SPEI-12). The ST model receives climate teleconnection
    pattern indices, extreme climate indices, hydroclimatic conditions, vegetation
    coverage, and anthropogenic factors as forcing data. The sensitivity of the ST
    drought model is then analyzed using variance-based global sensitivity analysis
    (GSA). The ST model was applied and tested in the German federal states of Brandenburg
    and Berlin. This paper’s modeling method is useful in disaster prevention, such
    as meteorological drought early warning. It helps users understand the key determinants
    driving the meteorological drought forecast using an explainable ML algorithm.
    Section 2 presents an overview of the study area and the used datasets. The ST
    model is described in Section 3, followed by a model sensitivity analysis in Section
    4. The results are presented in Section 5. Future research directions are discussed
    in Section 6, followed by conclusions in Section 7. 2. Study Area and Methodology
    2.1. The Study Area This work’s methodology was applied to forecast meteorological
    drought severity in Berlin-Brandenburg, Germany (Figure 1). Berlin-Brandenburg
    is located in the North German lowlands with flat topography and consists mainly
    of agricultural land (49%), forestry land (35%), water bodies (3.5%), and urban
    areas (9%). Berlin itself consists of 18% forest, 4% agriculture, and 70% settlements
    and roads [20]. Figure 1. (a) The MCD12Q1 landcover classifications (Year 2018)
    in Brandenburg and Berlin; (b) the location of Brandenburg (black outline) and
    Berlin (red outline) (Source: Global Aviation Data management (GADM), version
    4.1). Berlin-Brandenburg is one of the warmest and driest regions in Germany,
    and thus it is particularly vulnerable to droughts. The long-term (1961–1990)
    average annual precipitation is less than 600 mm, and the average air temperature
    is near 8 °C to 10 °C [26]. In recent decades, the mean annual temperature in
    the region has increased by about 1 °C, exceeding the global temperature trend
    of 0.7 °C [27]. Previous studies indicate that evapotranspiration exceeds annual
    precipitation, and that the water balance in Berlin-Brandenburg is negative [26].
    Regional climate simulations show a shift in precipitation patterns for the next
    decades with extremely dry summers and rising temperatures [28]. 2.2. Datasets
    Predictors include variables describing hydroclimatic, large-scale teleconnection
    patterns, as well as vegetation, terrain, anthropogenic, landcover, and historical
    drought indices. Several hydroclimatic datasets related to soil moisture, evapotranspiration,
    surface runoff, and terrestrial water storage were included in this study as predictors
    to measure the land surface response to drought conditions. Large-scale teleconnection
    indices were also included because drought is known to be related to large-scale
    atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature conditions. Vegetation datasets
    were used to depict the growth conditions of vegetation in response to drought.
    Terrain variables provide location information to capture spatial variations in
    drought. Moreover, human activities and land use characteristics can impact drought
    occurrence and persistence through influences on water resource management, climate,
    and ecosystem dynamics. Finally, historical drought indices were applied to capture
    serial autocorrelation because drought is an inherently persistent phenomenon.
    These data provide a comprehensive interpretation of drought from different perspectives.
    Gridded data are used to reduce biases from irregularly distributed gauge stations
    and to account for the spatiotemporal variability of drought-related variables
    such as precipitation [13,29]. This study implemented gridded datasets from January
    2001 to December 2018 for model training, validation, and testing to achieve available
    and consistent predictors. It should be noted that the calculation of the SPEI-N
    (N = 1, 2, …, 12) with different timescales covers the period 1989–2018, employing
    30 years of data records to capture climate variability, long-term trends, and
    statistical significance in assessing drought conditions. All the selected datasets
    were of high quality and had a resolution of around 1 km to reduce bias caused
    by upscaling and downscaling [30,31,32,33]. Datasets that differed from the target
    resolution were interpolated to 1 km by bilinear interpolation. Moreover, the
    datasets applied in this study were intentionally restricted to those that are
    regularly updated so that our model can also be adapted to make predictions for
    future drought. The variables and metrics evaluated in this study are listed in
    Table 1. Table 1. Descriptions of whole datasets. 2.2.1. Hydroclimate Datasets
    Terrestrial water storage (TWS) observations were provided by the Gravity Recovery
    and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission on a global scale. GRACE has been applied
    in drought investigations [13,34]. This study used the TWS data derived from the
    gridded GRACE Release-06 mascon product at the 25 km spatial resolution for the
    comprehensive monitoring of changes in the total volume of water stored in a region
    [35]. Meteorological drought is a weather-dependent phenomenon. Therefore, wind
    speed (v component of 10 m wind, and u component of 10 m wind), surface runoff,
    surface latent heat flux, surface pressure, and total evaporation from the fifth
    generation of the European Centre for the Medium-Range Weather Predicts (ECMWF)
    Atmospheric Reanalyzes of the Global Climate (ERA5 land reanalysis) dataset were
    also included as predictors. Furthermore, relative humidity, surface soil moisture,
    mean air temperature, and precipitation data were obtained from the climate data
    source of the German Weather Service (DWD). 2.2.2. Extreme Climate Dataset Sun
    et al. [36] argued that some extreme climate indices have a close connection with
    droughts. Extreme indicators have been widely used to analyze extreme events in
    different regions of Europe [37,38]. Four climate indices were selected in this
    work, which are commonly used to describe drought in previous studies [39,40].
    Extreme climate indices are herein calculated based on the DWD’s daily grid precipitation
    dataset, including heavy precipitation days (R10), very heavy precipitation days
    (R20), consecutive dry days (CDD), and consecutive wet days (CWD). The definition
    of each index is found in Karl et al. [41]. 2.2.3. Large-Scale Teleconnection
    Patterns Large-scale teleconnection patterns are known to be important driving
    factors for drought occurrence and are often used as predictors [1,42,43,44].
    Linking drought occurrence to teleconnection patterns is useful for understanding
    how drought characteristics change in response to changes in atmospheric circulation
    [45]. Nine teleconnection pattern indices were selected based on previous studies
    in North Germany and Europe [40,46]. This work used them to represent climate
    anomalies (see Table 1). Detailed descriptions of those indexes can be found in
    Abdelkader and Yerdelen [47]. 2.2.4. Vegetation and Terrain Datasets Precipitation
    deficits reduce the photosynthetic capacity, which in turn changes the absorption
    of solar radiation in photosynthetically active wavelengths by plants [48]. Vegetation
    indexes (VI) are widely and successfully applied in meteorological drought predictions
    due to the change in greenness that reflects the influence of precipitation deficit
    on vegetation [49]. Three VIs were used in this study: the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the leaf area
    index (LAI). The NDVI and EVI are derived from the MOD13A3 product, which provides
    monthly values at a 1 km spatial resolution. The EVI is a modified NDVI that improves
    sensitivity over high biomass regions and reduces the soil background effects
    and atmospheric influence [50]. The LAI is a critical variable in photosynthesis
    and precipitation interception processes [51]. It was acquired from the NOAA Climate
    Data Record of Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer Surface Reflectance (AVHRRSR).
    Terrain features (latitude, longitude, slope, and altitude) are derived from the
    Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model. 2.2.5. Anthropogenic
    Datasets Anthropogenic activities are likely to shape meteorological conditions
    [52]. Anthropogenically-induced climate change can exacerbate heatwaves and increase
    water demand, thereby aggravating droughts [53]. Human activity can be well assessed
    from anthropogenic light pollution [54]. The Night Light (NL) dataset and population
    data have been used in drought monitoring [55,56]. This study applied the NL dataset
    from the Harvard Dataverse to infer human activity [57]. This dataset is complemented
    by population distribution data (POP) from the LandScanTM High-Resolution Global
    Population Dataset. 2.2.6. Landcover Datasets The land cover change influences
    the occurrence of precipitation and drought [58]. Land cover data involved in
    this study were acquired from the MCD12Q1 product with a 500 m resolution. The
    data comprised seventeen types of land cover (see Figure 1a). The landscape indices
    were used to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of land cover, geographical areas,
    or landscapes composed of interacting patches of vegetation or green space stands,
    or habitat types [59]. A total of 19 landscape indexes were derived in this work
    with the Fragstats V4.2.1 software representing the change characteristics of
    land cover [60], including Shannon’s diversity index, Shannon’s evenness index,
    and 17 landscape percentages. 2.2.7. Time Characteristics Temporal information
    was included as a predictor to account for seasonal and trend effects. The four
    seasons were encoded through applying one-hot encoding [61], which represents
    the information in binary format, e.g., spring (March–May) as (0, 0, 0), summer
    (June–August) as (1, 0, 0), autumn (September–November) as (0, 1, 0), and winter
    (December–February) as (0, 0, 1). The month-of-year information was also used
    as a time characteristic. 2.2.8. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) The SPEI quantifies the meteorological drought at multiple time scales
    [62]. It is a widely used standardized meteorological drought index that uses
    precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to determine the onset, duration,
    and magnitude of drought conditions with respect to normal conditions [63]. The
    use of the SPEI is particularly effective in drought forecasting whenever precipitation
    deficits and temperature anomalies have shaped past and recent drought periods,
    such as is the case in Germany [28,64]. The SPEI is herein calculated at the 1
    km spatial scale, following the methodology described by Vicente-Serrano et al.
    [62]. Here, the calculation of the SPEI-N (N = 1, 2, …, 12) with different timescales
    is based on 30 years of data records (1989–2018) to ensure statistical robustness
    and reliability in quantifying the severity of drought. Its value ranges between
    −3 and +3 and can be categorized into several categories based on the drought
    severity degree [65] (see Table 2). Table 2. Drought categories based on SPEI
    values. Historical drought indices were included as predictors. Autocorrelation,
    a commonly used measure of persistence, has been widely recognized in the literature
    [66,67]. The incorporation of SPEI-Nt−1 and SPEI-12t−1 as predictors is grounded
    in their capability to capture the temporal patterns and autocorrelation inherent
    in historical drought indices. As the lag time increases, the correlation tends
    to decrease [68], reflecting the evolving dynamics of drought characteristics
    over time. This work took into account the autocorrelation of drought characteristics
    and introduced several timescale SPEI-N variables as predictors. The inclusion
    of SPEI-Nt−1 and SPEI-12t−1 enabled us to explore distinct characteristics in
    detecting drought trends and periodicities associated with different timescales.
    3. The Forecasting Model The modeling framework consists of four tasks: (i) preprocessing,
    (ii) developing and implementing the ST model, (iii) developing and implementing
    the SHAP algorithm, and (iv) a sensitivity analysis (see Figure 2). The four tasks
    are described in detail in the following sections. Figure 2. The workflow of the
    stacking model depicting the four tasks. i–iv represents the four tasks following
    the order of model numbering. 3.1. Preprocessing Preprocessing selects the relevant
    variables from a pool of potential data sources. The variables without normalization
    are then used as input to the so-called base learners (a type of machine learning
    algorithm). The three best-performing ones on validation datasets are selected
    from the model pool, which then serves as the first layer of the ST model. 3.2.
    Machine Learning-Based Stacking Model The ST model is an ensemble modeling approach
    that combines multiple machine learning algorithms [69], and it consists of two
    processing layers (Figure 2). The first layer contains several base learners.
    From this pool of potential base-learner algorithms, those that show good performance
    in the training phase are considered further. Specifically, during the training
    phase, which involves training and validation sets, the selection of base learners
    is based on the validation set. It is common to use no more than three base learners
    in ST models to achieve a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency
    [16]. This study selected three base learners initially to construct the ST model’s
    first layer, and their various combinations were further verified. The three base
    learners, XGBoost, RF, and LightGBM, are popular models in drought and precipitation
    forecasting [70,71]. The XGBoost regression algorithm is a scalable ensemble-tree
    algorithm based on the improved gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). The LightGBM
    regression algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy, and it processes faster
    than XGBoost. RF is an algorithm that forms part of the Bagging method in ensemble
    learning. An in-depth description of the XGBoost, LightGBM, and RF methods is
    presented by Chen and Guestrin, [72], Ke et al., [73], and Breiman, [74], respectively.
    The selected base learners build the first layer of the ST model. The training
    data are split into k folds, and k−1 folds are used to train the base learners.
    The first layer models are next applied to the remaining fold that was not used
    for the base model fitting. The test data are directly fed into the three well-trained
    base models. The predictions generated by three base models are then averaged,
    and the resulting average values serve as the input for a linear regression model
    (LR) to minimize the probability of overfitting during training (the second layer)
    [75]. Specifically, the second layer of the ST model is a meta-model that relies
    solely on the output results of the first layer. 3.3. Hyperparameter Optimization
    Hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size must be optimized in most
    ML algorithms [76]. Hyperparameter optimization is the process of selecting the
    best combination of hyperparameters for each independent base learner of the ST
    model to achieve their optimal performance on the training and validation datasets.
    The optimal hyperparameters are identified by combining the Opetuna and GridSearchCV
    approaches. Opetuna first ranks the significant hyperparameters based on the data
    characteristic [77]. Next, the optimal set of parameters is selected by the GridSearchCV
    algorithm [78]. In this study, the data were split 70% vs. 30% into a training
    and validation dataset (2001–2017) and a test dataset (2018) for hyperparameter
    optimization. The test dataset is only used to test the predictive power and generalization
    ability of the model. GridSearchCV conducts cross-validation on the training dataset
    to optimize hyperparameters, retraining each base learner model using the entire
    training period with the optimized parameters. Subsequently, here, we calculated
    the results for the validation set using the retrained base model. The optimal
    parameters are then used in all three selected base learners to construct the
    ST model. 3.4. Model Interpretation The black-box character of many ML models
    hinders our capacity to understand the physical processes underlying the phenomena
    under investigation. Previous studies have used variable-importance diagrams to
    reveal the most and least important predictor variables [79]. However, this approach
    cannot explain the contribution of second-order effects (interaction) on a given
    model outcome. Dikshit and Pradhan [80] overcame this problem by implementing
    the SHAP method to improve the model’s interpretation with respect to spatial
    drought forecasting [80,81]. The SHAP method calculates the marginal contribution
    of each predictor to the forecast [82,83]. The average contribution of a predictor
    instance among all possible coalitions is given by the SHAP value. The SHAP value
    fairly distributes the contribution of predictors to the final prediction. The
    SHAP method provides multiple AI model explainers, including the Kernel Explainer,
    the Deep Explainer, the Tree Explainer, and the Gradient Explainer. A detailed
    explanation about different explainers and their corresponding plots with different
    uses is found in Zhang et al. [71] and Molnar [84]. The Tree Explainer was applied
    in this work to the outputs of the three base models. The Kernel Explainer was
    applied in the ST mode [85]. Three main types of interpretation can be conducted
    using the relevant explainer, namely, (i) the Summary plot; (ii) the Dependence
    plot; and (iii) the Force plot. The details of all plots can be found in Molnar
    [84]. The summary and force plots are two typical visualization figures focused
    on understanding the model’s decision process under drought conditions [80]. This
    study evaluated the ST model performance under different drought severities using
    the SHAP summary plot and force plot. The summary plot explains the relative importance
    of each variable on the model outcome. A SHAP force plot has three key characteristics
    (Figure 3). The first is the output value, which is the forecast value of a specific
    instance. The second is the base value: the average predicted value of the test
    dataset. The third is the color: variables marked in red color increase the magnitude
    of the model output, whereas those in blue color decrease the magnitude of the
    model output. The force plot shown in Figure 3 for illustrative purposes consists
    of a horizontal bar for four variables (SPEI-11t−1, month-of-year (T), SPEI-12t−1,
    and precipitation (P)). The force plot displayed in Figure 3 serves as a visual
    aid to facilitate understanding the marginal contribution of predictors to model
    output (i.e., forecasts) but does not explore the meaning of variables. The length
    of the bar represents the magnitude of the variables’ contributions to the model
    output. Longer bars in the SHAP force plot indicate the greater contribution of
    a variable to the model output. The SPEI-11t−1 has the longest bar among the variables,
    followed by T. The impact of SPEI-12t−1 and P is comparatively lower. The plot
    also shows the base value and the output value. The model output value (f(x) =
    −2.09, see Figure 3) is shown at the top of the plot, with the base value of −2.153
    shown as a gray horizontal line. The horizontal axis in this visualization represents
    a small interval of the output and base values. The difference between the base
    value and the output value can be explained by the contributions of the individual
    variables. The red color indicates that the feature or variable increases the
    model output, while the blue color indicates that the feature decreases the model
    output. The SHAP algorithm is applied to improve the model’s transparency by determining
    the contribution of higher-order interactions to drought forecasting in Section
    5.6. Figure 3. An example of the SHAP force plot. 3.5. Model Evaluation The selection
    of base models from base pools and the accuracy of the SPEI prediction are assessed
    by the coefficient of determination (R2), the mean absolute deviation (MAE), and
    the root mean square error (RMSE). The best model and prediction results are comprehensive
    based on a higher R2, lower RMSE, and MAE. The model is further compared with
    a persistence model (PTM) [86]. The PTM is often used as a reference for model
    evaluation, assuming the current SPEI at the time t will persist to the next month
    SPEI at the time t + 1 (see Equation (1)). SPEI t+1 = SPEI t (1) All SPEI values
    less than zero are classified as a drought in the assessment of drought occurrence
    [65]. The fraction of the number of grid points with SPEI < 0 in area i ( 𝑛 0𝑖
    ) to the total number of grid cells Nt provides a measure to calculate the drought
    area DA (%). 𝐷𝐴= ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑜𝑖 𝑁 𝑡 (2) Multicollinearity [66] between the predictor
    variables is reduced by using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian
    information criterion (BIC). The smaller the AIC and BIC values, the better the
    feature selection. The prediction model’s capacity to deal with spatial and temporal
    non-stationarity issues is evaluated using an extended Moran’s I [9,87] which
    is a spatiotemporal autocorrelation index modified from the classical Moran’s
    I [88]. A positive value of Moran’s I represents a clustered pattern (i.e., positive
    correlation), a negative value represents a dispersed pattern (i.e., negative
    correlation), and a zero value represents a random pattern [89]. A value of the
    spatiotemporal Moran’s I close to 0 means that model predictions can capture spatial
    and temporal variations. 4. Model Sensitivity Analysis This work applied Sobol’
    method, which is a variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method to
    evaluate the different sources of uncertainty of predictors by decomposing the
    variance of the model output [23]. Contrary to more traditional SA methods, the
    Sobol’ method varies all input uncertainties simultaneously, which is required
    for nonadditive models [21,22,90]. The Sobol’ method commonly includes two measures
    for each parameter: the first-order index, which represents the contribution of
    a parameter to the response variance without interaction, and the total-order
    index, which represents the total contribution of a parameter to the response
    variance, including interaction effects. Saltelli’s extension of the Sobol’ sequence-based
    numerical procedures is applied in this study to generate input parameter sets
    for Sobol’ sensitivity analysis. More details about the GSA theory and Sobol’
    method can be found in Sauter and Venema [22], and Saltelli et al. [23,91]. 5.
    Results Drought forecasting involves five tasks: (i) the choice of predictands
    (drought index); (ii) predictor selection; (iii) model selection; (iv) assessing
    and examining the model outcomes; and (v) model sensitivity analysis [2,92]. 5.1.
    Predictand Selection The SPEI-12 meteorological drought index was selected as
    the target variable of the ST model in this study. The selection of the target
    timescale of the SPEI-N index depends on the study area. Previous authors have
    reported that the SPEI-N of longer timescales (12 month time scales, SPEI-12)
    is more accurately predicted than the SPEI-N of shorter time scales [80,93]. 5.2.
    Selection of Important Predictors If two or more predictors are highly correlated
    only the predictor with the highest correlation with the predictand is considered.
    This is done to reduce data redundancy and model complexity. Previous drought
    index values were also included to exploit temporal coherence [1,94]. Furthermore,
    multicollinearity was tested with the AIC and BIC values (Table S2). Table 3 summarizes
    the eight selected predictors identified for the SPEI-12 from 68 predictor variables.
    The selection is conducted on training datasets. Eight time-series variables were
    selected as model predictors, which are three hydroclimatic factors, two extreme
    climate indices, two preceding drought indices, and the month-of-year. The selection
    standard of the preceding drought indices is shown in Table S3. It should be noted
    that SPEI-11t−1 is not a variant of the SPEI-12t−1 index. They describe the drought
    characteristics by considering different time windows. There were 7,857,530 ×
    8 valid training and validation data records (Years 2001–2017) available for model
    training once data preprocessing was implemented. Figure 4 displays the final
    model structure. It is a one-month lead drought forecasting model. Figure 4. The
    flow chart of the input and output of the ST model. t and t + 1 represent the
    current and the next months, respectively. Table 3. Descriptions of selected variables.
    5.3. Model Performance and Comparison XGBoost, RF, and LightGBM were chosen from
    the base learner pool to serve as the first layers of the ST model. The initial
    selection of these three potential base models was based on their default parameter
    settings without involving hyperparameter tuning. The selection standard was based
    on their higher average R2 and smaller average RMSE (refer to Table S4) on the
    validation datasets. The forecast performance of the developed ST model was compared
    to three base models (XGBoost, RF, and LightGBM) and was also compared to the
    reference PTM model. The comparison was conducted for each month of the test year,
    2018. The results are presented in Table 4. The stacking model exhibited the best
    performance among all models, with the highest average R2 (0.845) and the smallest
    average RMSE (0.025) (Table 4). In particular, compared to the PTM model, the
    ST model demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. The ST
    model’s accuracy in summer was slightly lower compared to other seasons. This
    may have been due to rapid weather changes that usually occur in summer in the
    study region. A paired sample t-test was conducted between ST and each of the
    three base models and the PTM model in order to evaluate differences among the
    models’ results. The p-values of the t-test were below 0.05, except when compared
    with the PTM model (see Table 5), indicating that the accuracy improvement of
    ST was statistically significant. However, statistical metrics analyzed the variation
    between the forecasted and observed index values without considering the correct
    identification of drought and non-drought events. Therefore, the performance of
    the ST model, three base models, and PTM model with respect to the DA index was
    evaluated, with the results being listed in Table 6. The ST performed well compared
    with the reference PTM model, particularly in the summer season. The overall forecasting
    accuracy of ST was the best among all models, with an average DA (drought area)
    of 51.60%, and its forecasts were closest to the actual DA (52.24%). Table 4.

    the paired sample t-test between the R2 of ST, three base models, and the PTM
    model. Table 6. DA of the drought-forecasting models with a one-month lead in
    year 2018. This work resorted to a quantile–quantile plot (Q-Q plot) to assess
    the performance of the observed and forecasted SPEI-12 index corresponding to
    the ST model and the three base machine learning (ML) models across 12 test months,
    specifically focusing on extreme values (Figure 5). If the two distributions (reference
    and forecasted) being compared are similar, the blue points in the Q-Q plot will
    approximately lie on the identity line y = x (depicted in red). The best fitting
    was observed with the ST model. It is notable that the areas with extreme and
    severe drought were underestimated due to the limited number of extreme and severe
    drought samples in the training dataset. The underestimation was most pronounced
    for LightGBM among the three base models (Figure 5C). Figure 5. Q-Q plots of the
    observed and predicted SPEI-12 from (A) XGBoost, (B) RF, (C) LightGBM, and (D)
    ST for each of the 12 test months with numbers 1 to 12 in 2018. 5.4. The Spatial
    Pattern of the Predicted Drought Index Figure 6 depicts the spatial patterns of
    the forecasted and observed drought indices. All models predicted the spatial
    structure of SPEI-12 well. However, a closer look revealed some shortcomings in
    all models. For example, the models tended to underestimate the intensity of severe
    drought events in the western and southwestern regions. Figure 6. Spatial patterns
    of the forecasted SPEI-12. Calculated with (A) Xgboost, (B) RF, (C) LightGBM,
    (D) ST, and (E) observed SPEI-12 for the 12 test months from (1) January 2018
    through (12) December 2018. The boxplot of the differences between the forecasted
    and observed (referred to as prediction error) values is shown in Figure 7. The
    lower and upper edges of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, and
    the horizontal line in the box denotes the median. Compared with three base learners,
    the median of the prediction errors for the ST model (indicated by the blue boxes)
    was closer to zero, suggesting reasonably accurate overall predictions. In addition,
    the length of the ST model’s box (interquartile range, IQR) was smaller in most
    test months, which indicated a consistent dispersion of prediction errors. Figure
    7. Boxplots of the difference values between observed and forecasted values, obtained
    using four different methods: (A) Xgboost, (B) RF, (C) LightGBM, and (D) ST for
    the 12 test months from (1) January 2018 through (12) December 2018. The spatiotemporal
    autocorrelation Moran’s I index, described in Section 3.5, was applied to analyze
    the spatiotemporal patterns of forecasting errors derived from the four models.
    In the ideal case, the models’ forecasting differences should be randomly distributed
    within the study area where the spatial non-stationarity is fully captured by
    the models [9,95]. This analysis aimed to investigate whether the spatial non-stationarity
    was fully captured in the models’ results. The average error was calculated in
    the 19 districts of Brandenburg and Berlin in each of the 12 test months to compare
    the spatiotemporal patterns and the degree of spatiotemporal aggregation. The
    spatial weighting matrix was generated using the inverse square distance between
    any two districts and is row standardized. The final spatiotemporal Moran’s I
    forecasting errors are listed in Table 7. The spatiotemporal Moran’s I values
    were close to 0, and the p-values were lower than 0.05, indicating that the prediction
    errors of four models in the 12 test months only had very slight spatiotemporal
    clusters. The degree of error aggregation of ST was the lowest (0.0058) among
    the four models. Table 7. Spatiotemporal Moran’s I value of the forecasting errors
    calculated with ST, RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM. 5.5. Model Sensitivity The ST model’s
    sensitivity pattern was analyzed based on the variance-based Sobol’ GSA approach
    described in Section 4, where the Si indices measure the individual contributions
    of predictors to the output variance (ST), while St indices include all interaction
    effects. These two indices were calculated and averaged over the ST model in each
    testing month. Figure 8 shows Sobol’ sensitivity analysis results. It can be observed
    that the St indices were generally larger than the Si indices, suggesting the
    presence of higher-order interactions. From these results, it follows that SPEI-11t−1,
    SM, SPEI-12t−1, and P may be designated as sensitive variables since the model
    output is mainly influenced by the uncertainty of these factors in all seasons.
    Figure 8. Plot of the total-order and first-order sensitivity derived from the
    trained ST model in the 12 test months. Overall, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated
    that the performance of the ST model is most influenced by the SPEI-11t−1 drought
    indices, soil moisture, SPEI-12t−1, and precipitation as input variables. 5.6.
    Model Interpretation under Different Drought Severity Scenarios The SHAP algorithm
    was applied to determine the contribution of higher-order interactions to drought
    forecasting. The meaning of the SHAP plot is described in Section 3.4. SHAP provides
    local interpretability by enabling us to identify the impact of each predictor
    on SPEI-12 prediction results for different drought conditions. The ST model consists
    of a two-layer structure, where the prediction results from the first layer serve
    as input for the meta-model in the second layer. The SHAP algorithm for the ST
    model was applied to the meta-model. Figure 9 presents the results of force plots
    for five drought scenarios for the combined SHAP value over 12 test months: (a)
    overall performance, (b) extremely dry, (c) severely dry, (d) moderately dry,
    (e) mildly dry, and (f) non-drought. The detailed categorization of drought scenarios
    is listed in Table 1. Figure 9a shows that the preceding drought indices and soil
    moisture (SM) increased the model output, whereas the other variables slightly
    decreased the model output. Figure 9b–e depicts different drought conditions,
    and it was seen that the preceding SPEI-11t−1 increased the model output, whereas
    month-of-year (T) decreased the model output. SM and precipitation (P) either
    increased or decreased the model output based on drought severity. The case of
    non-drought conditions (Figure 9f) also shows the importance of the preceding
    SPEI-11t−1 in increasing the model output; T, surface runoff (SR), and P in decreasing
    the model output. Overall, the preceding SPEI-11t−1 was the most influencing factor
    for all drought severity conditions. The final predictors of the ST model were
    derived from the outputs of the base learns in its first layer. Therefore, the
    overall predictor importance (summary plot) was based on the combined results
    of three base learners depicted in Figure 10A and the entire ST model (Figure
    10B) for the purpose of validating the SHAP results. Although the ST model had
    a two-layer structure, the summary plot of the ST model was similar to the combination
    of the outputs from the three base learners in the first layer (see Figure 10A,B).
    The preceding drought indices were identified as the important features by both
    summary plots. In comparison with the base learners, the meta-model (second layer
    of the ST model) did not introduce a significant bias in the SHAP analysis. Figure

    results of three base models; (B) ST in the 12 test months. 6. Discussion The
    ST model could be improved by stacking the drought classification and regression.
    That is, drought severity could be classified into different categories. Then,
    the regression model could be used for predicting sub-categories. Also, the time
    variable is usually included as a parallel factor, and the grid datasets themselves
    have potential location information. The ST model also relies on the autonomous
    learning ability of ML models to take into account the effect of spatial and temporal
    information. This approach has been demonstrated to improve the forecasting skill
    of ML models, but it neglects the fact that spatiotemporal information does not
    directly affect drought severity when applying ML models. Rather, spatiotemporal
    information affects drought severity through other factors attached to spatiotemporal
    location. Thus, a more effective representation of spatiotemporal information
    must be explored in drought modeling. This work applied the SHAP algorithm in
    the proposed two-layer structured ST model to explain the importance of variables
    in forecasting drought. This paper’s purpose was to validate whether the second
    layer, serving as the meta-model, introduces significant errors to the SHAP analysis
    due to the added model structure. The SHAP analysis results of the combined three-base
    model (first layer of the ST model) were compared with those of the entire ST
    model. The result demonstrated that the meta-model of the second layer did not
    introduce significant errors in the SHAP algorithm. It is important to exercise
    caution when using SHAP analysis with complex model structures (e.g., multi-layers).
    The stability of SHAP analysis with different model structures is a worthy topic
    for future research. Moreover, the structure of the ST model can be further optimized
    by incorporating wavelet decomposition, which is effective for capturing data
    interconnection in the frequency domain. This paper’s model performs short-term
    forecasts successfully; yet, extending the short-term (within 3 months) to medium-
    and long-term prediction is possible and could be explored by adding physical
    constraints. One potential change in future drought forecasting is to use the
    root zone soil moisture (RZSM) index to replace the SPEI index. The RZSM index
    can directly reflect regional soil moisture conditions and describe drought conditions.
    The wide acceptability of the ST model must be further tested with respect to
    a variety of drought conditions and drought indices at larger spatial scales.
    In addition to the findings herein reported, we conducted a comparative analysis
    with the results presented by Mehr et al. [96] and with those reported by Mardian
    et al [97]. This paper’s model enables comprehensive monitoring of drought impacts
    in many areas across federal states lacking ground support at a 1 km spatial resolution
    in comparison with Mehr et al.’s [96] meteorological drought forecast model based
    on gauge stations. This paper’s ML model explains the contribution of variables
    in driving meteorological drought by breaking its black box structure. This paper’s
    ST model integrates the strengths of XGBoost, LightGBM, and RF models when compared
    with Mardian et al. ’s [97] individual XGBoost models. This study further explored
    the uncertainty errors of the SHAP algorithm introduced by different model structures.
    7. Conclusions Accurate drought forecasting is important for drought early warning
    and helps manage the risks associated with it. This study proposes a fusion-based
    ST model for one-month lead SPEI-12 drought index forecasting at 1 km spatial
    resolution. ML models are capable of solving complex non-linear problems but are
    weak in the interpretation of the underlying processes. However, the developed
    model can tackle the non-stationarity and underlying understanding by identifying
    the relationship between predictors and meteorological drought index. Specifically,
    68 variables extracted from satellite products were evaluated in this study. Precipitation,
    soil moisture, surface runoff, heavy precipitation days, very heavy precipitation
    days, month-of-year time characteristics, and precedent drought indices were selected
    as predictor variables. Climate teleconnection pattern indices were evaluated
    in this study, leading to the result that strong teleconnection is not observed
    between large-scale climate patterns and metrological drought in Berlin-Brandenburg.
    The performance of the developed ST model was compared with those of three base
    models (XGBoost, RF, and LightGBM) and a classic persistence model. The ST model
    performed best among the models, with an average R2 value of 0.845 for the 12
    test months. The spatiotemporal clustering analysis of prediction errors was further
    quantified based on the spatiotemporal Moran’s I. The error patterns analysis
    further showed that ST can effectively model non-stationarity in drought forecasting.
    The ST model can be applied to drought mapping with a relatively high spatial
    resolution, i.e., 1 km × 1 km. The complex interconnection between predictors
    and drought is identified with the SHAP algorithm under five drought severity
    conditions, thus improving the understanding of the processes captured by the
    ST model. Moreover, model sensitivity analysis is important in practical applications
    (e.g., rain-fed farming systems) of the model; however, few studies include them
    in drought modeling. Furthermore, the model sensitivity is diagnosed with a variance-based
    GSA method. SHAP and GSA methods have demonstrated that the performance of the
    ST model is most strongly influenced by precipitation, soil moisture, and preceding
    drought indices, particularly SPEI-11t−1 input variables. This study’s methodology
    and results provide a valuable reference for drought early warning, assisting
    resource policymakers, as well as agricultural and water resource managers, in
    mitigating the impacts of droughts on agriculture, water supply, and ecosystems.

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in

    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among

    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation

  description: In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the stochastic nature of influent
    wastewater and operational and weather conditions cause fluctuations in effluent
    quality. Data-driven models can forecast effluent quality a few hours ahead as
    a response to the influent characteristics, providing enough time to adjust system
    operations and avoid undesired consequences. However, existing data for training
    models are often incomplete and contain missing values. On the other hand, collecting
    additional data by installing new sensors is costly. The trade-off between using
    existing incomplete data and collecting costly new data results in three data
    challenges faced when developing data-driven WWTP effluent forecasters. These
    challenges are to determine important variables to be measured, the minimum number
    of required data instances, and the maximum percentage of tolerable missing values
    that do not impede the development of an accurate model. As these issues are not
    discussed in previous studies, in this research, for the first time, a comprehensive
    analysis is done to provide answers to these challenges. Another issue that arises
    in all data-driven modeling is how to select an appropriate forecasting model.
    This paper addresses these issues by first testing nine machine learning models
    on data collected from three wastewater treatment plants located in Iran, Australia,
    and Spain. The most accurate forecaster, Bayesian network, was then used to address
    the articulated challenges. Key variables in forecasting effluent characteristics
    were flow rate, total suspended solids, electrical conductivity, phosphorus compounds,
    wastewater temperature, and air temperature. A minimum of 250 samples was needed
    during the model training to achieve a great reduction in the forecasting error.
    Moreover, a steep increase in the error was observed should the portion of missing
    values exceed 10%. The results assist plant managers in estimating the necessary
    data collection effort to obtain an accurate forecaster, contributing to the quality
    of the effluent.

    1. Introduction The associated environmental pollution with sewage can pose substantial
    health and environmental risks (Jimoh and Abolfathi, 2022; Stride et al., 2023).
    It is possible to reduce these risks by collecting, transferring, treating, and
    returning sewage to the natural water cycle safely (Wear et al., 2021). Awareness
    of the variability extent in effluent characteristics of wastewater treatment
    plant (WWTP) is necessary in order to determine short and long-term treatment
    efficiency, evaluate the WWTP performance in situations of high fluctuations in
    influent rate and pollutant load, implement short and long-term plans for wastewater
    reuse, and fix plant operational problems by controlling treatment units with
    the aim of enhanced energy efficiency, cost-effective operations, and compliance
    with environmental regulations (OFID & IWA, 2018). Fluctuations in effluent characteristics
    are common and may happen as a natural outcome of many time-varying stochastic
    processes within WWTP (Wang et al., 2021). These variations may also stem from
    changes in influent quantity and quality attributed to wet-weather events such
    as heavy rainfall, or climate changes, including alterations in temperature patterns.
    As a result of these fluctuations, the effluent characteristics do not meet the
    acceptable (standard reusability) level of quality. An early warning system that
    can forecast the fluctuations a few hours ahead provides enough time to adjust
    system operations and avoid undesired consequences. Hence, there is a great interest
    in estimating WWTP effluent characteristics. The many known and unknown variables
    affecting effluent quality as well as the intricate relationships between the
    variables and different system compartments hinder developing conceptual forecasting
    models (Mehrdadi and Hasanlou, 2012). In contrast, data-driven models, such as
    machine-learning models, require little to no knowledge on the dynamics governing
    the variables of interest and are obtained merely from data. They additionally
    are known to provide fast and accurate estimations (Granata et al., 2017). Several
    studies have explored WWTPs in various countries using different types of data-driven
    models to forecast effluent characteristics, such as Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANN) (Abba and Elkiran, 2017; Bekkari and Zeddouri, 2018; Guo et al., 2015; Zounemat-Kermani
    et al., 2022), combination of ANN with other methods (Elmaadawy et al., 2021;
    Hejabi et al., 2021; Osman et al., 2020), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (Sadri Moghaddam
    and Mesghali, 2023) Fuzzy Logic (FL) (Nadiri et al., 2018), Long-Short Term Memory
    (LSTM) (Cheng et al., 2020; Farhi et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Pisa et al.,
    2018) and Random Forest (RF) (Wang et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022, Table 1).
    However, data-driven models are often data demanding, which is in contrast with
    the data collection issues in WWTPs, due to privacy protection, legal and organizational
    challenges (Wang and Tsai, 2022), as well as lack of precise, durable, and economic
    sensors. These highlight the predominant issue of data scarcity in WWTP modeling
    (Alvi et al., 2023; Borzooei et al., 2019). There are three major data challenges
    faced upon forecasting effluent characteristics that are rarely addressed in the
    literature. Table 1. A summary of recent studies in forecasting effluent characteristics

    error; RMSE: root mean squared error. First is to identify and collect those variables
    that highly affect the forecasting accuracy of the dependent variables, i.e.,
    effluent quality. The commonly used independent variables are influent characteristics,
    e.g., biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended
    solids (TSS), potential of hydrogen (pH), temperature (T), total nitrogen (TN),
    total phosphorus (TP), and electrical conductivity (EC). Nevertheless, the inclusion
    of some other uncommon variables, such as climate features, were reported to notably
    increase the accuracy (Farhi et al., 2021). Collecting and identifying all of
    these variables can be uneconomic or even infeasible. Instead, one should identify
    a smaller subset of the commonly measured variables in WWTPs that provide enough
    accuracy and can be used by a parsimonious model. The second challenge is to find
    the minimum number of data instances required for obtaining reliable and accurate
    results. Generally, the larger the dataset, the better the performance (Althnian
    et al., 2021), yet in reality, data collection from WWTPs happens sparsely and
    some variables have short recorded history or are non-digital, hardly-accessible
    records (Wang and Tsai, 2022). This results in a limited dataset for the training
    of the forecasting models, which can lead to unreliable results or low performance
    on the testing dataset. Knowing the number of additional data instances required
    to elevate the performance to the desired level determines the required measurement
    frequency. Third, and foremost, is tackling missing data that is a common issue
    in WWTP measurement records and a fundamental issue in machine-learning model
    development (Madhu et al., 2019; Revillon and Mohammad-Djafari, 2019). It can
    be the result of unexpected events, improper performance of measuring devices
    (Huo et al., 2008; Szelag et al., 2017), or human mistakes. As missing values
    increase, the forecasting accuracy generally decreases (Gill et al., 2007; McDonald,
    2022). Knowing the maximum portion of missing values that does not reduce the
    forecasting accuracy below a prespecified \"acceptable\" level determines the
    additional effort required in regular data collection and whether higher-quality
    sensors should be used. Nevertheless, such an acceptable level is plant specific
    and despite the continuous debates and efforts, there is still no certainty in
    the literature about the percentage of missing values in a WWTP dataset that results
    in accurate enough forecasts (Acuña and Rodriguez, 2004; Dong and Peng, 2013;
    Liu et al., 2020). In WWTPs in particular, missing values are almost always present.
    Three common approaches to deal with missing data are (1) filling gaps with zero,
    mean, ANO (average nearest observation), or other statistics of the other samples
    or variables (Yu et al., 2019), (2) deletions such as listwise deletion (Osman
    et al., 2020), and (3) using time series models to predict missing data. However,
    these methods bias the dataset or may reduce its size. Even in the presence of
    a dataset that addresses all of the above three challenges, the choice of the
    data-driven model is not straightforward. For the first time, in this study, a
    comprehensive analysis is preformed to address the aforementioned data challenges
    for developing data-driven effluent forecasters in WWTPs, i.e., to identify the
    necessary predictive variables, minimum number of data instances for training
    the model, and maximum portion of missing values that the model can tolerate.
    Additionally, the aim is to find a forecasting model that makes accurate predictions
    despite the missing values. This study seeks to uncover the potential of a probabilistic
    graphical model, Bayesian network (BN), to be used as an effluent quality forecaster.
    One of its main advantages is the capability to handle missing data during model
    evaluation by marginalizing unobserved variables without imputation (Heckerman,
    1998; Ramazi et al., 2021b, Ramazi et al., 2021a; Uusitalo, 2007). Three real
    datasets were used, which were collected from the treatment plants in Iran, Australia,
    and Spain. BN was compared with several other machine learning models to find
    the one with the highest accuracy. The set of variables that greatly contributed
    to this accuracy was accordingly identified. Then by systematically removing data
    instances (dataset rows) and some of the values in the dataset rows, the model
    was tested against a range of data instances and portions of missing values. The
    performance was analyzed to find the acceptable number of data instances and missing
    values. The findings of this research can assist practitioners and plant managers
    in making informed decisions on measuring variables and collecting data, both
    prior to and after developing a forecasting model. 2. Material and methods 2.1.
    Homogeneity test and spearman rank correlation To reveal the properties of the
    data utilized for training data-driven models and subsequently provide statistical
    evidence about the model performance, the homogeneity Pettitt test and Spearman
    rank correlation were conducted using pyhomogeneity (Shourov, 2020) and seaborn
    (Waskom, 2021) Python packages. The homogeneity test assists in determining if
    a time series is homogeneous across time. If the test reveals a great disparity
    in the data measurement records, it suggests that the variable may not be an appropriate
    predictor to be used in the model. Spearman rank correlation measures the direction
    and strength of the association between two variables and was performed on all
    pairs of variables in the dataset. If the test yields a great correlation between
    two independent and dependent variables, it indicates a strong linear relationship
    and in turn the possibility of accurately forecasting the independent variable
    from the dependent using a simple linear regression. 2.2. Train-test datasets
    Prevalent model assessment methods are based on a random splitting of the dataset
    into a training subset, used for developing the model, and a testing dataset,
    used for testing the trained model. The random split, however, fails to simulate
    the reality faced when working with temporal data. To forecast the future, only
    past and present data instances are available, not those in the future (Ramazi
    et al., 2021a, Ramazi et al., 2021b). If split randomly, the training and testing
    subsets become unrealistically similar, which biases the model assessment. Therefore,
    in this work, training and testing sets were separated temporally. The first 80%
    of the dataset was taken as the training dataset, and the last 20% of the dataset
    was taken as the testing dataset. 2.3. Tested models Nine machine learning algorithms
    were adopted to construct forecasting models, namely, Bayesian network (BN), k-nearest
    neighbors (KNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), decision
    tree (DT), random forest (RF), extra trees (ET), gradient boosting machine (GBM),
    and long-short term memory (LSTM). BN is a probabilistic graphical model for representing
    probabilistic relationships among variables via a directed acyclic graph (DAG),
    that is a collection of nodes and directed edges, where the nodes represent random
    variables and edges encode conditional dependence between the nodes (Geiger et
    al., 1990; Koller and Friedman, 2009). If there is an edge from a node A to another
    node B, then node A is called a parent of node B, and node B is a child of node
    A. Each variable statistically depends on its parents. Learning (estimating) BNs
    from data consists of two stages, structure and parametric learning. Structure
    learning refers to estimating the DAG from data. Parametric learning refers to
    estimating the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of each node given its
    parents. The resulting learned BN can answer probabilistic queries about the random
    variables via basic probability operations on the CPDs (equation A.1 in SI). In
    the case of continuous variables, Gaussian probability density functions are used
    as the conditional probability distributions. To learn the BN structure in the
    presence of missing values, the two R packages bnlearn (Scutari, 2010) and bnstruct
    (Franzin et al., 2017) were used (Table A.1 in SI). Both of these packages use
    structural Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm that iteratively imputes the
    missing values (expectation step) and learns the structure (maximization step).
    In bnlearn, the maximization step of the SEM is performed using two score-based
    approaches, Hill Climbing (HC) and Tabu Search (TS). In bnstruct, the structure
    learning is based on the hybrid approach Max-Min Hill Climbing (MMHC) heuristic.
    The input to these algorithms is the training dataset and the output is the BN
    structure. The measure Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used to find the
    optimal structure (equation A.2 in SI). Since these training algorithms execute
    random processes, the results may vary from one run to another. Each algorithm
    was hence run ten times and the averaged predicted outputs were used for comparison
    with other models. After finding the optimal network structure, the CPD parameters
    were learned over the training dataset using Maximum Likelihood Parameter (MLE)
    for HC and TS in bnlearn and Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) for MMHC in bnstruct.
    The additional machine learning models KNN, MLP, SVM, DT, RF, ET, and GBM were
    trained using the Scikit-learn Python package (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and LSTM
    was trained using the Keras Python package (Keras-Team, 2017). The use of these
    models required imputing the missing values, which was performed by a linear regression
    model in the mice R package (van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). The hyperparameters
    were tuned with random search algorithms for each model (Table B.1 in SI). 2.4.
    Evaluation indices Model performance was evaluated by different measures including
    coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root mean
    square error (RMSE) (Gao et al., 2020; Pengxiao and Zoe, 2019): (1) (2) (3) where
    is the observed value at time , is the forecasted value at time t, is the average
    of , is the average of , and is the number of instances. The model with the highest
    performance over the test dataset was chosen as the final model to be tested in
    the following data challenges. 2.5. Tackling data challenges in developing data-driven
    models (I) Sensitivity to independent variables To determine the most influential
    independent variables in developing WWTP effluent quality prediction models, the
    unified model explanation system – SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used.
    SHAP is a method for interpreting the performance of data-driven models based
    on the concept of game theory (Lundberg and Lee, 2017). It quantifies the influence
    of independent variables on the output of the model by computing SHAP values (equation
    C.1 in SI). The variables examined in this challenge include Q, BOD, COD, TSS,
    pH, T, TN, NH3, NH4, TP, PO4, EC, ZN, VSS, MLSSat, MLSSre, DOat, Tair_avg, Tair_min,
    Tair_max, R, W, Wmax, and H. For each of the three case studies (see section 3
    below), the top 50% of the variables with the highest SHAP values were listed,
    and every variable that appeared in at least two of the case studies as top 50%
    was considered as important. A variable was also considered important if it appeared
    in the top 50% in only one case study but was not measured in the other case studies,
    i.e., was not included in the corresponding dataset. (II) Sensitivity to training
    data volume To determine the impact of the number of training data instances on
    the model performance, the final 50 data instances of the original training dataset
    were removed iteratively until the total number of instances reached 100. This
    partitioning mimics the reality that new data instances will be collected in the
    future, not the past (Ramazi et al., 2021a). The testing dataset remained fixed.
    (III) Sensitivity to missing data To evaluate the model against different portions
    of missing values, iteratively 5% of the missing values of the original training
    dataset were randomly chosen and filled in by using a linear regression model
    from the mice R package to eventually obtain a complete dataset. To test the model
    on a dataset with more missing values than that in the original dataset, a portion
    of 5% random instances were iteratively removed from the original dataset until
    the model could be trained on a dataset that had a substantial portion of missing
    values. The testing dataset remained unchanged to have an impartial model comparison
    against the different portions of missing values. Since the missing data were
    generated at random, the experiment was repeated ten times and the average accuracy
    was reported. 2.6. Study overview The effluent variables were considered as dependent
    variables, for each of which a separate forecasting model was built based on the
    remaining influent, operational, and climate variables, considered as the independent
    variables. The dependent variables were shifted one day ahead, capturing the time
    delay between influent and effluent, resulting in the forecast horizon of 24 h.
    Then the raw dataset was first preprocessed to be used by the data-driven models
    (Fig. 1). Bayesian networks did not require this step. Next, by taking 80% for
    training and 20% for testing, several machine learning models were evaluated.
    The best-performing model was used to address the three data challenges. Download

    The overall process flowchart of the study. 2.7. Case studies Data from three
    distinct case studies were utilized to validate the proposed approach on WWTP
    data challenges. The First was the South of Tehran Wastewater Treatment Plant
    (TWWTP), located in Iran. This plant started its operation in 2009 and was designed
    in eight modules to serve a population of 4.2 million inhabitants (Rafati et al.,
    2018). In the first phase of the TWWTP, modules 1 to 4 were built to treat wastewater
    with an average daily rate of 450,000 m3/day and influent BOD concentration of
    280 mg/l. At first, raw wastewater (influent) is treated by the primary treatment
    section and then treated by activated sludge process including nitrogen and phosphorus
    removal (Tabesh et al., 2019). Presently, the effluent is used mainly to irrigate
    Varamin farmlands and the resulting sludge is planned to be used as fertilizer.
    The second case study was the East of Melbourne wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP),
    located in Australia. This plant treats nearly half of Melbourne sewage (2.5 million
    inhabitants). The sewerage network in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne receives
    and conveys approximately 330,000 m3/day of sewage to the MWWTP, where it is treated
    and transformed for reuse. The MWWTP adheres to the national water quality management
    strategy to ensure that the sampling, treatment, and effluent management processes
    meet the required standards (Bagherzadeh et al., 2021a, Bagherzadeh et al., 2021b).
    After treatment, a portion of the effluent is utilized on-site or supplied to
    nearby customers and the remaining effluent is discharged into the ocean. The
    dataset obtained from MWWTP can be accessed through the Melbourne Water Open Data
    Hub (2020) webpage. The third case study was the Manresa wastewater treatment
    plant near Barcelona (BWWTP), located in Spain. The activated sludge process employed
    by this plant is capable of treating 35,000 m3/day of sewage generated by a population
    of 100,000 individuals, and it also receives wastewater from industrial sources,
    indicating its capacity to effectively manage and treat a diverse range of wastewater
    sources (Anter et al., 2020; T. Liu et al., 2022). The dataset obtained from BWWTP
    is available from the UCI repository (Poch, 1993). The data was obtained from
    the aforementioned three WWTPs (Table 2; see appendix D in SI for details). Fig.
    2 displays a nullity matrix representing missing dispersion over the datasets.
    In the TWWTP dataset, 13% missing values were observed, with particularly considerable
    and systematic missing for PO4 and TP, i.e. about 89%. Notably, this pattern manifested
    with measurements taken on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. The MWWTP dataset had
    a total of 12% missing values, and a great portion of these missing values is
    associated with TN variable, i.e. about 91%. The dataset from BWWTP exhibits an
    overall missing value of 2% that appears to manifest randomly. Therefore, missing
    data is a common issue in WWTP measurement records. Accordingly, this study examines
    the efficacy of data-driven algorithms in processing datasets containing different
    portions of missing values. Table 2. Summary of collected data from three case

    package (Bilogur, 2018). 3. Results 3.1. Statistical analysis of the case studies
    data The homogeneity test revealed that the majority of the variables within all
    three datasets demonstrate heterogeneous conditions. This heterogeneity can present
    challenges when training data-driven models using these variables, e.g., influent
    pH and MLSS in TWWTP data, effluent Q in MWWTP data and influent pH in BWWTP data
    (Fig. 3). Due to the limited data size and the dispersion of heterogeneous points
    across various variables, it was not feasible to separate the heterogeneous portion
    of the data. Furthermore, the collected data was authentic and reflected real-world
    conditions where such heterogeneity can naturally occur. Hence, the complete dataset
    was utilized in the research to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of
    the models in handling the data challenges. Download : Download high-res image

    to the Spearman rank correlation matrix between the dependent and independent
    variables (Fig. 4), the dependent variables were nearly uncorrelated with the
    independent variables {DOat, MLSSat, MLSSre, R, W} in TWWTP data, {W, Wmax, H}
    in MWWTP data and {Znin, TSSin} in BWWTP. Conversely, the dependent variables
    were highly correlated with the independent variables including {Qin, Tin, pHin,
    TSSin, MLSSat, Tair_avg, Tair_min, Tair_max, H} in TWWTP data {Qin, TNin} in MWWTP
    data and {pHin, BODin, CODin, ECin} in BWWTP data, which were expected to contribute
    notably to the accurate forecast of wastewater characteristics. Download : Download

    Models performance None of the implemented nine models outperformed the others
    uniformly over all of the dependent variables (Fig. 5, see appendix E in SI for
    NSE and R2 scores). For TWWTP data, dependent variables Q, T, pH, BOD, NH4, and
    TP were the most accurately forecasted – all by the BN algorithms, particularly
    HC. Dependent variables COD, TN, and PO4 were reasonably accurately forecasted
    – all by the LSTM model. Next, the dependent variable TSS was most accurately
    estimated by the MLP model. Finally, the poorly estimated variable FC was best
    estimated by GBM. For MWWTP and BWWTP data, all dependent variables were best
    forecasted by BN algorithms, particularly HC. Download : Download high-res image

    of variables Important independent variables associated with forecasting effluent
    characteristics were identified by using the SHAP method. Average SHAP values
    were computed for each variable, allowing for the creation of a bar graph that
    visualizes the contribution of each variable in model output (Fig. 6). A higher
    SHAP value denotes greater importance of the variable in model output. Download

    (b) MWWTP, (c) BWWTP datasets. Certain independent variables had a great influence
    and strong associations with all dependent variables, including Qin, Tin, pHin,
    TSSin, ECin, PO4 in, TPin and Tair in TWWTP data, Qin and Tair in MWWTP data and
    Qin, CODin, TSSin and ECin in BWWTP data. These variables can be ranked as important
    variables that show high sensitivity with a relatively high impact on the model
    output. Furthermore, the value of an influent characteristic, such as Q, T, pH,
    TSS, PO4, TP in the case of TWWTP data, Q in the case of MWWTP data and COD, EC
    in the case of BWWTP data, emerged as the most important factor in forecasting
    the same characteristic in the effluent. 3.4. Sensitivity to data volume To assess
    the impact of data size on the model performance, the best performing model was
    selected from section 4.2, i.e. BN and in particular, HC. For all dependent variables,
    a gradual decrease in average error on the forecasting of test data was observed
    by increasing the size of training data (Fig. 7). Furthermore, results for variables
    such as Q, BOD, TN, NH4, TP, PO4 for TWWTP and all dependent variables in MWWTP
    and BWWTP show that as the size of the training data increased, the error curves
    of both the training and testing data appeared to converge towards a certain value.
    Most importantly, in all datasets and for most of the stated variables, there
    was a sudden drop in the model improvement rate once the training dataset reaches
    250 data instances. Also, the results highlighted that even with smaller training
    data volumes, the BN model exhibited lower testing errors compared to other models
    that developed with larger training data. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    the number of instances in the training dataset. 3.5. Sensitivity to missing values
    Similar to the previous section, the BN model HC was selected to evaluate the
    impact of different portions of missing values in the training set on the model
    accuracy (Fig. 8). As expected, generally, the accuracy over the testing dataset
    decreases with the portion of missing values in the training dataset. A noteworthy
    point was obtained from the graphs for pH, COD, BOD, TSS, NH4, PO4 variables for
    TWWTP, as well as all dependent variables in MWWTP and BWWTP. It was observed
    that between 0 and 10% of missing values, the increase in error was relatively
    gradual. As the portion of missing values reached the range of 10%–30%, the trend
    of error increase became more pronounced. When missing values accounted for 30%–45%
    of the dataset, the error experienced a steeper surge. Hence, it can be said that
    as the percentage of missing values in the dataset increased, the impact on the
    model performance became more substantial. Download : Download high-res image

    versus portion of missing values (%) (the vertical blue line represents the initial
    portion of missing values in the training dataset, before applying other percentages
    of missing data). 4. Discussion The statistical tests give the implication that
    some independent variables in datasets of all three case studies are heterogeneous
    and also uncorrelated with the dependent variables. However, this is a common
    issue and can occur naturally in WWTP real-world conditions. These data are difficult
    for conventional data-driven models to cope with. Consequently, there is a need
    to develop more solid and effective models utilizing accessible information that
    has been addressed among recent similar studies. Based on Table 1, Yongkui et
    al. (2022) utilized MLP model to forecast COD and TN concentration in WWTP effluent.
    The model performance indicated the coefficient of determination 0.69 and 0.59
    (R2 score) for COD and TN respectively. In a different approach, Wang et al. (2022)
    developed nine machine learning algorithms to forecast the COD concentration of
    WWTP effluent. The results showed high forecasting accuracy for both KNN and GBM
    models. However, the results of this study demonstrated the strength of algorithm,
    Bayesian network, in dealing with such data as they outperformed the other data-driven
    models, highlighted in previous studies. This is mainly due to the fact that the
    BN serves as a suitable probabilistic model for simulating the uncertainty arising
    from an incomplete understanding of the plants, as well as the inherent randomness
    in the treatment. Moreover, a Bayesian network does not need to impute missing
    values in the dataset when making predictions. This is in line with previous arguments
    about the efficacy of Bayesian networks, which include the appropriate model development
    even with limited data, handling missing values within the dataset, and the ability
    to simulate subjects encompassing degrees of uncertainty (Baclawski, 2004; Heckerman,
    1998; Ramazi et al., 2021b; Uusitalo, 2007). Specifically, this work shows that
    the success of WWTP forecasting models is heavily affected by the quality and
    quantity of the training dataset, in terms of essential variables, data instances,
    and missing values. The following discussions of data challenges are drawn. In
    this paper, the independent variables influential in forecasting effluent characteristics
    of WWTP were identified, which can be taken as top independent variable choices
    in future research at the beginning of data collection. Although the important
    independent variables were different for each dependent variable, Qin, Tin, TSSin,
    ECin, PO4 in, TPin and Tair, which are commonly measured in WWTPs, played a crucial
    role in forecasting effluent characteristics. As expected, the value of an influent
    characteristic is the most influential factor in forecasting the same characteristic
    in the effluent. This can be explained by the fact that the models rely strongly
    on using the difference between the same characteristic in influent and effluent
    when forecasting (Farhi et al., 2021). Through the results of the second challenge,
    data volume, three observations are made. First, as the size of training dataset
    increases, the forecasting error over the testing dataset gradually decreases.
    The larger training dataset contains more information regarding data trends and
    variable correlations, which in most cases can lead to improved model performance.
    In addition, a larger volume of data can reduce the data dispersion, as noted
    by Payrovnaziri et al. (2021), and provide an opportunity for the model to extract
    more meaningful information. Nevertheless, it should be noted that increasing
    the size of the data would inevitably extend the training time of the models.
    Second, with further increase in the size of the training dataset, a noticeable
    phenomenon is observed where the training and testing error curves plateaued.
    This behavior of data-driven algorithms may be attributed to reaching local optimal
    points within the training space. Consequently, it can be inferred that when an
    adequate number of samples is available, the model error plateaus at a certain
    level, and further increasing the sample size hardly improves the model performance.
    This conclusion is consistent with previous studies conducted by Alipour and Harris
    (2020) and Ramazi et al. (2014). Third, based on the results obtained from the
    three case studies, a minimum of 250 measurement samples is required for model
    training in order to achieve a substantial reduction in the forecasting error
    of the test data. A considerable forecasting error was observed for smaller datasets.
    This can be considered as a rule of thumb threshold for the minimum number of
    data instances to train forecasters for WWTP. Also, the results indicate that
    the BN model displayed superior forecasting capabilities, even when trained with
    a limited dataset. It should be noted that this research ignored the simultaneous
    effect of data volume and missing values on model accuracy. At each step of adding
    samples to the dataset, there were some missing values that could be the reason
    for unfavorable changes in the graphs. The obtained result explains the impact
    of different portions of missing values on model performance. As expected, more
    missing values led to worse model performance (Uechi et al., 2019). However, the
    impact of the missing values was heightened if they increased beyond a certain
    point, 30% in this paper, and as the portion of missing values reaches 45–50%,
    the software package could not train the BN model. A portion below 10% helped
    lessening the severity though. The forecasting error in a few points of the graph
    decreased as the missing values increased. This behavior seems outside the logic
    of the problem (Payrovnaziri et al., 2021) and is perhaps partly because some
    data instances conveying erroneous information to the model are randomly removed
    from the dataset, which leads to ascending the accuracy. 5. Conclusions The information
    on effluent characteristics that a forecasting model can provide to plant managers
    will help them to make on-time and reasonable decisions before effluent passing
    from the standard quality. Three case studies on the basis of measured data in
    WWTPs located in Iran, Australia and Spain provide key findings associated with
    three data challenges through the modeling process of developing the BN and eight
    other models. The first result of this research was an operative data-driven model
    that can forecast the effluent characteristics of WWTP, 24 h ahead. The analysis
    of the obtained result confirmed that the BN is able to calculate effluent characteristics
    under missing data with a higher accuracy than other machine learning algorithms.
    The performance of data-driven models strongly relies on the quality of the data
    used to train them. This study, for the first time, sought to tackle three common
    data challenges in forecasting WWTP effluent characteristics: (1) Practitioners
    look for variables that, when added to the dataset, improve the forecasting accuracy.
    In this article, key variables were identified that are likely to have a great
    impact on the effluent quality forecasting model, including Q (flow rate), T (influent
    temperature), TSS, EC, PO4, TP and Tair (ambient temperature). (2) In general,
    increasing the number of measurement samples leads to better model performance.
    However, in reality, there are limited available data in WWTPs. The minimum number
    of measurement samples for model training in order to notably reduce the forecasting
    error of the test data is proposed to be 250 samples. (3) Undoubtedly, missing
    data implies limitations in developing a model. In this paper, only data-driven
    tools were explored, and the results explain how model performance suffers from
    missing data. Should the portion of missing values exceed 10%, the error would
    increase more steeply. The findings of this research offer valuable insights that
    can assist plant managers in making informed decisions regarding the selection
    of sensors within WWTPs. Additionally, this research serves as a resource for
    experts and model developers, providing guidance on the collection of sufficient
    and relevant data to achieve a successful forecasting model in terms of cost,
    time, and accuracy. This study did not address the impact of toxic compounds on
    forecasting accuracy, which can be explored in future research. Also, one of the
    characteristics of data that may influence the model accuracy is the measuring
    time step in WWTP. As stated previously, TP and PO4 in the case of TWWTP are two
    variables measured weekly or sometimes biweekly. These two variables have medium
    forecasting accuracy, which appears to be a result of the measurement schedule.
    Therefore, it remains open to study the trade-off between time steps and model
    accuracy. Finally, the question should be answered whether it is economical to
    provide a sensor with a low-step detector in WWTP. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: In recent times, the densely populated Bengaluru metropolis in India
    has faced challenges related to water scarcity, particularly relying on the Krishna
    Raja Sagara (KRS) dam. The forecasting of reservoir water levels has become challenging
    due to spatio-temporal fluctuations in meteorological conditions and complex physical
    processes. As a result, developing suitable water management to meet the population's
    water demand requires an accurate and dependable estimate of the dam's water level.
    This work attempted to use a daily reservoir and weather data by utilizing long
    short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Seven high-performance models (viz., M1 to
    M7) with varying window sizes and horizons have been trained on this data and
    their performance is compared. The performance metrics revealed that the M7 model
    outperformed the other models for reservoir water level prediction, with coefficient
    of determination (R2) score of 0.93, root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.94, and
    mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.01. This study also provides a valuable
    dashboard for tracking forecasted water levels in the largest reservoir in the
    Cauvery basin. Finally, the innovative integration of LSTM technology in water
    level predictions for the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) dam not only addresses the
    challenges posed by spatio-temporal fluctuations but also sets a new standard
    for precision in forecasting, thereby establishing a crucial decision-support
    tool for real-time monitoring and enhanced water resource management in India's
    Bengaluru metropolis.

    learningHydrological modellingLSTM 1. Introduction River water is part of the
    water cycle, and proper use of this resource by means of both the reservoirs and
    the dams are much needed infrastructure for flood control, power generation, water
    distribution, irrigation, and agriculture [1]. The monitoring of reservoirs is
    a challenging task as it includes forecasting of water storage levels for evaluating
    structural problems [2], water inflow and supply availability [3,4], quality of
    the water [5,6], disaster prevention [7], navigation management [8], and hydropower
    production optimization. Monitoring water levels can have a variety of environmental
    benefits and is a common measurement for several industries and organizations.
    Ensuring the upkeep of reservoirs responsible for supplying drinking water to
    urban areas and effectively responding to the impacts of various hydro-climatic
    conditions is a key responsibility in urban water management [9]. According to
    the Census of India, 31.2 % of the population lives in cities. The largest urban
    cities are Greater Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad [10].
    A significant proportion, approximately two-thirds, of the urban population currently
    lacks access to safe drinking water [11]. Urban locations in the south confront
    the challenges of unreliable, insufficient, and contaminated freshwater supplies
    [12]. Shockingly, approximately one billion individuals lack feasibility to safe
    and uninterrupted water sources in these cities. This has serious implications
    for health and wellbeing [13,14]. Because of the rapid urbanization, there is
    a greater need and competition for, water supply. During times of water insecurity,
    there is a crucial requirement for transparent data to facilitate informed decision-making
    and effective water supply risk management [15,16]. Over the past few decades,
    hydrological and environmental studies have witnessed the development and application
    of diverse machine learning models [[17], [18], [19]]. Hydrological and environmental
    modeling are pivotal for minimizing the environmental impact of water resources
    and ecosystems. Hydrological modeling involves simulating processes like rainfall,
    runoff, and groundwater flow, offering insights into water system dynamics crucial
    for sustainable water resource management [20]. Environmental modeling, encompassing
    air quality, land use, and ecological systems, enables the assessment of human
    activities environmental impacts [21,22]. By monitoring variables such as precipitation,
    river flow, and ecological indicators over time and visualizing them spatially
    with sophisticated tools, decision-makers understand hydrological and environmental
    systems comprehensively [23,24]. This data-driven approach empowers urban planners
    to make informed decisions, addressing water scarcity, pollution, and ecosystem
    degradation [[25], [26], [27]]. Strategies informed by hydrological and environmental
    modeling contribute to eco-friendly development, minimize ecological footprints,
    and support overall urban and regional environmental preservation objectives [28,29].
    In the reservoir operations, the most used models are autoregressive integrated
    moving average models (ARIMA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Many scholars
    are promoting ANN in the reservoir operation field as ARIMA is limited in forecasting
    extreme values and ANN models are good at non-linear prediction ability [30,31].
    ANN, Support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF) have been the primary
    machine learning (ML) techniques in hydrology, environment, and water resources
    for modelling water flow, assessing water quality, and forecasting water level.
    To anticipate the water level in the Andong Dam watershed in South Korea, Seo
    et al. [32] used ANN models and wavelets. Babaei et al. [33] reported that for
    the real-time water level forecast of the Iranian Zayandehroud dam reservoir,
    the SVM model performs better than the ANN model. RF was used by Yaseen et al.
    [34] to forecast lake levels. Furthermore, a few research have also shown an ANN
    hybrid model using the ARIMA hybrid model [[35], [36], [37]]. The limitations
    of ANN, like local optimal solutions, vanishing gradient problem, have been highlighted
    due to the increased research in neural networks and have limited the application
    of the model [38]. The above algorithms are applicable for estimation, but they
    suffer from significant flaws like a lack of feature extraction capabilities,
    long processing times. In recent years, deep learning (DL), an emerging learning
    technique, has made remarkable strides in computer science domains such as computer
    vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Its success has been
    increasingly notable. DL has demonstrated its ability to abstract and represent
    attribute categories or characteristics by combining low-level features. Furthermore,
    it has shown a substantial enhancement in accuracy [39]. Due to its capability
    to handle intricate scheduling problems, the LSTM model has become extensively
    utilized in hydrological forecasting. It stands as a widely adopted deep learning
    model in this field [40,41]. Extensive research has focused on reservoir inflow
    forecasting methodologies, particularly in the unique study cases of significant
    reservoirs like Linganmakki, Supa, and Mani in the western part of Karnataka State,
    South India, there is a noticeable gap in studies utilizing ML and DL to estimate
    water inflow across diverse geographical, geological, and hydrogeological contexts.
    Gupta and Kumar [42] introduced a novel boosting model for forecasting water level
    inflow in western Karnataka, leveraging historical data from water levels, rainfall,
    and groundwater. Similarly, Ruma et al. [43] applied particle swarm optimization-based
    LSTM for water level forecasting in the Bangladesh river network. They acknowledged
    the need to incorporate crucial aspects like weather and rainfall data for more
    accurate flood predictions. Many authors have considered hydro-meteorological
    data and historical reservoir data [[44], [45], [46]]. Despite a substantial body
    of literature exploring the prediction capabilities of various ML-based algorithms
    and approaches for water level forecasting, there remains a significant research
    gap in applying these methods across diverse geographical settings. This review
    underscores the importance of considering multiple factors, including weather
    and rainfall data, to enhance the accuracy of predictions, especially in regions
    reliant on reservoirs [[47], [48], [49], [50]]. Many cities worldwide heavily
    depend on reservoirs, making it imperative to address several critical considerations
    related to their behavior, which is notably sensitive to various influencing factors.
    This literature review highlights the evolving landscape of ML and DL applications
    in water level forecasting. It emphasizes the need for further research to bridge
    existing gaps and enhance the predictive capabilities of these models. 1.1. Research
    significance To address the aforementioned research gaps, this study adapted and
    implemented state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for water level prediction.
    Additionally, we delved into probabilistic projections, a fact that previous research
    predominantly overlooked in favor of point forecasts [51,52]. Using deep learning
    facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the reservoir''s water levels. To
    evaluate the efficacy of various models, an extensive case study was conducted
    in one of the largest reservoirs in South India. To the author''s knowledge, limited
    studies reported the multi-horizon predictions in water level forecasting [53].
    Inspired by the effectiveness of the multi-horizon prediction models, a hybrid
    time series modeling technique has been developed and revealed in the current
    study for describing the linear and non-linear properties independently. The main
    objective of building the predictive model is to estimate reservoir water availability
    at least 1–3 months in advance using hydro-meteorological, reservoir water level,
    and historical data. To accomplish this, the data should encompass real-time information
    on water risk management and provide short-term forecasts regarding the availability
    of water in reservoirs [54]. This comprehensive data will enable better decision-making
    and proactive measures in managing water resources effectively. Through this study,
    we introduce a dashboard to visualize the water levels in the reservoir throughout
    the year, a significant gap in earlier studies [54]. 2. Methodology This section
    offers an in-depth examination of the study area and provides a comprehensive
    account of the experimental procedures and techniques employed throughout the
    study. 2.1. Study area One of the most essential interstate rivers in South India
    is the Cauvery, which is located between latitudes 10°9′ N and 13°30′ N and longitudes
    75°27′ E to 79°54′ E. The three Indian states and union territories that comprise
    the Cauvery basin are Karnataka (42 %), Tamil Nadu (54 %), and other smaller states
    [55]. The Cauvery watershed is an exemplary example of the many large catchments
    in Peninsular India confronting increasing difficulties in managing their water
    resources due to increased urbanization, population expansion, and intensified
    agriculture. The Cauvery River is marked by continuous disagreements about water-sharing
    agreements between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The catchment is currently dealing
    with water abstraction levels that exceed the renewable water resources available,
    as indicated by the designation of highly water-stressed [56,57]. Significant
    regional differences exist in the water demand of this catchment, with 90 % of
    the total water resources coming from agricultural operations [58,59]. Competition
    for water resources is fiercer across sectors and between states due to the catchment''s
    fast growth in the urban and industrial sectors [60]. The catchment has many different
    types of water management infrastructures, from large-scale transfer schemes to
    medium- and large-scale reservoirs and small-scale storage measures. A thorough
    grasp of the catchment''s hydrology is essential due to its intricate dynamics.
    Developing robust and dependable models is essential to improving water resource
    management in severely water-stressed catchments. The necessity of accuracy and
    dependability highlights the significance of ongoing studies and modeling endeavors
    to tackle the changing obstacles linked to water scarcity and rivalry in such
    dynamic catchment regions. The Cauvery delta, KRS reservoir is one of the largest
    reservoirs with a higher gross capacity [52,55]. Fig. 1 shows the Cauvery River
    basin and KRS reservoir. Bengaluru, situated in the southeastern region of Karnataka,
    is India''s sixth largest city. It is one of the rapidly expanding urban centers
    in Asia. It boasts a population of nearly 10 million residents. Presently, the
    city retains only around 20 % of its original water bodies [52]. Bengaluru relies
    on two primary sources for water supply: the river Cauvery and groundwater. The
    water from the river Cavery is collected in the KRS dam, situated in Mysore. Following
    this, the BWSSB pumps and distributes this water to more than 660,355 connections
    across Bengaluru. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    within the village areas of Krishnarajasagara village, Srirangapatna taluk, and
    Mandya district. Fig. 1 presents the visual representation of the basin map. The
    dam has a total catchment area of 10880.63 km2 consisting of 3229.58 km2 intercepted
    by reservoirs on major rivers of Harangi (419.58 km2) and Hemavathi (2810 km2)
    reservoirs and 7651.05 km2 independent. The maximum and minimum annual virgin
    yields at KRS Dam site from derived run off data for the years 1901–1980 area
    34870.5MCM (1232.17 TMC) and 13183MCM (465.83 TMC) respectively. The 75 % dependable
    yield at this site is worked out to be 21057MCM (743.64 TMC). Average annual yield
    is 24071.17MCM (850.59 TMC). The reservoir formed by the dam has a gross storage
    capacity of 1400 MCM (49.452 TMC) and live storage capacity of 1276 MCM (45.051
    TMC). The reservoir water spread submerges an area of 129 km2 displacing a population
    of about 25 villages. 2.2. Data This section describes the data available for
    KRS Dam and the methodology carried out to collect hydro-meteorological data from
    various sources. The daily reservoir data is released by the World Resources Institute
    (WRI) as part of their Reservoir Watch Hackathon.1 It contains daily data on inflow,
    outflow, and present storage from January 2011 to December 2020. The descriptive
    statistics of the provided data are shown in Table 1. Additional open-source data
    is incorporated from various sources. The daily reservoir data is updated daily
    by our system with the help of Storage and Flow Data on the Major Reservoirs portal.2
    We have even collected spatially aggregated weather data from remotely sensed
    data products from the Visual Crossing weather service.3 Weather plays a major
    role in the amount of water that flows in. In this study the data is collected
    from the Visual Crossing weather data service to analyze weather across the major
    cities along the three inflow channels, as well as the mean Karnataka weather.4
    Each user is limited to 1000 records per day. The collected data is in the repository.

    mean Karnataka weather, and the KRS inflow plotted on the same time scale for
    2018. Fig. 2 indicates that the inflow is greater when the temperature, humidity,
    and cloud cover are lower, and vice versa. We have also analyzed the correlation
    of various weather indicators to the KRS water characteristics. The cities considered
    for analyzing the weather are Haranhalli, Heggadikpplu, Akkihebbal, Chikmanglur,
    Keralapura, Kodugu, Krishnarajanagara, Mandya, Mysore, and Saligrama. All these
    regions are topographically at a higher elevation. Bengaluru and the surrounding
    areas are at lower elevations. While rains in Bengaluru may reduce outflow from
    KRS, they have no effect on inflow. Each location was found to have some correlation
    with the reservoir, but the average Karnataka weather had a stronger relationship.
    The region experiences 1950 mm of precipitation on average per year; however,
    there are temporal and spatial differences in this precipitation across the sub-catchment.
    The Western Ghats facilitate the development of a rain shadow effect that lowers
    the precipitation gradient during the southwestern monsoon along the western coastline.
    Within the catchment, daily mean temperatures range from 11 °C to 25 °C. Particularly
    in the Western Ghats, the soil properties are typically intense, and the valley
    bottoms are covered in thick forests, while the mountain slopes are primarily
    grasslands. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    that there is a positive correlation between storage and wind, humidity, and cloud
    cover, but a negative correlation with maximum temperature, which seems logical
    given that hotter day''s result in more evaporation, less inflow, and more water
    use. However, certain locations closer to KRS show a reverse correlation, suggesting
    that we need to look at a wider region than only the neighborhood. Overall, the
    average Karnataka weather shows similar and consistent trends, so we chose to
    include only average weather in our predictive model. Download : Download high-res

    The \"global dimming\" effect, which results from the elevated levels of gases
    in the atmosphere from dense industries surrounding the reservoirs, may be connected
    to the decrease in evaporation seen in the Ceara, Pacoti Riachao, and Gaviao reservoirs
    in Brazil. This effect increases local cloudiness and lessens the warming impact
    of solar radiation on the nearby reservoir or rivers evaporation [61]. Two reasonable
    reasons for the decreased evaporative loss in the reservoirs are air pollution
    and regional dimming. Numerous other densely industrialized nations and locations
    with more petrol emission rates, including Canada, India, Turkey, New Zealand,
    and others, have similarly reported this decrease in evaporation [[62], [63],
    [64]]. However, few nations are not densely industrialized and emits very low
    amounts of gases, this occurrence does not uniform throughout the worldwide. The
    converse can occur in developing or underdeveloped nations since their atmospheric
    gas output is insufficient to offset the sun''s radiation, which could lead to
    increased evaporation rates. With the study, we have daily reservoir data and
    weather data. To test the effectiveness of the datasets collected, we planned
    to build three different predictive models for forecasting the water level in
    KRS using the following data conditions (1) daily reservoir data which contains
    inflow, outflow, and present storage, (2) weather data which contains maximum
    temperature, visibility, wind, humidity, cloud cover, and present storage, and
    (3) merged data which contains both daily reservoir data and weather data. 2.3.
    Algorithms In order to enhance water resource planning and improve risk preparedness
    for Bengaluru city, this project proposes the implementation of a pipeline that
    enables short-term forecasting of reservoir data availability. The entire process
    is visually represented in Fig. 4, consisting of three primary components: Data
    Collection, Model Training and Evaluation, and Dash-board Creation. The detailed
    procedure for collecting data is outlined in the subsequent section. There are
    three types of datasets involved in this work are Daily Reservoir data, Weather
    data, and the merged data combining both sources. To effectively train a deep
    learning model on time series data, the data needs to undergo a process called
    reconstruction or embedding [65]. This involves shifting the time series by a
    specific window size (T), which encompasses all the necessary data for a single
    training example. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Flow of the entire work covering data collection, model
    training, and creation of dashboard. 2.3.1. Model training and evaluation The
    one-step forecast involves predicting the value at time t + 1, based on the previous
    T values of the time series, assuming we are currently at time t. On the other
    hand, the multi-step or multi-horizon forecast entails predicting the values at
    times (t + 1, t + 2, · · ·, t + HORIZON), given the previous T values of the time
    series, assuming we are at time t. Our forecast model adopts the vector output
    approach, which trains the network using the previous T values from time t as
    the source and time t + 1 to t + HORIZON as the target. This approach leverages
    deep learning models, which can effectively handle time series data in a scalable
    manner and provide accurate forecasts [66]. Considering that standard autoregressive
    time series analysis may not adequately account for multiple factors, we have
    chosen to utilize deep learning techniques for our forecasting purposes. The suggested
    model utilizes an LSTM-based architecture because it leverages memory cells and
    gates to retain long-term dependencies within a sequential context [67]. LSTM
    units can be trained in a supervised manner on a collection of training sequences
    by employing a modified version of the Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm,
    which takes into account the relevant gates [68]. The model architecture used
    is shown in figure. The LSTM networks takes in a input training example as a sequence
    of values X = x1, x2, · · ·, x + T, one value at a time. The network produces
    a cell state, c, and a hidden state, h, for each value. The LSTM cell in the network
    recursively feeds the values at current timestep xt, cell state, c, and hidden
    state, h from the previous time step (ct−1, ht−1), to produce the next cell and
    hidden state, (ct, ht) as expressed in equation (1). The final outcome hT is obtained
    by sending the timestep xT, is passed to a dense layer which produces the predicted
    forecast yˆ:Horizon as shown in equation (2). (1) (2) The LSTM networks calculate
    a cell state ct and hidden state ht as (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) In the array of
    equations, it, ft, and ot refer to the input, forget and output gates, respectively
    at timestep t. xt and ht refer to the number of input features and hidden units,
    respectively. The parameters W and U are the parameter matrices (weights) adjusted
    during learning. Fig. 5 illustrates the architecture of the model, where T represents
    the latent dimension indicating the number of lags, and H represents the horizon,
    indicating the number of days in the future that we aim to predict. The input
    to the model consists of a set of T values, while the output consists of a set
    of H values. The following steps were followed in the development of the model.
    • Prepare the time series data for training LSTM model. • Transform the data into
    the required shape. • Implement an LSTM model to predict the next time step (t
    + 1) in the time series. • This model utilizes recent values of inflow, outflow,
    max temperature, visibility, humidity, and wind as input features. • Enable early
    stopping to reduce the likelihood of model overfitting. • Evaluate the performance
    of the model on the test dataset. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download

    forecast. If Horizon, H = 30, the model forecasts for 30 days. RMSE, R2, and MAPE
    (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance
    of regression models or forecasting models. RMSE measures the average magnitude
    of the errors between predicted and actual values. It is calculated by taking
    the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and
    actual values. It serves as a metric for assessing the overall accuracy of a model,
    with superior performance indicated by lower values. Given its reliance on error
    squaring, this metric is responsive to outliers. R2 is a measure that indicates
    how much of the variability in the outcome variable (dependent variable) is accounted
    for by the independent variables in a regression model. It''s a statistical metric
    ranging from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 signifies a flawless fit. In simpler terms,
    R2 can be seen as the percentage of changes in the dependent variable that the
    model successfully explains. MAPE calculates the average percentage disparity
    between predicted and actual values. It involves taking the absolute difference
    between the predicted and actual values, dividing it by the actual value, and
    then averaging these values across all predictions. Widely utilized in time series
    forecasting, MAPE offers a relative gauge of the forecasting error. Expressed
    as a percentage, lower MAPE values signify greater accuracy. The formulae to calculate
    these metrics are present in the form of equations - RMSE in equation (9), R2
    Score in equation (10), MAPE in equation (11). In all equations (9), (10), (11),
    yi and yˆi represents the actual and predicted water level at the timestep i.

    help all types of userbase [69]. We have implemented a prediction dashboard5 on
    a free tier AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance [70]. The dashboard utilizes the Streamlit
    Python library [71]. Fig. 6 illustrates a simplified architecture of the dashboarding
    process. To keep the data up-to-date, a daily updater process gathers updates
    from the weather service and the reservoir daily update service. This information
    is then added or appended to a pre-existing SQLite database. Additionally, we
    maintain a repository of predictive models that we have trained. These models
    vary in their predictive capabilities and are designed to work with different
    hydrological parameters. The predictions generated by each model are stored in
    the database. The interactive streamlit dashboard visualizes the weather data,
    reservoir history, and forecast data. It allows users to explore and interact
    with the information. Furthermore, we have developed a chatbot using RASA to enhance
    the overall user experience, making it more engaging and interactive. Download

    Dashboard architecture. 3. Experimentation We conducted experiments using three
    distinct feature sets: daily reservoir data, weather data, and merged data (displayed
    in Table 2). These datasets were populated in an SQLite database from the mentioned
    sources for future prediction purposes. Given the multivariate nature of the data
    and the significant influence of several observations on the current water availability
    of the reservoir, we trained a multivariate time-series model. To optimize the
    model''s performance, we trained it with different window sizes (30, 60, 90 and
    180 days) and horizons (1, 30, 60, and 90 days). The development process of the
    LSTM model involved several steps to prepare and train the time series data. •
    Preparation of the time series data: The data was preprocessed to ensure it was
    suitable for training the LSTM model. • Arranging the data: The data was reshaped
    to meet the requirements of the API, ensuring compatibility with the LSTM model.
    • LSTM model implementation: The LSTM model was created, utilizing the input features
    with a specific window size. This allowed the model to predict subsequent time
    steps, ranging from time t + 1 to t + Horizon. • Initial stopping: To address
    the risk of model overfitting, early stopping was enabled. It helps prevent the
    model from continuing to train when it no longer improves on the validation set.
    • Model evaluation: The trained LSTM model was evaluated with the help of a test
    data to assess its performance and find its predictive accuracy. Table 2. The
    feature sets used for model training. Data Feature Set Daily reservoir data Inflow,
    outflow, and water storage Weather data Maximum temperature, visibility, wind,
    humidity, cloud cover, and water storage Merged data Inflow, outflow, water storage,
    maximum temperature, visibility, humidity, and cloud cover For effective model
    training, the data was partitioned into three distinct datasets: training, validation,
    and test. The distribution of data among these sets is illustrated in Fig. 7.
    The train-test-split was modified according to the chosen window size and horizon
    based on the experiment. This allowed for the exploration of different configurations
    and an assessment of their impact on the model''s performance. The experimentation
    involved variations in latent dimensions, horizons, batch sizes, and optimizers.
    The adjustment of these parameters aimed to optimize the model''s capacity and
    improve its predictive capabilities. It is noteworthy that the model''s capacity
    may vary based on the window sizes and horizons employed in the experiments. Download

    Visualization of training, validation and testing data. 4. Results and discussion
    Several models were trained using diverse window sizes and horizons, involving
    extensive experimentation to alter the model capacities. Out of the various models
    examined, seven high-performing models were presented in Table 3, each offering
    forecasts ranging from 1 day to 90 days. Table 3 provides details on the model
    capacity, input days, and forecast days. To distinguish them, the models were
    assigned names ranging from M1 to M7. Among all the models, M6 stands out with
    a higher number of parameters due to its larger window size and horizon, encompassing
    more days of data. On the other hand, M7 has a relatively smaller number of parameters,
    amounting to only 4391, since it focuses on forecasting for a single day. The
    third column indicates the model''s capacity, followed by the window size (T)
    and horizon (H) used in training. Models 1 to 6 were trained using feature set-3
    (merged data), while model 7 utilized only feature set-2 (weather data). Table

    Table 4 presents a comprehensive overview of the trained model''s performance,
    including their training and validation loss, R2, RMSE, and MAPE scores. Based
    on the R2 score, it is evident that models M3, M6, and M7 are the best-fit models
    among the entire set. The analysis of M3 and M6 indicates that the model capacity
    significantly influences performance. Notably, none of the models utilize a window
    size smaller than the predicted days. The models follow a consistent ratio of
    1:1, 6:1, 3:1, and 2:1 for the window size and prediction days across the first
    six models. However, M7 deviates from this pattern with a window-to-horizon ratio
    of 30:1, resulting in the best fit model. As the prediction window is minimal,
    the performance is better for the M7 model. This finding implies that incorporating
    a greater number of days as features leads to improved predictions. It was observed
    that historical reservoir data yielded good predictive results. The merged data
    performed well for all forecast periods of 30, 60, and 90 days, achieving a validation
    loss of 0.001. Notably, M7, which solely relied on weather data, exhibited a validation
    loss of 0.00038 for a single day forecast. This outcome suggests that weather
    data alone is also sufficient for accurate forecasting. Table 4. Performance of
    the models. Model Training Loss Validation Loss R2 RMSE MAPE M1 0.0980 0.0011

    30 days, respectively. Fig. 8d illustrates the forecast generated by models trained

    Notably, with a 1-day horizon. This model demonstrates the best performance compared
    to others, primarily due to the utilization of a larger number of records for
    training. Additionally, the training and validation loss curves are presented
    alongside the model performance curves. Notably, Fig. 9 demonstrates a noticeable
    reduction in overfitting as the window size decreases. This phenomenon can be
    attributed to the number of records created, which follows the formula: (12) n
    − (Ws + H) + 1 where n represents the available data points, Ws denotes the window
    size, and H indicates the horizon. When Ws and H have large values, the resulting
    dataset becomes minimal, leading to an increased risk of overfitting. There is
    no overfitting observed in this model''s training (Fig. 9d). The visuals provided
    in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 clearly highlight the significance of having a substantially
    large ratio between the window size and horizon. Furthermore, these figures emphasize
    the necessity of having an ample amount of data for effective modeling. Download

    are consistent with the most recent developments in the field. The results of
    the proposed model and well-established water level forecasting methods were compared
    [[72], [73], [74], [75], [76]], showing that deep learning greatly increases prediction
    accuracy. Remarkably, compared to conventional regression techniques like neural
    network regression, boosted decision tree regression, and gradient boosting machines,
    the suggested water level prediction model performs better regarding RMSE [[76],
    [77], [78]]. This research has yielded significant insights into creating efficient
    models for forecasting water levels. There are now two main recommendations: First,
    a precise assessment of the effectiveness of prediction models depends on the
    thoughtful selection of assessment metrics. Second, deep-learning approaches are
    recommended, as they outperform the capabilities of machine-learning regressor
    models that have been around for a while. There are two reasons to concentrate
    on improving the prediction performance of LSTM. First, using carefully controlled
    structures called gates, LSTMs demonstrate the capacity to add or remove information
    from the cell state selectively. Second, they improve overall prediction performance
    by giving a subset of features more attention. Drawing from the results outlined
    earlier, it is evident that employing deep learning methodologies, particularly
    LSTMs, yields optimal outcomes across various evaluation metrics when predicting
    time-series data. These results highlight how deep learning can improve the precision
    and efficacy of water level predictions, making a substantial contribution to
    hydro informatics. LSTM models have difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies,
    sensitivity to hyperparameters, overfitting on small datasets, expensive computation,
    difficulty in capturing complex seasonality patterns or trends [79]. Researchers
    are now experimenting with transformer-based models on time series data and gaining
    good results. When choosing a model for this kind of data, it is essential to
    consider characteristics of the data (seasonality, trend, and noise) [79,80].

    in Python. The dashboard presents a summary of the current forecast, which is
    displayed in the bottom-right corner. It offers the ability to generate water
    level forecasts on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis. By default, the forecasts
    are generated using the most accurate model available. Furthermore, the dashboard
    includes a feature that allows users to select a specific model from the repository
    and generate predictions accordingly. For users who may encounter difficulties
    with the dashboard, a chatbot is provided as an alternative assistance tool. Download

    developed using Python Streamlit library. It enables to view the monthly, weekly,
    and daily forecast of the water level in the reservoir. Effectively managing water
    resources is paramount, and the developed predictive model is a significant advancement
    in this domain. By offering accurate forecasts of water levels, the model empowers
    resource managers to optimize water allocation, fostering a sustainable equilibrium
    between supply and demand. Moreover, the model plays a pivotal role in mitigating
    the impact of extreme water events. It facilitates early warnings for droughts
    and floods, enabling proactive measures to minimize adverse consequences. This
    predictive capability contributes to preserving ecosystems reliant on specific
    water levels, ensuring ecological balance and biodiversity maintenance. Additionally,
    the model aids in sustainable infrastructure planning, offering valuable insights
    into future water levels for designing resilient and adaptive structures. Communities
    relying on water resources for various needs, including agriculture, industry,
    and domestic use, benefit significantly from accurate water level predictions,
    enhancing their resilience and adaptive capacity. While the global adoption of
    artificial intelligence (AI) for reservoir water level prediction remains limited,
    the potential for effective water resource management is vast, especially with
    user-friendly AI dashboards that provide real-time information and graphical representations
    to facilitate collaborative decision-making among field engineers [81]. 5. Conclusion
    The main goal of this research was to create a predictive model for forecasting
    water levels, ensuring a sustainable balance between water supply and demand.
    This was achieved by utilizing historical reservoir and weather data to train
    multiple LSTM-based models. The study specifically focused on the Bengaluru city
    region in India, utilizing data from the Krishnarajasagara dam. The research underscored
    the significance of historical data and demonstrated that accurate predictions
    can be attained using weather data alone. The selection of the window size and
    horizon in training a time-series model was identified as crucial. It was concluded
    that maintaining a sufficiently high ratio between these parameters is essential,
    ensuring an abundant amount of data for effective training. To enhance accessibility
    to this forecasting tool, a user-friendly dashboard was developed, making it available
    for use by a diverse audience. In future research, the predictive model for water
    level forecasting in Bengaluru could benefit from including socio-economic factors
    that align with urban development trends. Improving data resolution and incorporating
    advanced technologies like remote sensing and satellite imagery will refine the
    tool''s accuracy and relevance. CRediT authorship contribution statement Abhinav

  description: Proper water management is crucial for agriculture, as its irrigation
    systems can waste approximately 60% of water. Using IoT for irrigation based on
    soil moisture can help reduce waste. This study used multidimensional time series
    modeling to predict soil moisture using two years of data on a US farm, including
    factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather. The models assessed were
    machine learning algorithms like Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forests,
    Deep Learning's Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN), and Vector Autoregression
    as a reference model. Random Forest was the most efficient and stable model. Furthermore,
    the spectral temporal graph neural network could not outperform the reference
    model. Comparing Random Forest with univariate algorithms like Naive, Exponential
    Smoothing, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) showed univariate's
    better performance in 9 of 10 datasets, with ARIMA being best in 8. A substantial
    disparity is observed when considering the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    metric. ARIMA yields an MAPE of 0.052, while StemGNN reports 0.127 as the major
    difference. ARIMA achieves a MAPE of 0.046 for the minor difference, whereas StemGNN
    obtains 0.038. In the remaining eight datasets, ARIMA consistently outperforms
    StemGNN by at least 30%. In summary, modern methods could not beat the older methods

    approximately 65 billion cubic meters of water, 50% of this water used for irrigation.1
    However, up to 60% of irrigation water is wasted due to inefficient irrigation
    practices [1]. With the expansion of agriculture and the growing risk of water
    shortages, the development of new irrigation strategies to avoid water waste is
    becoming increasingly important. Technology can play a vital role in addressing
    this challenge by creating efficient irrigation water management systems. An example
    is the Smart Water Management Platform (SWAMP) project, which used intelligent
    tools to manage irrigation plans. The SWAMP platform leverages technologies such
    as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and data science to offer farmers
    an intelligent strategy to monitor and plan irrigation schedules. The fields can
    be monitored by sensors and drones connected to a management system that receives
    real-time data. All data are processed and stored in the cloud, and historical
    data is used to train forecasting models that predict soil moisture (SM). The
    predictions generated by the models provide valuable information for farmers in
    planning irrigation schedules [2], [3]. Similarly, Amarendra Goap, Deepak Sharma,
    and their team have developed a fully autonomous irrigation system that combines
    IoT, cloud computing, and data science to predict SM levels in real time [4].
    The intelligent system collects data from soil sensors, air, and light radiation
    and uses machine learning models to forecast SM. The output of the model feeds
    into a decision system to control field irrigation. Furthermore, time series forecasting
    has proven applicable in various problem domains in recent years. For example,
    Yassen et al. [5] used time series prediction to predict water flow in Malaysia.
    Their study aimed to improve water management to ensure drinking water for citizens
    and energy production. Sezer, Gudelek, and Ozbayoglu [6] systematically reviewed
    the literature on studies that used time series forecasting to model financial
    time series. These studies applied machine learning and deep learning models to
    predict commodity values such as oil, coffee, and sugar and the values of company
    shares, currencies, and digital coins. Furthermore, Ediger and Akar [7] used time
    series forecasting to model fuel demand in Turkey. On the contrary, Barak and
    Sadegh [8] proposed to model annual energy consumption in Iran using time series
    forecasting. In both studies, the researchers aimed to predict the need for energy
    resources for government planning. Efficient irrigation is essential to ensure
    better water management and the continuity of agricultural production. Esfahani,
    Rua, and McKee [9] described how efficient irrigation prevents soil leaching and
    crop stress from excess water, thus ensuring productive capacity during water
    scarcity. Estimating the future value of the SM variable is essential for irrigation
    planning to ensure adequate water volume for cultivation. Typically, physical
    models that simulate the dynamics of water in the soil over time generate estimates
    for the SM variable [10]. These models require knowledge of soil properties to
    effectively simulate water dynamics in the soil [11]. Furthermore, the evapotranspiration
    of soil water, irrigation, precipitation, and transpiration of the cultivated
    plant are essential factors in estimating the variable SM [12]. There are various
    tools for generating SM estimates using physical models, with HYDRUS software
    being one of the most widely used [13].” A drawback is that obtaining all the
    calibration data from the HYDRUS software can be challenging. Thus, alternative
    approaches, such as time series forecasting with machine learning and deep learning,
    are being explored. Karandish and Simunek [14] compared various time series forecasting
    algorithms to predict SM, using the output model to feed a system that creates
    the irrigation schedule. Esfahani, Rua, and McKee [9] combined machine learning
    and sensor data to create an optimization system for the irrigation process. In
    their work, Goap and Sharma [15] used a regression model to forecast SM. The regression
    model output was then classified using a cluster model to generate a binary output,
    which determined whether to continue the irrigation process. Goldstein and Fink
    [16] utilized machine learning algorithms to predict SM time series, and the resulting
    predictions were used to plan the weekly irrigation strategy. Accurate SM forecasting
    is crucial for intelligent platforms and fully autonomous irrigation systems to
    generate information on irrigation schedules [17]. Applying time series modeling
    for soil moisture forecasting requires careful consideration of many technical
    details. These include the selection of appropriate models, the choice of input
    and window lag variables, and the optimization of parameters. Additionally, the
    accuracy of the forecasts must be evaluated to ensure that the model performs
    as expected. This paper proposes time series modeling of SM data and investigates
    the performance of univariate and multivariate algorithms for forecasting SM.
    Our experiments aim to explore the influence of data window size on algorithm
    performance and compare the performance of traditional algorithms with modern
    ones. We investigate the ideal sample data size required to build an efficient
    model, considering different scenarios of data availability ranging from one to
    twelve months or more. We also examine the impact of updating the fitting model
    on the prediction performance. Finally, we compare the performance of univariate
    and multivariate algorithms in ten datasets from various regions of the world.
    Our goal is to provide information on the performance of different SM forecasting
    algorithms and to identify the most efficient algorithms for this task. 2. Background
    This section presents the background of our research. 2.1. Soil moisture The target
    variable in this study is SM, which represents the amount of water content in
    a soil volume ( ) [18]. The study focuses on investigating the capability of machine
    learning algorithms to forecast future SM values, which is essential to create
    an efficient irrigation schedule. 2.2. Forecasting algorithms We used statistical
    and machine learning algorithms to analyze the SM forecast. Statistical algorithms
    included Naive [19], Vector Autoregression (VAR) [20], Exponential Smoothing (ES)
    [19], and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [21]. The naive method
    predicts the value of the future series as the last known observation [19]. ES
    predicts future values using weighted averages that exponentially prioritize recent
    samples, assigning them higher weights [19]. The VAR model predicts the future
    value of a series as a linear combination of past values of the target series
    and the series that influence it [20]. On the other hand, the machine learning
    algorithms consisted of Random Forest (RF) [22], Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
    [23], Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting
    (N-BEATS) [24], and Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time
    Series Forecasting (StemGNN) [25]. RF is an ensemble technique derived from bagging.
    RF comprises n predictors built using decision trees. It distinguishes itself
    from bagging by introducing random variable selection during predictor construction.
    It enables the algorithm to be trained with diverse input sets, reducing predictor
    variance and improving the accuracy of the final prediction [22]. XGB is a Gradient
    Boosting Machines implementation that incorporates decision trees as weak predictors
    and includes regularization in the cost function to prevent overfitting during
    training [23], [26], [27]. The N-BEATS architecture for univariate time series
    prediction consists of M stacks, which function as an ensemble model similar to
    boosting. Each stack specializes in predicting the residual of the previous stack.
    Stacks are made up of K blocks, which operate similarly. Each block predicts the
    residual of the previous block and comprises two parts: a fully connected neural
    network (FC) with four layers and two single-layer FC neural networks [24]. The
    StemGNN combines Graph Discrete Fourier Transform (GDFT), Discrete Fourier Transform
    (TFD), and deep learning components. StemGNN transforms multivariate time series
    into a multivariate temporal graph in the first layer. It uses a Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) layer to calculate the adjacency matrix W for series computation and
    self-attention. The second layer, StemGNN, involves a GDFT transformation, followed
    by a sequence of operations. It includes TFD, 1D CNN, Gated Linear Unit (GLU),
    and the inverse Fourier transform to capture intraseries patterns. The spectral
    matrix is filtered through a graph-convolutional neural network. The output consists
    of future value predictions and input series reconstruction. The loss function
    optimizes the network parameters by minimizing prediction and reconstruction errors.
    We have designated the Naive and ES models as the univariate baseline and the
    VAR model as the multivariate baseline. We selected the well-known ARIMA algorithm
    [28], [29], [30], [31] to provide a benchmark for statistical time series forecasting.
    We selected N-BEATS, a state-of-the-art algorithm that has demonstrated exceptional
    performance in time series forecasting [24] for deep learning models. To investigate
    decision tree-based models for multivariate time series forecasting, we selected
    RF [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39] and XGB [40], which represent
    ensemble bagging [41] and boosting [40] based on decision tree models, respectively.
    Finally, we explore StemGNN, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm, as a representative
    for multivariate time series forecasting [25]. 2.3. Data description Throughout
    the work, we used a set of datasets to investigate SM forecasting using various
    algorithms. The Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) [42] data set was the result of the Long-Term
    Agroecosystem Research Group (LTAR), which consists of researchers associated
    with Washington State University who monitor the soil of an agricultural cultivation
    farm [43]. We also collected nine data sets from the International Soil Moisture
    Network (ISMN) project, an international collaborative initiative to store and
    make available SM records collected from soil monitoring sites worldwide [44].
    Our research comprises two sets of experiments to compare the performance of multivariate
    and univariate algorithms. In the first group of experiments, we focused on evaluating
    the influence of data window size on the performance of multivariate algorithms
    using the CAF dataset. The CAF data set comprises data from 42 sensors installed
    on a farm, divided into 42 zones, each monitored by one sensor. Each sensor records
    SM, temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity at five depths: 0.3, 0.6, 0.9,
    1.2, and 1.5 meters. Additionally, the data set includes daily temperature and
    rainfall data from the nearest meteorological station. Therefore, three new features
    were added to the data set: daily precipitation, maximum daily temperature, and
    minimum daily temperature. The data set contains daily measurements for two years.
    For our experiments, we selected the data generated by the CAF095 sensor and used
    SM, soil temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity from depths of 0.3, 0.6,
    and 0.9 meters. Therefore, our final data set consisted of nine soil features
    and three meteorological features. The second group of experiments focused on
    comparing the performance of multivariate and univariate algorithms on SM forecasts.
    For this purpose, we used ten data sets from different regions worldwide, including
    the CAF data set from the first group. We obtained the other nine data sets from
    the ISMN project, a global initiative that stores and provides access to data
    sets that contain SM records [44]. The ISMN partners monitor SM levels around
    the world and make the data available in the cloud. Table 1 shows the details
    of the location of the data set. Each station monitored air and soil using sensors
    and registered a feature group, generating each data set. Table 2 presents a comprehensive
    list of feature names, corresponding abbreviations, and accompanying descriptions.
    Meanwhile, Table 3 offers an overview of the constituent features of each dataset.

    in terms of the features they included. We selected SM, temperature, precipitation,
    and air temperature as our main features. In some cases, the sensors generated
    SM and soil temperature readings at different depths, and we used both whenever
    possible. We selected two years for each time series and grouped the hourly data
    into daily values using the trimmed mean at 80%. Our study highlights the importance
    of data window size in multivariate algorithms and sheds light on the performance
    of multivariate versus univariate algorithms for SM forecasting. Our results have
    implications for the design and development of future forecasting models in this
    field. 2.4. Performance measures Throughout this work, we used some metrics to
    measure the efficiency of our algorithms in forecasting SM. Our time series consists
    of daily values, so we aim to predict the next day''s value. To compare the performance
    of our algorithms, we use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE), and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Using time series
    data from different locations throughout the world, we chose MAPE to compare the
    performance of the algorithm across different data ranges. In addition, we used
    RMSE and MAE to evaluate the impact of outliers on the forecast. While the former
    imposes a higher penalty for larger errors, the latter does not. Therefore, we
    use both metrics to analyze the effect of outliers on our forecasts. 3. Methodology
    The methodology used in our study consists of three scenarios designed to address
    key research questions. In the first scenario, we conducted seven experiments,
    each with varying training window size, to assess their impact on the performance
    of multivariate algorithms. We also evaluated the prediction stability over a
    year for each training configuration. Scenario two mirrored scenario one but with
    a reduced fitting frequency for multivariate algorithms, conducted every 15 days
    instead of 30. It allowed us to investigate the impact of the fitting frequency
    for model updating. In scenario three, we performed ten experiments comparing
    the best performing multivariate algorithm from scenarios one and two with univariate
    algorithms across ten diverse datasets from different geographical locations,
    providing insight into multivariate algorithm performance relative to univariate
    counterparts. The research questions were as follows. • How does the size of the
    training window influence the performance of multivariate algorithms? • Does the
    frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithm influence the prediction efficiency?
    • Does the multivariate algorithm outperform the univariate algorithms? We conducted
    seven experiments in scenario one to gain insight into the first research question.
    For each experiment, we defined a different training window to compare the impact
    of the training window size on the performance of multivariate algorithms. Additionally,
    we analyzed the performance of each multivariate algorithm over a year to assess
    the prediction stability of each training configuration. For scenario two, we
    conducted seven experiments identical to scenario one, but with a lower frequency
    of fitting of the multivariate algorithms. Specifically, the algorithms were fitted
    in scenario two every 15 days, compared to every 30 days in scenario one. This
    strategy allowed us to investigate whether the frequency of fitting the multivariate
    algorithms impacted their performance. Finally, in scenario three, we performed
    ten experiments that generated results to discuss the fourth question. We selected
    the multivariate algorithm with the best performance in scenarios one and two
    experiments and compared it with univariate algorithms. We considered ten datasets
    from different geographical points for the comparative study. Thus, we obtained
    results to discuss the performance of the multivariate algorithm compared to the
    univariate algorithms. 3.1. Scenario one In scenario one, we utilized the CAF
    dataset, as described in section 2.3. The target variable was the SM at a depth
    of 0.3m. The data set was divided into two periods of one year, with the first
    period used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models and the second period
    used for validation. For the training stage in scenario one, we used a sliding
    window format over the first data period, with the test dataset defined as 25%
    of the size of the training dataset. The training window was slid across the first
    year''s data, with one-third of the training dataset data updated in each iteration.
    We recorded the optimized hyperparameters and the predicted and test series for
    each training cycle to calculate performance metrics. During hyperparameter selection,
    we stored the model with the best performance per iteration of the experiment
    and grouped the hyperparameters into discrete and continuous categories. The discrete
    hyperparameters with the highest frequency were selected in the iterations of
    each experiment, whereas the mean was used for the continuous hyperparameters.
    Performance was used as a tiebreaker for hyperparameter selection. Experiments
    six and seven were exceptions to the described process. In both cases, the training
    window was one year, the training data set defined as 80% of the data and the
    test data set as 20%. After selecting the hyperparameters, we fitted the models
    using the entire available data set in the first period. During the validation
    stage, we did not perform hyperparameter optimization. Instead, we utilized the
    hyperparameters selected in the training stage and fitted the algorithms using
    the data window of the period prior to the prediction. For each day''s prediction,
    we used data from the previous days and, after 30 days, we fitted the model again.
    We recorded the predicted series values to calculate the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation
    metrics. Experiment seven was an exception to the previously described process,
    with the training window not sliding. After predicting the first month of the
    validation dataset, we added the data to the training data set and used the entire
    period for algorithm fitting. 3.2. Scenario two In scenario two, except for the
    prediction step, we replicated the experiments conducted in section 3.1. Specifically,
    we conducted seven experiments to evaluate the impact of fitting the multivariate
    algorithms every 15 days compared to every 30 days in scenario one. We used the
    same data set in scenario one for each experiment and the same methodology for
    hyperparameter optimization and performance evaluation. The only difference was
    the frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithms, done every 15 days in scenario
    two. For prediction, we make forecasts one day ahead for the next 15 days. The
    primary goal of scenario two was to investigate the effect of the frequency of
    fitting of the models on their performance. 3.3. Scenario three In scenario three,
    we selected the multivariate algorithm that demonstrated the best performance
    in scenarios one and two and conducted ten experiments. Next, we compare the performance
    of the selected algorithm with the univariate algorithms using ten data sets from
    various geographical points. The results allowed us to evaluate the performance
    of the multivariate algorithm against the univariate algorithms at different locations.
    Section 2.3 describes the data sets used in the experiments. We used the results
    from scenarios one and two to design the experiment plan for scenario three. We
    selected the modeling arrangement in which the algorithms evaluated in the previous
    scenarios presented the best performance. We began the experiment by selecting
    the original data sets, from which we chose samples for two years. Next, we selected
    the algorithms evaluated in the comparative study, which included the RF multivariate
    algorithm that outperformed the other algorithms evaluated in scenarios one and
    two. We also selected four univariate algorithms, including three traditional
    statistical methods: Naive, ES, and ARIMA. The fourth univariate algorithm selected
    was the N-BEATS neural network architecture. We divided the data samples in scenario
    three into two periods of one year. We used the first period to optimize the hyperparameters
    of the algorithms, and we used data from the second period to validate the results.
    The experiments in this scenario compared the performance of the univariate algorithms
    with the multivariate RF algorithm, which had achieved the best performance in
    the previous scenarios. During the training stage of the experiments in scenario
    three, we optimized the hyperparameters of the RF and N-BEATS algorithms. The
    other algorithms evaluated at this stage of the study did not require optimization
    due to the nature of the algorithms. We used the same strategy as in experiments
    six and seven of the previous scenarios, using a training window of one year.
    The training base was defined with 80% of the sample data and the test base with
    20%. Once the hyperparameters were selected, we fitted the algorithms using one
    year for the validation stage. To select hyperparameters, we stored the model
    with the best performance per iteration of the experiment. We grouped the hyperparameters
    into discrete and continuous ones, selecting the discrete hyperparameters with
    the highest frequency in the iterations of each experiment. We use the mean to
    select continuous hyperparameters, with performance as a tiebreaker for hyperparameter
    selection. We did not optimize the hyperparameter during the validation stage
    using the hyperparameters selected in the previous step. However, we calibrated
    the algorithms using the entire available data period. The strategy was similar
    to experiment seven of the previous scenarios, using a daily aggregation window
    strategy before prediction and performing algorithm calibration with all available
    historical data. By expanding the daily training base, the model would have accessed
    the most significant sample variability. Finally, we recorded the predicted series
    values to calculate the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation metrics. 4. Results and
    discussion This section discusses project questions based on the experiment results.
    4.1. How does the size of the training window influence the performance of multivariate
    algorithms? To investigate the first design question, we developed seven configurations
    of training windows, namely, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and annual.
    The annual window was used in two configurations, as explained in 3.1. Fig. 1
    presents the MAPE performance graph per experiment for all algorithms evaluated
    in scenarios one and two. The training windows successively increase from the
    first to the last experiment. There was no direct relationship between performance
    and an increase in the training window. The VAR algorithm in scenario one improved
    performance from the first to the second experiment, but the performance decreased
    from the second to the third one. The StemGNN algorithm showed continuous worsening
    from the first to the fifth experiment and has improved in the last. RF achieved
    similar results in experiments one to four, worsened in experiment five, and improved
    in experiments six and seven. The XGB algorithm presented regular results from
    the first to the fifth experiment and improved performance in experiments six
    and seven. Therefore, increasing the training window did not guarantee better
    algorithm performance. However, the results revealed that a one-year or longer
    window applied to experiments six and seven significantly improved the performance
    of all algorithms. Evidence found to explain the better performance referred to
    the periodic behavior of the series of CAF data sets. Table 4, Table 5, Table
    6, Table 7 shows the result metrics for each experiment in both scenarios. Download

    the frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithm influence prediction efficiency?
    To investigate the second research question, we separated the fit algorithm frequency
    in experiments conducted in scenarios one and two. In scenario one, we split the
    validation step into 12 parts and predicted 30 observations continuously. Subsequently,
    we added the predicted observations to the training base and refitted the models.
    We repeated a similar configuration for scenario two, but with a prediction period
    of 15 observations. We present all the result metrics for each experiment in both
    scenarios in Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7. Fig. 1, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 present
    the results of the experiments in each scenario, with scenario one illustrated
    in blue and scenario two in orange. We presented the results of the MAE, RMSE
    and MAPE metrics. In all three metrics, reducing the calibration period improved
    the algorithms'' performance, except for experiment six of the StemGNN algorithm,
    which showed worsened performance for all analyzed metrics in scenario two compared
    to scenario one. Moreover, in experiment seven, we observed that the RMSE and
    MAE obtained for the XGB algorithm achieved slightly lower performance in scenario
    two. Therefore, the frequent calibration strategy generally resulted in better
    performance of the algorithms explored in the study. Download : Download high-res

    To address the third research question, we analyzed the results obtained from
    the experiments conducted in scenario three. Our objective was to compare the
    performance of multivariate and univariate algorithms in forecasting SM. For this
    comparison, we chose the RF algorithm, which demonstrated the best performance
    in scenarios one and two. We evaluated and compared the performance of four univariate
    algorithms: ARIMA, N-BEATS, ES, and Naive. Table 8 presents all the algorithms
    evaluated. We conducted ten experiments using different datasets, and the target

    CAF Interestingly, the RF algorithm could not outperform the Naive method in nine
    out of ten experiments. In particular, Naive, one of the simplest methods available,
    outperformed the RF algorithm in most experiments. The results suggest that the
    components registered in data sets containing SM series did not add predictive
    capacity to multivariate methods. The N-BEATS algorithm could not outperform the
    ES, Naive, and ARIMA algorithms in most experiments. These findings highlight
    the difficulty of modern methods in surpassing straightforward but practical approaches,
    at least with regard to the data sets used in this work. 5. Conclusions Through
    the investigation of SM prediction, we modeled the problem as a univariate and
    multivariate time series prediction problem, conducting a total of 28 experiments
    to answer three design questions: • How does the size of the training window influence
    the performance of multivariate algorithms? • Does the frequency of fitting the
    multivariate algorithm influence the prediction efficiency? • Does the multivariate
    algorithm outperform the univariate algorithms? In the first scenario, we performed
    seven experiments to generate results for discussing the first question. These
    experiments evaluated the performance of four multivariate algorithms (VAR, StemGNN,
    RF, and XGB) for the prediction of SM. We designed the experiments with seven
    modeling strategies that varied the configuration of the training sample size,
    using monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annual samples. We used the
    results to investigate the effect of sample size on algorithm performance. We
    used scenario two to investigate the importance of recurrent fitting of the models.
    We conducted seven experiments similar to scenario one, with the only difference
    being the validation step, in which we fitted the models every 15 days. We compared
    the results of the experiments in scenario two with those of scenario one to answer
    the second question of the project. In scenario three, we designed ten experiments
    to compare the prediction performance of a multivariate algorithm with that of
    univariate algorithms, generating results to discuss the third question of the
    project. Based on the results of scenarios one and two, we selected the RF algorithm
    as the most efficient among the multivariate solutions evaluated in the study.
    We then compared its performance with the ARIMA, Naive, ES, and NBEATS algorithms.
    We considered ten datasets from different geographical points for the comparative
    study, enabling us to evaluate the algorithms'' performance in predicting SM under
    different exogenous conditions. In conclusion, we could answer all the questions
    posed in the study. Models with higher predictive capacity were obtained using
    data samples with more records, whereas shorter-period training samples resulted
    in unreliable and unstable models. Our experiments demonstrated that the multivariate
    RF and XGB methods outperformed the StemGNN neural network and the VAR method.
    These results are consistent with the findings of the M5 competition [38], which
    indicated that machine learning methods were more effective than traditional statistical
    methods and neural network architectures. Furthermore, our comparison between
    univariate methods and the RF algorithm showed that univariate approaches were
    more efficient in predicting SM. Our results suggested that exogenous variables
    had little predictive value in the SM series data sets. However, it remains to
    be investigated to what extent exogenous variables affected the performance of
    multivariate methods. When compared to Naive, the RF algorithm''s low performance
    could be attributed to exogenous series that only added noise and made it difficult
    to predict the RF algorithm. Our experiments showed that deep learning methods
    did not outperform the traditional methods evaluated. This finding is similar
    to that presented in [52], which showed that neural network architectures must
    be improved to be superior to traditional methods for predicting time series.
    In future work, we suggest exploring additional techniques for creating variables
    based on the original bases to advance the understanding of multivariate time
    series modeling. In the current study, we only added a series of variables delayed
    by one, two, and three days. Adding more variables could increase the predictive
    capacity of multivariate methods. Furthermore, the low performance of the RF algorithm
    compared to the univariate methods suggests that exogenous variables may have
    a low predictive value. For future work, it would be interesting to investigate
    the importance of each variable for multivariate methods and determine whether
    exogenous variables positively affect or not the methods'' performance. Regarding
    the modeling strategy, we did not explore optimization of the parameters of machine
    learning and deep learning algorithms with frequent periodicity. Additionally,
    we recommend incorporating the data component as an attribute in the training
    strategy. For example, the model could be trained using monthly windows, with
    data from January used to predict the series for January of the following year.
    Similarly, for a semester window, the algorithm could be trained using data from
    the first semester of a year to predict the first semester of the following year.
    It would also be valuable to investigate the prediction of periods longer than
    one day. Using the SM variable for windows larger than one day is typical in irrigation.
    Therefore, understanding algorithms'' behavior when predicting larger windows
    would be significant. We limited the experiments to evaluate the prediction of
    SM at an exact value. However, in the irrigation problem domain, it is essential
    to maintain the moisture concentration within a range in the soil volume where
    the crop root is located. The health of the crop depends on the respect of the
    upper and lower limits of the moisture concentration range. Therefore, future
    studies could investigate strategies to predict the volume of water necessary
    to maintain an adequate concentration for each crop category. In this study, we
    compared the performance of different algorithms for predicting SM, but we did
    not explore traditional physical models that simulate soil water dynamics over
    time. Comparing the performance of different algorithms with traditional physical
    models to predict SM would be of great value. Moreover, we could design hybrid
    solutions to achieve better performance in SM prediction. Declaration of Competing

    18 November 2021 1 Introduction Large-scale watershed modeling tools have been
    widely used in water resources management, engineering, and environmental studies
    to evaluate the potential impacts of changes in land use and land cover, climate,
    and water management practices on water resources, pollution mitigation, and sediment
    transport (Singh and Su 2021; Singh and Woolhiser 2002). These modeling tools
    offer valuable insights for policymakers, providing strategies to improve the
    sustainability and resilience of water resources. Notable examples of such tools
    include the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) (Arnold et al. 2012), the Hydrologic
    Simulation Package-Fortran (HSPF) (Bicknell et al. 2005), the Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation
    Model (DHSVM) (Wigmosta et al. 1994), and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)
    model (Liang et al. 1994). However, applying these models requires extensive data
    inputs (e.g., climate, topography, soil, land use, and hydrologic data) to set
    up and run, which can be time-consuming and costly. Moreover, calibration and
    validation against observed data before application are usually required, making
    it difficult for non-experts to run. Therefore, there is a demand for a decision
    support system (DSS) that simplifies the cumbersome initialization processes associated
    with large-scale watershed modeling tools. This system should provide an intuitive,
    user-friendly interface for configuring models and preparing input data. The Hydrologic
    and Water Quality System (HAWQS) is a web-based DSS that employs SWAT as its core
    modeling engine to simulate hydrologic and water quality processes in watersheds
    (HAWQS 2020). One of HAWQS’s distinct advantages is its advanced functionality,
    significantly reducing initialization time. It provides a user-friendly platform
    to generate SWAT projects at three Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) (i.e., HUC 8, HUC
    10, and HUC 12) levels, covering the contiguous United States (CONUS, 48 states)
    (Yen et al. 2016). HAWQS has incorporated preliminarily calibrated parameters,
    and users only need to specify the ending HUC and the desired simulation period
    to generate a SWAT project. With its user-friendly interface, HAWQS has greatly
    simplified the use of SWAT for simulating the effects of management practices
    on hydrology and water quality. These practices include the assessment of sediment
    transport, pathogens dispersion, nutrient dynamics, biological oxygen demand,
    dissolved oxygen levels, pesticides, and water temperature (HAWQS 2020). HAWQS
    has been widely used to evaluate the effects of climate change (Ouyang 2021; Ouyang
    et al. 2022b) and extreme weather events, including hurricanes and tropical storms,
    on watershed hydrologic processes (Ouyang et al. 2022a). Additionally, HAWQS can
    be integrated with multimedia and process-based system models, such as the Weather
    Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ),
    and Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC). This integration enhances
    the evaluation of the impacts associated with future climate scenarios, land use
    changes, and different management practices (Yuan et al. 2018). Moreover, HAWQS
    has demonstrated its utility in assessing the economic benefits of water quality
    improvement (Corona et al. 2020). Furthermore, HAWQS has been applied in evaluating
    the impacts of climate change (Fant et al. 2017), natural gas infrastructure development
    (Hanson et al. 2017), and the design of riparian buffer zones (Ghimire et al.
    2021) concerning sediment and nutrient removal and stream water quality. To enhance
    the applicability of HAWQS in various regions, comprehensive testing and evaluation
    have been conducted, including the assessment of input data quality and the effectiveness
    of watershed delineation methods (Brighenti et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2021, 2020).
    For instance, Chen et al. (2021) evaluated the influence of climate dataset density
    and HRU delineation schemes in HAWQS on hydrologic processes in the Upper Mississippi
    River Basin. Brighenti et al. (2022) analyzed the representation of tile drainage
    systems and fertilizer applications within the corn belt regions of the United
    States. An accurate estimation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) is important
    since it affects the overall hydrologic balance, agricultural water management,
    and crop yield at the watershed scales (Singh and Su 2022; Su and Singh 2023;
    Zhang et al. 2021). In this context, Chen et al. (2020) assessed how the selection
    of the PET method and climate dataset within HAWQS affected hydrologic processes
    in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. In this study, we developed the South Carolina
    Hydrologic and Water Quality System (SC.HAWQS), a calibrated HAWQS model explicitly
    designed for South Carolina (SC) (Srinivasan et al. 2023). SC.HAWQS utilizes the
    latest weather, soil, topographic, and land use data to provide comprehensive
    support for hydrologic and water quality researchers, managers, and policymakers
    in SC. Additionally, SC.HAWQS provides climate sensitivity and variability analysis
    tools to help users better understand water cycle changes in response to a changing
    climate. Accurate quantification of actual evapotranspiration (AET) and discharge
    is important to understand the variability of regional water resources. To evaluate
    the hydrologic processes simulated by SC.HAWQS, we employed the Budyko framework
    (Budyko 1974). The Budyko curve illustrates how the interplay between atmospheric
    water supply (i.e., precipitation) and water demand (i.e., PET) governs the partitioning
    of precipitation into discharge and AET (Berghuijs et al. 2014). It provides a
    reference condition for assessing the water balance at watershed levels (Jones
    et al. 2012). The specific objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the seasonal
    patterns of AET, precipitation, and discharge across six watersheds in SC.HAWQS;
    (2) analyze trends in the water cycle; (3) evaluate the performance of the water
    cycle simulated using the Buduko framework; and (4) analyze the sensitivity of
    hydrologic processes in a warming climate. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Study Area
    SC.HAWQS has a dedicated HAWQS web interface to model all watersheds within SC,
    United States. Compared with the national HAWQS, a detailed calibration was conducted
    in SC.HAWQS in six watersheds, including Tyger River watershed (TRW), Lower North
    Pacolet River watershed (LNPRW), Black Creek watershed (BCW), South Fork Edisto
    River watershed (SFERW), Cedar Creek watershed (CCW), and Coosawhatchie River
    watershed (CRW) (Fig. 1). These watersheds were selected based on land use and
    soil characteristics, effectively representing major land use and soil types across
    the state. Details regarding areas, subbasins, and HRUs within these watersheds
    can be found in Table S1. Fig. 1 Calibrated watersheds and USGS sites used for
    calibration in SC.HAWQS Full size image Forest is the predominant land use in
    SC (35%), followed by wetlands (22%), urban (10%), and croplands (8%) (Fig. S1).
    In TRW, LNPRW, and BCW, forests dominate the land use (46–68%), with croplands
    accounting for 1–7% (Fig. 2). In CCW, SFERW, and CRW, forests account for 29–38%
    of land use, and croplands are the second largest land use, ranging from 20 to
    28%. The major soil type in SC is Ultisols (73%), with Udults and Aquults being
    the two primary suborders (Fig. S2). Udults supports mixed forest and cropland,
    characterized by well-drained with relatively high saturated hydraulic conductivity
    (USDA-NRCS 2021). Aquults are primarily found in the coastal plains with shallow
    groundwater, and most Aquults soils are covered by coniferous forests (USDA-NRCS
    2021). Figure S3 provides further details on the hydrologic soil group used in
    SC.HAWQS. Fig. 2 Major land use (%) across the six watersheds in SC.HAWQS Full
    size image The climate in South Carolina is humid subtropical, characterized by
    humid and hot summers and relatively mild winters (Peel et al. 2007). The state
    receives an average annual precipitation of 1214 mm (1895–2020), with slightly
    higher levels in the coastal plain due to the prevalent sea-breeze-front thunderstorms
    during the summer (Figs. S4 and S5). However, despite this precipitation, moderate
    to severe drought occurs during the growing season, posing significant challenges
    to crop production (Barnette et al. 2020; Dyer et al. 2022). Irrigated agriculture
    in SC relies heavily on groundwater, with 82% of total irrigation water use being
    sourced from groundwater (Fig. 3), especially in counties of the Coastal Plain
    region (from the Fall line east to the Atlantic Ocean, Fig. S6). Water withdrawals
    for irrigation have increased from 3.94 \\(\\times\\) 106 m3/day in 2011 to 4.82
    \\(\\times\\) 106 m3/day in 2021 (SCDHEC 2021). To promote sustainable groundwater
    usage, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental has established
    capacity use areas for groundwater, as detailed in Fig. S6. Producers are mandated
    to obtain permits for groundwater withdrawals exceeding 11,356 m3 (3 MGM). For
    instance, CCW and SFERW are located in the western capacity use area, while CRW
    falls within the low country capacity use area. Evaluating water resources in
    these watersheds and their response to a changing climate is critical for developing
    adaptive strategies that enhance crop production and ensure water resource sustainability.

    Full size image 2.2 SC. HAWQS SC.HAWQS offers comprehensive input datasets, including
    weather, atmosphere deposition, watershed boundaries, land use, soil, elevation,
    stream network, point sources, and management data. Data sources are provided
    in Table S2. SC.HAWQS users have the flexibility to choose weather data and simulation
    time steps (daily, monthly, or yearly). The default parameters in the six watersheds
    were calibrated and can be directly used for model application. For other watersheds,
    users need to verify if calibration and validation are necessary before applying
    the model. The system includes a total of 958 HUC 12 watersheds. Within the six
    calibrated watersheds, 20,332 hydrological response unities (HRUs) were configured
    using a threshold of 1 km2. The number of HRUs for each watershed is detailed
    in Table S1. For weather input, we used the Parameter-elevation Regressions on
    Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). Surface runoff was simulated using the traditional
    curve number method and streamflow routing was implemented using the Variable
    Storage method (Neitsch et al. 2011). The Hargreaves method (Hargreaves and Samani
    1985) was the default PET method selected. The simulation period was from 1990
    to 2020, with the first two years as an initialization period. More details of
    the model framework can be found in (HAWQS2.0 2023). 2.3 Calibration and Validation
    Streamflow data from 11 USGS gauge sites across the six watersheds was used for
    model calibration (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/sc/nwis/rt). Locations of the gauge
    sites are shown in Fig. 1, with site names listed in Table S3. We used SWAT-CUP
    for model calibration and validation (SWAT 2019). An automatic calibration was
    performed using the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting v2 (SUFI-2) algorithm. Here,
    the percent bias (PBIAS), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) (Nash and Sutcliffe
    1970), and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al. 2009) were used to evaluate
    model performance. $$PBIAS (\\mathrm{\\%})=\\frac{100 \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[{(S}_{i}-{M}_{i})\\right]}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{M}_{i}}$$
    (1) $$NSE=1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(S}_{i}-{M}_{i})}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({M}_{i}-\\overline{{M
    }_{i}})}^{2}}$$ (2) $$KGE=1-\\sqrt{{\\left(\\alpha -1\\right)}^{2}+{\\left(\\beta
    -1\\right)}^{2}+{\\left(r-1\\right)}^{2}}$$ (3) where \\({S}_{i}\\) and \\({M}_{i}\\)
    are the ith simulated and measured values, respectively; \\(\\overline{{M }_{i}}\\)
    is the mean measured values; n is the total number of the simulated or measured
    values; \\(\\alpha\\) is the ratio of the standard deviation of the simulated
    and measured values; \\(\\beta\\) is the ratio of the mean of simulated and measured
    values; and r represents the linear correlation coefficient between the simulated
    and measured values. Monthly values were used to calculate PBIAS, NSE, and KGE
    (Moriasi et al. 2007, 2015). The simulated values are considered satisfactory
    if \\(PBIAS\\le \\pm 25\\%\\) (Moriasi et al. 2007); \\(NSE\\ge 0.5\\)(Moriasi
    et al. 2015); and \\(KGE\\ge 0.6\\) (Patil and Stieglitz 2015). Table 1 lists
    the calibration and validation years and statistical measures for each gauge site.
    The calibrated parameters for the six watersheds are shown in Table 2. During
    model calibration, it was observed that SC.HAWQS showed relatively low performance
    in the CCW watershed, potentially affected by a large pond that may have been
    limiting accurate modeling. Therefore, model validation was performed at the other
    five watersheds using monthly streamflow data from 2019 to 2020. Model simulations
    of river discharge compared well with observations, indicating the robustness
    of the SC.HAWQS to simulate the hydrologic process in the selected watersheds.
    A comparison of the simulated and measured daily discharge at the USGS site at
    the TRW watershed was shown as an example (Fig. 4). Table 1 Calibration and validation

    2.4 Budyko Framework The Budyko framework serves as a useful tool for conducting
    a comprehensive analysis of water and energy balances within the six watersheds.
    According to the Budyko hypothesis (Budyko 1974), the evaporative index (AET/P),
    which represents the proportion of mean annual (or long-term) average precipitation
    (P) allocated to AET, is a function of the aridity index (PET/P), defined as the
    ratio of PET to precipitation (Eq. 4). $$\\frac{AET}{P}={\\left[\\frac{PET}{P}{\\text{tanh}}(\\frac{P}{PET})\\left(1-{e}^{-(\\frac{PET}{P})}\\right)\\right]}^{0.5}$$
    (4) 3 Results 3.1 Seasonal Cycle of AET, Precipitation, and Discharge The long-term
    mean AET from 1992 to 2020 was 799 mm yr−1, showing slight spatial variability
    with a standard deviation of 49 mm yr−1 and temporal standard deviation of 53
    mm yr−1) (Fig. 5). Both AET and P (with a mean of 1268 mm yr−1 and spatial standard
    deviation of 123 mm yr−1) peaked in June. However, P showed more pronounced spatial
    variation among the six watersheds. The seasonal dynamics in P differed significantly
    across these watersheds. In particular, the TRW and LNPRW showed limited seasonal
    variations in P, with peak values in December (Fig. S7). In the BCW, P reached
    its peak in August. The other three watersheds exhibited peak values in June.
    Fig. 5 Long-term mean seasonal cycle of AET, precipitation, and discharge from
    1992 to 2020. The shaded area indicates the standard deviation among the six watersheds
    Full size image The long-term mean discharge (Q) from 1992 to 2020 was 421 mm
    yr−1, with a spatial standard deviation of 125 mm yr−1 (Fig. 5). The temporal
    dynamics of Q showed distinct patterns, characterized by higher values during
    the winter and spring months (December to May) with a mean monthly value of 39
    mm. In contrast, the summer and fall months (June to November) witnessed comparatively
    lower mean monthly Q of 31 mm. This divergence between the patterns of P and Q
    underscored the substantial contribution of baseflow to Q (54–90%) across the
    six watersheds (Table S4). Our finding highlights the important role of subsurface
    hydrologic processes in regulating streamflow dynamics within the studied watersheds.
    3.2 Trends in the Water Cycle The analysis of trends in AET, P, and Q from 1992
    to 2020 revealed that these trends were not statistically significant (Fig. 6),
    indicating no substantial changes in the water-cycle components throughout the
    studied period. However, it is worth noting that both positive and negative trends
    of AET were found due to the interaction of PET and P: negative trends of PET
    (-1.6 to -0.6 mm yr−1, Fig. S8) coupled with positive trends of P (1.6–8.0 mm
    yr−1). In particular, positive trends of AET (0.6–1.3 mm yr−1) were observed in
    TRW, LNPRW, SFERW, and CCW, which were driven by an increase in P (1.6–3.9 mm
    yr−1). In contrast, negative AET trends were found in BCW (-0.5 mm yr−1) and CRW
    (-0.4 mm yr−1) due to substantial declines in PET (-1.4 and -1.6 mm yr−1), which
    were approximately 2–3 times greater than those observed in the other four watersheds,
    ranging from -0.8 to -0.4 mm yr−1. Fig. 6 Trends in AET, precipitation, and discharge
    for each watershed from 1992 to 2020. (a) TRW, (b) LNPRW, (c) BCW, (d) SFERW,
    (e) CCW, and (f) CRW. Trends (slopes) are calculated at the p < 0.05 probability
    level according to the Student’s t test Full size image To identify the primary
    factor driving the trends of AET, regression analyses were conducted by regressing
    AET onto both PET and P (Figs. S9 and S10). Precipitation played a more important
    role in driving AET and its trends in TRW, LNPRW, SFERW, and CCW, explaining 34–51%
    of the variance in AET. Conversely, in BCW and CRW watersheds, PET played a slightly
    more influential role, accounting for 39% and 49% of the variance in AET, respectively,
    slightly higher than P (35% and 46%). These results aligned with the observed
    trends in AET, PET, and P across the six watersheds. Discharge showed positive
    trends, ranging from 2.5 to 8.3 mm yr−1, except for the CCW watershed (-2.9 mm
    yr−1). This decline in the discharge of CCW was attributed to an increasing trend
    in water storage change (3.9 mm yr−1, p = 0.43) (Fig. S11). Furthermore, we evaluated
    the changes in the ratios of AET/P, Q/P, and AET/Q (Fig. S12). Results revealed
    a decrease in AET/P (excluding LNPRW) and an increase in Q/P (excluding CCW) between
    1992 and 2020, ultimately leading to a reduction in AET/Q (excluding CCW). These
    results suggest that P was increasing partitioning into Q rather than AET, although
    the observed trends in these ratios were not statistically significant. 3.3 Performance
    Evaluation Using the Budyko Framework To evaluate the performance of SC.HAWQS
    simulating key hydrologic variables, we employed the theoretical Budyko curve
    as a reference. The annual variations in the evaporative index across the six
    watersheds generally followed the theoretical Budyko curve, indicating that SC.HAWQS
    effectively captured the dynamics of PET, AET, and Q variables (Fig. 7a-f). However,
    deviations were observed in four watersheds (LNPRW, SFERW, CCW, and CRW), with
    lower AET than anticipated under the same aridity index in the theoretical Budyko
    curve. Several factors may contribute to these deviations from the theoretical
    Budyko curve. One possible explanation is the missing consideration of groundwater
    gains and losses in the theoretical Budyko curve. For instance, between 1992 and
    2020, the mean groundwater gains from 1992 to 2020 in the TRW and BCW watersheds,
    which matched well with the Budyko curve, were only 4 and 12 mm yr−1, respectively.
    In contrast, the LNPRW, CCW, and CRW showed substantially higher groundwater grains,
    reaching 100–156 mm yr−1. This discrepancy underscores the influence of groundwater
    dynamics on the overall hydrologic balance within these watersheds. Another contributing
    factor could be the overestimation of PET, particularly when using the Hargreaves
    method in energy-limited (PET/P < 1) conditions (Su et al. 2022; Zhu et al. 2019).
    This may lead to a systematic bias in PET estimates, affecting the accuracy of
    AET simulations and subsequently influencing the agreement with the Budyko curve.

    are shown in (g-f) Full size image The interannual variations in AET/P were notably
    less pronounced than those observed in PET/P, suggesting that all six watersheds
    had the capacity to adapt AET in response to climatic variability (Fig. 7g-i).
    From 2001 to 2010, all watersheds experienced a transition towards drier conditions,
    characterized by higher AET/P ratios and a decrease in Q compared to the preceding
    decade (1992–2000). In contrast, from 2011 to 2020, the watersheds exhibited a
    trend towards wetter conditions with lower AET/P ratios and an increase in Q.
    These findings further supported our previous conclusion that no statistically
    significant trends in AET, P, and Q were observed from 1992 to 2020. 3.4 Impacts
    On Water Cycle Under a Warming Climate To assess the sensitivity of the water
    cycle to increasing temperatures, simulations were conducted with temperature
    increases ranging from 1 to 4 \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\) while keeping other input
    variables constant (Fig. 8). The TRW watershed was selected as a representative
    case, allowing us to investigate the responses of PET, AET, and discharge (including
    surface runoff, return flow, lateral flow). The selected temperature range aligned
    with climate projections for SC, where annual average temperatures are projected
    to rise by approximately 1.5 to 4.0 \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\) by the end of the twenty-first
    century under various emissions scenarios (Runkle et al. 2022). Fig. 8 Temperature
    sensitivity on the water cycle. (a) Relative changes (%) in PET, AET, discharge,
    surface runoff, return flow, and lateral flow compared with current situations
    (1992–2020). Temperature sensitivity on mean daily (b) PET and (c) AET from April
    to September in TRW watershed. Boxplots show the 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles,
    and extremes. Mean values are shown in black dots and daily data are from 1992
    to 2020 Full size image Our analysis revealed that PET, AET, and discharge showed
    varying sensitivities to temperature increases, with approximate changes of 2.9%,
    1.4%, and -2.7% per \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\), respectively. In SC.HSWQS, the Hargreaves
    method was used for PET estimation, resulting in a PET increase of \\(\\frac{100}{(T+17.8)}\\)
    % per \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\), where T is the mean daily temperature in \\(^\\circ{\\rm
    C}\\). Therefore, the sensitivity of PET to temperature is dependent on T itself,
    decreasing from 3.6% to 2.1% per \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\) as T rises from 10 \\(^\\circ{\\rm
    C}\\) to 30 \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\). As shown in Fig. 8b, PET increased by 2.3–3.0%
    per \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\) from April to September under a warming climate. In
    contrast, AET only exhibited significant increases in April (by 5.4% per \\(^\\circ{\\rm
    C}\\)) and May (by 3.1% per \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\)) and remained relatively stable
    from June to September. This limited response of AET to temperature during the
    summer months suggested that water availability may become a limiting factor under
    these conditions. Furthermore, our analysis showed that surface water flux was
    less sensitive to temperature changes than groundwater flux, with baseflow showing
    the highest sensitivity (3.7% per \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\)), followed by lateral
    flow (1.3% per \\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\)) and surface runoff (1.1% per \\(^\\circ{\\rm
    C}\\)). The observed influence on groundwater flux was more pronounced and could
    be attributed to the direct effect of AET on available soil moisture. As AET increases
    with temperature, soil moisture content decreases, leading to reduced long-term
    groundwater recharge. This reduction in groundwater recharge, in turn, affects
    baseflow contributions to streamflow, with potential implications for long-term
    water resource availability. Furthermore, the reduced soil moisture facilitates
    greater infiltration during rainfall events, resulting in decreased surface runoff
    and affecting the timing and magnitude of peak flows in rivers. 4 Discussion The
    temporal dynamics of water balance in the studied South Carolina watersheds were
    elucidated through the seasonal cycle of AET, P, and Q. We found that both AET
    and P reached their peaks in June, but Q showed lower values during the summer
    and fall (June to November) and higher values during the winter and spring (December
    to May). This inverse relationship between P and Q patterns highlighted the critical
    role of subsurface hydrologic processes, particularly baseflow contributions,
    in regulating streamflow dynamics across the six watersheds. As such, it is essential
    for water resources management strategies to consider the preservation and sustainable
    management of groundwater resources, especially in regions where baseflow significantly
    contributes to streamflow. Long-term trend analysis of AET, P, and Q can help
    identify potential shifts or variations in water cycle components. Although we
    did not find statistically significant trends in these components, indicating
    overall stability in the water cycle, it was important to interpret the positive
    and negative trends. These trends were determined by the interplay of PET and
    P. Notably, we observed positive trends in most watersheds, primarily driven by
    increasing P. The PET method calculated in this study (i.e., the Hargreaves method)
    was temperature-based. Therefore, our findings suggested that there was more of
    an apparent effect of precipitation rather than the effect of temperature on the
    trend in AET. Moreover, the analysis of AET/P, Q/P, and AET/Q further elucidated
    how precipitation was partitioned within the hydrologic system. A decrease in
    AET/P (excluding LNPRW) and an increase in Q/P (excluding CCW) were observed from
    1992 and 2020. These shifts suggested a partitioning of precipitation into Q rather
    than AET during the study period, although these trends were not statistically
    significant. The Budyko curve evaluated long-term water and energy balances in
    the studied watersheds. The deviations (year to year) provided insight into the
    resilience of water yield to climate change. Here, we demonstrated that watersheds
    with substantial groundwater gains exhibited an underestimation of AET/P when
    compared to the theoretical Budyko curve. This discrepancy highlighted the need
    to account for groundwater dynamics when interpreting Budyko curve results, especially
    in regions where groundwater dynamics played a significant role in influencing
    the water balance. Another factor contributing to the deviations from the Budyko
    curve is the method used for estimating PET. Our study utilized the Hargreaves
    method for PET estimation, which has been reported to overestimate PET in humid
    climates (Sepaskhah and Razzaghi 2009; Su et al. 2022; Tabari and Talaee 2011;
    Zhu et al. 2019). This overestimation can significantly impact the accuracy of
    hydrologic modeling outcomes. Hence, Pimentel et al. (2023) suggested using different
    PET methods across various climatic regimes. As temperatures continue to rise
    in a changing climate, understanding these dynamics becomes increasingly crucial,
    given its high sensitivity to temperature increases. Therefore, further research
    is required to analyze uncertainties in hydrologic modeling arising from PET method
    selection. The varying sensitivity of different discharge components (i.e., surface
    runoff, baseflow, and lateral flow) to temperature changes revealed the intricate
    interplay between temperature, soil moisture, and groundwater dynamics. The pronounced
    sensitivity of baseflow to temperature underscores the potential implications
    of rising temperatures on groundwater declines and their subsequent impact on
    streamflow regimes. In the current SC.HAWQS platform, we have calibrated six watersheds
    using existing gauges in SC. Our future efforts will focus on extending this calibration
    to cover all the gauges in SC. In cases where no gauges are available, machine
    learning techniques will be used to estimate calibration parameters based on similar
    watershed characteristics as an initial approximation. Once this comprehensive
    calibration is achieved, SC.HAWQS will be readily applicable as a baseline model
    without the need for calibration prior to scenario runs. Furthermore, climate
    projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 6) could be
    incorporated into the SC.HAWQS platform to enhance its support for climate change
    analysis. 5 Conclusions By reducing the time and cost associated with setting
    up and calibration, SC.HAWQS offers a user-friendly web-based decision support
    system, making it accessible to hydrologic and water quality researchers, managers,
    and policymakers. We employed this platform to evaluate the water cycle dynamics
    and the impact of climate variability on hydrologic processes in six calibrated
    watersheds in South Carolina, United States. Our findings highlight the critical
    role of subsurface hydrologic processes, particularly baseflow contributions,
    in governing seasonal streamflow dynamics. Long-term (1992–2020) trend analyses
    of AET, P, and Q revealed overall stability in the water cycle. While no statistically
    significant trends were observed, positive trends in most watersheds were primarily
    driven by increasing precipitation, with its effect outweighing that of temperature.
    The partitioning of precipitation was found to shift slightly toward Q other than
    AET, albeit statistically insignificant. Our investigation of the Budyko curve
    emphasized the need to consider groundwater dynamics when interpreting water balance
    results, particularly in regions where groundwater significantly influences the
    hydrologic system. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrated the varying sensitivities
    of different discharge components to temperature changes, highlighting the complex
    interplay between temperature, soil moisture, and groundwater dynamics. The pronounced
    sensitivity of baseflow to temperature emphasized the potential implications of
    rising temperatures on groundwater declines and their subsequent impact on streamflow
    regimes. Data Availability The data used in this study can be accessed and downloaded

  description: This paper focuses on developing a water and energy-saving reliable
    irrigation system using state-of-the-art computing, communication, and optimal
    energy management framework. The framework integrates real-time soil moisture
    and weather forecasting information to decide the time of irrigation and quantity
    of water required for potato crops, which is made available to the users across
    a region through the cloud-based irrigation decision support system. This is accomplished
    through various modules such as data acquisition, soil moisture forecasting, smart
    irrigation scheduling, and energy management scheme. The main emphasizes is on
    the electrical segment which demonstrates an energy management scheme for PV-battery
    based grid-connected system to operate the irrigation system valves and water
    pump. The proposed scheme is verified through simulation and dSpace-based real-time
    experiment studies. Overall, the proposed energy management system demonstrates

    paper focuses on developing a water and energy-saving reliable irrigation system
    using state-of-the-art computing, communication, and optimal energy management
    framework. The framework integrates real-time soil moisture and weather forecasting
    information to decide the time of irrigation and quantity of water required for
    potato crops, which is made available to the users across a region through the
    cloud-based irrigation decision support system. This is accomplished through various
    modules such as data acquisition, soil moisture forecasting, smart irrigation
    scheduling, and energy management scheme. The main emphasizes is on the electrical
    segment which demonstrates an energy management scheme for PV-battery based grid-connected
    system to operate the irrigation system valves and water pump. The proposed scheme
    is verified through simulation and dSpace-based real-time experiment studies.
    Overall, the proposed energy management system demonstrates an improvement in
    the optimal onsite solar power generation and storage capacity to power the solar
    pump which save the electrical energy as well as the water in order to establish
    an improved solar-irrigation system. Finally, the proposed system achieved water
    and energy savings of around 9.24 % for potato crop with full irrigation enhancing
    the Water-Energy-Food Nexus at field scale. Previous article in issue Next article

    the globe demands more food production. However, the changing climate causes declining
    water availability and thus leading to the water and energy shortages across all
    the sectors including mainly the agriculture [1]. To maintain the current per
    capita supply, the food production needs to be increased by around 50 % in the
    next 50 years to feed the rising population, which further intensifies the demand
    for water and energy [2]. In this scenario, any poor agricultural practices will
    further intensify the negative effects, leading to more vulnerable situations.
    While the accessibility to surface water resources is limited, groundwater contribution
    is a major source of irrigation. Nearly two-third (64 %) of irrigated agriculture
    in India depends on groundwater sources, which is depleting at an alarming rate
    due to inefficient irrigation management and unreliable power supply [3]. Consequently,
    about 30 % of the aquifers are in a critical state, threatening the sustainability
    of groundwater utilization [4]. The urgency of this water-energy nexus investigation
    stems from the shortage of water and energy, a phenomenon that is intensifying
    recently both in India and across the world. Irrigation efficiency has direct
    implications on the nexus between water usage and power consumption. According
    to the organization for economic co-operation and development''s environmental
    outlook 2050, Indian agriculture would face severe water constraints/shortages
    in the next thirty years [5]. Supplying precise amount of irrigation water (i.e.,
    right quantity at the right time) not only saves water used for irrigation but
    also protects the groundwater resources and further reduces power consumption
    used for pumping. For this endeavor, solar water pumps could be a viable alternative
    for both optimal irrigation and energy from the utility grid [6]. Irrigation scheduling
    can be categorized into plant-based-, soil moisture based-, and weather-based
    approach [7]. In the existing literature most of the automatic irrigation and
    monitoring systems are typically based on soil moisture approach, often integrated
    with weather parameters (e.g. rainfall) [8]. There are a variety of water-saving
    techniques for diverse crops, ranging from the most basic to the most technologically
    advanced. Notably, a remote canopy temperature-based approach employed infrared
    thermometers to automate the cotton crop irrigation, the automatic irrigation
    system activated by canopy temperature threshold [9]. Similarly, implementing
    an evapotranspiration (ET) based automatic irrigation scheduling system to compute
    the crop irrigation requirement and time of water application achieved up to 42
    % water saving [10]. Innovative strategies, such as soil sensors and evaporimeters
    are used to further reduce/adjust the irrigation based on the daily weather or
    substrate moisture content fluctuations [11]. Advancements in wireless sensor
    networks (WSN) have facilitated irrigation machinery control. Multiple studies
    have explored WSNs to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and illumination to maintain optimal conditions for crop growth [12,13].
    A novel irrigation scheduling system was developed in Ref. [14] to plan for more
    accurate water allocation using earth observation data, weather forecasts, and
    numerical simulations. To overcoming the challenges in WSN systems, recent advancements
    in microelectronics and wireless technologies generated low-cost, low-power components,
    power-aware protocols, task management, and communication solutions [15,13] are
    useful. Since the groundwater based irrigated agriculture contributes major share
    of total agricultural products, approximately 31.8 million pumps have been installed,
    which are being operated by grid power and diesel engines [16]. Recently, the
    solar powered water pumping systems have gained significant attention [17,18],
    which can be off-grid or grid connected. The solar based pumping mainly helps
    in effective utilization of grid power, effective use of sensors, to achieve high
    efficiency in the power electronic conversion modules, and thus to reduce the
    loading on utility grid. Several research papers have discussed the performance
    improvement of solar pumps in terms of battery storage [19], environmental impact
    assessment [20], comparison of DC and AC motors [21], comparing the pumps such
    as centrifugal, submersible and displacement pumps [22]. Further, solar water
    pumping system with water storage tank was introduced to address the reliability
    and life cycle cost issues [23]. Based on the literature review presented, it
    was noted that the integration of both water and energy management still needs
    further improvements especially at field scale. Therefore, the paper proposes
    an energy management scheme to maximize the utilization of photovoltaic (PV) capacity
    and ensure the power supply security during overcast conditions. The goal of the
    study is to demonstrate that automated irrigation system reduces water and power
    consumption for enhancing the Water-Energy-Food nexus at field scale. This was
    achieved adopting the following tasks a) to develop wireless sensor network (WSN)
    nodes to measure soil moisture and local weather and cloud-based irrigation decision
    support system using the Internet of Things (IoT), b) to develop an onsite optimal
    energy management strategy to operate the solar-powered automated irrigation system,
    c) to implement a well-structured integration of all the sources and loads (pump),
    d) to demonstrate the interconnected system for irrigation experimentally, and
    e) to apply the energy management and control systems for improving irrigation
    in more economical and energy-efficient way. Fig. 1 illustrates the overall integration
    of the water and energy-efficient reliable irrigation system (WatEr-ERIS). Download

    Water and energy-efficient reliable irrigation system (WatEr-ERIS). The WatEr-ERIS
    encompasses an array of modules which are explained in detail in the subsequent
    sections. The main focus of this paper includes: • A rule-based energy management
    and control schemes for a grid connected solar water pumping system for water
    and energy-efficient reliable irrigation system. • The seamless operation of the
    Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPMSM) drive is reported with Battery,
    PV on grid-connected mode or island mode based on energy management scheme. •
    A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) operation for PV is achieved along with
    the DC-link voltage regulation. • The abnormal condition of grid performance is
    also analyzed with voltage sag and swell scenarios. The paper is arranged in the
    following manner. The realization of the proposed work is given in Section 2.
    Section 3 elaborates various modules to achieve automated irrigation system. The
    proposed energy management scheme is explained in Section 4. The discussion over
    experimental results is made in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the paper.
    2. Realization of proposed system The proposed study focuses on the rural areas
    (Kataula, Salgi etc.) of Mandi District, Himachal Pradesh, India, where significant
    water shortage is affecting mainly groundwater irrigation. The open-source satellite
    products are updated on a daily basis, and field observed meteorological parameters
    are used to forecast the local weather for 5–7 days lead period and store it in
    the cloud [24]. The soil moisture and temperature sensors along with Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices, are used to transmit the data to the cloud. The cloud
    provides crop-specific irrigation information to the users along with other weather
    parameters such as rainfall, solar irradiation, temperature, and soil moisture
    level. The pump can be operated through mobile apps to irrigate, irrespective
    of power supply from the grid is available or not. During the power shutdown,
    pumps are operated from the onsite power backups, which are recharged by the solar
    PV system. The integration of all the entities such as PMSM drive, PV, and energy
    storage system are achieved with help of power electronics converters. Based on
    the power conversion stage, converters can be classified as single-stage and two-stage
    topologies. In power electronics, there exist a major challenge to establish a
    regulation of desired voltage or current and hence the configuration must be chosen
    carefully. For this purpose, a two-stage power electronics topology typically
    consisting of two converters in the overall power conversion process is chosen.
    The key advantage of the two-stage topology is that it requires the small capacitance
    size for strict voltage regulation and achieving in better maximum power point
    tracking capability. In a two-stage topology, the voltage regulation is excellent
    as compared to the single-stage converter topology. Several converters are used
    to accomplish the objective. A front-end DC-DC boost converter is interfaced between
    the PV panel and DC link. For PV application, two-stage configuration also provides
    the MPPT efficiency and system dependability. Another DC-DC bi-directional converter
    is connected to battery. In combined, both circuitry makes it a two-stage DC-DC
    converter. Here, first DC-DC converter is used for extracting maximum power and
    the second converter is used for maintaining the constant DC link voltage [[25],
    [26], [27]]. To extract the maximum power from the PV, the perturb and observation
    (P&O) algorithm is used. Another, two-stage configuration is used for interconnection
    of PMSM drive and the AC grid. In this, front-end single phase voltage source
    inverter (VSC) connects AC grid to the common DC link. Whereas another three phase
    VSC is used to connect PMSM drive with DC link. In order to control the speed
    of the PMSM, a hysteresis current controller is used. The performance is analyzed
    with different operating conditions such as motoring and regenerative braking
    condition. The more details about the power stage of the converters are elaborated
    in section 5 which is an experimental part of this study. 3. Automated irrigation

    [28]. A weather station is installed on the campus, connected to the LoRa gateway,

    of soil moisture measurement. 3.2. Module 2: short-range soil moisture forecasting
    Module 1 provides the information of the soil moisture and weather information
    measured at the field. In Module 2, a machine learning based long short-term memory
    (LSTM) model was developed to forecast the soil moisture (SM). LSTM is a robust
    model in forecasting the sequential timeseries information by accounting vanishing
    gradient problem. For scheduling the irrigation, 5 days ahead prediction of the
    soil moisture content is required. Accordingly, the SM was forecasted for up to
    5 days ahead including the 1 and 3 days ahead forecasting. The input variables
    for the LSTM model consists of meteorological parameters such as rainfall [P]
    (mm), temperature [T] (oC), relative humidity [H] (%), wind speed [W] (kmph),
    dew point [D] (oC) along with soil moisture measured using field sensors. The
    summary statistics of selected input variables for modelling is presented in Table
    1. Based on the cross, and auto correlation the most significant inputs were identified
    correspondingly to current time (t) and different lagged time (up to t-2). The
    final input model structure was fixed and the outputs are the soil moisture corresponding
    to the required forecast lead (t+1, t+3 and t+5). Table 1. Summary statistics

    between different input variables also with output (soil moisture at time ‘t’).
    It is clear that despite different levels of correlation estimated among the input
    variables, the overall correlation with output variable varied between −0.125
    and 0.2907. Unlike other hydrological variables such as surface runoff, evapotranspiration,
    the correlation was not very strong in the case of soil moisture corresponds to
    weather parameters. However, the influence of weather parameters on the soil moisture
    cannot be ignored so as to allow the LSTM model to train with diverse sets of
    inputs capturing the underlying physics of the system. Download : Download high-res

    of input and output variables. The model is constructed using single layer LSTM
    cells with 32 units connected to 4 layers of fully connected neural networks.
    The LSTM model is optimized using Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) with mean
    squared error as the loss function. The model is trained and tested to forecast
    SM 5-days ahead (SMt+5). To achieve better accuracy, the 5-days ahead rainfall
    forecast collected from block level India Meteorological Department forecast was
    used. The observed hourly data of the weather information and soil moisture from
    December 2021 to April 2022 was used to develop the SM forecast module. The model
    was trained optimizing the 5697 parameters (weights and biases) with the hyperparameters
    learning rate, 0.001 and batch size of 32. The model performance was assessed
    using Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency index (NSE) for 1-day, 3-day and 5-day ahead forecast.
    Overall a good fit between observed and forecasted was found and the NSE estimated
    are presented in Table 2. As the dynamics of SM was very consistent, the model
    performance was almost similar across all the lead time. Furthermore, the ability
    of LSTM learning sequentially the underline trend of the data allows the model
    performance not to deteriorating even the lead time increases. The testing period
    results of 5 days ahead SM forecast is illustrated in Fig. 5. The results of 1-
    and 3- days ahead forecast are not presented herein for brevity. Further, it is
    confirmed from Table 3 that the statistical estimates (mean, standard deviation
    and skewness) of observed and forecasted soil moisture closely matches with each
    other across all the lead time (1- day, 3-day and 5-day). Table 2. Performance

    Module 3: smart irrigation scheduling All the data received from Module 2 helps
    calculate the actual crop water requirement (CWR). In this study, the CROPWAT
    8.0 simulation platform has been used to calculate the net CWR. The CROPWAT 8.0
    utilizes weather data including rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and
    wind speed, crop data, and soil data in order to evaluate CWR [29]. Here, weather
    data is taken from the automatic weather station installed near the experimental
    field. According to crop water requirements, the decision support scheme turns
    ON/OFF the motor. The process to check the status of water requirement is given
    in Fig. 6. The amount of net irrigation required by the crop is a very important
    aspect. To achieve this Module 3 processes and computes the net irrigation. The
    computed irrigation required, and the water supplied by the pump and reservoir
    together are represented as D (liters/hectare) and S (liters/hectare), respectively
    in Fig. 6. The net irrigation depends on various parameters such as field capacity,
    the water level of the reservoir, rainfall status, etc. Download : Download high-res

    of water requirement [D indicates water supplied by pump and reservoir together
    in liters/hectare]. The soil present in the experimental field is silty loam with
    field capacity (FC) of 32 % and wilting point of 12 % (available water 20 %).
    Field capacity is defined as water retained in the field due to molecular attraction
    and by loose chemical bonds after irrigation or rain. The FC can be expresses
    as eq. (1). Allowable depletion is 80 % of available water (i.e. irrigation water
    is applied when the soil moisture goes below 16 % to bring back to 32 %). The
    effective root zone depth is measured as 47 cm. The depth of water (d) stored
    in the root zone is calculated using eq. (2) [30] and is comes out to be 11.3
    cm. (1) (2) where, and are the density of dry soil and water, respectively. The
    values of and taken from the field are 14.78 KN/m3 and 9.81 KN/m3, respectively.
    Considering the irrigation efficiency of 80 %, volume of water stored in the root
    zone is 33.9 m3 (field size is 20 m × 15 m) and volume of water pumped/supplied
    from the source is 42.375 m3. The data for decadal crop water requirement for
    potato, effective rainfall, soil water availability are presented in Table 4.
    It can be noticed that for crop periods, November to March, two-time irrigation
    is required. Therefore, total volume of water supplied for the experimental field
    is 84.75 m3 (equivalent to 2825 m3/ha). However, conventional irrigation requirement
    is calculated as 3086.25 m3/ha based on the flood irrigation method and potential
    evapotranspiration requirement of the crop for the field location [31]. Here,
    water saving achieved is around 261.25 m3/ha (9.24 %) under no water stress condition.
    With pump discharge rate of 0.03 m3/Sec, the total time to run the pump is calculated
    as 84.75/0.03 = 2825 Sec or 0.78 h. At last, the total energy consumed is computed
    in eq. (3) (3) Total energy Consumed = 3.7 kW × 0.78/0.9 = 3.2 kWh Table 4. Irrigation

    irrigation requires around 26.15 h of pumping which consume about 96.80 kWh of
    energy, whereas conventional irrigation requires around 28.57 h of pumping which
    consume 105.7 kWh of energy. Compared conventional irrigation, soil moisture-based
    irrigation saved around 8.9 kWh. 3.4. Module 4: energy management scheme The energy
    management scheme (EMS) is initiated with reference to the inputs received from
    the forecasting and crop simulation models, which deal with soil moisture forecasting,
    growth prediction, genetic features of specific cultivar, environmental variables
    and management practices etc. If solar powered automated irrigation system is
    not adequately managed and operated, it may lead to wasteful energy and water
    use. Hence, an EMS is proposed and a detailed discussion is presented in the next
    section. 4. Proposed energy management scheme Irrigation can be improved in a
    more cost-effective and energy-efficient manner with well-implemented energy management
    and control systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a rule-based energy management
    and control schemes for a grid connected solar water pumping system. The EMS is
    initiated with reference to the inputs received from the forecasting and crop
    simulation models, which deal with soil moisture forecasting, growth prediction,
    genetic features of specific cultivar, environmental variables and management
    practices etc. The EMS requires the prior knowledge regarding operational status
    of various entities such as availability of PV power, water level in storage tank,
    state of charge of storage battery and availability of grid by means of placing
    suitable sensors. Estimation of State of Charge (SoC) of battery is an important
    parameter and the estimated SoC decides the operational states of the energy management
    scheme. Finally based on objective function defined, EMS generates the reference
    variables for controllers, that control the power electronic interfacing devices.
    Whole data is transferred to cloud through IoT, which is retrieved by other modules
    and monitored. To achieve this objective, the proposed EMS is implemented on the
    system shown in Fig. 7. The flowchart of proposed EMS is shown in Fig. 8. This
    figure also illustrates various control strategy for different converters. The
    operation is carried out in such a way where, PV side DC-DC boost converter operates
    in the MPPT mode derived using P&O algorithm. The proposed system operates in
    two modes i.e., grid-connected mode and island mode. The working modes of the
    converters are chosen in accordance with the EMS, as indicated in Fig. 8. This
    EMS leads to the definition of distinct cases, which are then carried out and
    confirmed through experimental tests. In the following section, these studies
    are well-explained. Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download : Download

    image Fig. 8. Proposed Energy Management Scheme along with control strategies
    for different converters. When the AC grid is OFF, battery side BI-DI DC-DC converter
    regulates the DC-link voltage. If the irrigation is not required i.e., IPMSM pump
    drive is OFF, the PV power injects into the battery completely. Therefore, the
    battery begins to charge up to its maximum capacity. As the battery is fully charged,
    the PV feeds the power into the grid. Once the sun is not available, then the
    battery provides the energy to the IPMSM drive pump. If the SOC of battery (SOCB)
    is less than 10 %, then grid feeds power to the pump. The grid assumes control
    of the DC link voltage as soon as it is connected and regulates it to the required
    value. In this instance, the system contains both a PV and an AC grid, and the
    PV supplies electricity to the AC grid. The whole process ensures the maintenance
    of power flow. So that maximum power of PV is utilized completely. The pump operates
    in its optimal condition. According to water requirements, the motor operates
    at different speeds. Here, a dual loop control (inner current loop and outer voltage
    loop) is used. When PV current (iPV) is more than the required current, the DC-link
    voltage (VDC) is greater than the reference voltage (Vref), and both the voltages
    are compared, and error is fed to the PI controller. At this time, the outer voltage
    controller generates the negative reference current. The actual battery current
    (Ib) is compared to the generated reference current (Ibref), and again, error
    is fed to the PI controller that generates the pulses for the respective switches.
    Another PI controller is used for control the speed of IPMSM. Fig. 8 illustrates
    the control strategies on the individual converters. 5. Experimental study The
    experimental prototype of the grid integrated solar PV array and battery fed IPMSM
    drive is developed in the laboratory as in Fig. 9. Here, the IPMSM motor emulates
    a water pumping system for irrigation. In the power stage, a PV, battery, and
    AC grid utility are used as active sources and IPMSM motor is used as pump load.
    The 3.7 kW IPMSM (JD engineering works) is coupled with the DC machine and connected
    to DC link through IGBT based VSC (Semikron converters). To emulate solar PV,
    a TerraSAS photovoltaic simulator (EGAR) is utilized. In the control unit, a digital
    controller dSPACE-1104 is used to operate the system in real-time. To acquire
    the voltage and current data, the hall effect voltage and the current sensors
    are used, respectively. The parameters selected for experimental study are given
    in Table 5. The different cases have been studied which are as follows. Download

    performance is tested at different solar irradiance. At 1200 W/m2 and 200 W/m2
    (at 25 °C constant temperature), the PV current and voltage are the 3.9 A and
    110 V, and 0.4 A and 102 V, respectively. In this case, the pump load is not connected
    hence, the PV feeds the power to the battery. The tracking efficiency of MPPT
    achieved is 98 %–99 %. The experimental results for this case are shown in Fig.
    10. It can be observed that at t1, t2, t3, and t4, when solar irradiance decreases,
    the power is delivered to battery is also decreases. But the DC-link voltage (VDC)
    remains regulated. Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download : Download

    solar irradiance. (i.e., PVON, battery = ON, pump = OFF, AC grid = OFF). 5.2.
    Case 2: PV with AC grid utility This case occurs when the battery is charged completely
    then the PV power is transferred to the AC grid utility. At this time, the grid
    maintains the VDC. Since the reference is zero before the grid is ON, PV current
    iPV begin to increase, hence, the grid reference current Igref also increases
    to maintain the constant DC-link voltage. Fig. 11 illustrates the results for
    this case. In Fig. 11(a), it can be seen that at t5, as the solar irradiance change
    from 800 W/m2 to 1200 W/m2, the iPV also increases from 3.2 A to 4.8 A. Hence,
    the ig also increases up to some level. Similarly, the effect of iPV and ig under
    decrement in solar irradiance form 1200 W/m2 to 800 W/m2 at t6 is shown in Fig.
    11(b). The transients during turning ON of PV while grid is ON can be seen in
    Fig. 12. Here, the PV (solar irradiance: 1000 W/m2) is turned ON at t7 and delivers
    the power to the AC grid. In this mode, the ig is out of phase from Vg. Download

    2: Transient during turning ON of PV. 5.3. Case 3: pump load with AC grid This
    case represents a scenario when solar power is not available (i.e., PV is OFF),
    the battery is fully discharged and the pump (IPMSM) requires the power to run.
    At this time the AC grid feed the power to the IPMSM. The transient and steady-state
    behavior of IPMSM is shown in Fig. 13. At t8, IMPSM gets turned ON and start to
    run and then settle at 400 RPM. The peak value of grid current (ig) and motor
    stator phase current (istator) are 2 A and 2.5 A, respectively. Download : Download

    during AC grid feeds power to IPMSM. (i.e., PVOFF, battery = OFF, pump = ON, AC
    grid = ON). The AC grid performance is observed at Vg = 120 V (RMS). At t9, the
    speed has been changed to 1000 RPM. During this time, ig and istator are 9 A and
    9 A, respectively. 5.4. Case 4: pump load with PV and AC grid In this case, the
    PV and AC grid both feed the power to the IPMSM. Fig. 14 illustrates the PV, AC
    grid and IPMSM performances for this case. Solar irradiance is kept constant throughout
    i.e., 400 W/m2. Initially PV and AC grid both present in the system till t10.
    During this time, PV feeds power to the AC grid and it can be seen through section
    Z5. Here, ig and Vg both are out of phase from each other. Later, at t10 the IPMSM
    is connected and begin to run then reaches to 500 RPM in steady-state. In steady-state,
    the VPV, iPV and ig are 107 V, 2 A and −0.5 A, respectively. After some time,
    at t11, the speed of IPMSM is increased up to 1000 RPM. This increment in the
    speed requires extra power than PV. Therefore, AC grid start to deliver power
    and feed to IPMSM. A change in ig can be seen in zoomed version Z6. Here, ig is
    changed from −0.5 A to 6.5 A when speed changes from 500 to 1000 RPM. Download

    Case 4: Performance during PV and AC grid feed power to IMPSM. (i.e., PVON, battery
    = OFF, pump = ON, AC grid = ON). 5.5. Case 5: pump load with battery A situation
    can be arisen when both PV and AC grid is not available and irrigation is needed.
    At this time, battery feeds the power to IPMSM. The steady state performances
    of battery and IPMSM at 500 RPM and 800 RPM, respectively are illustrated in Fig.
    15(a) and (b). At t12, it can be observed that as the motor speed increases from
    500 to 800 RPM, the battery current ibat also rises from 3.5A to 8 A. Download

    (i.e., PVOFF, AC grid = OFF, battery = ON, pump = ON). 6. Conclusion An energy
    management scheme is proposed for PV-battery based grid-connected system to drive
    the water pump. This helps to make water and energy-saving reliable irrigation
    system. The proposed scheme is based on data such as rainfall, solar irradiation,
    temperature, and soil moisture level. These aforesaid data are used to operate
    solar pump based on availability of the power sources such as PV, battery and
    AC grid utility. In this paper, various real-time scenario such as PV with battery,
    PV with grid, water pump with AC grid, both PV and AC grid with water pump, and
    battery with water pump have been implemented experimentally. Hence, the optimal
    operation of pump and harvesting maximum power from PV along with the power injection
    into AC grid if needed, have assured the water and energy-saving during irrigation.
    The results show that around 9.24 % of water and energy saving is achieved with
    the proposed irrigation system for potato crop with full irrigation. However,
    extensive studies are required to explore more water and energy saving possibilities
    for different crops under different levels of deficit irrigation. Ethical standards
    The research meets all ethical guidelines, including adherence to the legal requirements
    of the study country. Data availability The data used will be shared upon the

  description: The availability of accurate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) data
    is crucial for developing decision support systems for optimal water resource
    management. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of three empirical models
    (Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestly-Taylor (PT), and Turc (TU)) and three machine
    learning models (Multiple linear regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial
    Neural Network (NN)) in estimating daily ETo compared to the Penman-Monteith FAO-56
    (PM) model. Long-term data from 42 weather stations in Florida were used. Moreover,
    the effect of ETo model selection on sweet corn irrigation water use was investigated
    by integrating simulated ETo data from empirical and ML models using the Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model at two locations (Citra
    and Homestead) in Florida. Furthermore, a linear bias correction calibration technique
    was employed to improve the performance of empirical models. Results were consistent
    in that the NN and RF models outperformed the empirical models. The empirical
    models tended to underestimate and overestimate small and high daily ETo values,
    respectively, with the HS model exhibiting the least accuracy. However, calibrated
    PT and TU models performed comparably to the ML models. Results also revealed
    that using an inappropriate ETo model could lead to over-irrigation by up to 54
    mm during a single crop season. Overall, ML models have proven reliable alternatives
    to the PM model, especially in regions with access to long-term data due to their
    site-independent performance. In areas without long-term data for ML model training
    and testing, calibrating empirical models is viable, but site-specific calibration
    is needed. It is important to highlight that distinct plant species exhibit varying
    transpiration characteristics and, consequently, have different water requirements.
    These differences play a pivotal role in shaping the overall impact of ETo models
    on crop water use.

    1. Introduction Evapotranspiration (ET) is the combined loss of water through
    evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) in the form of vapor and plays an essential
    role in linking water, energy, and carbon cycles in the land and the atmosphere
    (Fisher et al., 2008; Wang and Dickinson, 2012). Roughly two-thirds of terrestrial
    precipitation is returned to the atmosphere from the earth''s surfaces through
    ET (Oki and Kanae, 2006). Accurate measurement or estimation of ET is critical
    to understand fundamental hydrological processes at different scales and developing
    models and decision support tools that allow optimal use of water resources (Tang
    et al., 2018). Currently, ET measuring approaches include the use of lysimeters
    (Guo et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022), eddy covariance methods
    (Yang and Lei, 2022), and Bowen ratio (Bowen, 1926). However, these methods are
    time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, making measuring actual ET challenging
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011). Therefore, most water management
    decisions, such as irrigation scheduling and hydrologic modeling, rely on estimated
    reference ET (ETo) using models (Courault et al., 2005; Farahani et al., 2007).
    The earliest ETo modeling approaches primarily relied on temperature measurements
    (Farahani et al., 2007). The most widely used method for estimating reference
    ETo is the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) method (Allen et al., 1998). The PM model
    allows the calculation of ETo from weather inputs. Crop ET (ETc) is then estimated
    based on reference ETo and crop coefficient (Kc) values. This approach is widely
    used for irrigation scheduling and hydrologic modeling (Thorp et al., 2020). The
    FAO-56 PM method is recommended as the standard ETo model by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) (Allen et al.,
    1998; Vishwakarma et al., 2022). However, the FAO-56 model is data intensive,
    requiring multiple input parameters, including solar radiation, air temperature,
    relative humidity, and wind speed, making its broader applications challenging
    (Subedi and Chávez, 2015). As a result, alternative methods with fewer data requirements,
    including Blaney-Criddle (Blaney and Criddle, 1962), Thornthwaite (Thornthwaite,
    1948), Makkink (Makkink, 1957), Turc (Turc, 1961), Priestley Taylor (Priestley
    and Taylor, 1972), Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985), have been developed.
    The Thornthwaite, Makkink, and Priestley Taylor models were proposed for humid
    climate conditions, while Hargreaves and Blaney Criddle methods were recommended
    for arid and semi-arid climates of the United States. However, the accuracy and
    reliability of all these models are affected by several factors and vary from
    region to region. As a result, ETo models need to be evaluated for their reliability
    under different climate, weather, and environmental conditions (Kang et al., 2009a,
    Kang et al., 2009b). Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have made
    it possible to estimate ETo accurately using machine learning (ML) models such
    as linear regression (R), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (NN)
    (Agrawal et al., 2022; Antonopoulos and Antonopoulos, 2017; Pirvali Beiranvand
    and Ghamghami, 2022; Küçüktopcu et al., 2023; Makwana et al., 2023; Peng et al.,
    2017; Shu et al., 2022). Studies have shown that RF is a robust method for estimating
    ET with high accuracy (da Silva Júnior et al., 2019; Douna et al., 2021; Wang
    et al., 2019), while NN has been found to perform better than other methods such
    as Priestley and Taylor and Hargreaves (Antonopoulos and Antonopoulos, 2017; Heramb
    et al., 2023; Makwana et al., 2023). However, the accuracy of ML models can be
    affected by the climatic region of the study area (Wang et al., 2019). Furthermore,
    advanced ML models like NN require expertise and a rigorous selection of parameters
    to achieve optimal performance. Within crop growth simulation and hydrologic models,
    ETo is calculated in the backend using limited ET model options. Therefore, it
    is crucial to investigate the accuracy of the ETo modeling approach used to minimize
    error propagation and bias from the ETo model to crop simulation and hydrologic
    models. This study integrated the ML ETo models into the DSSAT CSM (Decision Support
    System for Agrotechnology Transfer Cropping System Model) model by modifying the
    DSSAT''s source code. The aim of this study was twofold: first, to investigate
    the performance of three empirical [Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestly-Taylor (PT),
    and Turc (TU)] and three machine learning (ML) [Multiple linear regression (LR),
    Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (NN)] models in estimating daily
    ETo compared to the FAO-56 PM model; and second, to evaluate how the choice of
    ETo model affects irrigation scheduling and sweet corn irrigation water use using
    the DSSAT CSM. The three empirical and machine learning (ML) ETo models were chosen
    for their efficiency in estimating ETo, requiring comparatively minimal data input.
    This selection is grounded in established literature demonstrating their effectiveness
    in estimating reference ETo across diverse geographic regions. 2. Research methods
    2.1. Study area and data This study covered 42 weather stations distributed across
    Florida, USA (Fig. 1). Florida is a low-lying peninsula with a diverse topography.
    It has infertile sandy and loamy soils (Harris et al., 2010). The state holds
    significant aquifers, including the Floridan and Biscayne Aquifers, which contain
    abundant water (https://www.sfwmd.gov/science-data/gw-modeling). Florida''s climate
    is characterized by a humid subtropical zone in most of the state and a tropical
    savanna region in the southernmost part. Florida experiences a range of temperatures
    throughout the year (Florida Climate Center, 2022). In January, temperatures vary
    between 10 and 15.6 °C. In the hottest month, typically July and sometimes August,
    average temperatures hover around 27.2–28.3 °F across the state. On average, Florida
    receives more than 1300 mm of rainfall annually (Zhang et al., 2017). However,
    Florida weather stations experience considerable annual and monthly precipitation
    variations. Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Spatial distribution of FAWN weather stations in Florida and location
    of the two stations (Citra and Homestead) used for irrigation scheduling study.
    This study uses 42 weather stations that are distributed throughout Florida as
    part of the Florida Automated Weather Network (FAWN), established by the University
    of Florida (https://fawn.ifas.ufl.edu) (Fig. 1). The FAWN website offers both
    real-time and historical weather data, which are freely available for the public.
    The website provides weather data every 15 min, ensuring up-to-date information
    is accessible to users at no cost. The study used 213,650 observations from 2003
    to 2020. Calculated ETo using the FAO-56 PM model was considered as observed ETo
    due to the lack of measured data. The PM model is considered the gold standard
    model by FAO and is one of the most widely used approaches in crop simulation
    and hydrologic models (Allen et al., 1998; Vishwakarma et al., 2022). 2.2. Empirical
    modeling Daily data used in this study includes precipitation, minimum temperature
    (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), average wind speed (Ws), average dew point
    (Tdew), solar radiation (Rs), and average relative humidity (RH). Data from all
    weather stations were combined and checked for quality, such as missing values
    and outliers. Wind speed was measured at 10 m height, and 2 m wind speed values
    were estimated using the equation (Eq. 1) by Allen et al. (1998). (1) where u2
    and uz are calculated and measured wind speed at 2 and z m above ground, respectively;
    z is the height at which wind speed was measured. Days with outliers or missing
    values are not included in the analysis. The outliers were identified by calculating
    the standard deviation and discarding all data points with values more than three
    standard deviations from the mean. Such values were regarded as outliers and removed
    from further analysis. Once daily data is cleaned and checked for quality, daily
    ETo was calculated using three empirical in addition to the standard FAO-56 Penman–Monteith
    model (PM; Eq. 2). The three additional empirical ETo models include Hargreaves–Samani
    (HS; Eq. 6), Priestley-Taylor (PT; Eq. 8), and Turc (TU; Eq. 9). (2) where ETo
    is the reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), Rn is the net solar radiation
    (MJ m−2 day−1), G is the soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), T is the mean
    daily air temperature at 2 m height (°C), Δ is the slope of the saturated vapor
    pressure curve (kPa °C−1), γ is the psychometric constant (0.066 kPa °C−1), es
    and ea are saturated and actual vapor pressure (kPa), respectively, and u2 is
    the mean daily wind speed (m s−1) at 2 m height. Saturated vapor pressure (es)
    was estimated as follows: (3) The mean saturated vapor pressure (eo) at the air
    temperature T was calculated as: (4) The slope of the saturated vapor pressure
    curve Δ (kPa °C−1) was calculated using Eq. (5). (5) The Hargreaves model was
    calculated as follows (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) (6) where Tav, Tmax, and Tmin
    are average, maximum, and minimum air temperatures (°C), respectively, and Ra
    is the extraterrestrial radiation (MJm−2day−1) estimated using eq. 7. (7) where
    Gsc is the solar constant = 0.0820 MJ m−2 min−1; Dr is the inverse relative distance
    between the Earth and Sun; δ is the solar decimation (rad); φ is the latitude
    (rad); ωs is the sunset angle (rad). The Priestly and Taylor model was implemented
    using Eq. 8 (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) (8) where △ is the slope vapor pressure
    curve (kPa °C −1); Rn is the net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m −2 day −1);
    G is the soil heat flux density (MJ m −2 day −1), and it was assumed to be 0 based
    on Allen et al. (1998); γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1); The Turc model
    was used to calculate ETo using Eq. 9 (Turc, 1961) (9) where Rs (mm day-1) and
    RH (%),Tav (°C) are solar radiation, relative humidity, and average temperature,
    respectively. WRH is 1 when RH <50% and 0 when RH > 50%. 2.3. Machine learning
    Two traditional machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Multiple
    Linear Regression (LR), and one deep learning algorithm, Artificial Neural Network
    (NN), were compared against the FAO-56 PM in estimating daily ETo. These models
    were selected based on their performance in solving non-linear and complex problems
    and handling big data. 2.3.1. Multiple linear regression Multiple linear regression
    (LR) model is based on a linear relationship between one dependent variable and
    multiple independent variables. The LR model has a general mathematical expression
    as described in Eq. 10. Detailed explanation of LR modeling approach can be found
    in Özbayoğlu and Evren Özbayoğlu (2006). (10) where a and b are coefficients.
    2.3.2. Random Forest Random Forest (RF) is a type of supervised machine learning
    algorithm developed by combining several trees that, in turn, result in a combined
    power of prediction accuracy (Huang et al., 2019). During the construction of
    trees, the algorithm chooses a random variable subset, which was used to estimate
    a variable of interest (da Silva Júnior et al., 2019). Then, the prediction of
    new data will be done by aggregating the predictions made by the trees. The RF
    modeling used 600 trees with the lowest error. A detailed mathematical description
    of RF models can be found in Breiman (2001). 2.3.3. Artificial neural network
    Artificial neural network (NN) is one of the most commonly used deep learning
    models with a wide area of applications (LeCun et al., 2015). The NN model had
    three layers, i.e., input, hidden, and output layers. The input layer consists
    of a single layer with two neurons corresponding to the number of input features
    (Tav and Rs). The hidden layer consists of two hidden layers with five neurons
    each, and the output layer, the last layer of the network, contains one layer
    with one neuron for the estimated ETo. The number of hidden layers and neurons
    in each hidden layer was selected to achieve a well-performing NN algorithm without
    overfitting or underfitting. A hyperparametrization technique was used to determine
    the best batch size (15) and epoch weight (50) for improved model accuracy. 2.3.4.
    Feature selection and model training The correlation-based feature selection (CFS)
    method was employed to select input features and estimate ETo using each ML algorithm.
    Initially, seven weather parameters, including minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum
    temperature (Tmax), average temperature (Tav), wind speed (Ws), solar radiation
    (Rs), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation (PRCP) were included in the feature
    selection analysis. The analysis has shown that Rs and Tav were the most critical
    weather parameters to simulate ETo using ML algorithms. Input features were scaled
    using max-min scaling to avoid dominance due to the high-weight parameters. This
    approach scales input features to a 0–1 scale. The three ML models (NN, RF, and
    LR) used Rs and Tav as input features. The ML models were trained and tested using
    213,650 daily observations from all 42 weather stations. The dataset was split
    randomly into 70 % for the training, and the remaining 30 % was used for model
    testing/evaluation. The test data set results were used to discuss ML models''
    performance evaluations. 2.4. Simulating irrigation using the DSSAT model The
    Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT v4.8.0.027) cropping
    system model (CSM) (Hoogenboom et al., 2021) is a dynamic model that allows simulation
    of soil-plant-water relationships on a daily timestep. A calibrated CERES-Sweet
    corn model by Lizaso et al. (2007), using field experimental data from a study
    in Citra, Florida, was developed for optimal sweet corn production with an automatic
    irrigation scheduling option to meet crop water requirements. Model simulation
    with an automatic irrigation scheduling option was run for 18 years at Citra and
    Homestead, Florida sites. The study sites exhibit distinct soil characteristics,
    as outlined in Table TS1. The standard DSSAT software calculates ETo from weather
    data primarily using the Prestley Taylor or the FAO-56 PM methods. The DSSAT model
    source code was modified in FORTRAN so that estimated ETo using empirical and
    ML models could be be used for irrigation scheduling instead of the built in ETo
    models within DSSAT. Modifying the model''s source code allowed the DSSAT model
    to read the calculated ETo outside the DSSAT shell. This facilitated the evaluation
    of how uncertainties in daily ETo estimation methods tested in this study propagated
    into irrigation scheduling and seasonal agricultural water use for sweet corn
    production at the two selected sites in Citra and Homestead (Fig. 1). 2.5. Model
    calibration and evaluation To improve the performance of empirical ETo models
    in estimating daily ETo, a linear bias correction technique was employed to calibrate
    poorly performing ETo models. A similar calibration approach by Djaman et al.
    (2016) was used. Linear bias correction regression equations were developed for
    each weather station using the PM-ETo as the dependent variable and ETo from the
    empirical models as an independent variable. The calibration coefficients were
    then obtained by multiplying the slope of a regression equation by its inverse
    to bring the slope close to one and adding the opposite intercept value to get
    the intercept close to zero. A suite of model evaluation criteria such as coefficient
    of determination (r2; Eq. 11), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE; Eq.
    12), mean absolute error (MAE; Eq. 13), and root mean squared error (RMSE; Eq.
    14) was used to determine the performance of empirical and ML models in estimating
    daily ETo compared to the PM model. (11) (12) (13) (14) where Oi is observed data
    at weather stations, Si is simulated data, while Ō and S̄ are observed and simulated
    means, respectively, and n is the number of observations. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Performance of machine learning and uncalibrated empirical ETo models The
    NN and RF models had the highest r2 and NSE and the lest MAE and RMSE, while the
    HS model performed the least based on the long-term simulations using historical
    weather data (Fig. 2). However, both the NN and RF had higher r2 and NSE, the
    NN model had a slightly lower MAE and RMSE than the RF model. On the other hand,
    the HS model had the lowest r2 and NSE and the highest MAE and RMSE. Among the
    three empirical models, the performance of the PT and TU models was comparable;
    however, it should be noted that all three empirical models had very high RMSE
    values compared to the ML models. Overall, the ML models, especially NN and RF,
    performed better than the other models, including the LR, during model training
    and testing (Table 1, Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download

    0.14 0.15 0.15 0.63 0.46 0.46 On the other hand, while the LR model was not as
    strong as the other two ML models, its performance was better than the other three
    empirical models, as reflected by the high NSE coefficient and lower MAE and RMSE
    values (Table 1). Previous research reports also showed that the LR model performed
    better than the HS and TU models (Üneş et al., 2020). Overall, better performances
    of ML models over empirical methods are well documented (Kumar et al., 2002; Rahimi
    Khoob, 2008a, Rahimi Khoob, 2008b; Zanetti et al., 2007; Landeras et al., 2008;
    Ferreira et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Pirvali Beiranvand and Ghamghami, 2022;
    Chen et al., 2020). For instance, the findings of Pirvali Beiranvand and Ghamghami
    (2022) showed that ML models were more reliable than empirical models such as
    HS and TUR. According to Landeras et al. (2008), the NN model outperformed the
    HS, PT, and TU models, demonstrating its better performance. Similarly, Ferreira
    et al. (2019) concluded that the NN model exhibited higher r2 values and lower
    RMSE values when compared to the HS model. Additionally, Chen et al. (2020) found
    that the RF model performed better than the HS and PT models. For instance, Pagano
    et al. (2023) demonstrated that the RF model outperformed empirical models in
    an experimental site in Palermo, Italy, with an RMSE of 0.39 mm/day and an r2
    of 0.84. Although the performance values obtained in this study are slightly higher
    than those reported by Pagano et al. (2023), the overall trend supports the superiority
    of ML models in estimating ETo. Multiyear simulation results also revealed that
    each model performed consistently across all weather stations. This suggests that
    geographic location appears not to influence model performance (Fig. 3). However,
    a consistent issue observed with the HS, PT, and TU models is that the models
    tend to underestimate lower ETo while overestimating higher ETo values compared
    to the PM model across most weather stations (Fig. 3). Similarly, the overestimation
    issue of the HS model was reported by Antonopoulos and Antonopoulos (2017), Allen
    et al. (1998) and Rahimi Khoob (2008a), and Kumar et al. (2002). Kumar et al.
    (2002) reported an over and underestimation of the HS model by up to 37 and 20
    %, respectively, compared to the PM model. Overall, the results confirmed the
    seasonal dependency of the empirical models in accurately estimating ETo, which
    was not observed with the ML models. For example, the r2 value of HS was higher
    at the hottest months of the year (June, July, August, and September), where it
    tends to lower for the rest of the months, which are relatively colder. On the
    other hand, the RMSE of HS tends to be higher for March, May, and April and relatively
    lower for the rest of the months. Similarly, variation in performance of TU and
    PT was evident across months of the year. This indicates a seasonal variation
    in the performance of empirical models and the potential of ML models in accurately
    estimating daily ETo without seasonal bias. Download : Download high-res image

    (ML) models generally resulted in more accurate estimates of ETo than empirical
    models. This improvement in estimation accuracy holds significant potential for
    simulating water balance and optimizing irrigation water management in irrigated
    fields when coupled with hydrological or crop growth models. By leveraging ML
    models, it becomes possible to enhance the precision and reliability of water-related
    simulations, thereby enabling better-informed decision-making regarding irrigation
    practices and efficient water allocation in agricultural settings. 3.2. Actual
    ET (ETc) and irrigation water use at Citra and Homestead Sweet corn planting at
    the two sites selected for irrigation scheduling using the DSSAT model occurs
    during March in Citra and November in Homestead. This resulted in different weather
    patterns after sweet corn planting (Fig. 4). Average temperature and PM ETo increased
    in Citra right after sweet corn planting, while opposite trends were observed
    in Homestead. As expected, Homestead''s average relative humidity was higher than
    Citra''s (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (452KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Measured weather characteristics in Citra and Homestead
    during corn growing seasons. Source https://fawn.ifas.ufl.edu Observed differences
    between empirical and ML models in estimating daily ETo were also reflected in
    daily actual ET (ETc) values for the two sites, as demonstrated by the DSSAT simulations
    (Fig. 5). Since the DSSAT model was developed to optimize sweet corn yield by
    applying needed irrigation water, the choice of ETo estimated by both empirical
    and machine learning models did not have a significant effect on final sweet corn
    yield (Table TS2). However, a much higher yield was observed from DSSAT modeling
    in Citra compared to the Homestead site, which could be attributed to the better
    soil properties of the Citra site than Homestead used in the DSSAT for modeling
    the yield. For example, the Citra site has 180 cm tick soil with a soil fertility
    factor of 0.92, much higher than the homestead soil, which is only 18 cm thick
    with a soil fertility factor of 0.70. The HS and TU models resulted in higher
    ETc values in Citra compared to the PM model, while results were opposite in Homestead,
    where ETc values from HS were consistently lower than the PM model (Fig. 5). In
    general, ETc from ML models showed the least seasonal variation at the two sites
    compared to ETc values based on empirical models including PM. Download : Download

    actual ET (ETc) simulated by DSSAT based on ETo inputs from empirical and ML models.
    Differences in daily ETo estimates between models were also reflected in the sweet
    corn irrigation water requirements of the two study sites. In Citra, the empirical
    model-based irrigation scheduling resulted in increased irrigation by up to 54
    mm during a single crop growing season compared to the PM model (Fig. 6). In contrast,
    the empirical models, except PT, resulted in a reduction of sweet corn irrigation
    water use in Homestead (Fig. 6). Reduction in irrigation water use from ML models
    was as high as 20 mm per season. Like the ETc estimates, sweet corn irrigation
    water use based on the ML models was very close to the PM model, except on a few
    occasions when irrigation water uses from the ML models were lower by up to 20
    mm compared to the PM model (Fig. 6). Overall, ETc and irrigation water use in
    Homestead were smaller compared to Citra (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). This could be due to
    differences in weather conditions during crop growth season in both locations
    (Fig. 4). Sweet corn cultivation in Homestead and Citra follows different planting
    periods. In Homestead, sweet corn is grown during the winter season, whereas in
    Citra, planting occurs in spring. The distinct climate and agricultural practices
    influence this difference in planting schedules in the respective regions and
    impact ETc estimates. In addition, Homestead has high relative humidity, which
    indicates a lower vapor pressure deficit in the air, which is the primary driving
    mechanism for evapotranspiration (Fig. 4). This highlights the variation in water
    use estimates among the different models and underscores the importance of selecting
    the most suitable model for accurate irrigation management. Download : Download

    of employing different ETo models on estimating total irrigation water use (mm),
    with the PM model as the reference. The box and whisker plots were developed using
    18 data points representing the seasonal irrigation water use. The lower whisker
    represents the smallest value within 1.5 times the interquartile range below the
    25th percentile, while the upper whisker represents values within 1.5 times the
    interquartile range above the 75th percentile. Values outside the lower and upper
    whiskers were considered outliers. The ML models consistently outperform empirical
    models in accurately estimating ETc, leading to reductions in water use across
    the two study areas. In contrast, empirical models yielded inconsistent results.
    Consistent with the findings of this study, previous research conducted in the
    United States and elsewhere has also highlighted the better performance of ML
    models in estimating ETc (Costa et al., 2023; Granata, 2019; Küçüktopcu et al.,
    2023; Pagano et al., 2023). This advancement is crucial for ensuring a precise
    and accurate assessment of crop water demand, as accurate estimation of ETc plays
    a vital role in the modeling process (Costa et al., 2023; Djaman et al., 2018;
    Koech and Langat, 2018). Previous studies have consistently highlighted the significance
    of ML models in enhancing water use efficiency and facilitating precision irrigation
    management. For example, research conducted in various regions, such as the Kansas
    High Plains in the United States, has shown the remarkable performance of ML models
    in capturing the intricate dynamics of water consumption in agricultural fields
    (Wei et al., 2022). In general, by accurately estimating ETc and irrigation water
    requirements, farmers and water resource managers can make informed decisions
    regarding irrigation scheduling, crop water allocation, and overall water resource
    planning (Küçüktopcu et al., 2023; Pirvali Beiranvand and Ghamghami, 2022; Wang
    et al., 2019). This, in turn, helps to mitigate the risks of over-irrigation,
    under-irrigation, and water scarcity, leading to improved crop yields, reduced
    environmental impacts, and enhanced water conservation (Ahansal et al., 2022;
    Liakos et al., 2018). Integrating ML models into agricultural water management
    practices offers substantial benefits, enabling precise estimations of ETc and
    irrigation water use. By leveraging the power of advanced computational algorithms,
    ML models provide a valuable tool for optimizing water resources and enhancing
    agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. 3.3. Calibrated empirical ETo
    models The bias correction-based calibration results of the three empirical models
    (HS, PT, and TUR) exhibited substantial improvements, with NSE values ranging
    from 0.76 to 0.97, MAE values ranging from 0.11 to 0.33, and RMSE values ranging
    from 0.15 to 0.41, as presented in Table 2. Calibrated model RMSE error values
    were reduced by 35 % for HS, while the reduction for PT and TU models was as high
    as 67 and 65 %, respectively (Table 2). Reductions in MAE for the three models
    ranged between 32 % for HS and 72 % for PT. In addition, NSE for the HS model
    showed an average improvement of 80 %. Table 2. Summary of empirical ETo models

    −69.2 −64.5 While calibration improved the performance of the HS model, it still
    had the highest RMSE and MAE values, while its NSE was still the lowest compared
    to other models. Calibration addressed the HS model overestimation issues in most
    weather stations, but the calibrated model still tends to slightly overestimate
    smaller ETo values (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (889KB)

    ETo estimates by the HS model before calibration compared with daily ETo from

    hand, calibration of the PT and TU models addressed observed under and overestimation
    issues of these models (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10). The results demonstrate that
    the calibrated PT and TU models exhibited comparable performance to the NN and
    RF models, as evidenced by their low MAE and RMSE values and high r2 and NSE coefficients
    (Table 2). This suggests that the calibrated PT and TU models achieved accuracy
    and precision like the NN and RF models. This also showed that calibration of
    empirical models could be an option without the data inputs needed to develop
    ML models. Calibration parameters (intercept and slope) estimated for the three
    empirical models at each weather station (Table TS3) could be applied to correct
    daily ETo estimates and achieve comparable results with the PM model (Fig. 8,
    Fig. 9, Fig. 10). This would allow users to overcome the need for additional weather
    variables for the PM model and the need for big datasets by the ML models. Generally,
    according to the evaluation criteria established by Nash and Sutcliffe (1970),
    Saleh et al. (2000), and Van Liew et al. (2007) for NSE, MAE, and RMSE values,
    the performance of the empirical ETo models can be classified as ranging from
    very good to excellent. Download : Download high-res image (712KB) Download :

    performance of the calibrated ETo models exhibited slight variations across the
    weather stations, which could be attributed to differences in the stations'' topographical
    location and climate regions. Likewise, the calibrated ETo models displayed diverse
    performance compared to the PM-ETo, depending on the region''s climate conditions.
    The PT and TU models were initially developed to suit humid climate conditions,
    while the HS model was designed for arid and semi-arid climates, as documented
    by Hargreaves and Samani (1985), Priestley and Taylor (1972), and Turc (1961).
    In the context of Florida, where the majority of the state falls within a humid
    subtropical climate zone, the HS model demonstrated the highest error rates for
    both inland and island locations, as reported by Irmak et al. (2003) and Martinez
    and Thepadia (2010). The authors explicitly highlighted that the HS model is prone
    to errors due to temperature fluctuations caused by weather shifts, wind speed
    variations, and cloud cover changes. Poor performance of the PT model was also
    reported in China''s semi-arid climate, where the PT estimation fluctuated by
    the variation in the monthly precipitation and wind speed (Xiaoying and Erda,
    2005). As observed in this study, previous studies have also demonstrated the
    effectiveness of ETo calibration approaches in improving the simulation performance
    of different empirical ETo models (Djaman et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2015; Valipour,
    2015). For example, a previous study by Valipour (2015) reported the best performance
    of calibrated PT and TU with an average r2 value of 0.98 across 181 synoptic stations
    in Iran. Using inaccurate ETo models led to significant errors when estimating
    irrigation water use. However, employing a linear regression equation developed
    between daily PM-ETo and ETo estimates shows promising results for enhancing the
    estimation performance of ETo models. This improvement in simulation accuracy
    can positively impact irrigation water efficiency and agricultural water management
    practices. By employing the calibrated linear regression equation, the ETo models
    can more accurately estimate evapotranspiration rates, leading to better-informed
    decisions regarding water usage in irrigation and agriculture. Consequently, this
    advancement could potentially optimize water resources and enhance overall sustainability
    in these sectors. 4. Conclusion This study evaluated the performance of three
    empirical models (HS, PT, and TU) and three machine learning models (LR, RF, and
    NN) for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ETo) compared to the standard
    FAO-56 PM model. Historical weather data collected from 42 weather stations distributed
    throughout Florida were used. The ML algorithms were tested to determine if they
    could serve as reliable alternatives to the empirical models or the data-intensive
    PM model. The study addressed uncertainties in estimating daily ETo among the
    empirical models. It also investigated how the choice of the ETo model affects
    sweet corn irrigation water use by modifying the source code of the DSSAT model
    to incorporate ETo estimates from empirical and ML models. In addition, the poorly
    performing empirical models were further calibrated against the PM model using
    linear regression bias correction techniques to improve their accuracy. The findings
    consistently showed that the NN and RF models outperformed the uncalibrated empirical
    models in accurately estimating daily ETo with higher r2 and NSE values of 0.97
    for both NN and RF, lower MAE values of 0.1, 0.11, and lower RMSE values of 0.14,
    0.15, respectively for NN and RF. The uncalibrated empirical models tended to
    exhibit underestimation and overestimation of daily ETo, with the HS model performing
    the poorest (r2 = 0.75). The study also demonstrated that the choice of ETo model
    could result in up to 54 mm of irrigation water wastage during a single crop season
    when using ETo-based irrigation scheduling. The findings suggest a preference
    for machine learning models, specifically NN and RF, as alternatives to the PM
    model when input parameters such as average temperature and solar radiation are
    available, even when other parameters are lacking. Calibration of the empirical
    models was found to be effective in improving their performance by reducing errors.
    Numerically, after calibration, the NSE value of HS, PT, and TU was improved by
    80.1 %, 39.9 %, and 36.6 %, MAE decreased by 31.5 %, 71.5 %, and 69.2 %, and RMSE
    decreased by 34.5 %, 66.6 %, and 64.5 %, respectively. It is worth mentioning
    that the calibrated PT and TU models showed comparable performances with the ML
    models. Therefore, when sufficient long-term data needed to train and test machine
    learning models is unavailable, calibration of empirical models could be considered.
    The findings of this study have practical implications for water resource engineers,
    irrigation managers, hydrologists, and others involved in freshwater resources
    management, aiding in the selection of appropriate ETo models for informed decision-making.

    Introduction The temperature variable stands out as one of the atmospheric parameters
    with the highest accuracy, contributing to enhanced reliability in weather forecasts.
    Precisely predicting the air temperature at a specific location and time is a
    crucial research challenge with diverse applications, spanning from energy generation
    to agriculture. Climate scientists anticipate that the escalating air temperatures
    in the forthcoming decades may lead to adverse environmental impacts [1]. The
    demand for temperature forecasts in the agricultural sector is growing for both
    maximum ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) and minimum ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) temperatures, as these significantly influence
    crop growth and potential yield. It is a key research topic in atmospheric sciences,
    with potential applications to the agricultural sector [2]. Daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇
    𝑚𝑖𝑛 serve as valuable indicators of crop growth and yield, as they can be used
    to predict the irrigation water requirements for crops. Consequently, predicting
    the daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a significant issue, with practical applications in crop science,
    as it has been demonstrated that irrigation water requirements depend greatly
    on weather conditions. According to Allen et al. [3] and Ali [4], irrigation water
    requirements are closely linked to weather parameters such as temperature, relative
    humidity, sunshine hours, wind speed, and rainfall. Among these, temperature stands
    out as a key factor, influencing not only the determination of irrigation water
    requirements but also facilitating plant growth through the photosynthesis process.
    Notably, both maximum and minimum temperatures play a crucial role in shaping
    irrigation water requirements and crop scheduling, as expounded by Wang et al.
    [5] and Haque et al. [6]. The connection between temperature forecasting and agriculture
    is profound, as temperature significantly influences various aspects of crop growth
    and development [7,8]. Temperature forecasts play a crucial role in agriculture
    by providing valuable information for planning and decision making across various
    agricultural activities. Temperature forecasts offer essential insights into various
    aspects of agriculture, including crop growth, pest management, irrigation, harvest
    timing, climate change adaptation, and resource management [9]. By incorporating
    accurate temperature forecasts into agricultural practices, farmers can make informed
    decisions, optimize resource allocation, enhance productivity, and mitigate risks,
    ultimately contributing to the development of sustainable and efficient agricultural
    systems. Therefore, the present study aims to provide multi-step-ahead forecasts
    for both 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 in three distinct climatic zones of Bangladesh. The precise
    prediction of air temperatures has attracted the attention of researchers in recent
    years. This is because precise temperature forecasting has a wide range of applications
    in fields such as climate science, agriculture, energy management, and urban planning
    [10]. Temperature forecasting has been continuously evolving for nearly a century,
    since the inception of weather forecasting. According to the literature, there
    are two fundamental methods for predicting weather forecasting, including air
    temperature and precipitation forecasting: general circulation or physically based
    simulations and statistical modeling [11,12,13,14]. Physically based models are
    classic approaches that utilize computer simulations based on mathematical equations
    and are often referred to as numerical weather prediction models [15,16]. However,
    physically based models are constrained by the need for significant computing
    power and a clear understanding of the system being modeled. On the other hand,
    statistical models aim to reduce the reliance on physically based models. They
    are easier to understand and less computationally complex than their physically
    based counterparts. Typically, statistical models are applied to the outputs of
    numerical weather prediction models. Most studies have demonstrated that results
    from statistical models and physical models are generally consistent. There are
    two types of statistical analysis [17]: correlation techniques and regression
    approaches. Regression approaches primarily rely on machine learning (ML)-based
    data-driven methodologies, which have gained popularity in the prediction and
    forecasting of air temperatures [1,18,19,20]. However, it is observed that in
    the absence of transient weather systems, the daily cycle of temperature is more
    or less well defined. Therefore, a classic regression model could often be utilized
    to forecast the air temperature when there is no cloud cover during the data acquisition
    process. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the air temperature using classic
    regression methods poses a challenge, given the chaotic nature and nonlinear trends
    of weather parameters. In such scenarios, ML-based methods have proven to be viable
    alternatives to classic regression models. In recent years, various soft computing
    approaches have been applied to address temperature prediction challenges in diverse
    areas. Many of these approaches have harnessed the power of neural computing techniques,
    known for their speed and accuracy [10]. Specifically, ML-based approaches to
    air temperature prediction involve the application of various methods, including
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [21], genetic algorithm-tuned ANN [22], Honey
    Badger Algorithm-tuned ANN [23], Gene Expression Programming [23], Support Vector
    Regression [14,17,21,24,25], Multi-Layer Perceptron [1,14], Multi-Variate Adaptive
    Regression Spline [26], Extreme Learning Machine [26,27], M5 Prime [28], Random
    Forest [17,26,29,30], Lasso Regression [29], Regression Tree [17], Long Short-Term
    Memory Network (LSTM) [1,31], GRU-LSTM [32], Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    [29], CNN-LSTM [1,33,34], Simple Recurrent Neural Network with Convolutional Filters
    [35], and Stochastic Adversarial Video Prediction [35]. Cifuentes et al. [18]
    provided a detailed review of air temperature forecasting approaches using ML
    techniques. These forecasting methods have consistently demonstrated improved
    prediction results. Implementing new techniques in temperature forecasting is
    crucial for reducing modeling errors and mitigating model parameter uncertainties
    [36]. However, achieving higher forecast accuracy with a desired model remains
    a complex scientific challenge. In this article, we are not referring to the relationship
    between NWP and ML models; rather, we propose a new approach based on ML-based
    modeling to address the inherent limitations of NWPs, such as the need for well-defined
    prior knowledge and extensive computational capacity. In contrast, ML techniques
    excel at identifying hidden patterns in the dataset without requiring prior knowledge.
    Thus, these approaches may serve as suitable alternatives to NWPs in weather forecasting.
    Previous studies on temperature forecasting employed various ML approaches and
    optimization algorithm-tuned ML models, including the deep learning approaches.
    These studies compared a few modeling approaches and proposed the best predictive
    model based on the comparison results. However, this approach is limited by the
    need to select appropriate candidate models for comparison and to identify the
    top-performing model. In other words, traditional ML-based approaches to temperature
    forecasting involve manual model selection, which can be time-consuming and subjective.
    To address these limitations, it is often beneficial to compare multiple approaches
    while optimizing their tunable hyperparameters using optimization algorithms to
    identify the most suitable prediction or forecast model for a given dataset. This
    process of automatic model selection involves automatically choosing the most
    appropriate regression model for a given dataset. The objective is to find the
    model that best fits the data and provides the most accurate predictions. To this
    end, the present study proposes an automated model selection technique to enhance
    forecasting accuracy and streamline the modeling process. Bayesian optimization
    [37] and the asynchronous successive halving algorithm (ASHA) [38] were employed
    to search for the top-performing model by tuning hyperparameters. The selection
    of significant input variables is a critical step in ML-based modeling applications.
    It involves the identification and selection of the most relevant and informative
    features from the available dataset [39,40]. This process is fundamental in ML-based
    forecasting models, as it plays a vital role in improving predictive performance,
    reducing overfitting, enhancing computational efficiency, and improving the interpretability
    of ML-based models. It enables models to leverage the most relevant and informative
    features, leading to more accurate, efficient, and interpretable predictions in
    various applications and domains. Previous studies have utilized both linear methods
    [41] and nonlinear techniques [40], including Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance
    (MRMR) [42] approaches, to identify the most significant input variables for forecast
    models. One promising approach to identifying the most influential input variables
    is the utilization of F-tests. F-tests are a common approach to assessing the
    importance of individual features in predicting a continuous target variable.
    In this approach, each feature is evaluated independently based on its relationship
    with the target variable, using the F-statistic and associated p-value. It is
    important to note that while univariate feature ranking provides insights into
    an individual feature’s importance, it does not capture potential interactions
    or dependencies between features. Therefore, it is essential to complement this
    analysis with other feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques to
    consider the combined effects of multiple features and capture complex relationships
    in the regression model. Another approach to significant input variable selection
    is the use of MRMR, a popular technique for selecting a subset of features that
    are both informative and minimally redundant. MRMR aims to maximize the relevance
    of features to the target variable while minimizing the redundancy between the
    selected features. Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) is another feature selection
    technique that aims to find an optimal subset of features for a given classification
    or regression task. NCA is a distance-based feature selection method that learns
    a linear transformation of the original feature space to maximize the discriminability
    of the data points. In the present study, a combination of all variables that
    were selected by the individual variable selection approaches was used to include
    all possible contributing variables affecting the outputs. In this proposed approach,
    the common variables that were determined by all approaches were used only once.
    Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches for temperature prediction typically
    entail manual model selection, a process that is known to be time-consuming and
    subjective. Addressing these challenges, it proves advantageous to compare multiple
    approaches and optimize their tunable hyperparameters through optimization algorithms.
    This helps identify the most suitable prediction or forecast model for a given
    dataset. This research introduces an innovative approach to automated model selection
    by employing Bayesian optimization and the asynchronous successive halving algorithm,
    providing a systematic and efficient method for choosing the most suitable models
    in predicting daily minimum and maximum temperatures. The incorporation of the
    ASHA algorithm contributes to enhancing the efficiency of the model selection
    process, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are limited or
    asynchronous evaluations are necessary. The research addresses the challenge of
    model selection in a robust and adaptive manner through optimizing model hyperparameters,
    providing a valuable contribution to the broader field of machine learning and
    climate science. Finally, by emphasizing the application of advanced optimization
    techniques in the field of temperature prediction, the study contributes to a
    broader understanding of automated model selection strategies in environmental
    forecasting, potentially paving the way for similar methodologies in related domains.
    To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no prior attempts to predict
    and forecast temperatures using optimization algorithms such as Bayesian optimization
    and ASHA for automatic model selection. This underscores the novel contribution
    of the current study. The agricultural sector stands to benefit significantly
    from the evolution of machine learning (ML) models, especially with a focus on
    enhancing computational efficiency. The advancement of ML models, particularly
    in the context of agriculture, has led to a growing interest in developing less
    computationally expensive models to their enhance scalability and accessibility
    [37]. Bayesian optimization emerges as a promising approach in this regard, offering
    a systematic method for optimizing the hyperparameters of ML models with a reduced
    computational burden. Utilizing Bayesian optimization empowers researchers to
    refine temperature models with increased effectiveness, thereby facilitating advancements
    in precision agriculture and the accuracy of climate-related predictions. On the
    other hand, the ASHA optimization algorithm further complements this effort by
    parallelizing the model training process, thereby expediting the optimization
    procedure [38]. This strategy offers an effective means of optimizing hyperparameters,
    streamlining the training process, and making models more accessible in the context
    of agriculture. In agricultural applications, where the need for real-time decision
    making is crucial, the implementation of less computationally intensive ML models
    can significantly improve efficiency [43]. The incorporation of Bayesian and ASHA
    optimization techniques contributes to the sustainable evolution of precision
    agriculture and climate-related predictions. This study aims to train several
    regression models using Bayesian and ASHA optimizations on a given training dataset
    and identify the best-performing model on a test dataset. The objective is to
    investigate the effectiveness of the Bayesian and ASHA optimization algorithms
    in forecasting daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values and to provide a comparison of these
    two optimization algorithm-tuned models. By automating the model selection process,
    we aim to overcome the limitations of manual selection, such as subjectivity and
    suboptimal choices. Our proposed approach automates and eliminates manual steps
    that are required to go from a dataset to a predictive model. We present a novel
    approach that automates the model selection process for temperature forecasting,
    offering a more objective and efficient alternative to manual selection. Therefore,
    the contributions of this study encompass (a) building multiple regression models
    for a given training dataset of 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 by optimizing their hyperparameters
    using Bayesian and ASHA optimization algorithms, (b) performing a comparative
    analysis of models tuned by Bayesian and ASHA optimization algorithms, and (c)
    identifying the top-performing models for multiple forecast horizons at three
    weather stations. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area and the Data Daily
    𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 data were collected from three meteorological stations, namely,
    Barishal, Gazipur, and Ishurdi stations. The selection of these stations was based
    on their representation of three distinct climatic regions in Bangladesh: (1)
    Gazipur station represents the central region of Bangladesh, situated at approximately
    24.00° N latitude and 90.43° E longitude, with an elevation of 14 m above mean
    sea level; (2) Ishurdi station represents the northern climatic regions of Bangladesh,
    located at around 24.04° N latitude and 90.07° E longitude, with an elevation
    of 18 m above mean sea level; and (3) Barishal station represents the southern
    part of Bangladesh, positioned at approximately 22.60° N latitude and 90.36° E
    longitude, with an elevation of 1.0 m above mean sea level. The study area, including
    the locations of these three weather stations, is depicted in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Study area indicating the positioning of the weather stations. This study utilizes
    medium-term daily temperature data obtained from the Bangladesh Meteorological
    Department (BMD) across three weather stations to provide multi-step-ahead temperature
    forecasts. The maximum and minimum temperatures of the day were measured using
    Zeal P1000 maximum and minimum thermometers from G. H. Zeal Ltd., London, UK.
    The thermometers have an accuracy of ±0.2 °C and a range and resolution of −50
    to +70  °C with 0.1  °C increments, and they were positioned at a measurement
    height of 2 m. The geographical distribution of meteorological stations is illustrated
    in Figure 1, depicting a reasonable coverage of three distinct regions across
    the country. Notably, Bangladesh’s topography is predominantly flat, with some
    elevated regions in the northeast and southeast. Consequently, it is reasonable
    to infer that the selected meteorological stations comprehensively represent the
    climatic conditions of the three regions of the country [44]. The temperature
    distribution in Bangladesh is significantly influenced by various local conditions.
    The country’s proximity to the equator contributes to a predominantly tropical
    climate, characterized by high temperatures throughout the year. The Bay of Bengal,
    bordering the southern coastline, acts as a key influencer, moderating temperatures
    along the coastal regions compared to the inland areas. The flat topography, interspersed
    with some upland regions, further contributes to temperature variations. Seasonal
    monsoons, driven by distinct wind patterns, play a crucial role in shaping temperature
    dynamics and precipitation patterns, thus exerting a notable impact on the overall
    temperature distribution across different geographical regions of Bangladesh [5,6].
    Gazipur station exhibits a tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (classification:
    Aw). The district records an annual average temperature of 28.95 °C, marking a
    1.21% increase compared to the national averages in Bangladesh. Gazipur usually
    receives around 71.24 mm of precipitation annually. Ishurdi station also features
    a tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (classification: Aw). The district maintains
    an annual temperature of 29.52 °C, which is 1.78% higher than the national averages
    in Bangladesh. Ishurdi typically receives around 98.38 mm of precipitation annually.
    Barisal station experiences a tropical climate, characterized by significantly
    less rainfall in winter compared to the summer months. According to Köppen and
    Geiger [45], this location falls under the Aw classification. Statistical analysis
    reveals an average temperature of approximately 25.6 °C, with an annual rainfall
    of around 2005 mm. The temperate characteristics of Barisal poses challenges in
    clearly categorizing distinct seasons in the region. The acquired temperature
    forecast results remain unaffected by local atmospheric conditions. While the
    mentioned local factors are implicitly embedded in the data collected from weather
    stations, it is crucial to note that the modeling outcomes presented in this research
    solely derive from historical temperature data from BMD. A diurnal cycle, also
    known as a diel cycle, manifests as a recurring pattern every 24 h due to the
    complete rotation of the Earth around its axis. The Earth’s rotation gives rise
    to temperature variations on the surface during both day and night, contributing
    to seasonal weather changes. The primary determinant of the diurnal cycle is the
    influx of solar radiation [46]. The atmospheric seasonal cycle is influenced by
    the Earth’s axial tilt. The Earth’s seasonal cycle arises from its 23° axial tilt,
    causing varying solar radiation at different latitudes throughout the year. Equinoxes
    align the sun with the equator, the June solstice with the Tropic of Cancer, and
    the December solstice with the Tropic of Capricorn, creating hemispheric temperature
    disparities in summer and winter. The Annual Temperature Cycle (ATC) encompasses
    seasonal temperature changes that are influenced by fluctuations in solar radiation
    reaching the Earth’s surface throughout the year [47]. Typically, evaluating the
    ATC relies on sparse and unevenly distributed air temperature observations or
    numerical model simulations. This study utilized temperature data collected by
    the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) at specific intervals, encompassing
    daily maximum and minimum values. The data were sourced from three designated
    weather stations for analysis. In this study, the daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 data were
    collected from three weather stations, located in distinct climatic regions of
    Bangladesh. Ensuring the quality of the temperature datasets is essential to enhance
    the reliability of temperature forecasts using ML algorithms [48]. While a comprehensive
    quality assurance process was not conducted for this specific dataset, the accuracy
    and completeness of the recorded temperature data were systematically assessed
    using range/limit tests. Range testing is a fundamental quality control method
    that involves verifying that every observation falls within a specified range
    [48]. Only values within the predefined limits are considered valid [49,50], while
    readings outside the specified range are appropriately marked as invalid. The
    valid readings within the allowable range were used to simulate future temperature
    fluctuations in the selected weather stations, with a particular focus on generating
    multi-step forward temperature forecasts for both 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 . A small portion
    of the collected data, amounting to less than 2% of the total data from all weather
    stations, contained missing values. To address this issue, the ‘moving median’
    imputation technique was employed. This technique utilizes a moving median with
    a predetermined window length to fill in the missing values. After applying the
    imputation method, the weather stations Barishal, Gazipur, and Ishurdi had 2677
    readings (from 1 January 2015 to 30 April 2022), 6695 readings (from 1 January
    2004 to 30 April 2022), and 2041 readings (from 1 June 2015 to 31 December 2020)
    of daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for
    daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 at the three weather stations. It can be seen from Table
    1 that the data exhibited left (negative) skewness, suggesting that the distribution
    had an extended left tail compared to the right tail. Additionally, kurtosis values
    included both positive and negative values, indicating that the datasets had both
    ‘heavy-tailed’ (positive kurtosis) and ‘light-tailed’ (negative kurtosis) distributions.
    Table 1. Descriptive statistics of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures
    at the three stations (Barishal, Gazipur, and Ishurdi stations), Bangladesh. The
    Gaussian distribution, commonly known as a normal distribution, is characterized
    by a bell-shaped curve. It is often assumed that measurements will adhere to a
    normal distribution, featuring an equal number of measurements above and below
    the mean. However, in real-world scenarios, data may not precisely conform to
    the Gaussian distribution and could exhibit slight deviations. In practice, achieving
    exact conformity to a Gaussian distribution is rare. Ideally, if a distribution
    is truly normal, the mean, median, and mode values would be identical—an occurrence
    seldom observed in real-world situations. In instances where the values of the
    mean, median, and mode differ, the distribution is considered skewed and deviates
    from the Gaussian norm [51]. The presented data in Table 1 reveal that the mean,
    median, and mode values of the temperature measurements exhibit slight differences.
    These numerical variations suggest that the data do not perfectly adhere to a
    Gaussian distribution and show indications of being slightly skewed. The specific
    numeric values can be found in Table 1 for reference. Skewness quantifies the
    asymmetry that is present in data relative to their sample mean. Negative skewness
    indicates that the data are more dispersed to the left of the mean, while positive
    skewness suggests greater dispersion to the right. A perfectly symmetric distribution,
    such as the normal distribution, has a skewness of zero. Kurtosis serves as a
    metric for gauging the susceptibility of a distribution to outliers. The normal
    distribution exhibits a kurtosis of 3. Distributions with kurtosis values exceeding
    3 are more prone to outliers than the normal distribution, while those with values
    below 3 are less susceptible. Some definitions of kurtosis involve subtracting
    3 from the calculated value, resulting in a kurtosis of 0 for the normal distribution.
    This study adopts this later definition (subtracting 3 from the calculated value)
    to compute the kurtosis value. 2.2. Data Preprocessing for the Lagged Input and
    Output Variables Time-lagged information was gathered from the collected time
    series of the daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values. The outputs from the models were the
    day-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values. Therefore, the inputs to the models (five models
    for five-days-ahead forecasts) were 𝑇(𝑑, 𝑑−1,𝑑−2,𝑑−3,…,𝑑−𝑛 ) (1) The outputs were
    𝑇(𝑑+1, 𝑑+2,𝑑+3,…,𝑑+𝑛 ) (2) Due to time-lagging of input variables and the target,
    the observed daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 records were reduced at each weather station.
    At Barishal station, a total of 2642 historical records remained (from 1 January
    2015 to 26 March 2022) after removing 35 records due to time-lagging (5-time lag
    forward and 30-time lag backward) from the entire time series of 2677 readings
    (from 1 January 2015 to 30 April 2022). At Gazipur station, a total of 6660 historical
    records remained (from 1 January 2004 to 26 March 2022) after removing 35 records
    due to time-lagging (5-time lag forward and 30-time lag backward) from the entire
    time series of 6695 readings (from 1 January 2004 to 30 April 2022). At Ishurdi
    station, a total of 2006 historical records remained (from 1 June 2015 to 26 November
    2020) after removing 35 records due to time-lagging (5-time lag forward and 30-time
    lag backward) from the entire time series of 2041 readings (from 1 June 2015 to
    31 December 2020). Each station’s remaining dataset was divided into two sets:
    80% for model training and 20% for model testing. While there is no established
    rule for data splitting during model learning and testing [52], it is recommended
    that testing data comprise between 10% and 40% of the total dataset size [53].
    2.3. Input Variable Selection The first step in developing forecast models using
    ML-based approaches is the selection of the most significant input variables [39,40].
    For the purpose of choosing input variables in hydrology and water resource modeling
    [39], both linear methods [41] and nonlinear techniques [40] have been employed.
    However, because hydrology and water resource modeling issues are frequently nonlinear
    in nature [54], linear methods based on Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)
    and Autocorrelation Function (ACF) are often less suitable techniques. For modeling
    of hydrological and water resources as well as other fields of science and engineering
    applications, nonlinear approaches that utilize mutual information (MI) [55] typically
    outperform linear techniques [35,40,56]. Since the only data used in this effort
    are the daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values at three weather stations (Barishal, Gazipur,
    and Ishurdi), the time-lagged versions of the acquired temperature data (from
    each station) were used as potential inputs. To extract the time-lagged information
    from the 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 time series and choose which lags to include as prospective
    inputs, the PACF was employed. The PACF is a technique that is commonly used in
    time series analysis to identify the most influential lagged features for predicting
    a target variable [57]. The PACF measures the correlation between a time series
    variable and its lagged values, while accounting for the influence of intermediate
    lags. By applying PACF, one can identify the lagged features that have the most
    significant impact on the target variable. These lagged features capture the historical
    patterns and dependencies that can be exploited for accurate time series forecasting.
    Figure 2 displays the PACF plots for the data from three weather stations, revealing
    that the current and past 30-time lags are essential for forecasting temperatures
    for the next five days ( 𝑇 𝑑+1 ,  𝑇 𝑑+2 ,  𝑇 𝑑+3 ,  𝑇 𝑑+4 , 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑇 𝑑+5 ). The
    PACF provided an initial guess of the candidates for input variables. However,
    this initial selection of input variables may include unnecessary or redundant
    features, which could hinder the training of ML-based forecasting models. Therefore,
    it is important to determine the most significant input variables to ensure proper
    training and computational efficiency. Figure 2. PACF plots of the 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇
    𝑚𝑖𝑛 data. Next, this study used the F-statistic [58,59] to identify the most influential
    input variables. The F-test is a statistical test that assesses how much the variability
    in the target variable is explained by a specific feature compared to the variability
    that is not explained by that feature. It examines the importance of each predictor
    individually using an F-test, testing the hypothesis that the response values
    that are grouped by predictor variable values are drawn from populations with
    the same mean against the alternative hypothesis that the population means are
    not all the same. A small p-value of the F-test indicates the importance of the
    corresponding predictor. The F-statistic is calculated by dividing the mean square
    regression (MSR), representing explained variability, by the mean square error
    (MSE), representing unexplained variability. Univariate feature ranking with F-tests
    helps identify the most influential features for a regression task, emphasizing
    the most relevant variables and potentially enhancing interpretability and model
    performance [58,59]. The variable importance is also determined using the MRMR
    technique [60,61]. The MRMR algorithm aims to find a balance between selecting
    informative features while avoiding redundant ones. MRMR considers both relevance
    and redundancy when identifying a subset of features that collectively offer maximum
    information while minimizing duplication. There are variations and extensions
    of MRMR, such as weighted MRMR or incremental MRMR, which provide additional flexibility
    and adaptability to different scenarios. Overall, MRMR is a valuable feature selection
    technique that enhances the interpretability, generalization, and efficiency of
    machine learning models by focusing on the most relevant and nonredundant features.
    The MRMR algorithm [61] identifies a best-possible set of characteristics that
    are maximally and mutually different and are useful for representing the response
    variable. The approach maximizes a feature set’s relevance to the response variable
    while minimizing its redundancy. Using pairwise mutual information of attributes
    and mutual information of an attribute and the response, the technique measures
    the degree of duplication as well as the relevance of variables. The MRMR technique
    seeks to identify an ideal set 𝑆 of features that maximizes 𝑉 𝑠 , the relevance
    of 𝑆 pertaining to a response variable 𝑦 , and minimizes 𝑊 𝑠 , the redundancy
    of 𝑆 , where 𝑉 𝑠 and 𝑊 𝑠 are defined with mutual information (MI) 𝐼 : 𝑉 𝑠 = 1
    |𝑆| ∑ 𝑥∈𝑆 𝐼(𝑥,𝑦), (3) 𝑊 𝑠 = 1 |𝑆| 2 ∑ 𝑥,𝑧∈𝑆 𝐼(𝑥,𝑧). (4) where |𝑆| denotes the
    quantity of attributes in 𝑆 . The amount of uncertainty in one variable that can
    be lowered by understanding the other variable is measured by the MI between two
    variables. The MI (𝐼) of the discrete random variables 𝑋 and 𝑍 can be represented
    by [60] 𝐼(𝑋,𝑍)= ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 𝑃(𝑋= 𝑥 𝑖 ,𝑍= 𝑧 𝑖 )log 𝑃(𝑋= 𝑥 𝑖 ,𝑍= 𝑧 𝑖 ) 𝑃(𝑋= 𝑥 𝑖 )𝑃(𝑍=
    𝑧 𝑖 ) . (5) If 𝑋 and 𝑍 are independent, then 𝐼 equals 0. If 𝑋 and 𝑍 are the same
    random variable, then 𝐼 equals the entropy of 𝑋 . It is necessary to take into
    account all 2 |𝛺| combinations in order to find the optimum set 𝑆 , where 𝛺 is
    the set of all features. The MRMR approach utilizes an alternative approach. In
    this approach, the MRMR approach scores attributes by employing the forward addition
    technique, which necessitates 𝑂(|𝛺|·|𝑆|) computations, by utilizing the MI quotient
    (MIQ) value. 𝑀𝐼𝑄 𝑥 = 𝑉 𝑥 𝑊 𝑥 (6) where 𝑉 𝑥 and 𝑊 𝑥 are the relevance and redundancy
    of a feature, respectively: 𝑉 𝑥 =𝐼(𝑥,𝑦) (7) 𝑊 𝑥 = 1 |𝑆| ∑ 𝑧∈𝑆 𝐼(𝑥,𝑧). (8) The
    MRMR function uses a heuristic technique to quantify the significance of a characteristic
    and then generates a score. A high score value denotes the significance of the
    associated predictor. A degree of trust in feature selection is also indicated
    by a decline in the feature significance score. The score value of the second
    most essential attribute, for instance, is significantly lower than the score
    value of 𝑥 if the algorithm is confident in choosing it. The results can be used
    to identify an ideal set 𝑆 for a particular collection of features. The features
    were ranked using the MRMR algorithm according to the following steps: Step 1:
    Select the feature with the largest relevance, max 𝑥∈Ω 𝑉 𝑥 . Add the selected
    feature to an empty set 𝑆 . Step 2: Find the features with nonzero relevance and
    zero redundancy in the complement of 𝑆 , 𝑆 𝑐 . If 𝑆 𝑐 does not include a feature
    with nonzero relevance and zero redundancy, go to step 4. Otherwise, select the
    feature with the largest relevance, max 𝑥∈ 𝑆 𝑐 , 𝑊 𝑥 =0 𝑉 𝑥 . Add the selected
    feature to the set 𝑆 . Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until the redundancy is not zero
    for all features in 𝑆 𝑐 . Step 4: Select the feature that has the largest MIQ
    value with nonzero relevance and nonzero redundancy in 𝑆 𝑐 , and add the selected
    feature to the set 𝑆 . max 𝑥∈ 𝑆 𝑐 𝑀𝐼𝑄 𝑥 = max 𝑥∈ 𝑆 𝑐 𝐼(𝑥,𝑦) 1 |𝑆| ∑ 𝑧∈𝑆 𝐼(𝑥,𝑧)
    . (9) Step 5: Repeat Step 4 until the relevance is zero for all features in 𝑆
    𝑐 . Step 6: Add the features with zero relevance to 𝑆 in random order. Feature
    selection using Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) [62] focuses on learning
    a transformation matrix that preserves the discriminative information in the data
    while reducing the dimensionality. By considering the local neighborhood relationships
    between data points, NCA can identify the most informative features for the task
    at hand. It is important to note that NCA assumes linearity in the data and may
    not capture complex nonlinear relationships. Therefore, it is advisable to combine
    NCA with nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques or explore other feature
    selection methods for capturing nonlinear feature interactions if needed. The
    NCA feature selection for regression can be mathematically represented as follows
    [62]: Given 𝑛 observations 𝑆={( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ), 𝑖=1,2,…,𝑛}, where the response values
    𝑦 𝑖 ∈ℝ are continuous, the aim is to predict the response 𝑦 given the training
    set 𝑆 . Consider a randomized regression model that: Randomly picks a point (Ref(𝑥))
    from 𝑆 as the ‘reference point’ for 𝑥 ; Sets the response value at 𝑥 equal to
    the response value of the reference point Ref(𝑥) . Again, the probability 𝑃(Ref(𝑥)=
    𝑥 𝑗 |𝑆) that point 𝑥 𝑗 is picked from 𝑆 as the reference point for 𝑥 is 𝑃(Ref(𝑥)=
    𝑥 𝑗 |𝑆)= 𝑘( 𝑑 𝑤 (𝑥, 𝑥 𝑗 )) ∑ 𝑛 𝑗=1 𝑘( 𝑑 𝑤 (𝑥, 𝑥 𝑗 )) (10) Now consider the leave-one-out
    application of this randomized regression model, that is, predicting the response
    for 𝑥 𝑖 using the data in 𝑆 −1 and the training set 𝑆 excluding the point ( 𝑥
    𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) . The probability that point 𝑥 𝑗 is picked as the reference point for
    𝑥 𝑖 is 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 =𝑃(Ref( 𝑥 𝑖 )= 𝑥 𝑗 | 𝑆 −1 )= 𝑘( 𝑑 𝑤 ( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )) ∑ 𝑛 𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝑖 𝑘(
    𝑑 𝑤 ( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )) (11) Let 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ be the response value that the randomized regression
    model predicts and 𝑦 𝑖 be the actual response for 𝑥 𝑖 . And let 𝑙= ℝ 2 →ℝ be a
    loss function that measures the disagreement between 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ and 𝑦 𝑖 . Then, the
    average value of 𝑙( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ ) is 𝑙 𝑖 =𝐸(𝑙( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ )| 𝑆 −𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝑖
    𝑛 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 𝑙( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑗 ). (12) After adding the regularization term, the objective
    function for minimization is 𝑓(𝑤)= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑙 𝑖 +𝜆 ∑ 𝑟=1 𝑝 𝑤 2 𝑟 . (13) The
    default loss function 𝑙( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑗 ) for NCA for regression is mean absolute deviation.
    In this study, a combination of variable selection methods (F-tests, MRMR, and
    NCA) was used to select the most significant input variables from an initial pool
    of 30 candidate inputs determined by PACF. To include all possible contributing
    variables affecting the outputs, all variables selected by the individual variable
    selection approaches were considered, while the common variables determined by
    all approaches were used only once. Doing so eliminates the possibility of excluding
    any variables which might have been deemed important to forecast the output. Using
    this combinatory variable selection scheme, the possible number of candidate variables
    of the inputs for one-, two-, three-, four-, and five-days-ahead forecast of 𝑇
    𝑚𝑎𝑥 at Barishal station were 26, 27, 26, 22, and 25, respectively. The number
    of candidate variables of the inputs for one-, two-, three-, four-, and five-days-ahead
    forecast of 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 at Barishal station were 21, 22, 24, 24, and 23, respectively.
    Similarly, the possible number of candidate input variables for one-, two-, three-,
    four-, and five-days-ahead forecast of 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 at Gazipur station were 25, 26, 25,
    24, and 25, respectively. The number of candidate input variables for one-, two-,
    three-, four-, and five-days-ahead forecast of 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 at Gazipur station were 26,
    25, 26, 25, and 25, respectively. Likewise, the possible number of candidate variables
    of the inputs for one-, two-, three-, four-, and five-days-ahead forecast of 𝑇
    𝑚𝑎𝑥 at Ishurdi station were 23, 23, 26, 26, and 26, respectively. The number of
    candidate variables of the inputs for one-, two-, three-, four-, and five-days-ahead
    forecast of 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 at Ishurdi station were 24, 28, 21, 23, and 21, respectively.
    2.4. Model Development The accuracy and robustness of any forecasting model largely
    depend on the right selection of models and their forecasting accuracy. Forecasting
    models are developed using training and testing of the state-of-the-art machine
    learning algorithms, the optimal parameters of which were decided here based on
    parameters tuning using the Bayesian and ASHA optimization algorithms. Training
    several models and finding their optimal parameter sets through hyperparameter
    tuning can often be a challenging and time-consuming task. This task was made
    easier and faster by developing and comparing multiple models automatically through
    tuning their hyperparameters using optimization algorithms. In this approach,
    instead of training each model with different sets of hyperparameters, we selected
    a few different models and tuned their default hyperparameters using Bayesian
    and ASHA optimizations. These optimization algorithms search for an optimal set
    of hyperparameters for a particular model by minimizing the objective function
    of the model (minimization of the mean squared error (MSE)). The optimization
    algorithms deliberately selected new hyperparameters in each iteration, produced
    an optimal set of hyperparameters for a given training dataset, and identified
    the model that performed best on a test dataset. With the Bayesian and ASHA optimization
    algorithms, the function randomly selected several models with various hyperparameter
    values and trained them on a small subset of the training data. If the log (1
    + valLoss) value for a particular model was found promising, where valLoss is
    the cross-validation MSE, the model was promoted and trained on a larger amount
    of the training data. This process was repeated, and successful models were trained
    on progressively larger amounts of data. To reiterate, our proposed approach executed
    the following three steps simultaneously in the model development process: Data
    exploration and preprocessing: Identify variables with low predictive power that
    should be eliminated. Feature extraction and selection: Extract features automatically
    and—among a large feature set—identify those with high predictive power. Model
    selection and tuning: Automatically tune model hyperparameters and identify the
    best-performing model. The flow diagram of the entire model building process can
    be illustrated as Figure 3. Figure 3. Flow diagram of the proposed automatic model
    selection scheme. 2.5. Hyperparameter Optimization The majority of ML algorithms
    require a careful selection of hyperparameters [63]. The choice of hyperparameter
    settings significantly impacts the performance of ML models [64], and unconscious
    hyperparameter selection can result in low-performing models. Many studies employed
    trial-and-error selection of hyperparameters [64,65], grid search, and/or random
    search [66], while some employed heuristic optimization algorithms like particle
    swarm optimization and genetic algorithms [66]. Nevertheless, a precise and effective
    automated hyperparameter optimization method is highly desirable [64] and is essential
    for ensuring a fair comparison across ML alternatives. Furthermore, when evaluating
    various ML models, fair assessments can only be made if they are equally optimized
    (or receive the same level of attention) for the specific task at hand. Bayesian
    optimization and asynchronous successive halving algorithm (ASHA) are advanced
    optimization techniques that are employed to automate and enhance the efficiency
    of model selection processes. In Bayesian optimization, a probabilistic model
    is iteratively updated to capture the relationship between model hyperparameters
    and performance, guiding the search toward promising regions of the parameter
    space. This process allows for intelligent and resource-efficient exploration,
    especially in scenarios with limited computational resources. On the other hand,
    ASHA introduces an asynchronous approach to hyperparameter optimization, enabling
    parallel evaluations and efficient resource utilization. By continually pruning
    underperforming models, ASHA converges to optimal hyperparameter configurations.
    ASHA is particularly beneficial in scenarios with limited computational resources
    or asynchronous evaluations. It employs a successive halving strategy to efficiently
    allocate resources to promising configurations, eliminating less favorable ones.
    Both Bayesian optimization and ASHA contribute significantly to automating the
    selection of suitable models, particularly in the context of temperature forecasting,
    where manual selection can be time-consuming and subjective. The combination of
    these algorithms in this study represents a novel and valuable contribution to
    the field, showcasing their effectiveness in optimizing hyperparameters and improving
    the overall accuracy of temperature prediction models. A state-of-the-art approach
    for both global and local hyperparameter optimization is known as Bayesian optimization
    (BO) [37]. BO has been shown to outperform alternative methods like grid search
    and random search on various challenging optimization benchmarks [66]. In the
    quest for discovering the best hyperparameters, BO often surpasses the abilities
    of domain experts [67]. BO is versatile and applicable to a wide range of problem
    scenarios, accommodating both integer and real-valued hyperparameters. BO relies
    on the selection of a prior function and an acquisition function. The acquisition
    function, typically employing Expected Improvement (EI), works in conjunction
    with a Gaussian process prior [37]. The choice of covariance function, particularly
    the use of the Matern52 kernel, is crucial In determining the effectiveness of
    Gaussian processes [37]. With respect to 𝑥 in a bounded domain, the BO algorithm
    process seeks to minimize a scalar objective function, 𝑓(𝑥) . Depending on whether
    the function is stochastic or deterministic, it may yield different results when
    evaluated at the same point 𝑥 . The variable 𝑥 can have continuous real values,
    integers, or categorical components, referring to a discrete set of names. The
    key components in the minimization process include [68]: A Gaussian process model
    of 𝑓(𝑥 ). A Bayesian update procedure for modifying the Gaussian process model
    at each new evaluation of 𝑓(𝑥) . An acquisition function 𝑎(𝑥) (based on the Gaussian
    process model of 𝑓 ) that is maximized to determine the next point 𝑥 for evaluation.
    The ASHA [38] optimization algorithm is an upgraded variant of the successive
    halving algorithm (SHA) [69,70]. ASHA is a user-friendly hyperparameter optimization
    technique that leverages aggressive early stopping and is particularly suited
    for tackling large-scale hyperparameter optimization problems [38]. It has demonstrated
    superior performance on a workload employing 500 workers, exhibits linear scalability
    with the number of workers in distributed environments, and is well-suited for
    tasks involving substantial parallelism [38]. An advantage of ASHA is that the
    user does not need to specify in advance how many configurations they want to
    evaluate, because it operates asynchronously. However, it still requires the same
    inputs as SHA. A comprehensive explanation of ASHA can be found in the original
    work by Li et al. [38] and is not repeated in this effort. To the best of the
    authors’ knowledge, this is the first instance of the Bayesian and ASHA optimization
    algorithms being employed to tune the hyperparameters of multiple ML algorithms
    to automatically select the best model for forecasting multi-step-ahead daily
    𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 . In this study, forecasting models were developed by fine-tuning
    hyperparameters of seven widely utilized ML algorithms, aiming to identify the
    optimal model for forecasting daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 . Table 2 outlines the candidate
    ML algorithms and their adjustable hyperparameters. The hyperparameters were tuned
    using both the Bayesian and ASHA optimization algorithms, and a comparison was
    performed with respect to training time and accuracy. The best model was selected
    based on its ability to yield the lowest training and test errors, employing either
    the Bayesian or ASHA optimization algorithms. Table 2. Machine learning algorithms
    and their tunable hyperparameters. Forecasting models were developed for one-,
    two-, three-, four-, and five-days-ahead forecasting of daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛
    using data from three weather stations. Consequently, a total of 30 forecasting
    models were chosen by applying Bayesian and ASHA optimization techniques. Each
    training dataset, consisting of input–output pairs, was divided into a training
    set, containing 80% of the data, and a test set, containing the remaining 20%.
    To enhance computational efficiency, both algorithm runs were executed in the
    parallel computing environment of MATLAB (MATLAB, 2021a). 2.6. Statistical Indices
    for Performance Evaluation The following statistical indices were used to evaluate
    the performances of the developed temperature forecast models. The accuracy index
    is an evaluation metric that compares the proportion of accurate forecasts made
    by a model to all forecasts made. The higher the accuracy score is, the better
    the model performance will be. The ideal value of accuracy is 1.0. The correlation
    coefficient, R, denotes the strength of linear regression between the observed
    and forecasted values; however, for this linear relationship, the highest possible
    value (ideal) of R = 1.0 can be obtained despite the fact that the slope and ordinate
    intercept are different from 1.0 and 0, respectively [53]. Therefore, other indices
    need to be used to justify the model performance. A normalized/dimensionless measure
    of residual variance, Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NS) metric, is calculated
    by dividing residual variance by variance of observed dataset. NS ≤ 0.4, 0.40
    < NS ≤ 0.50, 0.50 < NS ≤ 0.65, 0.65 < NS ≤ 0.75, and 0.75 < NS ≤ 1.00 are categories
    that are labeled as unsatisfactory, acceptable, satisfactory, good, and exceptionally
    good, respectively [71,72]. Willmott’s Index of Agreement (IOA) [73] is able to
    detect additive and proportional differences in the observed and model-forecasted
    means and variances. The IOA usually ranges from −1 to +1, with higher values
    indicating greater model performance. Nevertheless, the IOA is often overly sensitive
    to extreme values due to the squared differences [74]. The Kling Gupta Efficiency
    (KGE) [75,76], which combines the three components of model errors (i.e., correlation,
    bias, and ratio of variances or coefficients of variation) in a more balanced
    way, has been widely used for evaluating the prediction ability of models in recent
    years. Generally, the RMSE criterion measures the error of the model. A lower
    value of RMSE indicates a higher forecasting power of the model. However, the
    value of RMSE largely depends on the magnitude of the data, and therefore, a lower
    value of RMSE does not necessarily mean a better forecasting performance. To overcome
    this issue, the NRMSE criterion was used to eliminate the dimensionality effect
    of the data. Model performance is said to be excellent when NRMSE is less than
    0.1, good when NRMSE is between 0.1 and 0.2, fair when NRMSE is between 0.2 and
    0.3, and poor when NRMSE is greater than 0.3 [77,78]. The Mean Absolute Percentage
    Relative Error (MAPRE) is the most common measure used to evaluate a model’s prediction
    performance, probably because the variable’s units are scaled to percentage units,
    which makes it easier to understand. It works best if there are no extremes to
    the data (and no zeros). It is often used as a loss function in regression analysis
    and model evaluation. Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is a resistant measure of
    variability, as it relies on the median as the estimate of the center of the distribution
    and on the absolute difference rather than the squared difference. Because the
    MAD is the median deviation of scores from the overall median, not all observations
    are equally weighted in this measure of dispersion. The clear advantage of MAD
    is the avoidance of influence by outliers. However, it has its own problems: if
    the distribution is actually normal, there is a loss of efficiency, in that it
    does not make as much use of the information as what is available in the data
    [79]. The MBE criterion provides an estimation of whether the developed model
    systematically under- or over-predicts the actual values. The MBE is usually not
    used as a measure of the model error, as high individual errors in prediction
    can also produce a low MBE. MBE is primarily used to estimate the average bias
    in the model and to decide if any steps need to be taken to correct the model
    bias [80]. The Percentage Bias (PBIAS) measures the average tendency of the simulated
    values to be larger or smaller than their observed ones. The optimal value of
    PBIAS is 0.0, with low-magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation.
    Positive values indicate overestimation bias, whereas negative values indicate
    model underestimation bias. Accuracy [81]: 𝐴𝑐𝑐=1−𝑎𝑏𝑠(𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑇 𝑖,𝑃 − 𝑇 𝑖,𝑆 𝑇 𝑖,𝑆

    performance evaluation indices, as discussed in the previous section, were employed
    to assess the performance of the various forecasting models. In the subsequent
    paragraphs, the performances of the identified top-performing models on the test
    dataset (selected based on their performance on both the training and test datasets)
    for the five forecasting horizons at the three stations are presented. Table 3
    provides a comparison of the best models that were selected by the Bayesian and
    ASHA optimization algorithms, considering log(1 + valLoss) values and training
    time for multi-step-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 forecasting. As can be observed from the log(1
    + valLoss) value presented in Table 3, the Bayesian optimization algorithm generally
    outperformed the ASHA algorithm in selecting the best model. However, in terms
    of training time, the ASHA algorithm demonstrated faster convergence in finding
    the optimal model parameters compared to the Bayesian algorithm. However, while
    the ASHA algorithm showed competitive performance in terms of training time, the
    Bayesian algorithm also achieved convergence within acceptable time limits. Therefore,
    in cases where training time is not a critical factor, the Bayesian optimization
    can be used to find optimal model parameters for selecting the best models for
    a specific task. On the other hand, when training time is a more important consideration
    than model accuracy, the ASHA optimization algorithm is advisable. Notably, there
    were instances where the ASHA algorithm outperformed the Bayesian algorithm in
    both log(1 + valLoss) and training time, such as for the one-step-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥
    forecast at Barishal station and four-step-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 forecast at Ishurdi station.
    In cases where the Bayesian algorithm showed superior performance based on log(1
    + valLoss) values, the differences were not substantial, while there was a significant
    difference in training times between the two algorithms. Table 3. Comparison of
    the Bayesian and ASHA optimization algorithm-tuned best models for forecasting
    maximum temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) at the weather stations. Boldface indicates models
    with lowest log (1 + valLoss) values. Table 4 presents the training and test performance
    results of the Bayesian and ASHA algorithm-tuned forecast models for maximum temperatures
    ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) at the weather stations. At this stage, the final models were selected
    based on the RMSE criterion: the best models were those producing the lowest difference
    between the training and test RMSE values. This ensures that the selected best
    models were neither over-trained nor under-trained. The data in Table 4 reveal
    that the ASHA algorithm-tuned best models produced the lowest difference between
    the training and test RMSE values in most instances (forecasting horizons and
    weather stations) for forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 values. Although the Bayesian algorithm
    required a longer time to converge to optimal solutions for selecting the best
    models, it excelled in three specific instances: the one-day- and five-days-ahead
    𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 forecast at Barishal station, and the three-days-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 forecast at
    Gazipur station (as indicated in Table 4). A complete list of the selected top-performing
    models can be found in Table 7. Table 4. Comparison of the training and testing
    performance of the Bayesian and ASHA optimization-tuned best models to forecast
    maximum temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) at the weather stations. Boldface indicates lowest
    difference between the training and test RMSE values. Table 5 provides a comparative
    performance evaluation of the Bayesian and ASHA algorithm-tuned best models for
    forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 at the weather stations, based on log (1 + valLoss) values and
    training time requirements. Table 5. Comparison of the Bayesian and ASHA optimization
    algorithm-tuned best models for forecasting minimum temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) at
    the weather stations. Boldface indicates models with lowest log (1 + valLoss)
    values. The results in Table 5 reveal that, in terms of log (1 + valLoss) values,
    the Bayesian algorithm-tuned best models outperformed the ASHA algorithm-tuned
    models in all instances except for the two-days-ahead forecast at the Gazipur
    station, where the ASHA algorithm-tuned GPR model was found to be the top-performing
    best model. Moreover, the ASHA algorithm-tuned models exhibited faster convergence
    to optimal solutions for parameter values in comparison to the Bayesian algorithm-tuned
    models in all instances. Additionally, the differences between the training errors
    (log (1 + valLoss)) produced by the Bayesian and ASHA algorithms for selecting
    the best models were relatively small for all instances. In summary, when computational
    time is not a limiting factor, the Bayesian algorithm is a suitable choice for
    searching for the best models (Table 5). However, it is essential to carefully
    evaluate the differences between the training and test errors of the best models
    that are produced by the Bayesian and ASHA algorithms before making a definitive
    decision on model selection. The comparison of the training and testing performance
    between the Bayesian and ASHA optimization-tuned best models for forecasting 𝑇
    𝑚𝑖𝑛 at the weather stations, as assessed by the RMSE criterion, is presented in
    Table 6. It is evident from Table 6 that both the Bayesian and ASHA algorithms
    exhibited similar performance in selecting the top-performing best models across
    all forecasting horizons and at all weather stations. The Bayesian algorithm outperformed
    in seven instances, while the ASHA algorithm provided top-performing forecast
    models in eight instances based on the lowest differences between the training
    and test RMSE values (Table 6). Overall, the selected top-performing best models
    demonstrated acceptable results according to the RMSE criterion. However, further
    validation of the forecasting performance of the selected models is required by
    computing other performance evaluation indices on the test dataset. A comprehensive
    performance evaluation of the selected top-performing models based on several
    statistical indices can be found in Table 8 and Table 9 and Figure 3 and Figure
    4. Figure 4. Performance of the best models on test dataset in terms of forecasting
    maximum temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) under various forecast horizons at the weather
    stations. Table 6. Comparison of the training and testing performance of the Bayesian
    and ASHA optimization-tuned best models to forecast minimum temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛
    ) at the weather stations. Boldface indicates lowest difference between the training
    and test RMSE values. The complete list of the selected best models for different
    weather stations under five forecasting horizons, based on log (1 + valLoss),
    RMSE, training time, and differences between the training and test RMSE (as presented
    in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6), is provided in Table 7. Table 7. Selected
    best models at different weather stations under the five forecasting horizons.
    Following the selection of the best-performing models, they were utilized to forecast
    multi-step-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values on the test dataset at the respective
    weather stations. To evaluate the forecasting performance, various statistical
    performance indices were computed and are presented in Table 8 and Table 9. Additionally,
    the results are visualized in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Table 8. Performance of the
    best models on test dataset to forecast maximum temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) under various
    forecast horizons at the weather stations. Table 9. Performance of the best models
    on test dataset to forecast minimum temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) under various forecast
    horizons at the weather stations. Table 8 presents a comprehensive overview of
    the performance of the best models in forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 under five different forecast
    horizons at the weather stations. It can be observed from Table 8 that the selected
    models consistently produced lower values of various performance metrics such
    as RMSE, NRMSE, MAPRE, MAD, MBE, and PBIAS. This indicates that the models have
    demonstrated improved accuracy in forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 . It is also inferred from
    the results presented in Table 8 that the forecasting performance slightly decreased
    with an increase in the forecast horizon. This observation aligns with prior findings
    reported in studies by Rahman et al. [42] and Barzegar et al. [89], which indicated
    that ML-based forecast models tend to exhibit reduced accuracy as the forecast
    horizon extends further into the future. The RMSE values were pretty small for
    all selected models across the weather stations. Small RMSE values generally indicate
    that the models’ predictions are closely aligned with the actual observations,
    suggesting a high level of accuracy in the forecasts. The NRMSE values were consistently
    less than 0.1 for all instances. An NRMSE below 0.1 is considered excellent performance
    in forecasting, as it indicates that the forecasted values are very close to the
    actual values [77,78]. The MAPRE values are also within acceptable ranges. For
    Barishal, Gzipur, and Ishurdi stations, the MAPRE values were below 8% (ranging
    from 5.091% to 7.954% for different forecast horizons), 7% (ranging from 4.737%
    to 6.468% for different forecast horizons), and 6% (ranging from 4.728% to 5.426%
    for different forecast horizons), respectively, depending on the forecast horizons.
    Since a MAPRE value below 10% is deemed acceptable for ML-based forecast models
    [90], these results suggest that the selected models are producing forecasts that
    meet or exceed acceptable standards. In summary, these performance indices demonstrate
    that the selected best forecast models are capable of producing accurate and reliable
    forecasts for 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 values at the weather stations, as evidenced by their small
    RMSE and NRMSE values, as well as MAPRE values that are well within the acceptable
    range. The MAD values are also reported as being acceptable for all models. These
    values ranged from 0.634 °C for a one-day-ahead forecast at Gazipur station to
    1.070 °C for a five-days-ahead forecast at Barishal station. The lower the MAD
    is, the closer the forecasts are to the actual values, indicating accurate model
    forecasts. Additionally, the models produced smaller values of MBE and PBIAS,
    which were pretty close to the optimal value of 0.0. MBE quantifies the average
    bias (overestimation or underestimation) in the forecasts, while PBIAS provides
    a measure of the Percentage Bias. The models produced low-magnitude values of
    both MBE and PBIAS, indicating that they are making reasonably accurate forecasts.
    Some models show negative MBE and PBIAS values, indicating a slight underestimation
    bias, particularly for Gazipur and Ishurdi stations and for three-days-ahead forecasts
    at Barishal station. On the other hand, positive MBE and PBIAS values are observed
    for one-day-, two-days-, four-days-, and five-days-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 forecasts at the
    Barishal station, suggesting a slight overestimation bias (Table 8). These biases
    are of smaller magnitude, indicating that the models tend to slightly under-predict
    or over-predict temperature values, but the deviations from the actual values
    are not substantial. In summary, the forecast models are delivering forecasts
    with acceptable levels of accuracy, as indicated by the MAD, MBE, and PBIAS values.
    While some models exhibit slight underestimation or overestimation biases, these
    biases are relatively small, and the forecasts are still considered accurate.
    These results provide confidence in the performance of the selected forecast models.
    Table 9 presents a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the top-performing
    models for forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values under the five forecast horizons at the weather
    stations. It can be seen from Table 9 that the overall forecasting performances
    of the models are acceptable, although the models showed slightly poor performance
    with respect to the computed RMSE, NRMSE, and MAPRE values when compared to the
    forecasting of 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (Table 8). Nevertheless, the models produced lower RMSE values
    (Table 9). The computed NRMSE criterion suggests that the model performances were
    excellent (NRMSE < 0.1) to good (NRMSE values slightly higher than 0.1, i.e.,
    NRMSE > 0.1 and NRMSE < 0.2) according to the ranges reported in Heinemann et
    al. [77] and Li et al. [78]. On the other hand, the models produced lower MAD,
    MBE, and PBIS values compared to those for the models developed for forecasting
    𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (Table 8 and Table 9). It is noted that the computed MBE and PBIAS values
    were pretty close to the ideal value of 0.0. According to the MBE criterion, the
    models produced very small amounts of underestimated biases, as indicated by the
    negative MBE values for all forecasting horizons and at all weather stations (Table
    9). Similarly, the PBIAS criterion also suggests that mostly underestimated biases
    existed, except for the model developed to forecast 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 for two-step-ahead at
    the Barishal weather station. The findings are reported in the form of bar diagrams,
    especially to demonstrate the model performance based on some other statistical
    performance indices. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate the models’ performance
    with respect to accuracy, R, NS, IOA, and KGE criteria. These performance indices
    are referred to as benefit indices, because higher values of these indices indicate
    improved model performance. Figure 4 shows the performance of the best models
    on the test dataset when forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 across different forecast horizons
    at the respective weather stations. This visual representation allows for a quick
    and easy assessment of how well the models are performing and how their performance
    varies with different lead times (forecast horizons). Figure 5. Performance of
    the best models on test dataset to forecast minimum temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) under
    various forecast horizons at the weather stations. Figure 4 reveals important
    insights into the performance of the best models for forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 under different
    forecast horizons at the weather stations. It is perceived from Figure 4 that
    the best models consistently demonstrate excellent performance with regard to
    the accuracy and IOA criteria, where accuracy values are close to 1, and IOA values
    exceed 0.8 for all forecast horizons. This indicates that the models produce forecasts
    that closely align with observed data and show a strong agreement with the reference
    measurements. Notably, the accuracy criterion does not exhibit a decreasing trend
    with an increase in the forecast horizon. In other words, the models maintain
    high accuracy regardless of the lead time. This is a positive finding, suggesting
    that the models are reliable for both short-term and longer-term forecasts. However,
    the R, NS, IOA, and KGE values indicate that the model performance is indeed influenced
    by the forecast horizon. These indices suggest that the forecasting performance
    tends to decrease as the forecast horizon increases, which is consistent with
    prior research [42,89]. R values are higher than 0.8 for the first and second
    forecast horizons (one- and two-step-ahead forecasts) at all weather stations.
    However, a decrease in R values is observed as the forecast horizon extends, with
    the lowest R value (0.771) occurring at the fifth forecast horizon for the Ishurdi
    station. In general, model performances were relatively poor with respect to the
    NS and KGE criteria (Figure 4). The findings of this research is in good agreement
    with the findings presented in Müller and Piché [91], who stated that ML-based
    models often showed contrasting performance with respect to different performance
    evaluation indices. These findings collectively suggest that the models are especially
    well suited for shorter-term forecasts, but they still provide valuable forecasts
    for longer lead times, albeit with slightly reduced performance. In order to forecast
    𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 at the weather stations over a range of forecast horizons, the best models
    were tested against the test dataset. The findings are presented in Figure 5,
    which shows the performance of the best models for forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 under various
    forecast horizons at the weather stations. Figure 5 suggests that the selected
    top models performed exceptionally well for all forecast horizons and at all the
    weather stations. This is particularly evident from the accuracy and IOA values,
    which consistently exceed 0.95. Such high accuracy and IOA values indicate excellent
    model performance, suggesting that the models generate forecasts that closely
    match the observed data. Similar to the 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 forecast, the accuracy of the models
    remains high across different forecast horizons, with accuracy values close to
    1. This indicates that the models maintain their high forecasting accuracy regardless
    of the lead time. Contrary to accuracy, other performance evaluation indices,
    including NS, IOA, and KGE, display a diminishing trend as the prediction horizon
    is extended. This is in line with the common observation that the forecasting
    performance tends to decrease as the forecast horizon increases, which aligns
    with the results observed for 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 forecasting. It is important to note that
    the R values appear to be consistent across all weather stations. These values
    are high, exceeding 0.90, indicating a strong correlation between the model forecasts
    and the observed data. In general, the best models appeared to perform better
    across all forecast horizons based on the R (>0.90), NS (>0.81), and KGE (>0.87)
    criterion values. Overall, the findings from Figure 5 suggest that the selected
    models perform remarkably well in forecasting 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 over various forecast horizons
    and at different weather stations. The models exhibit high accuracy, strong correlations,
    and consistent performance across forecast horizons, even though other indices
    show a slight decrease with an increasing forecast lead time. In a comparative
    context, the results for 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 forecasting seem to outperform those for 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥
    forecasting. This improvement in 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 forecasting performance might be attributed
    to the quality and volume of the collected data. High-quality and abundant data
    often lead to more accurate forecasts. While direct comparisons among the results
    presented in this research are hindered by the diverse study conditions and modeling
    approaches employed, an indirect evaluation was conducted by contrasting the computed
    performance indices in this study with those in previous research. For one-day-ahead
    minimum temperature forecasts, R2 values of 0.939, 0.911, and 0.901 were achieved
    across the Barishal, Gazipur, and Ishurdi stations, respectively. Conversely,
    for one-day-ahead maximum temperature forecasts, R2 values of 0.819, 0.764, and
    0.633 were obtained for the same stations. These results surpass the outcomes
    of previous studies utilizing CNN (~0.5), LSTM (~0.6), and CNN-LSTM (~0.7) for
    one-day-ahead temperature forecasts [33]. Moreover, our findings compare favorably
    or even outperform those of Ebtehaz et al. [27], who utilized IORELM for 10 h
    ahead temperature forecasts (R = 0.95, NSE = 0.89, RMSE = 3.74, MAE = 1.92). Our
    best models yielded RMSE values of approximately 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C for one-day-ahead
    maximum and minimum temperature forecasts, respectively. The detailed statistical
    performance indices for the proposed best models are provided in Figure 4 and
    Figure 5, as well as in Table 8 and Table 9. Furthermore, our research outcomes
    stand up well against those of Fister et al. [29], focusing on the temperature
    dataset of the Paris region. Our proposed best model exhibited superior performance
    compared to Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, Adaboost, RF, and CNN in terms of
    MSE values. Alomar et al. [17] identified the SVR model as the top performer for
    daily temperature forecasting, achieving an RMSE value of 3.592 °C, which is higher
    than the RMSE values produced by our proposed best models for both minimum and
    maximum temperature forecasts across the three weather stations (refer to Table
    8 and Table 9). In terms of the RMSE criterion, our proposed best models demonstrated
    comparable or superior performance (RMSE ~ 2 °C for both minimum and maximum temperatures)
    compared to the ANN (RMSE ~ 3 °C), GEP (RMSE ~ 3 °C), and HBA-ANN (RMSE ~ 2 °C)
    models that were developed for the coldest and warmest regions globally [23].
    Based on this comprehensive comparison, it can be argued that our proposed best
    models exhibit acceptable and sometimes superior performance compared to recently
    proposed machine and deep learning models for temperature forecasting. However,
    it is important to note that direct comparisons are challenging due to variations
    in data and study locations. The research on automated model selection using Bayesian
    optimization and the asynchronous successive halving algorithm for predicting
    daily minimum and maximum temperatures holds crucial implications for the agricultural
    domain. Accurate temperature predictions are fundamental to agricultural planning,
    impacting crop growth, yield estimation, and resource allocation. The application
    of Bayesian optimization ensures a thorough exploration of model parameters, enhancing
    the precision of temperature forecasts, which is crucial for optimal crop management.
    The incorporation of the asynchronous successive halving algorithm contributes
    to computational efficiency in finding the optimal hyperparameters for the selected
    best models. As a result, this research has the potential to significantly improve
    agricultural productivity, resource utilization, and resilience to climate variability,
    ultimately benefiting farmers and stakeholders across the agricultural supply
    chain. 4. Conclusions Accurate and reliable forecasting of daily maximum ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥
    ) and minimum ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) temperatures can be effectively utilized in the development
    of a sustainable and efficient agricultural water management strategy. However,
    due to nonlinear interactions between temperatures and other explanatory variables,
    as well as their multi-scale behavior that changes over time, producing reliable
    temperature ( 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥  and  𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) forecasts is often challenging. The prerequisites
    for creating accurate ML-based forecast models include selecting only the most
    influential input variables from a list of prospective input variables and optimizing
    model parameters. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative
    approach for selecting the most influential input variables and determining the
    best predictive models for forecasting daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values. These methods
    were combined with Bayesian and ASHA hyperparameter tuning to perform automated
    model parameter estimation. Notably, this study is the first to utilize the Bayesian
    and ASHA algorithms for automating the model selection process to provide accurate
    𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 forecasts at different weather stations in Bangladesh. Furthermore,
    the study provides a comparison of the best models that are tuned with Bayesian
    and ASHA algorithms. The selected best models were explored for one-, two-, three-,
    four-, and five-days-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 forecasting. The top-performing models
    for different forecasting horizons (1-day-, 2-days-, 3-days-, 4-days-, and 5-days-ahead)
    at the three weather stations were identified. The results demonstrate the suitability
    of these models in forecasting multi-step-ahead (5-days-ahead) daily 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and
    𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values, as indicated by the computed performance evaluation indices. The
    findings of this research demonstrated the ability and practical applicability
    of the proposed models in forecasting days-ahead 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 values at the
    weather stations. The primary objective of this research is to propose an ML-based
    methodology that is capable of accurately approximating daily temperature fluctuations
    and providing multi-step-ahead temperature forecasts. Importantly, the proposed
    methodology can be applied to other regions with diverse data ranges. Given the
    varying time intervals in the data from the three weather stations, the ML-based
    modeling approaches were developed separately for each station. The duration of
    data collection was determined based on the availability of data from the selected
    weather stations within the study area. Despite the absence of data for specific
    time intervals at some weather stations, the available dataset, spanning approximately
    a reasonable duration, remains sufficient and valuable for addressing the research
    objectives. Therefore, we believe that our findings are relevant and contribute
    significantly to the advancement of the field. Indeed, utilizing similar interval
    data for all stations and developing a model for one station, then validating
    its generalization capability at other stations, would be an interesting topic
    for future research. This approach could provide insights into the transferability
    and robustness of the proposed ML-based methodology across different weather stations
    and regions. The research paper presented a novel approach for automated model
    selection using Bayesian and ASHA algorithms. The findings contribute to the field
    of climate science and weather forecasting, providing valuable insights into improving
    temperature prediction models through automation and optimization techniques.
    The proposed methodology can be further extended and applied to other domains
    requiring accurate and efficient model selection. In this research, a limited
    set of ML algorithms was employed for selecting the best model, with the assistance
    of Bayesian and ASHA optimization algorithms. To broaden the scope of future studies,
    a more comprehensive array of ML algorithms could be explored for hyperparameter
    tuning using optimization algorithms. Additionally, the inclusion of a few deep
    learning algorithms in the pool of prospective models could be considered, enabling
    a more thorough exploration of the best-performing model through parameter tuning.
    The use of the Bayesian and ASHA optimization algorithms to fine-tune hyperparameters
    across multiple ML algorithms facilitates the automatic selection of the most
    effective forecasting model. It is noteworthy that alternative optimization algorithms,
    such as the genetic algorithm (GA) or particle swarm optimization (PSO), could
    also be investigated in future studies. However, it is essential to mention that
    while incorporating a diverse set of ML and optimization algorithms could enhance
    the depth of the study, it comes with the trade-off of increased complexity and
    time consumption in hyperparameter tuning across multiple ML models. This potential
    intricacy may pose challenges in achieving optimum results within the set parameters.

    crop evapotranspiration (ET0) accurately is essential for regional water resource
    planning and irrigation scheduling (Shiri et al., 2014). However, measuring ET0
    directly through experiments is usually restricted by high labour and time consumption
    (Xing et al., 2022). The FAO56–recommended Penman–Monteith (P-M) model is widely
    adopted as the standard method for ET0 estimation (Allen et al., 1998). Still,
    limited meteorological data usually restrict its application worldwide, especially
    global solar radiation (Rs) (Xing et al., 2023). Because of the cost of expensive
    measuring instruments, weather stations measuring Rs directly cover a limited
    number of locations worldwide, especially in developing countries (Jahani et al.,
    2017). Various weather datasets containing Rs values have been produced, including
    the NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (NASA POWER) (Chandler et al.,
    2013), the ERA-Interim reanalysis products (Dee et al., 2011), and the Japanese
    Meteorological Agency (JRA-55) (Kobayashi et al., 2015). These datasets provide
    valuable references for the relevant research driven by Rs but usually have lag
    time and unsatisfactory performance for the Rs products. Hence, real-time Rs estimation
    is always needed to meet various application requirements. Previous studies have
    established various estimation models for Rs, such as (1) the interpolation model
    with limited Rs observations (Rivington et al., 2006), (2) the empirical regression
    model between Rs and meteorological and geographic variables (Bristow & Campbell,
    1984; Makadea & Jamil, 2018), (3) the satellite–based model with direct measurement
    of surface shortwave radiation (He et al., 2015), and (4) the radiation transfer
    models (Pawlak et al., 2004). Empirical methods for Rs estimation have been widely
    established based on different input variables considering the low data requirements
    and computation. These statistical models are divided into sunshine- (Ångström,
    1924; Naserpour et al., 2020), cloud- (Badescu & Dumitrescu, 2015; Ehnberg & Bollen,
    2005), and temperature-based models (Feng et al., 2019; Yacef et al., 2014). Studies
    have shown that sunshine–based models outperformed other models (Abdul-Aziz et
    al., 1993; De, Souza, et al., 2016; Trnka et al., 2005), especially the Ångström–Prescott
    (A-P) method (Prescott, 1940). The A-P formula is developed based on limited inputs
    and a simple linear relationship and thus has been widely used in ET0 estimation
    with missing Rs data (Allen et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2022). The default values
    recommended by the FAO–56 document (e.g., a = 0.25 and b = 0.50) have been widely
    used since data were always inadequate for calibrating these coefficients (Allen
    et al., 1998). Unfortunately, Sabziparvar et al. (2013) and Liu et al. (2014)
    have reported remarkable spatial variations in the A-P coefficients that can cause
    significant errors in regional and national Rs and ET0 estimates. Thus, calibrating
    the A-P coefficients with actual local Rs measurements is essential for minimizing
    Rs errors (Peng et al., 2022). In addition to the spatial variation, temporal
    fluctuation of the A-P coefficients has also attracted the attention of researchers
    (Liu, Mei, Li, Zhang, Wang, et al., 2009). No consensus on time–dependent or fixed
    A-P coefficients for Rs estimation has been reached. Soler (1990) found that monthly
    a and b coefficients outperformed yearly ones, and Tymvios et al. (2005) drew
    a similar conclusion. Further, other studies report that time–dependent coefficients
    obtained similar accuracy (Almorox & Hontoria, 2004; Ertekin & Evrendilek, 2007)
    or worse (Hussain et al., 1999) Rs estimation. Additionally, the A-P coefficients
    are usually estimated through single- (Hassan et al., 2016) or multi-factor (Liu,
    Mei, Li, Wang, Jensen, et al., 2009) empirical regression models. These traditional
    models are usually inefficient in dealing with the complex nonlinear relationships
    between input factors and target variables (Kisi & Parmar, 2016). Further, input
    variables are usually set for a specific empirical model, which cannot always
    be done (Ming et al., 2015). Machine learning is widely adopted for Rs and ET0
    estimates due to the flexible combination of predictors and satisfactory accuracy
    in dealing with nonlinear problems (Fan et al., 2020; Gürel et al., 2020). However,
    considerable uncertainty can be generated in scenarios different from those in
    the training processes since machine learning usually performs as “black box”
    without a physical basis (Dong et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2018). Therefore, this
    study evaluated several empirical regression models and machine learning methods
    to estimate the A-P coefficients for ET0 at different time scales with missing
    Rs data. The main objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the spatiotemporal
    variation of the A-P coefficients, (2) assess the performance of time–dependent
    (daily and monthly) and fixed (yearly and FAO–recommended) A-P coefficients in
    daily Rs and ET0 estimation, and (3) evaluate different empirical regression models
    and machine learning methods in estimating the A-P coefficients across all of
    China. The findings were expected to facilitate the application of the P-M and
    A-P models in ET0 estimation for sites without Rs measurements in China. 2 MATERIALS
    AND METHODS 2.1 Study area The four main climatic zones are the mountain plateau
    zone (MPZ), the temperate continental zone (TCZ), the temperate monsoon zone (TMZ),
    and the subtropical monsoon zone (SMZ) (Figure 1). The average elevations of the
    MPZ, TCZ, TMZ, and SMZ are 4236, 912, 288, and 611 m, respectively. There is a
    noticeable difference in mean annual precipitation for these four climatic zones.
    The most arid and humid zones are TCZ (193 mm) and the SMZ (1360 mm) in northwest
    and southeast China, while the TMZ (460 mm) and MPZ (591 mm) share a similar annual
    precipitation. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Study area and distribution
    of the 80 national solar radiation measuring stations (red crosses) and 839 weather
    stations without solar radiation measurements (black dots) in the four climatic
    zones of MPZ (the mountain plateau), TCZ (the temperate continental zone), TMZ
    (the temperate monsoon zone), and SMZ (the subtropical monsoon zone) in China.
    The acronyms are the same below. 2.2 Datasets Daily measurements of Rs were collected
    from 80 Rs national measuring stations in China (Figure 1 and Table S1). There
    were 7, 16, 23, and 34 Rs stations in the MPZ, TCZ, TMZ, and SMZ zones, respectively.
    Daily meteorological measurements in this dataset including daily global solar
    radiation (Rs, MJ m−2), sunshine hours (n, h), maximum (Tmax, °C) and minimum
    air temperature (Tmin, °C), average air temperature (Tmean, °C), wind speed (U,
    m s−1), precipitation (P, mm), and relative humidity (RH, %). Additionally, except
    for Rs, regular measurements were collected from 839 weather stations. The two
    datasets also contained each site''s latitude, longitude, and altitude information
    and were obtained from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). Weather
    measurements will be omitted for the day with the following two conditions: (1)
    missing measurements for either Rs or n; (2) Rs/Ra ≥1 or n/N ≥ 1 (Persaud et al.,
    1997). 2.3 Description of the Ångström–Prescott (A-P) formula and penman–Monteith
    model Ångström (1924) established a linear relationship between Rs/Rs0 and n/N
    in 1924, where Rs0 represents the solar radiation on a sunny day, n represents
    the sunshine hour, and N represents the day length. We use Equation (1) to estimate
    the value of N: (1) where ωs is the sunset hour angle in rad. Prescott (1940)
    suggested replacing Rs0 with Ra (extra-terrestrial radiation) due to the difficulty
    in measuring Rs0. In this way, the Ångström formula was translated into the Ångström–Prescott
    (A-P) format (Equation 2): (2) where a (0–1) and b (0–1) are fundamental coefficients,
    and the sum of a and b is the transmissivity of clear sky. We further adopt Equation
    (3) to estimate Ra: (3) where Gsc represents the solar constant, 0.0820 MJ m−2 min−1;
    dr is the inverse square of the Earth-Sun relative distance; φ is the latitude,
    rad; δ is the solar declination, rad. The standard Penman–Monteith model (or P-M
    equation, Equation 4) has been recommended as the standard method for estimating
    ET0 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Allen
    et al., 1998): (4) where Rn is the net radiation above the canopy, MJ m−2 d−1;
    G represents the soil heat flux density, MJ m−2 d−1; γ is the air psychrometric,
    kPa °C −1; Tmean is the mean daily air temperature, °C; u2 represents the wind
    speed 2 m above ground in m s−1; es and ea are the saturation and actual vapour
    pressures, kPa; Δ is the slope of the vapour pressure curve, kPa °C−1. 2.4 Generating
    the optimal time–scale A-P coefficients for Rs and ET0 Previous studies have indicated
    the great spatiotemporal variations in the two fundamental coefficients (a and
    b) of the A-P formula. Hence, using fixed A-P coefficients can cause large errors
    in Rs estimation and further generate significant errors in ET0 with the P-M model
    (PM-ET0). However, local calibration of the coefficients a and b requires mass
    meteorological data, including Rs and other variables. Unfortunately, long-term
    measurements of Rs are always scarce for most areas worldwide. This study established
    a framework to generate the A-P coefficients with the optimal time scale for Rs
    and ET0 estimation over all of China (Figure 2). First, the temporal (daily, monthly,
    and yearly) and spatial variations of the A-P coefficients were assessed based
    on the benchmark values of 80 solar radiation measuring stations. Then, the performance
    of the three different time-scale A-P coefficients was evaluated in calculating
    Rs and further estimating ET0. Finally, the empirical regression functions and
    machine learning algorithms were employed to estimate the A-P coefficients with
    common meteorological and geographic variables. The optimal method was selected
    to estimate the A-P coefficients of 839 regular weather stations without direct
    Rs measurements. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flowchart of the generation
    of the optimal time-scale fundamental coefficients (a and b) of the Ångström-Prescott
    (A-P) formula in Rs and ET0 estimation for the entire China. Estimation of ET0
    is conducted based on the Penman-Monteith (P-M) model. The SVM, Cubist, BP, and
    ELM represent four different machine learning methods of the support vector machine,
    Cubist model tree, back propagation neural network, and extreme learning machine,
    respectively. 2.4.1 Benchmark values of the A-P coefficients in different time
    scales This study focused on the variations of yearly, monthly, and daily values
    of the A-P coefficients. First, the benchmark values of coefficients a and b were
    obtained for the three time scales based on least squares regression for each
    of the 80 Rs measuring stations. All of the Rs measurements were used to fit the
    regression function for the yearly A-P coefficients. For the monthly A-P coefficients,
    the Rs measurements in the target month were used to fit the given month. The
    target-day Rs measurements were used to fit the A-P coefficients for the given
    day. Taking a station with 50 years of Rs measurements as an example, the number
    of data involved in the calibration of a and b were 18 250 (approx. 365 d × 50
    a), 1500 (approx. 30 d × 50 a for each month), and 50 (50 a for each day) for
    the yearly, monthly, and daily scale, respectively. 2.4.2 Evaluating time–scale
    A-P coefficients for Rs and ET0 estimation The benchmark (daily, monthly, and
    yearly) and FAO–recommended values of the A-P coefficients were evaluated in the
    estimations of Rs and ET0 at the 80 Rs measuring stations. The estimates based
    on the four types of A-P coefficients above were compared directly with the daily
    measurements for Rs. For ET0, calculations based on the measured Rs and the P-M
    models (i.e., ET0 benchmark) were accepted as the standard ET0 values due to a
    lack of direct measurement. Then, the performance of the four A-P coefficients
    for ET0 estimation was assessed according to the deviation between the estimates
    and benchmarks. Finally, the time scale of A-P coefficients with the most minor
    errors in Rs and ET0 estimations was taken as the optimal time scale. The A-P
    coefficients with the relevant time scale were then estimated for all 839 regular
    weather stations. 2.4.3 Estimating A-P coefficients with empirical regression
    functions This study employed three empirical regression models and four machine-learning
    methods to estimate the A-P coefficients. Since the three empirical models can
    only estimate yearly (or time-invariant) A-P coefficients, the comparisons between
    empirical models and machine learning methods were only conducted at a yearly
    scale. For monthly and daily a and b, we evaluated the performances of different
    machine learning methods. Empirical model I based on mean annual air temperature
    Liu, Mei, Li, Wang, Zhang, and Porter (2009) established the estimation formula
    for the A-P coefficients based on the Rs records from 30 Rs measuring stations
    in the Yellow River Basin in northern China. This model employed only mean annual
    air temperature in the two–step model (Equations 5 and 6): (5) (6) where T represents
    the mean annual air temperature of the target site, °C. Empirical model II based
    on altitude Liu, Mei, Li, Wang, Zhang, and Porter (2009) also established another
    estimation function for a and b based only on site''s altitude through a two-step
    method (Equations 7 and 8): (7) (8) where Z is the altitude of the target site,
    m. Empirical model III based on multiple variables Liu et al. (2014) further modified
    the above formulas by introducing additional variables (Equations 9 and 10). The
    new functions were established and evaluated based on the Rs records from 80 Rs
    measuring stations: (9) (10) where Z is altitude, m; n is sunshine hours, n; N
    is day length, n; ϕ is longitude; φ is latitude. 2.4.4 Estimating A-P coefficients
    with machine learning models The steps for establishing machine-learning models
    for the estimating A-P coefficients include normalizing of input data, determining
    key parameters of machine learning models, training and testing models, and applying
    the models (Chen et al., 2022). Four machine learning methods were employed to
    estimate the A-P coefficients at daily, monthly, and yearly scales based on the
    variables same as the Empirical model III. The four machine learning algorithms
    were a back propagation (BP) neural network, a Cubist model tree, a support vector
    machine (SVM), and an extreme learning machine (ELM). The optimal machine-learning
    algorithm was then used to estimate the relevant time–scale A-P coefficients at
    the 839 weather stations without Rs measurements. The Kriging method was selected
    to interpolate the 839–site A-P coefficients (Peng et al., 2022). Additionally,
    the four machine learning algorithms were also directly used to establish the
    ET0 estimation (ML-ET0) models based on the above variables and been compared
    with the PM-ET0. The algorithms were coded in the R language (R Core Team, 2013).
    BP neural network The BP (backpropagation) neural network is one kind of feed–forward
    network for supervised learning (Rumelhart et al., 1986). This algorithm minimizes
    the error between the actual and expected outputs through backpropagation to modify
    the key parameters of the network (Tian et al., 2020). This study used the nnet
    package in the R language to establish the BP model. The key parameters of this
    algorithm include the number of hidden nodes (size) and the weight attenuation
    parameter (decay). Cubist model tree The Cubist model tree was established based
    on the M5 tree algorithm (Quinlan, 1992). Predictions with the Cubist were conducted
    based on the combinations of several successive piecewise models. This study used
    the Cubist package in the R language to establish the Cubist model. The critical
    parameters of this algorithm include the number of boosting iteration models (committees)
    and the number of instances used to correct the rule–based prediction (neighbours).
    SVM algorithm The SVM (support vector machine) was established based on the Vapnik
    (1996) construct of support vectors. The SVM can minimize the error by adding
    the hyperplane to maximize the margin between prediction and observation (Drucker
    et al., 1997). The SVM is good at dealing with problems with small samples, nonlinearity,
    and high dimensionality and is extensively used in Rs estimation (Chen et al.,
    2013; He et al., 2020). This study adopted the e1071 package (Karatzoglou et al.,
    2004) in the R language to establish the SVM model. The kernel function was set
    as radial. The critical parameters of this algorithm include the effect of a single
    sample on the entire classification hyperplane (gamma) and the cost of constraint
    violation (cost). ELM algorithm The ELM method is also a feed-forward neuron network
    algorithm but much faster due to its better generalization capability (Huang et
    al., 2006). This study used the elmNNRcpp package in the R language to establish
    the ELM model. The critical parameters of this algorithm include the number of
    hidden neurons (nhid), the type of activation function (actfun), and the distribution
    from which the input weights and the bias were initialized (init_weights). 2.5
    Statistical analysis This study used three statistical indicators to evaluate
    the A-P coefficients estimated with different methods, including the coefficient
    of determination (R2, Equation 11), the root mean square error (RMSE, Equation
    12), and the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE, Equation 13). A larger
    R2 shows better model fitness and a smaller RMSE shows slight model deviation.
    The statistical nRMSE, originally the ratio between RMSE and the mean value of
    the relevant observations, was used to evaluate the estimation errors of different
    variables. A smaller nRMSE value usually indicates higher accuracy: (11) (12)
    (13) where m is the data sample size; xi is the ith estimation value; yi is the
    ith observed value; is the mean value of xi; is the mean value of yi. 3 RESULTS
    3.1 Benchmark values of the A-P coefficients for different time scales The benchmark
    values of the a and b for the three time scales were obtained through linear regression
    at the 80 Rs measuring stations (Table 1) and Tables S1 and S2. Generally, the
    mean benchmark values of A-P coefficients were similar at the different time scales.
    The mean value ranges of a and b coefficients were 0.16–0.23 and 0.53–0.59, respectively.
    Compared with the FAO–recommended values (a = 0.25, b = 0.50), a large a and a
    small b are recommended for China. For coefficient a, the yearly benchmarks ranged
    from 0.12 to 0.29, while the daily benchmarks ranged from 0.01 to 0.61. For coefficient
    b, the yearly benchmarks ranged from 0.48 to 0.72, while the daily benchmarks
    ranged from 0.05 to 0.96. The largest mean values of the benchmarks were found
    in the MPZ zone for both the a and b. The smallest mean benchmark value was found
    in the SMZ zone for a and the TCZ zone for b. TABLE 1. Maximum (Max), minimum

    stations (Station 55 299 in MPZ; Station 51 567 in TCZ; Station 54 511 in TMZ;
    Station 59 287 in SMZ) in China (Figure 3). For coefficient a, larger benchmark
    values were found in December, January, and February (winter) in the MPZ, TCZ,
    and TMZ zones. In contrast, smaller ones were found in June, July, and August
    (summer). Additionally, the temporal trends of b were contrary to a. Distributions
    of benchmark values of the two coefficients also varied among sites. Compared
    with the sites in the other three climatic zones, no noticeable temporal trend
    was found at Site 57 461 in the SMZ zone. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    representative sites of each climatic zones (Station 52 866 in MPZ; Station 50 527
    in TCZ; Station 50 136 in TMZ; Station 57 461 in SMZ). 3.2 Estimating Rs and ET0
    based on different time–scale A-P coefficients 3.2.1 Estimating Rs Superior performance
    in Rs estimation was obtained through the A-P formula with different values of
    the fundamental coefficients (Figure 4). The RMSE values of the four methods were
    all less than 3.1 MJ m−2 d−1, and R2 values were more significant than 0.85. Additionally,
    all of the four methods overestimated the Rs in the interval of 1–10 MJ m−2 d−1.
    However, Rs was underestimated with the FAO–recommended A-P coefficients, which
    generated the most errors, especially under the high Rs conditions (Figure 4d).
    The maximum estimation of the FAO–recommended coefficients was 31.3 MJ m−2 d−1
    while the maximum observation was 41.6 MJ m−2 d−1. Compared with the Rs estimated
    with the FAO–recommended coefficients, a noticeable improvement was generated
    using the site–calibrated A-P coefficients. Meanwhile, the estimation errors of
    Rs were decreased with the finer temporal resolution of the A-P coefficients.
    The best Rs estimations were produced with the daily A-P coefficients (Figure
    4c). FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Estimation of daily global solar
    radiation (Rs) with the yearly (a), month (b), and daily (c) scale calibration
    and the FAO recommendation (d) of the two fundamental coefficients of the Ångström-Prescott
    formula at the 80 Rs measuring stations in China. 3.2.2 Estimating ET0 The site–calibrated
    coefficients provided significant improvement in ET0 estimation was over the FAO
    recommended coefficients of the A-P formula (Figure 5a). The mean RMSEs were 0.34,
    0.28, 0.29, and 0.30 mm d−1 in ET0 estimation using the FAO recommended, daily,
    monthly, and yearly calibrated A-P coefficients, respectively. The site–calibrated
    coefficients improved the estimation accuracy significantly compared to the FAO–recommended
    coefficients, especially in the SMZ. Additionally, there was an insignificant
    decreasing trend in errors for the site–calibrated A-P coefficients from yearly
    to daily scales. Further, an apparent spatial gradient of estimation errors increased
    from the north to the south (Figure 5d,e). The most remarkable errors were found
    in the SMZ for all four groups of coefficients, especially the FAO–recommended
    coefficients. Seven out of the 80 stations had RMSEs greater than 0.5 mm d−1;
    the largest RMSE was greater than 0.65 mm d−1. These three site–calibrated coefficients
    provided better estimations for most sites than the FAO-recommended coefficients
    did. The daily A-P coefficients achieved the most considerable improvement in
    ET0 estimation in the SMZ with all sites'' RMSE less than 0.5 mm d−1. FIGURE 5

    and FAO-recommended values of the fundamental coefficients of the Ångström-Prescott
    (A-P) formula. The A-P coefficients were calibrated at the daily, monthly, and
    yearly scales. The dark red dot shows the mean value of each box. The symbol *
    shows the significance level, and ns represents no significance. The four different
    A-P coefficients in ET0 estimation were evaluated in different months (Figure
    6). Generally, the FAO–recommended site–calibrated coefficients produced the largest
    errors in ET0 in all months. Compared with the FAO–recommended coefficients, the
    site–calibrated coefficients significantly improved estimation accuracy throughout
    the year, especially from April to September. The best estimates were provided
    through the Rs obtained with the daily A-P coefficients. However, these three
    site–calibrated coefficients in ET0 estimation had almost no significant difference.
    Additionally, larger estimation errors were found in hot seasons (the mean RMSE
    >0.3 mm d−1) than in cold seasons (the mean RMSE <0.2 mm d−1). FIGURE 6 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Temporal variation of RMSE for ET0 estimations based
    on the estimated Rs and the Penman-Monteith model. The Rs is estimated through
    the Ångström-Prescott formula with the daily, monthly, and yearly coefficients.
    The number above each sub-figure shows the month index. The symbol * shows the
    significance level, and ns represents no significance. Generally, the ET0 estimated
    with the PM–ET0 models showed greater variations (Table 2). Using the P-M model
    combing daily A-P coefficients provided the best ET0 estimations among these eight
    models. However, the ET0 estimations based on the FAO recommended A-P coefficients
    obtained the largest estimation errors. Compared with the PM–based methods, the
    four ML-ET0 methods obtained similar accuracies in ET0 estimation, the RMSEs were
    all greater than 0.97, RMSEs less than 0.31 mm d−1, and nRMSEs less than 12%.
    Notably, the PM-ET0 model with the yearly A-P coefficients obtained similar estimation
    accuracy as the machine–learning models. The difference of RMSE and nRMSE were
    less than 0.003 mm d−1 and 0.3% between the PM-ET0 with yearly coefficients and
    the ML-ET0 model with SVM. The results proved that the P-M model combined with
    site–special A-P coefficients was potential for ET0 estimation due to acceptable
    accuracy and convenience. TABLE 2. Coefficient of determination (R2), root mean

    formula. The ML-ET0 represents the ET0 estimated directly with machine learning.
    3.3 Optimal methods for estimating the A-P coefficients 3.3.1 Yearly A-P coefficients
    Generally, the machine learning methods outperformed the empirical models in estimating
    both a and b (Figure 7). The nRMSEs were 16.8%–23.6% for a and 6.5%–8.8% for b.
    The empirical models underestimated a but overestimated b at most sites (Figure
    7a,c). Empirical model III provided similar estimate distribution as benchmarks
    and produced the smallest errors. However, the three empirical models performed
    poorly at the sites with extreme benchmark values. Compared with the empirical
    models, all four machine learning methods obtained good estimates of the a and
    b coefficients, especially for a (Figure 7b,d). The nRMSEs were 10.2%–11.3% for
    a and 4.8%–5.6% for b. Hence, the machine learning methods were more accurate
    and promising for estimating the a and b coefficients of the A-P formula. Among
    the four machine learning methods, the SVM and Cubist provided the most negligible
    errors for the a and b, respectively. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Comparisons between the a and b coefficients of the Ångström-Prescott (A-P) formula
    estimated with three empirical models (Model I, II, and III; a, c) and four machine
    learning methods (BP, Cubist, ELM, and SVM; b, d) at the 80 Rs measuring stations.
    3.3.2 Monthly A-P coefficients Compared with the yearly values of the a and b
    coefficients, large errors were obtained in the estimates of monthly values at
    the training stages (Table 3). The nRMSEs were 3.8%–8.4% for a and 3.5%–6.8% for
    b. The highest estimation accuracy was provided in the MPZ, which was the same
    as the yearly coefficients. Larger errors arose in the TCZ and TMZ zones. The
    optimal machine learning methods were also different in the estimating the A-P
    coefficients. For a, the Cubist method outperformed the other three methods in
    two climatic zones and all of China. The corresponding RMSEs and nRMSEs were 0.008–0.014
    and 3.8%–8.6%. However, for b, the BP method outperformed the other three methods
    at three zones and all of China. The corresponding RMSEs and nRMSEs values were
    0.018–0.026 and 3.1%–5.0%. TABLE 3. Evaluation of the four machine learning methods

    the yearly A-P coefficients The yearly values of the A-P coefficients were estimated
    for the 839 regular weather stations with the selected optimal machine learning
    method of SVM (Figure 8 and Tables S1 and S2). Compared with the site–calibrated
    values (Table 1), the machine learning methods provided similar ranges for a and
    b. Generally, remarkable spatial variations were found for the two coefficients
    in the four different climatic zones. Larger coefficient values were mainly found
    in the MPZ and TCM, while smaller values were obtained in the SMZ and TMZ. The
    estimate distributions of a revealed a positive correlation with altitude. The
    coefficient b showed an opposite distribution to a. The largest estimated b was
    found in the MPZ, followed by the SMZ, TMZ, and TCZ. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer

    (A-P) formula with the optimal machine learning algorithm at the 839 national

    the coefficients a and b are SVM and Cubist, respectively. 3.4.2 Generating the
    monthly A-P coefficients The monthly coefficient of a was estimated with the optimal
    machine learning method of Cubist for the 839 regular weather stations and further
    interpolated over all of China (Figure 9; Table S3). For a, larger values were
    found in northern and western China. In comparison, smaller values were found
    in southeast China (especially in the SMZ). There were also noticeable temporal
    variations of the coefficient a in different months. Extreme values were in the
    cold season (Figure 9a,b,l), which resulted in the largest ranges of a. Further,
    the smallest spatial variation for a was in September and October (Figure 9i,j).

    a of the Ångström-Prescott (A-P) formula. The distributions are generated with
    the Kriging interpolation method based on the estimated coefficients a at 839
    national weather stations through the Cubist. The values of monthly b were generated
    with the optimal machine learning method of BP (Figure 10; Table S4). Generally,
    b showed the opposite spatiotemporal distributions to a. Larger values were found
    in south eastern China during cold seasons (Figure 10a,b,l). However, the spatial
    patterns of b were similar to a in September and October since the coefficient
    varied over a smaller range than in other months. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer

    (A-P) formula. The distributions are generated with the Kriging interpolation
    method based on the estimated values of coefficients b at 839 national weather
    stations through the BP. 3.5 ET0 estimation without Rs measurements Daily Rs values,
    calculated through the A-P formula based on the FAO–recommended and the machine
    learning–based coefficients, were compared at the 839 regular weather stations
    without direct Rs measurement (Figure 11). In general, both types of A-P coefficients
    produced similar distributions of ET0 in different meteorological zones. Difference
    of ET0 estimated with these A-P coefficients in the TCZ and SMZ was more significant
    than those in the other two meteorological zones. However, there were still differences
    between these two kinds of A-P coefficients in ET0 estimation in the four zones.
    Compared with the machine learning–based coefficients, ET0 was slightly overestimated
    in MPZ and TCZ while being significantly underestimated in TMZ and SMZ by the
    FAO–recommended coefficients. Notably, there was almost no difference between
    the two groups of ET0 estimated in the TCZ. FIGURE 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    is calculated based on the Ångström-Prescott formula with the FAO-recommended
    coefficients (red) and yearly estimates based on the optimal machine-learning
    model (blue). The symbol * shows the significance level, and ns represents no
    significance. 4 DISCUSSION 4.1 Spatiotemporal variations of A-P coefficients The
    A-P formula has been extensively applied for daily Rs estimation because of the
    simple data requirements and acceptable performance (Li et al., 2012). However,
    some earlier researchers found that the two fundamental coefficients of the A-P
    formula were site–dependent (Chen et al., 2006; Jin et al., 2005). Hence, these
    coefficients must be calibrated locally to guarantee satisfactory accuracy for
    daily Rs estimation. In this study, the linear regression method calibrated different
    time–scale benchmarks of the A-P coefficients at 80 national Rs measuring stations.
    Larger mean a benchmarks were found in the MPZ and TCZ zones with a dry climate
    and high altitude, while smaller mean a benchmarks were found in the SMZ zone
    with a wet environment and low altitude. Coefficient a varies with the season.
    Larger values of a were found in winter (dry), while b showed the opposite trend
    in China. Adaramola (2012) reported that the A-P coefficients varied with geographical
    location and weather conditions. Liu et al. (2012) calibrated the benchmarks for
    the A-P coefficients and obtained similar distributions of the variable values
    as in this study. They also pointed out that a and the sum of a and b correlate
    with altitude positively. This study showed that the benchmarks for a were mainly
    less than 0.25 (mean value is 0.19), while those for b was notably greater than
    0.50 (mean value is 0.56) (Table 1). Liu et al. (2014) calibrated the A-P coefficients
    at different sites across China and found that the mean values were 0.18 and 0.56
    for coefficients a and b, respectively. Hence, there are apparent differences
    between the calibrations and the FAO recommendation, which can cause significant
    errors in the estimation of daily Rs (Figure 4). Additionally, the largest differences
    between the A-P coefficients recommended by the FAO and those calibrated in this
    study were in the SMZ. Xia et al. (2021) pointed out that the FAO recommendations
    are advised in northern China, including the northeast, North China Plain, and
    the Loess Plateau. Liu, Mei, Li, Wang, Zhang, and Porter (2009) found that the
    FAO recommendations can provide acceptable Rs estimations where the altitude exceeds
    1928 m. Thus, worse ET0 estimates were found in the SMZ in south eastern China
    with lower altitudes when using the FAO–recommended values (Figure 5). 4.2 Empirical
    and machine learning methods in A-P coefficient estimation Machine learning is
    widely used for Rs and ET0 estimations due to the flexible combination of predictors
    and satisfactory accuracy in dealing with nonlinear problems (Fan et al., 2020;
    Gürel et al., 2020). However, machine learning works as a “black–box” model and
    usually becomes overfitted (Zhang et al., 2018). The performance of machine learning
    models is restricted by data training (Dong et al., 2022). Applying machine learning
    models would be inefficient when the scenario does not appear in the training
    dataset (Shu et al., 2022). Hence, the parameterization of the P-M model with
    machine learning can take advantage of the generalization ability of machine learning
    and the physical basis of the P-M models. This study used optimal machine learning
    algorithms to estimate the A-P coefficients of stations without Rs measurements.
    The coefficients were further used to calculate Rs to drive the P-M model to estimate
    the daily ET0. Satisfactory accuracy was obtained, indicating an exciting potential
    for combining machine learning with physical–process models for geoscientific
    predictions. We compared the empirical and machine learning methods in estimating
    the A-P coefficients. In general, the machine learning methods outperformed the
    empirical models, especially for the stations with extreme a and b values (Figure
    7). Large variations were found in the estimates of a and b among the empirical
    models, despite they were specially established for China. As in this study, the
    three empirical models published by Liu et al. (2009 and 2014) were established
    based on meteorological measurements over different periods. Hence, recalibrating
    the fundamental coefficients of the three empirical models may better estimate
    the A-P coefficients. Generally, the machine learning methods could better estimate
    the a and b coefficients than the empirical models. The machine learning methods
    performed exceptionally well at sites with extreme values of a and b. Fan et al.
    (2020) pointed out that machine learning methods take advantage of dealing with
    nonlinear problems with dispensable prior knowledge. Hence, machine learning methods
    have been widely used in direct estimation of solar radiation (Lu et al., 2023;
    Wang et al., 2017) and evapotranspiration (Niu et al., 2021). We evaluated the
    ET0 estimated with machine learning methods and the PM-AP model with missing Rs
    measurements. The results indicated that using Rs estimations based on the daily
    and monthly A-P coefficients outperformed machine learning models in ET0 estimation
    (Table 2). Since the estimations of the A-P coefficients have been produced in
    this study, the PM-ET0 model is recommended for ET0 estimation in China for researches
    who are not good at computer programing when only Rs data are missing. However,
    the A-P coefficients were estimated with the machine learning models that established
    based on observations from sparsely distributed stations. For example, there were
    only 7 and 16 stations in the MPZ and TCZ, respectively. Thus, the machine learning
    models and the A-P coefficient interpolation require further evaluation in these
    zones. Additionally, only four common machine learning algorithms were employed
    in this study. Searching for more efficient machine learning models for the parameterization
    of physical models is promising for geoscientific predictions (Nearing et al.,
    2021). In the further, we will investigate new machine learning and deep learning
    methods in estimating Rs and ET0. 4.3 Different time–scale A-P coefficients in
    Rs and ET0 estimation Great variation was found among the different time-scale
    A-P coefficient benchmark values (Table 1). The ranges of daily A-P coefficients
    were more extensive than their yearly ones, which may be caused by the data size
    used for linear regression (Liu, Mei, Li, Zhang, Wang, et al., 2009). The data
    size used for calibrating the values of A-P coefficients decreased substantially
    with a temporal gradient from yearly to daily scales. Compared with Rs estimates
    with monthly and yearly A-P coefficients (both benchmarks and FAO recommendation),
    the Rs errors caused due to daily A-P coefficients were the smallest across China.
    Soler (1990) used monthly values in Rs estimation and obtained better results
    in Europe. Podestá et al. (2004) pointed out that seasonal or finer time–scale
    A-P coefficients should be used to eliminate the systematic residuals of Rs estimation.
    However, the daily A-P coefficients slightly outperformed the monthly and yearly
    coefficients. The errors of Rs were further transferred to the ET0 estimation
    through the P-M model. The ET0 estimation driven by the Rs estimated with the
    daily A-P coefficients provided the highest accuracy. Moreover, there was a nonsignificant
    difference among these three time–scale A-P coefficients in ET0 estimation. Due
    to their convenience and accuracy, the yearly A-P coefficients are more suitable
    for estimating of daily Rs and ET0 in China. 5 CONCLUSION This study proposes
    a new method for estimating ET0 with missing Rs by combining machine learning
    with physical–based P-M models. Firstly, four machine learning algorithms were
    used to parameterize the fundamental coefficients of the A-P formula at different
    time scales (daily, monthly, and yearly). Then, the estimated A-P coefficients
    were used to calculate Rs to drive the P-M model for ET0 estimation (PM-ET0).
    Additionally, ET0 values were also directly estimated with machine learning methods
    (ML-ET0). Values of the a descended from northwest to southeast China while the
    b shared an opposite distribution. The two coefficients were more scattered in
    the daily scale, followed by the monthly and yearly scales. Compared with the
    benchmarks, the FAO recommended a large a, but a small b for most stations in
    China, which resulted in the largest errors both in Rs and ET0, especially in
    south eastern China. Estimation of ET0 with the FAO-recommended coefficients significantly
    improved by all of the site–calibrated A-P coefficients at different time scales,
    especially during the growing season from April to September. However, an insignificant
    decreasing gradient was found in ET0 estimation with the A-P coefficients from
    the yearly to daily scales. Compared with the PM-ET0, the ML-ET0 outperformed
    the ET0 estimated with yearly A-P coefficients but underperformed those estimated
    with daily and monthly ones. Further machine learning methods were more reliable
    in estimating the A-P coefficients than empirical regression methods. Hence, in
    terms of robustness and convenience, using the A-P formula with yearly A-P coefficients
    to calculate Rs to drive the P-M model for ET0 estimation is superior in China.

    controlPrecision irrigation 1. Introduction Agriculture is the base of our socio-economical
    model, and its development plays an essential role in the welfare of nations (Gollin
    et al., 2002). However, agriculture has a high environmental impact and can be
    considered one of the most important contributors to global environmental degradation
    (Mueller et al., 2012). Furthermore, as the global population continues to grow,
    there is an urgent need to increase food production. This already complex challenge
    is further intensified by accelerated environmental changes, characterized by
    significant shifts in precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme weather
    events such as heavy rains, heatwaves, and droughts (Bisbis et al., 2018). Consequently,
    it is critical to develop strategies to enhance agricultural production while
    mitigating its environmental impact. In this context, improvements in irrigation
    scheduling play an important role, not only because agriculture is the consumer
    of almost 70% of freshwater resources (Jalilvand et al., 2019), but also because
    appropriate irrigation scheduling can help to increase the yield production and
    minimize the leaching of nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metal to freshwater
    sources (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). Incorporating technological tools could be a
    viable solution to improve irrigation scheduling, where the aim is to make irrigation
    decisions based on the needs of the crops, establishing when the crops need water
    and how much water needs to be applied. Numerous studies have centered on developing
    tools that accurately detect plant water stress conditions to determine optimal
    irrigation. For instance, Torres et al. (2019) employed near-infrared spectroscopy
    to measure in-situ leaf relative water content. In parallel, other approaches
    assess plant water requirements using soil moisture sensors (SMS) positioned in
    the target zone. The use of SMS is the most adopted technology for irrigation
    scheduling in the USA (USDA, 2018, Taghvaeian et al., 2020), and in many scenarios,
    a common response to identified irrigation needs is implementing feedback threshold
    control by using SMS (Dukes et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2010, Zhang et al.,
    2017, Li et al., 2018, Cayuela et al., 2022, Simionesei et al., 2020), or using
    fuzzy-based decision systems (Culman et al., 2019, Stone et al., 2020). Both strategies
    define levels based on measured stress conditions or soil moisture. However, the
    methodology for setting these threshold levels is not versatile enough to accommodate
    the diversity of crops, soils, and environmental conditions. Furthermore, these
    thresholds often remain static, not accounting for the evolving needs of crops
    influenced by environmental factors, intrinsic crop properties, and growth stages.
    Accurately determining the volume of water needed for irrigation entails a comprehensive
    understanding of plant water consumption concerning environmental variables, specific
    crop attributes, and growth stages (Lopez-Jimenez et al., 2022). Many decision
    support systems employ crop measurements coupled with AI to estimate and compensate
    for water losses from the evapotranspiration process (Katimbo et al., 2023). The
    works developed by Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et al. (2019) aim
    to bolster decision-support systems for agricultural irrigation by incorporating
    analytical models such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM). This comprehensive
    model features modules covering soil water balance, nutrient dynamics, equilibrium
    soil chemistry, potential evapotranspiration, surface energy balance, heat transfer,
    pesticide processes, and plant growth, relying on the Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). RZWQM has been widely utilized to simulate
    the impacts of agricultural management strategies on crop yields and soil and
    water quality (Ma et al., 2012). Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et
    al. (2019) use RZWQM for computing irrigation scheduling based on measurable crop
    conditions, predefined threshold values, and numerical solutions generated by
    the model. Nonetheless, employing RZWQM to compute irrigation scheduling in a
    feedback scheme presents significant challenges due to its inherent complexity
    and rigidity. The model’s detailed structure complicates the straightforward analyses
    and inclusion of user-specified requirements and the adaptation to overcome discrepancies
    between the crop and the model. Furthermore, RZWQM is restricted to a predefined
    set of cultivars, limiting its versatility to diverse agricultural settings. The
    complexity also imposes computational constraints, making real-time feedback control
    based on the current soil moisture state and crop stages challenging. These limitations
    underscore the necessity for more versatile, adaptive, and computationally efficient
    irrigation scheduling strategies. To this end, some studies have explored advanced
    control theory as a systematic approach to the irrigation problem (Saleem et al.,
    2013, Delgoda et al., 2016, Shang et al., 2020). As mentioned by Romero et al.
    (2012) and Ding et al. (2018), using advanced control strategies in agriculture
    has a high potential to increase efficiency. However, tangible applications are
    sparse. Much of the documented research revolves around simulations (Romero et
    al., 2012). While comprehensive on paper, some models oversimplify real-world
    scenarios by presupposing fully instrumented crops. Contrarily, in practical settings,
    agricultural systems often struggle with control limitations. In many irrigation
    systems, manual intervention dominates, where operators activate or deactivate
    pumps, manage ditches, and manipulate valves or gates to regulate irrigation.
    In summary, we evidence a lack of irrigation strategies that balance efficiency,
    practicality, and real crop management considerations. Many current methods rely
    heavily on static thresholds or intricate models, which often do not adapt dynamically
    to changing environmental conditions, diverse crop needs, irrigation management
    practices, and different growth stages. Moreover, while advanced control theory
    holds promise, there is an absence of advanced control strategies that account
    for real-world complexities and manual human intervention in the operation of
    irrigation systems, where the timely human response to crop needs, actuation precision,
    and operational reliability are important elements that influence the controlled
    system. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this research is to use
    control theory to enhance the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly in
    real agricultural scenarios that are often human-operated. We propose developing
    a novel control-based algorithm for a DSS for irrigation scheduling capable of
    computing practical irrigation instructions based on field measurements and weather
    forecasting, which is designed to be adaptable to the grower’s or irrigation manager’s
    operational limitations, preferences, and experience and must compensate for uncertainties
    introduced by human intervention. We have formulated our DSS around a simplified
    proposed control-oriented model (COM), which describes the soil moisture dynamics;
    a data processing stage, which makes the measured data compatible with the COM;
    a parameter estimation stage, which guarantees an optimal adjustment of the COM
    parameters based on measured information from the crop; and a control stage, which
    uses the parametrized COM, measured information from the crop, and information
    from weather forecasting to compute the appropriate irrigation instructions that
    maintain the soil moisture close to a desired level. We evaluated our algorithm
    using collected data from a seepage-irrigated commercial sweetcorn field in South
    Florida. Our evaluations covered each component of our system, from model validation
    to overall system performance. As a principal outcome, the proposed algorithm
    presents the potential to save 30% of water in this type of irrigation system.
    This water-saving is facilitated through effective and achievable computed irrigation
    scheduling that maintains soil moisture within a targeted range. Such control
    preserves optimal growing conditions and minimizes environmental risks by preventing
    runoff, percolation, and the leaching of hazardous agricultural chemicals into
    the surrounding ecosystem. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 starts with an overview of soil moisture and irrigation scheduling,
    establishes the problem of formulating a control-oriented DSS for irrigation scheduling,
    and offers a detailed description of the proposed DSS algorithm. Section 3 describes
    the process following to validate the proposed algorithm. In Section 4, the results
    of the validation are presented and discussed. Finally, in Section 5, some conclusions
    are drawn. 2. Methods 2.1. Process description and problem formulation The relationship
    between irrigation, soil, plants, and the environment constitutes a complex system
    that requires practical concepts and analogies to formulate optimal irrigation
    strategies. As delineated in Eisenhauer et al. (2021), soil can be conceptualized
    as a reservoir, with different levels representing the amount of water available
    for plant uptake. We adopt this conceptual framework to simplify a complex problem
    that involves agriculture, control theory, and human interaction and to formulate
    the control problem on a DSS for irrigation management. Within this context, we
    identify key input and output variables, delineate desired conditions or set points,
    and specify agricultural constraints and human limitations. Download : Download

    of soil moisture states significant for plant-water relations and irrigation control
    based on Eisenhauer et al. (2021). The Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) delineates
    the lower threshold of soil water content at which plants cannot recover from
    water stress, marking the limiting boundary for plant survivability. The Maximum
    Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical reference, as soil moisture levels
    below this point result in sub-optimal physiological responses in plants. The
    soil moisture range between MADP and Field Capacity (FC) is optimal for plant
    growth, balancing water availability and stress prevention. Surpassing FC leads
    to inefficient water use, soil structural degradation, anaerobic root conditions,
    nutrient leaching, and the potential for surface water pollution. Beyond the Saturation
    Point (SP), the soil reaches its hydraulic limit, becoming incapable of retaining
    additional moisture. Fig. 1 illustrates this analogy: the base level, or the Permanent
    Wilting Point (PWP), indicates that below this threshold level, plants cannot
    extract water from the soil, leading to irreversible wilting. The next critical
    point is the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP); if the soil moisture drops
    below this level, the plants undergo water stress, potentially reducing yield.
    Consequently, MADP often serves as a guideline for irrigation decisions as the
    lower limit. However, its precise value, i.e., the percentage of MADP as the lower
    limit, can vary based on the crop, its growth stage, and prevailing climatic conditions.
    For instance, Bayabil et al. (2023) demonstrated that using only 75% of the expected
    MADP saved 25% of water consumption, with no reduction in sweet corn yield. Similarly,
    strategic deficit irrigation during certain growth stages of wine grapes enhances
    fruit quality for winemaking (Kang et al., 2023). From a control systems perspective,
    the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical set-point or lower-bound
    constraint that must be maintained. Failure to uphold soil moisture levels at
    or above this threshold can lead to suboptimal plant physiological responses and
    yield reduction. The Field Capacity (FC) is defined as the soil water content
    threshold beyond which the gravitational drainage is negligible and is considered
    the upper limit. Below FC, the capillary actions keep the water stored in the
    soil pores. Irrigating until reaching FC and avoiding exceeding field capacity
    prevents the leaching of nutrients and pesticides applied to the crops. The saturation
    point (SP) is attained when the soil can no longer retain water, leading to runoff
    on the surface, which poses significant environmental concerns. Soil texture significantly
    influences key hydraulic characteristics such as the PWP, FC, and SP. Saxton and
    Rawls (2006) provide detailed hydraulic characteristics across various soil textures,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2. From this figure, it becomes evident that managing irrigation
    in sandy soil is notably challenging. A simple 5% fluctuation in water content
    in such soil can either lead to plant wilting or result in water wastage. In contrast,
    silt soils offer better flexibility: water content can vary by as much as 24%
    without triggering any adverse agricultural or ecological consequences. Therefore,
    the soil’s proportion of sand, silt, and clay plays an important role in the control
    problem definition and for specific irrigation decisions. Conceptually, for control
    purposes, soil can be viewed as a storage unit, where the area depends on the
    soil texture, the control input is irrigation, and the control objective is maintaining
    the volumetric water content to a desired level. However, additional considerations
    must also be included in the case of a DSS for irrigation control. Download :

    Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) of 50% of the available water for each
    soil class. Points over each bar denote the specific values. This figure is based
    on the hydraulic characteristics reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006). 2.1.1. Control
    challenges on a decision support system for irrigation scheduling A DSS for irrigation
    scheduling is particularly useful in farm systems with no automatic control elements,
    where the grower or irrigation manager carries out irrigation actions. In our
    proposed DSS, the control problem is to use available information from crops and
    weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions that help the user minimize
    the error between desired and measured soil moisture. Below, we discuss some considerations
    that must be addressed. Timely Human Response: The grower or irrigation manager
    cannot execute irrigation instructions quickly and suddenly. For that, even if
    sensors and computational capabilities can offer periodic information with sampling
    periods of minutes or seconds, this information will be unhelpful and might overwhelm
    or confuse the operator. Moreover, if an irrigation instruction suddenly appears
    when the operator is unavailable to make an irrigation action, it might not generate
    the expected result. Actuation Precision: Many conventional irrigation systems
    rely on actuators that operate more as binary switches than precision instruments.
    In agriculture, it is common to find devices such as on–off pumps, gates, weirs,
    and valves, which are unsuited for precise operation. Hence, recommendations should
    be straightforward and actionable, such as suggesting irrigation during a time
    rather than maintaining a specific flow rate. Human Reliability: Even with precise
    recommendations from the DSS, human behavior introduces variability. External
    influences can alter the final action taken, introducing a layer of uncertainty.
    Considered Measurable Variables: In most agricultural practices, rain ( ), irrigation
    ( ), and temperature ( ) are the main measurable variables affecting root zone
    soil moisture ( ). While capillary effects from the deep soil also influence root
    zone soil moisture, quantifying these effects necessitates more elaborated measurement
    techniques compared to the direct measurement of the aforementioned variables.
    Integration of Weather Forecasts: Meteorological advancements have made weather
    predictions increasingly accurate. Governments worldwide are making concerted
    efforts to provide weather forecasts as part of impact-based decision-support
    services. These forecasts, especially regarding expected rainfall and temperature,
    are crucial for making informed irrigation decisions, ensuring optimal water use,
    and supporting crop health. 2.2. Proposed approach We address the control challenges
    by proposing a DSS presented in Fig. 3, which integrates measured information
    from the crop and weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions. The
    DSS integrates control theory and accommodates timely human response by working
    periodically and allowing the grower to determine the irrigation period1 for these
    executions. Furthermore, the DSS provides practical and realizable irrigation
    instructions, given in units of volume per irrigation period or irrigation time
    per irrigation period. For instance, if the grower selects a two-day irrigation
    period, the DSS will calculate the necessary volume of water or irrigation time
    that must be applied for each two-day interval. Download : Download high-res image

    proposed Decision Support System (DSS) for irrigation scheduling. The description
    illustrates the measured variables, where represents the instant time when the
    data is obtained, indicates the temperature, rain, soil moisture, and irrigation.
    The DSS is formulated with four main components: (i) the control-oriented model
    (COM), used as a base of the control algorithm; (ii) the data processing stage
    for aligning multi-temporal sensor data with algorithmic components; (iii) a parameter
    estimation stage for updating model parameters ( ); and (iv) a control algorithm
    that utilizes the COM, estimated parameters, processed measurements, and weather
    forecasts to calculate irrigation instructions ( ). The DSS uses measured variables
    from the crop, where rain and temperature can be obtained from a weather station,
    and volumetric water content can be obtained from soil moisture sensors. To address
    the system’s robustness against human variability in irrigation execution, our
    DSS additionally considers measuring this execution, i.e., obtaining measurements
    of irrigation time per irrigation period or volume of water per irrigation period.
    This measurement can be obtained from flowmeters or sensors for flow detection.
    The proposed approach (Fig. 3) is supported by (i) a COM of the SM, (ii) a data
    processing stage, (iii) a parameter estimation stage, and (iv) a control algorithm.
    In this approach, the COM serves as a parametrizable model that characterizes
    soil moisture as a function of processed measured variables and parameters to
    be estimated. At each irrigation period, the estimation stage calculates and updates
    the parameters. Then, the control stage uses the COM, the estimated parameters,
    soil moisture measurements, and weather forecasting data to determine the appropriate
    irrigation action that maintains the soil moisture at the desired value. A detailed
    breakdown of each component of the DSS is provided below. 2.2.1. Proposed control-oriented
    model for soil moisture The most important element of the proposed strategy is
    the COM. In agriculture, traditional models often focus on capturing the complexity
    of various biophysical processes. Although accurate, these models are often computationally
    expensive and not straightforwardly applicable for control design. We have derived
    the COM from a simplified water balance, as Fig. 4 describes. This model considers
    the soil a storage unit, where a linear combination of adaptable parameters and
    measured variables performs a water balance with inputs, including rain, irrigation,
    and upward capillarity. On the other hand, outputs include evapotranspiration,
    deep percolation, and runoff. The choice of a simplified model inevitably raises
    concerns about the sacrifice of modeling accuracy. However, in our DSS algorithm,
    this drawback is mitigated by continual parameter estimation based on real-time
    data and by incorporating feedback in the control equation. Our COM is formulated
    based on three assumptions: Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download

    dynamics, where , and are outputs associated with evapotranspiration, and deep
    percolation; , , and are inputs associated to rain, irrigation, and capillary
    rise. Assumption 1 Model Sampling Period The COM is formulated with a fixed time
    step, denoted by , corresponding to the irrigation period. This fixed period allows
    for the discretization of soil moisture dynamics, indexed by the variable . Our
    DSS algorithm is based on the COM, which is discrete and will describe the soil
    moisture dynamics according to the irrigation period ( ). The grower or irrigation
    manager can configure to suit their operational preferences. Consequently, the
    COM and, by extension, the DSS algorithm are adaptable to those preferences. For
    instance, if a two-day irrigation period is selected, the COM will effectively
    model soil moisture dynamics under this discrete time interval. It is highlighted
    that, in practice, sensors often provide data at multiple sampling frequencies.
    We have designed specific data management techniques to reconcile this multiplicity
    of data with the user-defined irrigation period . These techniques are detailed
    in Section 2.2.2. Assumption 2 Soil Moisture Average During an appropriate irrigation
    period, it is reasonable to presume that the available water for the plants within
    the root zone is closely around an average soil moisture value, denoted as . This
    assumption enables us to formulate the control objective as maintaining this average
    soil moisture close to a desired level . This assumption simplifies both the model
    and the DSS algorithm. However, we clarify that choosing a lengthy irrigation
    period might be comfortable for the irrigation manager but can be risky for the
    plant’s health. Conversely, opting for shorter irrigation periods can mitigate
    potential water deficit issues during this period, but at the expense of demand
    for more managerial time. The optimal irrigation period depends on the crop type,
    environmental conditions, and highly on soil type. For instance, sandy soils,
    characterized by low water retention capacities, necessitate shorter irrigation
    periods than silt soils, which can retain almost six times more water (see Fig.
    2). It is pertinent to note that the temporal resolution of the COM is directly
    correlated with the chosen irrigation period . A shorter irrigation period effectively
    enhances the temporal resolution, allowing the model to capture more rapid fluctuations
    in soil moisture and other variables. However, this comes at the expense of increased
    computational and managerial demands. The adaptability in selecting allows for
    a trade-off between temporal resolution and operational convenience. Assumption
    3 Linear Relation Soil moisture operates as a causal system. The future average
    soil moisture is influenced by its prior water content and the inputs and outputs
    during this irrigation period. We are considering average soil moisture variation
    between successive irrigation periods, which is represented as , as a linear relation
    of the water balance during such irrigation period. We are formulating that in
    the upcoming irrigation period, the soil moisture average will depend on the actual
    soil moisture average and a linear combination between parameters (rates of change)
    and accumulated amounts of water inputs and outputs during the current irrigation
    period. In this form, we denote water input as the accumulated amount of rain
    during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change between and
    . Note that the rain units are commonly expressed in units of the water depth
    accumulated in the area under study. Since is a summation of measurements, it
    retains the same depth units, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture
    per unit of depth. Similarly, we denote the input as the accumulated amount of
    irrigation during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change
    between and . Irrigation can be measured in units of depth, volume, or, in our
    case, for simplifying sensor instrumentation and data acquisition, irrigation
    time. reflects the total time that the crop is irrigated during the irrigation
    period, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture per unit of time. To streamline
    the electronic instrumentation, we are not considering measured variables corresponding
    to the capillary rise input, as this capillary rise comes from the water table.
    Instead, the input associated with capillary rise will be treated as an unknown
    parameter, denoted by . As discussed in the process description (Section 2.1),
    the infiltration and runoff are directly related to the soil moisture. For that,
    we are associating this output to the combination between the soil moisture average
    and the parameter , which is adimensional and represents the rate of change between
    and . The most adopted method to evaluate evapotranspiration is the FAO-56. This
    method requires the measurement of multiple environmental variables beyond the
    scope of our DSS, such as net radiation, soil heat flux, wind speed, saturation
    vapor pressure, and actual vapor pressure. Inspired by simpler models such as
    the Hargreaves Method (Gao et al., 2017), we overcome this issue by relating evapotranspiration
    directly to the temperature average ( ) via the estimated parameter , which has
    soil moisture per temperature units and describes the rate of change between and
    . Therefore, according to the assumptions and the proposed linear combinations
    that describe the system inputs and outputs, our parametrizable COM is formulated
    as (1) where , , , , and are positive parameters to be estimated, and the variables
    , , , and are obtained in the data processing stage from measured raw data. 2.2.2.
    Data processing stage The primary objective of this stage is to utilize measured
    data to compute the average soil moisture, total rainfall, total irrigation, and
    average temperature over the duration of the irrigation period. In that form,
    knowing a fixed irrigation period spanning from the time instant to and considering
    the sampling period of the respective sensor as , the number of samples within
    an irrigation period can be defined as: (2) With this, the average soil moisture
    is determined by: (3) Similarly, the average temperature is given by: (4) The
    accumulated rainfall over the period is computed as follows: (5) The accumulated
    irrigation is: (6) In Fig. 3, the data processing stage also processes rain and
    temperature forecast data. This data process uses the same methods followed in
    Eqs. (5), (4), considering the sampling time used for the forecasting provider.
    The expected accumulated rainfall for the next irrigation period is noted as ,
    and the expected temperature average is noted as . 2.2.3. Parameter estimation
    stage We aim to estimate the parameters inherent to the COM, namely , , , , .
    Our strategy hinges on maintaining a record of processed data, from which we derive
    an optimization-based approach for parameter estimation. This method is a variation
    of the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) technique (Rao et al., 2001). Our variation
    comprises an expanding estimation window, and this is slightly different from
    the conventional MHE, where a fixed-size window is used. Moreover, we propose
    to ensure the estimated parameters’ optimality by formulating a two-step estimator.
    The decision to use an expanding window arises from the unique characteristics
    of seasonal crops and the observed irrigation practices by growers. Notably, some
    crops can be ready for harvest just 30 days post-planting. Additionally, the irrigation
    schedules set by growers can fluctuate significantly, ranging anywhere from one
    to more than five days. Given these dynamics, valuing and utilizing every data
    collected from the crop throughout its growth cycle is imperative. Moreover, with
    a fixed-size estimation window, we risk encountering data windows without rain
    events or irrigation events, which can impact the estimation of parameters related
    to rain and irrigation. We use an expanding estimation window to mitigate this,
    ensuring the algorithm always has access to a sufficient data set. For permanent
    crops, the analysis might benefit from a moving window with a fixed size long
    enough to guarantee optimal parameter estimation. For data aggregation within
    this expanding window, we consider vectors of processed data from the instant
    to the instant . Hence, the processed data for soil moisture, rainfall, irrigation,
    and temperature within each estimation window is defined as: with . In that form,
    according to the corresponding estimation window, the parameters , , , , and are
    estimated at each irrigation period, given adaptive characteristics to the COM.
    We employ a two-step estimation strategy to guarantee the optimality of our estimated
    parameters: the first step estimates parameters in association with measured variables.
    In contrast, the subsequent step estimates the parameter linked to the water table.
    Prior estimation step At this step, we assume a water table’s slow dynamic variation
    in seepage irrigation and general water table elevation. For that, has a low incidence
    in the variation of the soil moisture. Consequently, we exclude in the first estimation
    step. This step estimates the parameters that minimize the quadratic error between
    the soil moisture variation and the linear combination between the measured variables
    and the parameters associated with the measured variables. In this estimation
    step, we are including a constraint to ensure that all the parameters must be
    positive to conserve the proposed physical relation of the mass balance. The proposed
    optimization problem is formulated as follows: Download : Download high-res image
    (40KB) Download : Download full-size image where is the vector of parameters that
    are associated with measured variables , and is the quadratic error described
    as (8) with , and . For the optimization problem (Eq. (7)), the linear constraints
    imply that an optimal solution is achievable if is convex. The convexity of this
    cost function can be established if its Hessian matrix respect to is positive
    definite (Bhatia, 2015), which in turn depends on the linear independence of the
    columns in . Variability in soil moisture and temperature can generally be assumed,
    ensuring the linear independence of corresponding columns in . However, given
    that rainfall and irrigation can exhibit extended periods of invariability, the
    algorithm is designed to commence only when observed variability in and is confirmed.
    Subsequent estimation step After estimating the parameters associated with the
    measured variables, is estimated. As we consider this parameter directly related
    to the soil moisture, we propose to find the parameter that minimizes the quadratic
    error between the measured soil moisture and the estimated soil moisture with
    initial conditions given by . Where the estimated soil moisture is obtained from
    the water balance in Eq. (1), and the numerical solution of the model (Eq. (1)),
    which is described as (9) In that form, we propose a subsequent optimization problem
    described as Download : Download high-res image (40KB) Download : Download full-size
    image where is the quadratic cost function given by (11) with . In this optimization
    problem, the constraints are also linear. In Appendix, it is shown that by appropriate
    substitutions, appear as a linear combination into the numerical solution given
    by , confirming the convexity of the cost function and that optimal solutions
    of also can be guarantee. 2.2.4. Control stage In the control stage, the COM,
    the estimated parameters, the processed measured variables, and the forecasted
    variables are integrated to calculate the amount of water that must be applied
    during the irrigation period. This stage is an adaptive, predictive, and feedback-plus
    feedforward control strategy. The main objective is to use measured and forecast
    information to estimate the appropriate irrigation ( ) that maintains the soil
    moisture close to a desired value. We explain the control strategy in four steps,
    where first, the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the estimated parameters obtained
    in Eqs. (7), and (10), and the processed measured data (Eqs. (3), (4), (5), and
    (6)) are used to predict (or forecast) the soil moisture one step ahead ( ) as
    follows: (12) Second, we use the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the predicted
    soil moisture , forecast rain and temperature data ( , and , and we assume that
    in the next irrigation period, the estimated parameter variation can be neglected
    or in other words that . With this information, we predict the soil moisture two
    steps ahead ( ) as follows: (13) Third, we establish the objective to deduce the
    irrigation amount to be applied, such as two steps ahead, the predicted soil moisture
    will be equal to the desired soil moisture. Therefore, by replacing in Eq. (13)
    and obtaining , we deduce the irrigation amount equation as follows: (14) Fourth,
    to analyze and understand the elements of the irrigation amount equation, we define
    the expected error between the desired soil moisture and the expected soil moisture
    as . Therefore, Eq. (14) can be rewritten as follows: (15) where the elements
    of the irrigation control equation can be described as components of the water
    balance that equilibrates the soil moisture around the desired value as follows:
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate for the difference
    between the desired moisture and the expected average of the soil moisture; is
    the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that, during
    the irrigation period, was lost due infiltration; is the volume of irrigation
    water that can be hold based on the expected rain during the irrigation period;
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that
    is expected to be lost due evapotranspiration; is the amount of water the crop
    will receive from capillary rise. Note that this control action is a case of adaptive
    control, knows a self-tuning regulator, where the stability of the controlled
    system is conditioned to the accuracy of the estimated parameters and the grade
    of uncertainty between the controlled system and the estimated system (Åström
    and Wittenmark, 2008). 3. Experimental verification The algorithm was validated
    using on-field measurements from a commercial sweetcorn field in South Florida.
    This data was initially collected as part of an integrated research and extension
    project focused on improving farmers’ adoption of soil moisture sensors for irrigation
    scheduling in vegetable farms. We evaluated our DSS algorithm using readings from
    soil moisture probes, a weather station, and a pressure transducer deployed in
    the commercial field. In this section, we describe the data collection process
    and the algorithm evaluation towards establishing the potential benefits of the
    algorithm in comparison with the information obtained from the grower irrigation
    practices. As shown in Fig. 5, we installed sensors to measure soil moisture,
    precipitation, environmental temperature, and irrigation management from December
    21, 2022, to January 11, 2023. Due to confidentiality agreements, the precise
    location of the commercial field remains undisclosed in this study. The soil in
    this field is classified as waveland and lawnwood fine sands. Following the hydraulic
    properties reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006) (Fig. 2), this soil is characterized
    by a permanent wilting point of 5%, a field capacity of 10%, and a saturation
    point of 46%. The field water movement and location of the sensors are described
    in Fig. 5, where the field is surrounded by a channel supplied by a pump drawing
    from a natural water source. Water is distributed from this surrounding channel
    to the crops via pipes. This water is then dispersed into ditches across the field.
    These ditches feature interconnected silts that facilitate water transport to
    the plant beds. Irrigation is accomplished by increasing the water level in the
    channel. It is important to note that this system operates under the assumption
    of homogeneous water distribution, with the water supply pump serving as the unique
    control element. Download : Download high-res image (568KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. The experimental verification description features the
    deployment of a weather station, a soil moisture sensor, and a pressure transducer.
    The blue lines delineate the water distribution inflow utilized for irrigating
    the agricultural field under study. Under the homogeneous water distribution consideration,
    moisture measurements were taken in the root zone at a depth of 0.3 m, using a
    Sentek Drill & Drop 60 cm soil moisture probe, which is capable of measuring soil
    moisture, temperature, and salinity at uniformly spaced depths every 0.1 m, providing
    a profile up to 0.6 m depth (Sentek, 2018). The sampling time was 1800 s. Rain
    and temperature data were obtained using a Davis Vantage Pro2 GroWeather 6820c
    weather station (Davis, 2023). The sampling time was 900 s. Irrigation measurements
    were taken by installing a KPSI 700 pressure sensor at the bottom of the channel.
    This sensor has a range of 0.7–210 m, an accuracy of 1% with analog output from
    0 to 10 V. The objective was to identify sudden increases related to pump activation
    to establish the irrigation time during the irrigation period. The pressure sensor
    was connected to a CR1000X datalogger of Cambell Scientific (Campbell, 2023) with
    a sampling time of 300 s, and the irrigation management was established by analyzing
    this information. The proposed DSS algorithm was tested using Matlab software
    version R2022a (Matlab, 2022). The irrigation period was selected by analyzing
    the irrigation management given by the grower. We observed that the management
    given by the grower was in function of soil and crop appearance, irrigating when
    required, and turning the pump on and off with an elapsed time between 1 and 6
    days. Given this information, our algorithm testing incorporated an irrigation
    period of two days ( ). We consider that with this period, we can provide reasonable
    timing actions from the grower. We added normally distributed random noise to
    the measured data to simulate the inherent stochasticity in weather forecasts.
    Specifically, the magnitude of this noise was set at 10% of the standard deviation
    of the actual measured data. In the context of rainfall predictions, any resultant
    negative values post-noise addition were truncated to zero. The maximum allowable
    depletion for sweet corn was considered 50% (Bayabil et al., 2023). We determined
    the desired soil moisture between 7.5% and 10%. We selected a desired soil moisture
    of 9% to stay far from the maximum allowable depletion point and accommodate uncertainties
    in soil characteristics. Before initializing the algorithm, we converted missing
    data entries to zeros. Soil moisture and irrigation data underwent homogenization
    through interpolation to match the 900 s rain and temperature data sampling interval.
    In the prior estimation step, the optimization problem was formulated as a quadratic
    programming problem and iteratively solved using the “quadprog” tool in Matlab.
    In the subsequent estimation stage, the optimization problem was iteratively addressed
    using a sequential quadratic programming method with the “fmincon” tool in Matlab.
    Then, in the test, the data is processed at each irrigation period to obtain the
    corresponding averages of the temperature and soil moisture and the corresponding
    amounts of accumulated rain and accumulated irrigation applied by the grower.
    Moreover, the model’s parameters are estimated at each irrigation period, and
    the recommended irrigation is computed. We evaluated the overall DSS algorithm
    by applying the computed control action to the parametrized COM. We are addressing
    the uncertainties related to assuming negligible estimated parameter changes between
    consecutive irrigation periods by adding stochastic variability, which was obtained
    by analyzing the variation of the estimated parameters and adding a randomized
    normal distributed disturbance with a standard deviation equal to the observed
    standard deviation of . In that form, the stochastic soil moisture prediction
    is given by (16) where , , , , and are the corresponding disturbances. In consequence,
    the evaluated control action is also disturbed by including the stochastic soil
    moisture prediction as (17) Below, we present the outcomes of our analysis. 4.
    Results and discussion Fig. 6 shows the results of the data processing stage.
    Note how the temperature ( ) shows a periodic component related to day and night
    patterns, also presented in the soil moisture ( ). However, this periodic component
    is removed in both the processed temperature ( ) and soil moisture ( ). In the
    case of accumulated rain ( ), the processed data is presented as the cumulative
    sum for each irrigation period. The grower irrigation decision represents the
    accumulated hours the grower irrigated during each irrigation period. The data
    processing stage is pivotal in aligning the measured data with the model and significantly
    mitigating uncertainties from the measured parameters of soil moisture, temperature,
    rain, and irrigation. As described, this stage computes the average soil moisture,
    total rainfall, total irrigation, and average temperature over the duration of
    each irrigation period. This computation aids in filtering out uncertainties and
    undesired data anomalies provided by sensors and forecasting methods. By averaging
    soil moisture over an irrigation period, the impact of incorrect measurements
    and transient spikes not contemplated in the model and random fluctuations are
    reduced, leading to more representative information on the available water for
    the plants. For example, in Fig. 6, an anomalous temperature measurement close
    to −20 °C is observed on Jan-08-23. This incorrect measurement was filtered out
    in the processed temperature data, thus attenuating its influence. Furthermore,
    considering accumulated rain and irrigation data in the data processing stage
    notably enhances the DSS robustness by minimizing the influence of uncertainty
    in both the measurement and prediction processes. It is essential to emphasize
    that uncertainties in measured rainfall and irrigation data, sampled every 900
    s, have a diminished impact on the estimation and control stages as the duration

    is pivotal for the robustness, accuracy, and reliability of the entire DSS algorithm.

    addition, the -value starts at and decreases as the estimation window expands,
    reaching a minimum of . The consistently high correlation and values across all
    estimation windows suggest that the estimation algorithm performs well in describing
    the dynamics of the soil moisture average. The lowest value of 0.84 indicates
    that, in the worst-case scenario, the COM can explain an 84% of the variability
    in the soil moisture average. On the other hand, the lowest correlation value
    of 0.92 indicates that we are reaching a strong linear relationship between the
    proposed COM and the observed soil moisture averages. The low and decreasing -value
    describes a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the estimations, which
    increases as the estimation window increases. Download : Download high-res image

    The results indicate that the average estimation error across all estimation windows
    is around zero, with maximum standard deviations of . The prediction error is
    similarly centered around zero, exhibiting maximum and minimum errors of . As
    the estimation window increases, the prediction error decreases. However, an increase
    in the prediction error is evidenced on Feb-05. This problem is also observed
    in the estimation analyses, with a decrease in the and correlation. On this particular
    estimation, the commercial sweetcorn field experienced an intense rainfall of
    26.67 mm within 24 h. This led to a substantial change in soil moisture levels,
    which the algorithm failed to estimate accurately, resulting in a peak error of
    3.29%. This behavior shows that close to the desired operation region (between
    the MADP and FC), the soil–water relation can be described as a linear model,
    where our COM can accurately describe the dynamics. However, the COM accuracy
    reduces in extreme events that move the SM content away from the desired operation
    region. Our proposed approach overcomes the uncertainties associated with using
    a simplified modeling approach by considering a recursive parameters estimation
    strategy that lets the model adapt to changing crop and environmental conditions.
    The modeling and estimation approach is capable of accurately describing the soil
    moisture dynamics close to the operation region, overcoming associated uncertainties,
    and can be used as a baseline for making irrigation decisions. To delve deeper
    into the validation and performance of our modeling and estimation approach, a
    comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the estimated parameters is subsequently
    provided. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the parameters and the incidence of
    the estimated parameters in the COM. It can be observed that the parameters associated
    with moisture ( ), irrigation ( ), rain ( ), and temperature ( ) exhibits a low
    dispersion in contrast with the parameter associated to the capillary rise ( ).
    A sensitivity analysis of the estimated parameters can be performed by multiplying
    the obtained parameters by the maximum reported value per respective variable,
    obtaining how much the soil moisture can increase or decrease according to the
    parameter dispersion and the maximum values reported for each variable. The results
    show that during an irrigation period, the soil moisture could (i) decrease a
    1.5% concerning maximum soil moisture of 13.6%; (ii) increase around 3.6% with
    48 h of continuous irrigation; (iii) increase around a 3.7% in relation with 26
    (mm) of rain on a period of 48 h; (iv) decrease around 0.3% with a maximum temperature
    average of 23.3 (°C); and (v) increase around 0.06% in relation with the capillary
    rise. Note that the parameter that shows the high dispersion in the estimation
    process is . However, gives the most significant influence. Moreover, it is observed
    that soil water losses from leaching and runoff could be five times higher than
    the amount lost due to high temperature, which is related to the evapotranspiration
    process. Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Distribution of the parameters and incidence of their distribution
    in the model. Fig. 10 shows that the variations of the estimated parameters are
    distributed close to zero. This dispersion accounts for the expected variation
    that the parameters could present between irrigation periods. For example, in
    the case of rain, from Fig. 9, we have that the parameter associated ( ) is close
    to 0.11. From the standard deviation of , we can expect that this parameter could
    be different around in the next irrigation period. This uncertainty is reflected
    in the prediction of the soil moisture Eq. (16) and in the control action, which
    is taken based on that prediction. For that, the standard deviations of the variation
    of the parameters shown in Fig. 10 are used to add uncertainty and perform a realistic
    simulation in the presence of such uncertainty. The results of the controlled
    system are shown in Fig. 11, where we compare the system’s measured data with
    the expected data if the proposed algorithm is used to manage irrigation. Download

    data is filtered in the process stage. This is important because a similar result
    can be expected by using data from the corresponding weather forecasting services,
    highlighting the importance of the data processing stage in enhancing the algorithm’s
    robustness. On the other hand, it is observed that due to the processing stage,
    rain presents more sensitivity to the added random data. That is because, in the
    case of rain, the limitation to zero of the applied noise affects his distribution.

    between measured temperature (red) and expected temperature; (ii) measured rain
    (red) and expected rain; (iii) measured soil moisture (red) and controlled soil
    moisture if the recommendations provided by the DSS are applied; and (iv) measured
    irrigation actions (red) and recommended irrigation actions by our DSS. In Fig.
    11, we are also presenting the comparison between the measured soil moisture and
    the expected soil moisture if the grower uses the computed recommended irrigation
    . In the comparison, we included the desired soil moisture ( ), and we can observe
    how the controlled moisture tries to be around this value. It is important to
    mention that the computation of starts on January 02, when the first prediction
    data is available (see Fig. 7); before that, and are the same. The most notable
    difference between the irrigation scheduling given by the grower and the irrigation
    scheduling computed by the algorithm is that the algorithm does not generate saturated
    irrigation actions of 48 h. The algorithm aims to uphold an average irrigation
    duration of 10 h every two days. This duration fluctuates proportionally with
    forecasted temperature changes (as seen on January 18) and inversely in response
    to anticipated rain events (as evidenced on January 24). On the other hand, the
    decisions taken by the grower show that he is reacting to extreme events. For
    example, on January 18, the irrigation was turned off when the average soil moisture
    reached a maximum of 13.85% (percolation). Also, it is observed that the irrigation
    is turned on on February 01, when the soil moisture is close to reaching the allowable
    depletion point of 7.5%. In contrast, the controlled moisture is close to 9, avoiding
    the environmental impact of percolation and also avoiding the crop risk of reaching
    an allowable depletion point. However, it is important to mention that the decisions
    taken by the grower show expertise in dealing with this complex process on the
    most difficult type of soil (see Fig. 2), avoiding the allowable depletion point
    and maintaining the soil moisture close to the available water region. Fig. 12
    compares the cumulative irrigation hours applied by the grower with those used
    for the proposed algorithm. On February 09, the grower reported a total of 367
    h of irrigation, while the algorithm used a total of 258 h. This result demonstrates
    the potential of our algorithm to save 30% of the water typically used in seepage-irrigated
    crops in Florida. Notably, seepage irrigation systems are known for their low
    efficiency, often falling below 40% (Dukes et al., 2010). Despite this inefficiency,
    they remain prevalent in Florida. According to the current grower records (personal
    communication), a single hectare of seepage-irrigated sweet corn can consume around
    1500 m3 of water per season. Using this volume consumption as a baseline, our
    proposed algorithm has the capacity to increase water use efficiency up to 450
    m3 per hectare per season. This finding underscores the substantial water-saving
    potential of our DSS, highlighting its significance for sustainable agriculture
    if it is adopted in the state of Florida. Download : Download high-res image (176KB)

    of irrigation hours between the grower technique and the recommendations provided
    by the proposed decision support system. Our study demonstrates significant advancements
    in irrigation management, particularly in incorporating information from weather
    forecasting services to optimize irrigation scheduling. Our approach has shown
    reduced irrigation time in response to anticipated rainfall events. This predictive
    capability offers a distinct improvement over fully automated systems as those
    reported by Domínguez-Niño et al. (2020) and approaches that at the beginning
    of the season precalculate irrigation management based on crop models as reported
    by Hodges et al. (2022), where a consistent reduction in irrigation corresponding
    to rainfall is not evident. We also highlight that the proposed strategy integrates
    multiple information sources for optimal irrigation management based on soil moisture
    and water balance. This is an advancement over the traditional approach presented
    by El-Naggar et al. (2020), where the use of soil moisture sensors and soil water
    balances are seen as independent control techniques, which are compared to elucidate
    the most suitable irrigation practices. While the modernization of irrigation
    systems, as discussed by Çetin et al. (2023), is crucial for sustainable agriculture
    and water conservation, it often involves significant initial investments. This
    can be a major barrier in regions still reliant on traditional irrigation methods
    such as seepage. Our research addresses this challenge by demonstrating that substantial
    water savings can be achieved without full-scale modernization and automation
    of irrigation systems. Our study’s results highlight our approach’s environmental
    benefits, presenting it as a cost-effective alternative for enhancing the sustainability
    of irrigation practices in diverse agricultural settings. Future studies involve
    evaluating the algorithm across varied agricultural settings, encompassing different
    soil types, irrigation methods, different regions, and crops. This is crucial
    for assessing its adaptability and efficacy in water conservation. Concurrently,
    efforts will be directed towards integrating this adaptive decision support system
    (DSS) into accessible digital platforms such as smartphone applications and websites,
    simplifying irrigation decision-making for farmers. Enhancing the DSS algorithm
    will involve developing advanced modeling and estimation techniques to accurately
    estimate and forecast soil moisture dynamics under extreme environmental conditions,
    considering their random and complex nature. The enhancement also includes refining
    predictive models and automated control strategies for more precise irrigation
    scheduling. A key aspect is the creation of control algorithms with mixed objectives,
    such as minimizing irrigation while ensuring optimal crop yield. The implementation
    of Kalman filters and stochastic model predictive control techniques to manage
    forecast uncertainty must be explored. 5. Conclusions In this study, we introduced
    a technological solution to enhance the sustainability of water management in
    agriculture. We developed a decision support system algorithm for irrigation scheduling
    using principles from control theory. This algorithm encompasses modeling, processing,
    estimation, and control stages, ensuring the optimality of the model that describes
    the system. During the evaluation, the estimation stage achieved minimum correlation
    coefficients and values of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. The algorithm integrates
    the parametrized model, processed data, weather forecasting, and human limitations
    to conform an adaptive feedback plus feedforward irrigation predictive control
    strategy that considers human action in the control loop. The algorithm can consistently
    regulate soil moisture, ensuring it remains at desired levels. This approach reduced
    the risks associated with leaching and runoff and offered the potential for water
    savings of up to 30% in seepage irrigated crops on sandy soils. Looking forward,
    we plan to move towards end-user implementation to promote wider adoption and
    benefits of this technological solution. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: Rapid and accurate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) estimation is essential
    for water resource management of irrigated lands. Nevertheless, due to the significant
    uncertainties in the inputs of conventional ETc equations and the inaccessibility
    of their proper spatial and temporal distribution values, precision agriculture
    requires a more accurate evaluation of ETc using efficient methods. Combining
    remote sensing (RS) data and machine learning (ML) techniques has provided a considerable
    capacity for estimating ETc, which can address these challenges. This study aims
    to develop a framework for ETc estimation based on the four most popular tree-based
    ML algorithms, namely M5-pruned (M5P), random forest regression (RFR), gradient-boosted
    regression trees (GBRT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). For this purpose,
    multisource RS data and meteorological and ground measurements (Meteo-GM) were
    used during three growing seasons (2018–2021) in irrigated croplands of the Sugarcane
    & By-Products Development Company in Khuzestan, southwest Iran. Since the unavailability
    of optical sensors, e.g., Landsat-8 data, in cloudy conditions restricts their
    enduring application, an alternative approach employing the Sentinel-1 Synthetic
    Aperture Radar (SAR) data for ETc estimation was also proposed. A set of 23 scenarios
    of various unique combinations of the available parameters was developed to ensure
    that a proper decision could be made for ETc estimation under any conditions.
    Eventually, the contribution of the input variables to estimate ETc was evaluated
    using the Sobol sensitivity analysis. The results showed that the RFR algorithm
    provided the most accurate ETc estimation in all scenarios, followed by the XGBoost,
    GBRT, and M5P algorithms (R2 = 0.92–0.99, RMSE = 2.02–0.32 mm d-1). The Meteo-GM
    models’ performances were improved by incorporating optical and thermal infrared
    (TIR) (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.32 mm d-1) and SAR (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.65 mm d-1)
    RS data. In addition, Sobol's sensitivity analysis revealed that maximum temperature,
    wind speed, pan evaporation, leaf area index, moisture stress index, and inverse
    dual-pol diagonal distance were the most influential input variables in the ETc
    estimation. This study can be used as a reference to simplify the ETc calculations
    using a novel application of ML as a helpful basis for precision irrigation management
    from the point to the regional scale in any weather conditions.

    Recent research provides an alarming view on the world population that will increase
    by 30 percent by 2100 (United Nations, 2019). Therefore, maintaining and increasing
    agrarian production is a significant challenge for agricultural policy (Behzad
    et al., 2009). In many irrigated farming areas, irrigation, primarily consumed
    as crop evapotranspiration (ETc), is the principal water source and the most restricting
    factor for agricultural productivity due to improper precipitation distribution
    (De Vries et al., 2010). In this context, reliable estimation of ETc on a temporal
    and spatial scale is essential for irrigation scheduling, determining crop water
    stress (CWS), hydrological equilibrium studies in a watershed system, and stabilizing
    groundwater resources. ET estimation methods can be classified into physical-based
    and data-driven models. Physical-based models construct equations for ET by drawing
    upon different theoretical assumptions, including energy conservation, gradient-flux
    similarity, complementary relationship, and the Budyko hypothesis. Some physical-based
    ET models may contain parameter and structural errors (Hu et al., 2021). Conversely,
    data-driven models employ fewer physical mechanisms and use different machine
    learning (ML) algorithms, including linear regression (LR), symbolic regression,
    support vector machine, neural network, and tree method, to directly estimate
    ET from climate forcing data (Han et al., 2021, Hao et al., 2022). Also, the emergence
    of the big-data era and advancements in artificial intelligence have led to a
    growing interest in these models. Granata (2019) used M5-Pruned (M5P), random
    forest regression (RFR), and support vector regression (SVR) to model ETc in humid
    subtropical climates in Central Florida. The M5P algorithm used net solar radiation,
    sensible heat flux, soil moisture content (SMC), wind speed, mean relative humidity,
    and mean temperature and was the most accurate model. Ge et al. (2022) estimated
    greenhouse tomato ET using meteorological parameters using eight models, e.g.,
    LR, SVR, K neighbors’ regression (KNR), RFR, AdaBoost regression (ABR), bagging
    regression (BR), gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT), and extreme gradient
    boosting (XGBoost). XGBoost was reported as the best-performing model by selecting
    the input variables Rn, RH, RHmin, Tmax, and Tmin. However, data-driven models
    commonly necessitate a substantial quantity of observational data to facilitate
    model training, and they provide limited mechanistic explanations outside their
    capacity for fitting. Also, these models do not consider the influential factors
    in ETc estimation, such as vegetation conditions, plant diseases, and irrigation
    and fertilizer management. The advent of remote sensing (RS) technology has significantly
    facilitated the implementation of some ET methods, as the land surface parameters
    obtained through RS over extended periods can serve as inputs to different ML
    models (Zhang et al., 2016). Based on the data employed, ETc models derived from
    RS fall into two categories: statistical methods dependent on vegetation index
    (VI) and comparatively more intricate models derived from the surface energy balance
    (SEB) equation. Though the SEB method has been stated as an efficient approach,
    it is challenging because minor mistakes in estimating the land surface temperature
    (LST) lead to significant errors in evaluating sensible heat flux. Moreover, only
    a handful of sensors provide thermal infrared (TIR) data in an open-source format
    (Bai, 2023). In this regard, approaches based on VIs were presented to estimate
    ETc to benefit from RS data while preventing the challenges of SEB-based methods.
    Satellite-derived reflectance-based VIs are valuable for monitoring plants and
    estimating crop water use based on growth stages at various spatial scales (Fan
    et al., 2021). Shao et al. (2021) reported that VIs could be used as near-real-time
    substitutes for the crop coefficient (Kc) because they describe plant development
    circumstances. Notably, Kc is a crucial parameter often required for ETc estimation.
    VIs can also represent the spatial heterogeneity between fields. Although integrating
    RS techniques with ML models to estimate ETc holds significant promise, several
    obstacles require attention (Abbasi et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2021, Mosre and
    Suárez, 2021). Optical RS methods cannot alone offer a direct and reliable detection
    to assess CWS and crop water requirements (CWR) due to the potential instrumental
    limitations, i.e., not using thermal bands (Nouraki et al., 2021). These limitations
    prompted the development of hybrid or experiential approaches for estimating ETc
    that combine the essential benefits of thermal and optical information (Ahmad
    et al., 2021). Mosre and Suárez (2021) developed LR models to estimate daily and
    monthly ETc in arid and cold regions. Their estimates based on a combination of
    RS data and weather parameters performed better than those based on weather data
    alone. Similarly, Liu et al. (2021) estimated ETc in South America by combining
    MODIS images and meteorological data using the RFR and SVR algorithms. The conclusion
    was that the RFR algorithm was superior. In addition, normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI), temperature, and precipitation parameters significantly affected
    ET estimates. Although these methods have been successfully utilized in several
    situations, these sensors could only make valuable acquisitions under almost cloudless
    conditions. This led to the reliance on radar sensing, particularly Sentinel-1
    Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which can provide continuous observation of agricultural
    areas under all weather conditions (McNairn & Shang, 2016). Various studies have
    applied Sentinel-1 SAR data to monitor vegetation areas (Bhogapurapu et al., 2022,
    Gururaj et al., 2019, Periasamy, 2018). There is currently a lack of significant
    studies that have assessed the utility of Sentinel-1 SAR data in ETc estimation.
    This indicates that there is still a need for further investigation to provide
    more insights into modeling and to develop an efficient analytical tool for operational
    applications. Overall, the radar-based vegetation features derived from the dual-polarimetric
    (dual-pol) SAR images are an emerging requirement for the research teams working
    on microwave RS for precision farming, forest management, environmental monitoring,
    and other relevant applications. In light of these issues, the main objectives
    of this study include the following: (i) To develop optimal models of distinct
    input variables for estimating ETc based on the ML algorithms to avoid using calibration
    parameters and empirical relations. (ii) To evaluate the potential of the RS data,
    including optical/TIR and Sentinel-1 SAR data, in predicting ETc spatially and
    temporally in all-weather circumstances. (iii) To assess the capability of the
    ML algorithms, e.g., M5P, RFR, GBDT, and XGBoost, to estimate ETc and determine
    the optimal algorithms. (iv) To use global sensitivity analysis to identify the
    order of importance, dependencies, and interactions between meteorological and
    ground measurement (Meteo-GM) data and RS data in ETc predictive models. 2. Material
    and methods 2.1. Machin learning regression algorithms Supervised ML algorithms
    could be divided into three categories depending on their learning mechanisms:
    models based on tree structures, generalized linear classifiers, and neural networks.
    In this study, decision tree models were selected to predict ETc for two primary
    reasons. First, decision tree-based models are one of the most popular ML algorithms.
    It has been widely employed in research and industry due to its high performance
    in problem-solving and less effort for data preparation during preprocessing.
    Secondly, these models are easy to represent visually and explain to technical
    teams and other users (Quinlan, 1992). 2.2. M5-pruned The decision tree is a data-oriented
    tree structure that produces nodes representing the algorithms. The M5P algorithm
    is a modified version of M5 (Quinlan, 1992) and a data-driven, decision-tree-based
    model developed by Wang and Witten (1996). M5P is presented to combine decision
    tree algorithms and linear regression functions in the leaves, which, unlike other
    ML algorithms, such as ANN and SVR, clearly explain the patterns and connections
    intrinsic to the data using rules and regression equations. Also, they handle
    high-dimensional datasets efficiently despite their simplicity. M5P first divides
    the input space into several subspaces using the standard deviation reduction
    factor (SDR), and then each subspace’s data is used to develop a linear regression
    model. In the next step, the nodes of the extended tree are pruned to prevent
    overfitting issues. Finally, the discontinuities caused by the pruning procedure
    are eliminated using the smoothing technique. Witten and Wang (1996) have provided
    a more detailed algorithm description. However, researchers believe single decision
    tree models perform poorly by reducing the amount of data and increasing complexity
    (Kotsiantis, 2013). Accordingly, ensemble learning techniques were proposed to
    improve the generalization and stability of individual algorithms by integrating
    several trained models employing the identical learning algorithm (Sagi & Rokach,
    2018). In this study, the bagging and boosting strategies were used to minimize
    the variance and bias of individual algorithms. Both techniques combine a group
    of weak classifiers to produce a more accurate, stable, and efficient model. 2.3.
    Random forest regression Introduced by Breiman (2001), RF is an ensemble learning
    method based on the statistical theory that combines the concepts of decision
    trees and bagging to solve classification and regression problems. The RF model
    overcomes the overfitting problem by training each single regression tree using
    the bootstrap method to resample the training data. The RFR algorithm generates
    multiple bootstrap samples with replacements from the original training data set
    (about 67 %) to create various regression trees (ntree), known as ‘in bag’ data.
    In comparison, the excluded data set (about 33 %) is known as ‘out-of-bag’ data
    (OOB) (Breiman, 2001). This reduces the model’s total variance and yields reliable
    results. In addition, the OOB samples are used to measure the variable importance,
    which indicates the predictive power of each variable and is used to optimize
    the selection of input parameters. Finally, the predicted value of an observation
    is computed by aggregating all decisions of the individual trees. Breiman (2001)
    has provided a more detailed description of the RF methods and parameters. During
    this process, four parameters need to be optimized in RF: (1) the number of trees
    in the forest (N_Estimators), (2) the maximum depth for each decision tree (Max_Depth),
    (3) the minimum number of samples on leaf nodes (Min_Samples_Leaf), (4) the minimum
    number of samples required to split an internal node (Min_Samples_Split). 2.4.
    Gradient-Boosted regression trees and extreme gradient boosting Friedman (2001)
    introduced gradient-boosted machines as a supervised ML technique. This approach
    is successively trained as a sequence of tree models, and the subsets of each
    weak learner are combined with a loss function and gradient descent optimization
    to produce a new strong learner. As a result, both GBRT and XGBoost adhere to
    the gradient boosting principle. A detailed description of the methodology and
    learning of the GBRT and XGBoost algorithms can be found in the literature of
    Friedman (2001) and Chen and Guestrin (2016). The XGBoost algorithm is an enhanced
    GBRT method that consists of several decision trees and is generally used for
    classification and regression problems (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). However, the XGBoost
    algorithm is distinct from GBRT in some aspects; a case in point, in contrast
    to GBRT, XGBoost utilizes a second-order Taylor expansion in its loss function,
    while GBRT only uses a first-order series expansion. On the other hand, the objective
    component of the XGBoost algorithm uses normalization to avoid overfitting and
    minimize the model’s complexity. Overall, both algorithms increase the weight
    of incorrectly classified training samples (with significant errors) and decrease
    the weight of those satisfactorily classified. The prior wrongly categorized subsamples
    are processed several times with increased vigilance to minimize the error rate
    (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). This last characteristic enables the XGBoost and GBRT
    algorithms to attain more accuracy than individual decision tree models. The hyper-parameters
    of the GBRT and XGBoost algorithms included n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_leaf,
    min_samples_split, learning_rate, subsample, max_delta_step, gamma, and colsample_bytree.
    This study used Python (version 3.9) software to build the ML algorithms. 2.5.
    Study area and Ground-Based observations The field measurements were conducted
    in the Sugarcane & By-Products Development Company lands. This company is the
    most extensive sugarcane agro-industrial in Iran, located in the Khuzestan province,
    southwest of Iran (Fig. 1). According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification
    (Kottek et al., 2006), the climate in this region is typically hot arid desert
    climates with an average yearly temperature of 22.92 ℃ and 2270.24 mm yr−1 of
    yearly evaporation from open pans. Precipitations are concentrated in fall and
    winter (Nov-Feb) with an average annual total of 203 mm. The soil texture of the
    area was silty clay and silty clay loam with a field capacity (FC) ranging between
    0.33 and 0.41 m3/m−3 and a permanent wilting point (PWP) ranging between 0.14
    and 0.19 m3/m−3, obtained using a pressure plate apparatus on soil samples collected
    in the area. In recent years, the area devoted to sugarcane cultivation was over
    800 km2 in the province’s southern region. Its local growth period ranges from
    nine months to more than a year. According to the region’s rainfall distribution
    and climate conditions, it is necessary to rapidly and accurately determine ETc
    for irrigation management in the area. Therefore, the meteorological variables
    and ground measurement data, including leaf area index (LAI), plant height (H),
    and soil water content (SWC), were used to estimate sugarcane ET (Table 1). Download

    station in the study area daily from 2018 to 2021. It should be noted that precipitation
    (P) was arranged with a 20-day delay due to the temporal rainfall distribution
    in the area. Soil moisture (SM) at the experimental location was measured using
    the conventional gravimetric procedure at 0–30 and 30–60 cm depths, representing
    the root development zone of sugarcane over the crop growth seasons. LAI, defined
    as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area, was calculated
    using a scanner. Sugarcane height, equal to the distance from the soil surface
    to the tip of the longest leaf, was measured using a measuring tape. The study
    area’s sugarcane farms were evenly partitioned into rectangular units with 25
    ha (250 m × 1000 m), and eight fields were selected to monitor the crop details.
    Ground measurements were collected simultaneously as the satellites passed through
    the study area at 24 control locations, three in each field, during the sugarcane
    growth period. Also, to eliminate inadvertent measurement error, each sampling
    location’s parameters were measured three times, and the ultimate mean value was
    used to determine the sampling point’s actual parameters. Based on the FAO-56
    model, ETc is computed by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and
    the Kc, which incorporates the crop-specific properties, i.e., crop transpiration
    and soil evaporation throughout the growth period (Eq. 1). For this purpose, the
    Penman-Monteith FAO-56 method was considered the standard method for ET0 calculation.
    This method is universally accepted for ET0 estimation based only on meteorological
    conditions (Allen et al., 1998). ETc = Kc × ET0 (1) (2) Where Rn is net radiation
    at the crop surface (MJ m-2d-1), G is soil heat flux density (MJ m-2d-1); T is
    the mean daily air temperature at 2-m height (°C), U2 is the wind speed at 2-m
    height (m/s), es is saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea is actual vapor pressure
    (kPa), Δ is slope vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1), and γ is psychrometric constant
    (kPa °C−1). The mid-season and late-season Kc values were modified for local climatic
    conditions and crop height (h) using the below equations: (3) Where Kcmid-FAO
    is Kc recommended during different stages by the FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998),
    U2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1), RHmin is the mean daily
    minimum relative humidity (%), and h is the average plant height (m). The daily
    Kc values during the crop growth stage were determined by Eq. (4) (Allen et al.,
    1998): (4) Where: i is the day number within the growing season, Kci is the crop
    coefficient on the day i, Lstage is the length of the stage under consideration
    (days), and ∑(LPrev) is the sum of the lengths of all previous stages (days).
    2.6. Remote sensing data This study’s RS data for spatial–temporal analyses were
    satellite Earth observations (EO) from multispectral Landsat-8 and dual-pol C-band
    Sentinel-1 SAR sensor. Notably, the Sentinel-2 bands have a higher spatial resolution
    (10 m or 20 m) than the corresponding Landsat-8 bands (30 m). Nevertheless, since
    the physical nature of ET is highly reliant on temperature, Sentinel-2 data were
    not employed in the study due to the lack of a thermal band. These EOs were downloaded
    from the United States Geological Survey’s data distribution (USGS) (https://glovis.usgs.gov/)
    and the ESA Copernicus data hub () websites, respectively. The cloud-free Landsat-8
    images were preprocessed using the environment for visualizing images (ENVI) 5.3.1
    software (Harris Corporation, Melbourne, FL, USA). The preprocessing consisted
    of two main steps: radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction by the Fast
    Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) module (Matthew
    et al., 2002). In addition, cloud cover filters from the Function of mask (FMask)
    algorithm (Zhu et al., 2015, Zhu and Woodcock, 2012) were applied to each image
    to identify cloud and shadow pixels. Subsequently, the spatial resolutions were
    resampled to 10 m using the nearest neighbor technique (Lima et al., 2019, Zhang
    et al., 2023). Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products in Interferometric
    Wide swath mode (IW) with backscatter coefficients in dual-pol (VH and VV) were
    selected in this research and preprocessed by the Sentinel Application Platform
    (SNAP) to produce sigma-naught corrections through several steps presented in
    Fig. 2 (Foumelis et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image (562KB) Download

    data using machine learning models. Over three years, a total of 110 Landsat-8
    and Sentinel-1 SAR images were collected and preprocessed using ENVI 5.3.1 and
    SNAP version 9.0.0 of ESA with the Sentinel-1 Toolbox version 8.0.5 (Table 2).
    Optical/TIR data and SAR VIs provide helpful information about spatio-temporal
    changes in plant growth and phenological phases, which can be subsequently employed
    to estimate ETc. Accordingly, these data can enhance experimental methods of ETc
    estimation spatially. Optical/TIR data are good proxies for representing vegetation
    changes and ultimately estimating ETc (Liu et al., 2021, Shao et al., 2021). However,
    cloud cover is a crucial barrier restricting the exploitation of these data, necessitating

    for estimating ETc in this study. After preparing the data, Pearson correlation
    analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation coefficient and the order of
    significant factors in changing ETc. This is a relevant and dominant evaluation
    method whose outcomes can be a helpful reference for determining different input
    scenarios of the ML algorithms (Ge et al., 2022). Also, hyperparameters are the
    most critical elements significantly affecting the ML models’ performance. Thus,
    it is essential to adjust them in the algorithms. This study used the K-fold cross-validation
    (CV) method combined with grid search (GS) to modify the hyperparameters. K-fold
    CV determines the test error rate by excluding a subset of the training data (i.e.,
    a validation set) from the model fitting process and then using the fitted model
    to predict the validation subset. In this research, K was set to 5. Moreover,
    the predictor variables were randomly divided into 70 % for the training step
    and 30 % for the validation process to develop a reliable ML algorithm. 2.8. Sensitivity
    analysis Sensitivity analysis can investigate uncertainty in a model’s output
    with a greater understanding of the model’s function and potential interactions
    between parameters to evaluate input variables’ contribution to the modeling.
    Therefore, it can reduce model complexity, computational time, and costs. Sobol’s
    method is a variance-based global sensitivity analysis process that can evaluate
    sensitivity throughout the entire input space, considers the complex and nonlinear
    component interactions when determining sensitivity index values, and uses more
    sophisticated sampling techniques. More detailed descriptions can be found in
    the literature of Sobol (1993). The Sobol method provides three distinct sensitivity
    indices about model sensitivity: first-order (Si), higher-order (Sij) (e.g., second-,
    third-, etc. orders), and total-order (ST). These indices are calculated as follows.
    (5) (6) (7) where Vi is the contribution to Var(Y) due solely to the effect of
    Xi, and Varxi is the variance resulting from the contribution of all parameters
    except Xi. This study used the Python package SALib to calculate the Sobol indices
    and generate the samples. 2.9. Accuracy assessment of model performance Two widely
    used statistical indicators evaluated the performances of the M5P, RFR, GBRT,
    and XGBoost models in estimating sugarcane ETc, i.e., coefficient of determination
    (R2), root mean square error (RMSE): (8) (9) where N shows the number of the output
    data series; and are the measured and average of measured ETc, respectively; and
    is predicted ETc. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Correlations of ETc and variables
    Fig. 3 depicts the temporal distribution of daily ETc over three years. ETc ranges
    between 0.82- and 29.11-mm d-1, with a standard deviation of 6.84 mm d-1, over
    the whole dataset. ETc has lower values during the early and late growing seasons,
    ranging from 1 to 2 mm per day from October to December. The maximum ETc value
    in June, during the sugarcane plant development stage, reaches more than 27 mm
    d-, which is expected for a semi-arid region. Pearson’s correlation coefficient
    analysis (P-Coefficient) was used to investigate the significance of RS-derived
    data (optical/TIR data and SAR VIs), meteorological variables, and ground measurement
    data to ETc (Fig. 4). The findings indicate a statistically significant positive
    correlation between ETc and all meteorological variables, except for RHmax, RHmean,
    RHmin, and P, which negatively correlated with ETc. In contrast, Han et al. (2021)
    reported that the prediction model’s accuracy was optimal when considering the
    precipitation variable. Download : Download high-res image (254KB) Download :

    Correlation coefficients (R) for ETc, LAI, Height, VIs, and meteorological parameters.
    It was determined that Tmax, Umean, and Epan play significant leadership roles
    in the area, so they were selected as input variables in the ML models. Also,
    Tmax had the highest correlation coefficient with ETc (0.80). This parameter can
    be measured almost everywhere with basic and affordable instruments. Therefore,
    in addition to adding Tmax as an input to most scenarios, it was also analyzed
    in an individual scenario (scenario-3). Liu et al. (2021) used correlation analysis
    to investigate the influence of meteorological parameters on ETc. They found that
    ETc had the most significant correlation with Tmean. The analysis of correlations
    between ETc and ground data revealed that the most influential ground data on
    ETc were LAI and SM30-60 (Fig. 4). The correlation coefficient between ETc and
    LAI was 0.60, which indicated that vegetation growth was closely related to the
    crop ET. LAI is the interface of the biosphere’s circulation of energy or matter,
    reflected in plant structure alterations. According to Pereira et al. (2020),
    a higher vegetation cover results in increased absorption of solar photons by
    plants, leading to a heightened energy conversion through transpiration. This
    outcome aligns with Shao et al. (2021) findings. Based on the results above, incorporating
    SWC data as a critical environmental factor that impacts stomatal conductance
    and soil evaporation fraction can significantly improve the ETc prediction accuracy
    using the ML approach. Significant positive correlations (P < 0.05) exist between
    ETc and the twelve factors derived from Landsat-8, except for the EVI and Brightness
    variables. The correlation between ETc and LST, NIR, NTR, NIRv, Greenness, MSI,
    and NDVI is more substantial than this relationship with GNDVI and NMDI. Notably,
    this study’s optical/TIR indices are highly associated with vegetation dynamics
    and soil and crop water content (Liu et al., 2021, Mosre and Suárez, 2021). As
    shown in Fig. 4, the highest correlations between ETc and SAR VIs were obtained
    from IDPDD, DPSVI, and VH. Five spectral indices, namely VV, RVI, DPRVIc, VDDPI,
    and DPDD, failed the significance test (P > 0.05). Although the correlation between
    ETc and SAR VIs was weaker than optical/TIR data, they were analyzed as independent
    models in this research due to their advantages and usability in all weather conditions.
    Depending on the variable input types, three models were generally classified
    based on Meteo-GM variables, optical/TIR data, and SAR VIs. Then, different scenarios
    were determined from each model according to the correlation coefficient (Table
    5). Table 5. The combinations of input variables for the machine learning models.

    data Table 6 presents the results of hyperparameter selection based on 5-fold-CV
    for the RFR, XGBoost, GBRT, and M5P algorithms in different scenarios. Table 5
    details Meteo-GM-based ETc estimation scenarios, numbered 1 to 9. The first three
    scenarios only employed meteorological data; ground measurement data, including
    LAI, H, SM0-30, and SM30-60, were added to the subsequent scenarios. The RFR,
    XGBoost, and GBRT algorithms showed similar and effective performance in all scenarios
    of the Meteo-GM model in ETc estimations, while the M5P algorithm exhibited the
    lowest accuracy (Table 7). In all algorithms except M5P, scenario-2 (S2) ETc estimations
    were more consistent with the standard ETc than S1 and S3 (R2 = 0.92–0.93, RMSE
    = 1.91–2.01 mm d-1) (Table 7). This result indicates that ML approaches can satisfactorily
    estimate ETc with only meteorological parameters (Tmax, Umean, Epan). Moreover,
    excluding Tmean, Tmin, RHmax, RHmean, RHmin, Sh, Rs, and P from the input variables
    has no substantial impact on the effectiveness of the RFR, XGBoost, and GBRT estimations,
    except M5P. The Morgan-Granger-Newbold (MGN) test was performed to analyze the
    significance of the algorithm’s accuracy in S2. The results showed that the RFR
    algorithm has a significant difference with the M5P algorithm (MGN = 2.15) but
    not with GBRT (MGN = 1.93) or XGBoost (MGN = 1.87). As expected, the ensemble
    learning models, i.e., RFR, GBRT, and XGBoost, performed nearly identically due
    to the similar nature of the input variables and their limited variation. Table

    values between 1.36 and 1.46-mm d-1 produced the lowest prediction accuracy, but
    it was still satisfactory. The MGN test revealed that the RFR and XGBoost algorithms
    differed significantly in S4 (MGN = 3.6) and S9 (MGN = 2.42) but not in S6 (MGN
    = 1.817). According to Table 7, the findings of S5 indicated that the performance
    of the ML algorithms using meteorological parameters and SWC without considering
    vegetation conditions was lower than S4, which does not include SWC (RMSE = 0.94–2.24
    mm d-1). Therefore, the superiority of using LAI over SWC in ML models for estimating
    ETc is reaffirmed. LAI substantially impacts the quantity of solar radiation absorption,
    significantly affecting ET''s long and short-term periods (Gao et al., 2008).
    Shao et al. (2021) proposed the integration of LAI in ML models for estimating
    corn Kc to avoid significant errors. Omitting the Epan and Umean parameters in
    S7 and S8 significantly reduced ETc prediction. The importance of these two parameters
    could be attributed to the fact that the sugarcane plant’s development period
    in the area coincides with the summer and high temperatures, which are inherently
    associated with high ET. Due to the sugarcane’s rapid development, which may reach
    more than 3 m, the warm local winds that blow over the area during this period
    can also play an essential role in ETc changes. It should be noted that S9, with
    all meteorological parameters, has provided lower results than S6 (Table 7). Therefore,
    it is confirmed that increasing the number of input variables does not necessarily
    lead to improving the ML algorithms’ performance. The Meteo-GM model’s S2, S4,
    and S6 were generally selected as this class''s most practical scenarios. Also,
    the RFR algorithm was identified as the best ML algorithm in all three mentioned
    scenarios based on the MGN test. Furthermore, M5P led to the highest scattered
    and residual values in ranges of 5–12 mm and 25–30 mm in S2, S4, and S6, respectively,
    and tended to overestimate ETc in these ranges (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). However, Granata
    (2019) reported different results regarding the superiority of the M5P algorithm
    over the Bagging, SVR, and RF algorithms in predicting actual ET, using flux,
    SMC, wind speed, RHmean, and Tmean as input variables. Download : Download high-res

    Violin plot for distribution of residuals in different scenarios (Scenarios 2,
    4, 6, 11, and 19). 3.3. Assessment of remote Sensing-Based ETc models The optical/TIR
    model included seven ETc prediction scenarios from S10 to S16. In the training
    phase, the RFR, GBRT, and XGBoost algorithms led to remarkably high values of
    R2, more significant than 0.96. In particular, RFR is characterized by the highest
    R2 and lowest RMSE values in S11 (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.32 mm d-1). Also, according
    to Fig. 5, the ETc estimates from S11 using the RFR algorithm against standard
    ETc were closer to the 1:1 line (Fig. 5 d), showing that RFR is more accurate
    than other ML algorithms, notably M5P, which has the highest residuals in the
    ranges 5–10 mm d-1 and 25–30 mm d-1 (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the MGN test results
    revealed a significant difference between the algorithms in all-optical/TIR model
    scenarios. Hao et al. (2022) introduced a novel methodology, titled endmember-based
    soil and vegetation energy partitioning (ESVEP-RF), for estimating crop growing
    season ET using MODIS data over 12 years (2003–2012, 2018, and 2019) from five
    flux towers in Nebraska and Michigan. This approach combines the strengths of
    the trapezoidal model and RF algorithm. The findings indicated that ESVEP-RF exhibits
    a high capacity to estimate ET precisely, provided an adequate and representative
    quantity of training samples was available. Nevertheless, the primary constraint
    of ESVEP-RF pertains to the requirement of crop type and planting date as inputs
    for the ESVEP model to compute various parameters, including accumulated growing
    degree day, height, and aerodynamic resistance. This data exhibits significant
    uncertainties that have the potential to impact the accuracy of the ET calculation
    significantly. Notably, the technique employed in computing the gridded instantaneous
    latent heat flux is applicable solely under cloudless circumstances. The optical/TIR
    model results showed that ETc could be accurately predicted by combining meteorological
    parameters with the spectral indices, considering the vegetation conditions. Meanwhile,
    the simultaneous use of meteorological parameters, optical/TIR information, and
    ground measurement data reduced the accuracy of the ML algorithms (i.e., S12-S15).
    This is consistent with Mosre and Suárez’s (2021) findings, which demonstrated
    that it is possible to produce reliable and precise estimations of daily and monthly
    ETc by incorporating RS data and meteorological parameters into ML algorithms.
    Notably, S10, which only included optical/TIR data derived from Landsat 8, provided
    satisfactory results by the RFR, GBRT, and XGBoost algorithms ranked based on
    RMSE values in descending order of GBRT > XGBoost > RFR, which is consistent with
    the MGN test results. Accordingly, optical and thermal RS data can reliably predict
    ETc in regions with inadequate meteorological variables to estimate ETc. This
    fact agrees with the findings of Abbasi et al. (2021). Generally, the main advantage
    of using optical/TIR information compared to ground measurement data like LAI,
    SM, and H is that they do not allow extrapolation of estimates to vast areas due
    to their point measurements characteristic. However, spectral indices like NDVI,
    NIR, NIRv, NTR, MSI, D1609, Greenness, and LST band could reflect vegetation,
    structural, and phenological conditions information and reveal SM and CWS spatially,
    which can be easily extensible to large areas. According to Table 5, the ETc prediction
    model based on SAR VIs was developed from scenarios 17 to 23. By comparing different
    scenarios in the SAR VIs model to estimate ETc, S17, using only SAR RS data, had
    the least accuracy in predicting ETc. In contrast, S19 provided the highest level
    of precision across all ML algorithms (R2 = 0.96–0.98). In S19, ground measurement
    data was used in addition to meteorological variables and SAR VIs, which may account
    for its superiority over S18. Nevertheless, S18 performed satisfactorily using
    meteorological parameters and dual-pol SAR data (VH, IDPDD, and DPSVI) (R2 = 0.94–0.97).
    Also, the RFR algorithm was the best ML algorithm in both S18 and S19 based on
    the MGN test. Fig. 5 (e) shows the scatter plots for the simultaneous use of dual-pol
    SAR data, meteorological parameters, LAI, and SM30-60 in the ML algorithms. The
    highest data dispersion was obtained in the M5P algorithm. In contrast, the RFR
    algorithm had the lowest scattering and residual values, leading to the highest
    ETc estimation accuracy (Fig. 5 e and Fig. 6). The current findings indicate that
    dual-pol SAR data, including VH, IDPDD, and DPSVI, can effectively describe vegetation
    changes during different growth stages, similar to optical/TIR data. This study’s
    findings are consistent with previous SAR-based crop growth monitoring research
    (Bhogapurapu et al., 2022, Gururaj et al., 2019, Periasamy, 2018). For instance,
    Chintala et al. (2022) reported VH as the best parameter for sugarcane growth
    monitoring. Also, the ML algorithms’ performance decreased by omitting Umean and
    Epan parameters in scenarios 20–23, demonstrating the importance of combining
    SAR data and meteorological parameters. The MGN test and Table 7′s statistical
    measures indicate that the RFR algorithm is reliable for estimating ETc in S2,
    S4, S6, S11, and S19. The results indicated that ensemble learning models were
    more effective than single decision tree models for ETc modeling. The M5P model’s
    structure renders its results highly unstable, as even minor variations in the
    input can lead to significant changes in the model. In contrast, this is not true
    for ensemble learning models, i.e., RFR, GBRT, and XGBoost (Kersaints, 2013).
    According to prior studies, the XGBoost algorithm was expected to perform better
    than the RFR algorithm (Ge et al., 2022). As in S2, where only meteorological
    parameters were used, a similar result was observed between these two algorithms.
    However, the RFR algorithm outperformed the XGBoost algorithm when the types of
    input variables were expanded, i.e., adding ground measurement data and RS information
    to the input dataset. Also, the RFR algorithm requires fewer hyperparameter adjustments
    than the GBRT and XGBoost algorithms, making it more straightforward for less-technical
    users. Overall, the main advantage of the ETc prediction approach based on the
    RFR algorithm and RS data is that it allows managers and appraisers to spatially
    and temporally estimate ETc in areas where meteorological parameters are not readily
    available. 3.4. Comparison of the spatial distribution of ETc To enhance comprehension
    of various ETc model outputs at the regional scale, Fig. 7 illustrates the spatial
    distribution pattern of ETc predicted by the optical/TIR-RFR and SAR-RFR models
    on May 21st and May 18th of 2020, respectively. These times were chosen due to
    the extensive vegetation growth and high ETc rates. As expected, the SAR-RFR model
    was highly consistent with the optical/TIR-RFR model at different spatial and
    temporal scales. Notably, soil moisture (due to irrigation), vegetation conditions,
    soil properties, and meteorological variables significantly influence the ETc
    variations in the area. Therefore, the high spatial heterogeneity of ETc at the
    specified times can be attributed to varied irrigation schedules and different
    growth stages in sugarcane fields. Download : Download high-res image (924KB)

    2020, respectively. 3.5. Sensitivity analysis of model input variables The Sobol
    technique was used to perform a global sensitivity analysis to evaluate the RFR
    algorithm’s dependability under particular scenarios (Fig. 8). Tmax, Umean, and
    Epan played the most significant role in the RFR algorithm’s ETc estimation in
    all optimal scenarios (Fig. 8). In S2, Epan was more sensitive than Tmax. In contrast,
    in S4, S6, S11, and S19, the Tmax sensitivity value was higher than Epan, and
    no significant difference was observed between them. In S4, LAI and H were moderately
    sensitive in the estimation process but less critical than meteorological parameters.
    Also, similar results were observed by LAI with a higher sensitivity than the
    SM30-60 parameter in S6. Although obtaining accurate SM in soil deeps is challenging,
    it had minor sensitivity to the RFR algorithm’s performance in S6 (ST and S1 =
    0.003). Similar to previous studies (Fan et al., 2021, Shao et al., 2021), Sobol’s
    sensitivity analysis reveals that LAI is the most vital predictor parameter from
    the ground measurement dataset, which can reflect long-term observations of plant
    phenology changes. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download

    S2, (b) S4, (c) S6, (d) S11, and (e) S19. The error bar represents the standard
    deviation of sensitivity indices. As expected, LST was so sensitive that its impact
    on ETc estimation was comparable with Epan and Umean parameters in S11 (ST = 0.20,
    S1 = 0.18). Following these three parameters, the most sensitive variables were
    NIR, MSI, and D1609. S11′s results might be because the parameters derived from
    RS data describe not only the vegetation conditions but also contain the crop
    water content information. Another interesting result was the higher importance
    of these three optical data than NDVI in the estimation. This may be because NDVI
    exhibits greater sensitivity during low greenness phases, while it becomes saturated
    during high vegetation greenness periods, limiting its ability to depict vegetation
    growth accurately (Hao et al., 2022). On the other hand, Liu et al. (2021) introduced
    precipitation, temperature, and NDVI as the most influential parameters for predicting
    ET. Accordingly, LST, NIR, MSI, and D1609 are essential parameters for ETc estimation
    using the optical/TIR approach, which requires special attention for further spectral
    and spatial improvement. In addition to meteorological variables and LAI, IDPDD
    indicated higher importance than other input parameters in S19 (ST = 0.03, S1
    = 0.017). Notably, ETc estimated by the SAR VIs approach is affected by vegetation
    indices and meteorological parameters; hence, the simultaneous use of IDPDD and
    LAI led to better vegetation monitoring. Fig. 8 demonstrates no significant differences
    between the total and first-order sensitivity, meaning that the input parameters
    in each scenario do not substantially interact. 4. Conclusions This study developed
    three new methods based on Meteo-GM variables, optical/TIR data, and SAR VIs to
    estimate daily sugarcane ETc using tree-based models, i.e., the M5P, RFR, GBRT,
    and XGBoost algorithms. The estimations were performed under different conditions,
    including climate data constraints and clear-sky and cloud-cover circumstances,
    during three years in irrigated croplands in southern Khuzestan, Iran. Different
    scenarios were determined for each approach based on the correlation coefficient
    between the input variables. The decisive parameters obtained by the correlation
    coefficient in the Meteo-GM approach were rated as Epan > Tmax > Umean > LAI >
    SM30-60. The plant height variable was at the bottom of the list. In the models
    based on the optical/TIR data and SAR VIs, the correlation coefficient ranked
    the most critical input factors as follows: LST > NIR > NTR > NIRv > Greenness
    > MSI > D1609; IDPDD > VH > DPSVI. S2, using Tmax, Umean, and Epan as input variables,
    had the highest prediction capabilities in meteorological data scenarios, where
    all the applied ML algorithms performed admirably (R2 = 0.91–0.93). This scenario
    had the benefit of directly providing ETc without requiring crop coefficients.
    Also, the existence of Tmean, Tmin, RHmax, RHmean, RHmin, Sh, Rs, and P in the
    input variables does not confer significant benefits over their absence, so it
    is efficient in areas with insufficient meteorological data. Moreover, S4 and
    S6 simulated the most accurate ETc among the Meteo-GM approach scenarios (R2S6
    = 0.95, R2S4 = 0.96) by incorporating meteorological variables and ground measurement
    data (LAI and SM30-60) using the RFR algorithm. The findings indicate that RFR
    outperformed the other ML algorithms in clear-sky and cloud-cover circumstances
    using S11 and S19 with RMSE values of 1.51- and 1.62-mm d-1, respectively. Generally,
    the GBRT, XGBoost, and RFR algorithms showed nearly identical performance, while
    M5P was the least effective algorithm but still satisfactory. Sobol sensitivity
    analysis revealed that the Tmax, Umean, and Epan parameters were critical for
    estimating ETc in all models. The suggested methods help researchers better grasp
    the uncertainty in ETc estimation without impairing the precision of the results.
    However, applying these methods under conditions distinct from this study will
    depend on data availability for adjusting the parameters and selecting the appropriate
    approach. ML models have the potential to exhibit comparable or superior performance
    to complex physical methods, especially in the context of large-scale investigations.
    However, it is essential to note that these models lack the interpretability inherent
    in physical models. Therefore, it is recommended that future research endeavors
    explore the integration of ML and physical models at both local and large scales
    to minimize uncertainties and enhance ETc prediction accuracy. Funding “Shahid

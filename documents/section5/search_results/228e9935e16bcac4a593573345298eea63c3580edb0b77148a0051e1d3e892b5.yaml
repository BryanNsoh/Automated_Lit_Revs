    Get rights and content Abstract Variations of the crop water stress index (CWSI)
    have been used to characterize plant water stress and schedule irrigations. Usually,
    this thermal-based stress index has been calculated from measurements taken once
    daily or over a short period of time, near solar noon or after and in cloud free
    conditions. A method of integrating the CWSI over a day was developed to avoid
    the noise that may occur if weather prevents a clear CWSI signal near solar noon.
    This CWSI and time threshold (CWSI-TT) was the accumulated time that the CWSI
    was greater than a threshold value (0.45); and it was compared with a time threshold
    (CWSI-TT) based on a well-watered crop. We investigated the effectiveness of the
    CWSI-TT to automatically control irrigation of short and long season grain sorghum
    hybrids (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, NC+ 5C35 and Pioneer 84G62); and to examine
    crop response to deficit irrigation treatments (i.e. 80%, 55%, 30% and 0% of full
    replenishment of soil water depletion to 1.5-m depth). Results from automated
    irrigation scheduling were compared to those from manual irrigation based on weekly
    neutron probe readings. In 2009, results from the Automatic irrigation were mixed;
    biomass yields in the 55% and 0% treatments, dry grain yields in the 80% and 0%
    treatments, and WUE in the 80%, 55%, and 0% treatments were not significantly
    different from those in the corresponding Manual treatments. However, dry grain
    yields in the 55% and 30% treatments were significantly less than those in the
    Manual control plots. These differences were due mainly to soil water variability
    in the beginning of the growing season. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact
    that IWUE for dry grain yield was not significantly different for 30% and 55%
    treatments, and was significantly greater for Automatic control at 80%. In 2010,
    there were no significant differences in biomass, dry grain yield, WUE, or IWUE
    for irrigation control methods when compared across the same amount treatments.
    Similar results between irrigation methods for at least the highest irrigation
    rate (80% of soil water depletion) in 2009 and among all irrigation treatment
    amounts in 2010 indicate that the CWSI-TT method can be an effective trigger for
    automatically scheduling either full or deficit irrigations for grain sorghum
    in a semi-arid region. Highlights ► We used a plant feedback method and remote
    sensing to successfully schedule irrigations. ► A CWSI calculated over daylight
    hours in a 24 h period is useful in timing irrigations for sorghum. ► Crop WUE
    was optimal at the level of 55% replacement of soil water depletion to field capacity.

    Sorghum is important to the livestock and ethanol industries in the United States.
    Both early and late maturing varieties of grain sorghum are grown in the Northern
    High Plains area of Texas, where approximately 40% of grain sorghum is irrigated,
    resulting in yields double those from dryland farming (Colaizzi et al., 2009).
    Irrigation in this semi-arid region is accomplished primarily with center pivot
    systems. If irrigation strategies can be automated, farmers can save time and
    labor by allowing the automated system to monitor crop water status and help determine
    when to apply irrigations. If automated irrigation systems produce yields and
    water use efficiencies comparable to those resulting from prior best irrigation
    scheduling practices, then farmers can realize greater profitability. The theoretical
    crop water stress index (CWSI) developed by Jackson et al. (1981) was based on
    energy balance analysis. This thermal stress index has been investigated to characterize
    plant water stress (Howell et al., 1986, Yuan et al., 2004, Möeller et al., 2007),
    estimate crop productivity and water stress relationships (Wanjura et al., 1990),
    and has been used as a tool for irrigation timing (Throssel et al., 1987, Nielsen,
    1990, Garrot et al., 1994, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008), usually in its empirical
    form. The theoretical CWSI incorporates incoming solar radiation, relative humidity,
    air temperature, wind speed, canopy resistance at potential evapotranspiration,
    and crop height. Its general form is: (1) where (Tc − Ta) is the measured difference
    between crop canopy temperature and air temperature, (Tc − Ta)ll is the lower
    limit representing the temperature difference for a well watered crop, and (Tc
    − Ta)ul is the upper limit representing the temperature difference between the
    crop canopy and ambient air when the plants are severely stressed (Jackson et
    al., 1988). The CWSI tends towards 0 after irrigations and progressively climbs
    towards 1 as soil water is depleted. Many studies have used differential irrigation
    amounts on different crops and calculated the corresponding CWSI values (alfalfa
    – Hattendorf et al., 1988; sorghum – Olufayo et al., 1996; Bermuda grass – Farahani
    et al., 1993, Emekli et al., 2007; corn – Yazar et al., 1999; cotton – Barbosa
    da Silva and Rao, 2005). A few studies have used an established CWSI value to
    trigger irrigations on soybean (Nielsen, 1990) and wheat (Garrot et al., 1994).
    Typically, the measurements were either instantaneous (Hattendorf et al., 1988,
    Nielsen, 1990, Farahani et al., 1993) or were taken as average values over a short
    interval usually near solar noon (Garrot et al., 1994, Olufayo et al., 1996, Ajayi
    and Olufayo, 2004, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008). Irrigation scheduling using the CWSI
    has not always been successful, and it has not become widely adopted. One problem
    is that instantaneous measurements, or mean values from measurements take over
    a short time period near solar noon, may be influenced by passing clouds, wind
    gusts or other micrometeorological incidents. We hypothesized that assessing the
    CWSI over daylight hours would provide a more stable and relevant index for irrigation
    scheduling (i.e. timing) because it would average and thus smooth out the effects
    of short-term microclimatological events and more reliably respond to the plant
    water status. A method of integrating the CWSI over a day was developed. This
    CWSI-TT was the accumulated time that the stress index, CWSI, was greater than
    a threshold value (0.45), for a specified time threshold (CWSI-TT) based on a
    well-watered crop. In this study, we compared a scientifically based manual method
    for irrigation scheduling that of direct soil water measurements using a neutron
    probe, to the automated plant-feedback method comprised of infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) and microclimatological instrumentation for remote sensing of crop water
    status. While farmers or crop advisers can use a neutron probe to determine soil
    water status, the disadvantages of the neutron scattering method include the radiation
    hazard and attendant licensing requirements, relatively poor (and uncertain) spatial
    resolution, and the soil specific calibration requirement (Or and Wraith, 2002).
    The initial investment for a neutron probe ranges in cost from $4000 to $6000.
    The system for remotely sensing crop water status with IRTs and meteorological
    instrumentation is variable depending on the number of IRTs and the manufacturer.
    However, with the advent of low-cost wireless sensors (Mahan et al., 2010, O''Shaughnessy
    et al., 2011) and sensor network systems (O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010), the
    cost is closer to the lower-end of the purchase price for a single neutron probe.
    Additionally automated systems using the center pivot as a platform for IRTs can
    be used to provide crop canopy temperature maps on a frequent basis (Peters and
    Evett, 2007), which will have better spatial and temporal resolution than weekly
    neutron probe readings. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate
    the effectiveness of the CWSI-TT method to automatically trigger irrigations;
    and (2) and to examine grain sorghum response to deficit irrigation treatment
    amounts in a semi-arid region. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site
    Experiments took place at the Conservation Production and Research Laboratory,
    Bushland, TX (35°11′N, 102°06′W, 1174 m above mean sea level). The field soil
    was a Pullman clay loam, a fine, mixed, superactive, thermic, Torrertic Paleustoll
    (Soil Survey Staff, 2004). The field capacity (0.33 m3 m−3) and wilting point
    (0.18 m3 m−3) water contents were assumed uniform across the center pivot field.
    The climate is semi-arid with an average annual rainfall of 470 mm. 2.2. Sorghum
    varieties and agronomics We used a short and long season variety in this experiment
    since both varieties are important to farmers in this area. Almost invariably,
    a full-season variety will out-yield a good early-season hybrid, other conditions
    being equal and favorable for sorghum growth. But, short season varieties use
    less water over a growing season and can be used as a replacement crop or may
    provide economic relief if an earlier crop is damaged due to extreme weather conditions
    or harmful chemical residuals. Early maturing or short season (SS) grain sorghum
    (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), variety NC+ 5C35,1 was planted on day of year (DOY)
    175 (June 24) in 2009, and a late maturing variety or long season (LS) sorghum,
    Pioneer 84G62, was planted on June 1 (DOY 152) in 2010. Both crops were planted
    in concentric rows on beds spaced 0.76-m apart under a three span center pivot
    irrigation system. Irrigations were applied using low energy precision application
    (LEPA) drag socks (Lyle and Bordovsky, 1983) in every other furrow. Dikes were
    placed in the furrows to reduce runoff. The sorghum varieties were cultivated
    in a manner similar to production practices in the region. Fertilizer was applied
    based on preplant soil samples tested by a commercial soil testing laboratory.
    The low nitrogen application for 2009 indicates residual nitrogen from the previous
    year''s fallowed field after a failed cotton crop. Fertilizers and herbicides
    for weed control were applied through the pivot lateral (Table 1). Table 1. Summary

    Oct 15–24 (DOY 288–295) Total above-ground biomass and grain yields were hand-harvested
    from a 10 m2 area in each of the 48 treatment plots prior to mechanical harvesting.
    Biomass samples were dried in an oven at 60 °C, and heads were stored in cotton
    bags and air-dried at room temperature in a drying room. 2.3. Treatments and plot
    design Two irrigation control method treatments were used; Automatic and Manual
    as described later. For each irrigation control method, four irrigation amount
    treatments were applied (80%, 55%, 30%, and 0% (dryland) of full; full being defined
    differently for automatic and manual control methods as discussed later). Treatment
    plots were arranged in six blocks arc-wise around half of the center pivot circle
    (Fig. 1a and b) with alternating blocks for manual and automatic irrigation scheduling.
    Within each block, irrigation treatment amounts were randomly assigned with two
    replications arranged radially from the pivot point. Radial and arc-wise blocking
    was designed to control for effects of position along the lateral on irrigation
    application rate and to control for effects of possible runoff. Typically, alternating
    halves of our pivot fields are cropped each year for experimentation and a cover
    crop is grown on the opposite semi-circle to help even-out the soil water profile.
    In 2009, however, it was necessary to plant sorghum on the same semi-circle where
    cotton was grown under differential irrigation treatments in the previous year.

    irrigation system. Manual Blocks I, II, and III were irrigated based on weekly
    neutron probe readings and Automatic Blocks I, II, and III were irrigated automatically
    based on the CWSI-TT trigger. 2.4. Manual irrigation scheduling Manual irrigations
    were scheduled over 2–3 days in a 7-day period, following weekly soil water readings
    by neutron methods usually taken on Monday mornings. Manual irrigations were performed
    on odd-numbered days of the year (DOY) based on 80%, 55%, 30%, and 0% (designated
    I80%M, I55%M, I30%M, and I0%M, respectively) of full replenishment to field capacity
    of water depletion in the top 1.5 m of soil. Soil water content was determined
    using a neutron probe (NP) (model 503DR, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Martinez, CA)
    in 0.2-m increments down to 2.4 m in the I80%M treatment plots. In all other treatment
    plots, soil water was measured once every 30 days for soil water balance computation
    of evapotranspiration (ET) only. Access tubes were placed in a row in the center
    of each plot (18 rows wide). The neutron probe was field calibrated to accuracy
    of better than 0.01 m3 m−3, resulting in separate calibrations from three distinct
    soil layers, Ap, Bt and Btca, using methods described by Evett (2008). Any rainfall
    occurring prior to irrigation of the total amount for the week was subtracted
    from the required total. Irrigation level was determined by nozzle discharge rate,
    horizontal spacing of the drop hoses, and the travel speed of the center pivot.
    2.5. Automatic irrigation scheduling When scheduled by the CWSI-TT algorithm,
    automatic irrigations were applied on even DOY. The CWSI-TT algorithm used a CWSI
    threshold of 0.45, and a time threshold of 420 min. These thresholds were determined
    from well-watered grain sorghum grown on weighing lysimeter fields at Bushland,
    Texas in 1988. The CWSI was calculated every 5 min, and each time the index was
    greater than 0.45 during daylight hours, 5 min of time were accumulated. At midnight,
    if the cumulative time for the past 24 h was greater than 420 min, then an irrigation
    was scheduled to be applied using computer control over the automatic blocks of
    the field the following morning. Because Manual and Automatic irrigations were
    scheduled on alternate days, the full irrigation level for automatic treatments
    was based on twice the peak daily crop water use rate of grain sorghum at the
    location (2 × 10 mm = 20 mm) (Steiner et al., 1991). Irrigations for the automatic
    control treatments were 80%, 55%, 30% and 0% (designated I80%A, I55%A, I30%A,
    and I0%A) of 20 mm. Automatic irrigation scheduling was initiated when the SS
    variety was in the 5th leaf stage, summer 2009, and when the LS variety was in
    the 7th leaf stage during the summer of 2010. 2.6. Canopy temperature and microclimate
    instrumentation A total of 16 infrared thermometers (IRTs) (Exergen model IRt/c.5:1-Type
    T, Watertown, Mass.) were mounted on the pivot lateral and wired to a datalogger
    (CR21X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) to measure and record crop canopy temperature
    (Tc). The IRT sensors were calibrated in a controlled temperature environment
    using a blackbody calibrator (CES100, Electro Optical Industries, Inc., Santa
    Barbara, CA). Sensors were mounted on vertical masts placed at opposite edges
    of each concentric treatment plot, with two sensors facing inwards towards the
    canopy in each plot at an oblique, down-looking angle to reduce sun angle effects
    and viewing of bare soil. The sensors were located forward of the drop hoses approximately
    1.5 m above the crop canopy. An IRT was placed in each of the two I80%A treatment
    plots in Auto Block I (Fig. 1) to record reference temperature for a well-watered
    crop. Crop canopy temperatures recorded from the moving irrigation system were
    averaged for the period of time it took for the system to move across each plot,
    and so represented a mean one-time-of-day plot-specific temperature. These plot-specific
    temperatures were scaled using the method of Peters and Evett (2004) to produce
    estimates of the plot temperature over the entire daytime. Wind speed (uz) and
    solar radiation (Rs, W m−2) were measured every 2 s at a height (z) of 2 m (using
    a RM-Young Wind Sentry Set and LI-COR 200SZ, respectively) using a datalogger
    (model CR10X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) located in plot 12 (Fig. 1) and
    reported as 5-min mean values. Air temperature (Ta, °C), relative humidity (RH,
    %), and precipitation (P, mm) were measured using a HMPC45 probe and TE-52 mm
    bucket wired to a datalogger (CR10X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) mounted near
    the end of the pivot lateral. Data from each of the dataloggers were transmitted
    using radio frequency (RF) telemetry in the 900 MHz frequency to a base station
    computer located at the pivot point. 2.7. CWSI calculations The upper (Tul) and
    lower temperatures (Tll), boundaries of the CWSI, were calculated from measured
    environmental parameters paired with scaled canopy temperature data using equations
    from FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998). The upper limit was calculated for a non-transpiring
    crop (latent heat of evaporation = 0) using the equation (Jackson et al., 1988):
    (2) where Rn is the net radiation (MJ m−2 d−1) is estimated as the difference
    between incoming net shortwave and outgoing net longwave radiation using Eqs.
    (38), (39), and (40) in FAO-56 and an albedo (α) = 0.23; G = soil heat flux (MJ
    m−2 d−1) is estimated using Eq. (45) from FAO-56; ρ (kg m−3) is the density of
    air approximated as a function of air temperature; Cp = specific heat capacity
    of dry air (1013 J kg−1 °C−1); and ra is aerodynamic resistance (Eq. (4)). Using
    this upper boundary equation, assumes bulk canopy resistance, rc, approaches infinity.
    The lower limit, representing a fully transpiring crop, (Tc − Ta)ll is calculated
    using: (3) where γ is the psychometric constant (Pa °C−1); Δ is the slope of the
    saturated vapor pressure-temperature relationship calculated at the average of
    canopy and air temperature expressed in °C (as in Jackson et al., 1988); es is
    saturated vapor pressure, ea is actual vapor pressure, and ra is aerodynamic resistance
    (s m−1), computed as Eq. (4) (FAO-56): (4) where zm is the height of wind measurements
    (m); zom the roughness length (m) for momemtum transfer, approximated by 0.123
    × crop height; zh the height of humidity measurements (m); d the zero plane displacement
    height (m), approximated by 2/3 × crop height; zoh the roughness length governing
    transfer of heat and vapor (m), approximated by 0.1 × zom; k = von Karman''s constant
    = 0.41; and uz = wind speed (m s−1). Crop height was estimated using data from
    sorghum grown on the large weighing lysimeter fields at Bushland, TX. 2.8. Water
    use and water use efficiency calculations Crop water use (ETc, mm) was calculated
    using the soil water balance equation (Evett, 2002): (5) where ETc is evapotranspiration,
    ΔS is the change in soil water stored in the profile as determined using the NP
    (final minus initial soil water reading), R is runoff, P is precipitation (mm),
    I is the irrigation water applied (mm), and F is flux across the lower boundary
    of the control volume (taken as positive when entering the control volume), all
    in units of mm. Runoff and flux were assumed to be negligible because the field
    was furrow diked, plots were large enough that horizontal fluxes were important
    only in plot borders, and NP measurements indicated negligible flux in the 2.1
    to 2.3-m depth range. The average daily fractional soil water depletion (Df) in
    the root zone of the I80%A treatment plots was calculated as Df = Dp/TAW where
    Dp (depletion) was calculated using a daily soil water balance (Chapter 8-FAO-56
    in Allen et al., 1998). Total available water (TAW) is the total of the plant
    available water in the root zone (depth of 1.5 m) at field capacity. Daily Df
    was compared to daily average CWSI-TT values from the I80%A treatment plots. The
    comparison was only made between values from these plots since the irrigation
    triggers were based on data from these plots. Water use efficiency (kg m−3) was
    calculated as (6) where Yg is the economic yield (g m−2), and ETc is the crop
    water use (Howell, 2002). Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE, kg m−3) was calculated
    as (7) where Ygi is the economic yield (g m−2) in the ith treatment level, Ygd
    is the dryland yield (g m−2), and IRRi is the irrigation water applied (mm) (Howell,
    2002). 2.9. Statistical analysis Results from each year were analyzed using the
    General Linear Models (GLM) procedures, and the Bonferroni t-test to perform multiple
    comparisons of treatment means at p = 0.05. Statistical software was SAS (SAS
    9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Climate and
    precipitation In 2009, rainfall from June through October totaled 228 mm, which
    was typical for the area and time of year. Seventy-four percent of rainfall for
    this growing season occurred between boot and flowering stage. In 2010, the majority
    of precipitation again fell between boot and flowering stage; however, the total
    precipitation for the 2010 growing season was 46% less than for 2009. Maximum
    daily temperatures and grass reference ET (ETo) values were also greater in August
    through October of 2010 than in 2009 (Table 2). Table 2. Climatic conditions for

    center pivot field at the beginning of the 2009 growing season was variable among
    treatment plots because circumstances forced cropping sorghum on the same field
    as had differential irrigation treatments for cotton in 2008. Those 2008 differential
    irrigation treatments resulted in soil water variability amongst the manual and
    automatic treatment plots at the beginning of the 2009 growing season (Table 3).
    Soil water variability in the 30% treatments was such that the mean initial water
    content was larger for the Manual treatments at the 50–230-cm depths and remained
    so at depths >50 cm throughout the season. For the 55% treatments, mean initial
    water content was larger for the Manual treatment below the 70-cm depth and continued
    so throughout the season. For the 80% treatments, mean initial water content was
    larger for the Manual treatment at the 50- and 70-cm depths, however, there was
    no clear difference in water contents between these Manual and the Automatic treatments
    at 90-cm depth and below throughout the season. Table 3. Treatment mean water
    contents (mm) in the top 1.5-m of the soil profile on July 6, day of year (DOY)

    Over the irrigation scheduling period (DOY 204–272), the Manual control treatments
    received 8–13% more water than those in the automatically irrigated blocks (Table
    4). Cumulative automatic irrigations were comparable in volume to manual irrigations
    until DOY 255 (Sept 12) (Fig. 2). Small differences between air and canopy temperatures
    and higher levels of RH (minimum daily average of 40% and maximum daily average
    of 92%) between DOY 255 and DOY 264 contributed to reduced CWSI levels, which
    reduced the number of automatic irrigations that were scheduled compared with
    those scheduled manually using soil water sensing. Table 4. Irrigation amounts

    treatments kept up with those for the manual control plots until DOY 251; (b)
    in 2010, automatic irrigation scheduling started on DOY 186. During the last week
    of the irrigation season, Sep 3 to Sep 10 (DOY 247–252), no automatic irrigation
    signals were received. In 2010, the soil water profile was nearly uniform among
    the 48 treatment plots; the average soil water content was 482 mm in the 1.5-m
    profile (0.32 m3 m−3), which was near field capacity, with a standard deviation
    of ±3 mm. Uniformity of the soil water profile was improved by the precipitation
    received in the early months of the calendar year, and also by the fact that the
    field was fallowed in the previous year. Irrigation amount differences between
    the Automatic and Manual methods were less than 3%; however, the automatic control
    method scheduled irrigations that did not match the Manual irrigations (i.e.,
    NP readings did not indicate a need to irrigate manual control plots) early in
    the season. Cumulative irrigations in the I80%A treatment plots were 39 mm greater
    than irrigations in the I80%M plots from July 5–July 31 (DOY 186–212). A frequent
    number of irrigation signals for the automatic control treatments were received
    during the week of Jul 19 to Jul 27, 2010. A site visit to the field indicated
    that these signals were false positives due to the sensors on the pivot being
    aimed at acute angles from the vertical and looking mainly at soil rather crop
    canopy surfaces. This likely contributed to the IRTs viewing more soil background
    than canopy cover at the onset of the irrigation season. During August, the irrigation
    amounts were nearly equivalent between irrigation methods; and near the end of
    the irrigation season, Sep 8–10 (DOY 251 to DOY 253), three manual irrigations
    were not matched by the automatic control method (Fig. 2) due to cloud cover and
    ambient air temperatures exceeding canopy temperatures. In addition to meeting
    crop water needs, irrigators are also concerned with the possibility of over-irrigating
    and causing surface runoff or deep percolation which can waste water and drive
    nutrients from the root zone. There was no evidence of deep percolation in any
    of the 80% irrigation treatment plots for years 2009 and 2010 as soil water content
    at the lower depths were stable (Fig. 3). Manual irrigations were continued longer
    to reduce lodging, which was observed especially in the 30% treatment plots. Download

    3.3.1. Difference between irrigation control methods Data for each variety of
    sorghum were analyzed separately. Analyses were made across irrigation methods,
    grouped by irrigation treatment amounts to make comparisons between manual and
    automatic irrigation scheduling. In 2009, biomass dry matter was significantly
    greater for the I80M% (F statistic = 10.5, p = 0.01), and I30M% treatment amounts
    (F statistic = 5.46, p = 0.04) (Table 5). There was no significant difference
    across irrigation scheduling methods between dry grain yields at the I80% irrigation
    amount or at the I0% amount. However, dry grain yields were significantly greater
    in the I55M% (F statistic = 5.15, p = 0.05) and I30M% (F statistic = 6.17, p =
    0.03) control treatments. Crop water use (ETc) was significantly greater in I80M%
    (F = 7.34, p = 0.02) and in the I55M% (F = 28.87, p = 0.0003) treatments, and
    grain yields were higher. Water use efficiency in the I30%A (F = 6.12, p = 0.033)
    was significantly less than that for the I30%M treatment due to the low grain
    yield produced in the I30%A treatment. Unger and Wiese (1979) reported an increase
    in sorghum yield of 17.6 kg ha−1 for each mm (1.76 kg m−3) increase in profile
    water content measured to 1.8-m depth at planting. If applied to the differential
    in profile water content on DOY 187, this would give an estimated 268 kg ha−1
    yield increase for manual irrigation at the 30% level (I30%M), and a 27 kg ha−1
    yield increase for manual irrigation at the 55% level (I55%M), which would explain
    in part the smaller yields from the automatic treatments at the 30% and 55% irrigation
    levels (I30%A and I55%A, respectively) in 2009. Table 5. Average plant biomass,

    test for significant differences among means. The overall means are based on data
    grouped by irrigation method. Mean values compared between irrigation method within
    a treatment amount for each variety of sorghum followed by the same lower case
    letter in each row are not significantly different (p < 0.05). Mean values within
    each irrigation method (manual vs. automatic) that are not significantly different
    are followed by the same capital letter in the columns for each section. The ‘Combined’

    applicable. In 2010, there was no significant difference between the two irrigation-scheduling
    methods when comparing overall mean biomass and dry grain yield, WUE, and IWUE
    responses for the automatic and manual treatment plots (Table 5). Moreover, biomass
    and dry grain yield, ETc, WUE and IWUE were not significantly different between
    irrigation methods within the same treatment amount. Given these results and the
    non-uniform initial conditions in 2009, we conclude that there was no important
    difference between the Manual and Automatic scheduling methods. 3.3.2. Differences
    across irrigation amount treatments To investigate biomass, dry grain yield, WUE,
    and IWUE across different irrigation amount treatments, analyses were performed
    on data from all treatment plots for a given year (Table 5). In 2009, biomass,
    dry grain yields, and ETc were significantly affected by irrigation levels. The
    greatest WUE was in the 55% treatment although not significantly different from
    the I80% treatment plots. These results are similar to those reported by Colaizzi
    et al. (2004) in that grain sorghum irrigated at levels of 100% and 75% of ET
    produced yields that were not significantly different. The greatest IWUE occurred
    in the I55% treatment plots, yet they were not significantly different than the
    I30% treatment plots. In 2010, biomass and dry grain yields were significantly
    greater in the highest irrigated treatment plots (80% and 55%) as compared with
    the deficit treatments of 30% and 0%. Crop water use and WUE were significantly
    greater between irrigated (I80%, I55%, and I30%) and non-irrigated plots (I0%),
    but there were no significant differences among the irrigated treatment plots.
    The largest average yield increase for both sorghum varieties occurred between
    the 30% and 55% amount treatments, where the average yield increase was 2.4 Mg
    ha−1 in 2009. These results are similar to findings reported by Schneider and
    Howell (1999) for grain sorghum irrigated between 25% and 50% of crop ET at Bushland,
    TX. Sorghum was less responsive in 2010 to different irrigation levels as compared
    to the previous year, i.e. crop water use and WUE was not significantly different
    between the three irrigation treatment levels (80%, 55%, and 30%). The average
    increase in yield between the 30% and 55% treatment amounts was reduced by 45%.
    Soil water levels were similar for these treatments through DOY 216 for both irrigation
    methods (Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Average soil water
    depletion at the root zone for the irrigation levels in the 30%, 55%, and 80%
    treatment levels for both the automatic and manual control methods in years (top)
    2009; and 2010 (bottom). 3.4. CWSI-TT and soil water depletion In 2009, regression
    analysis of the CWSI-TT and Df revealed a significant relationship: CWSI-TT =
    740.36Df + 118.06, r2 = 0.34, F = 14.71, and p < 0.0001. The CWSI-TT index declined
    after irrigations, as expected, and was nearly zero on cloudy days and days with
    precipitation (Fig. 5a). In the 2009 growing season, Df was lowest on August 1
    (DOY 213) after 32 mm of rainfall and increased to its greatest amount on August
    8 (DOY 220), during the later vegetative stage. Soil waster depletion also rose
    after the onset of the reproductive stage (August 18, DOY 230) and during the
    non-irrigation period between September 12 and 21 (DOY 255 and 264) when no irrigation
    signals were triggered. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The CWSI-TT
    values plotted with the average fraction of depletion in the root zone (to a depth
    of 1.5 m) for the I80%A treatment plots in: for SS variety sorghum in 2009 (top
    diagram); and LS variety sorghum in 2010 (bottom diagram). Early in 2010, DOY
    196–198, during the vegetative phase, mean fractional soil water depletion was
    low (0.15), while the CWSI-TT index was at high levels, i.e. 550–800 min (Fig.
    5b). As mentioned previously, this was likely due to the IRTs viewing soil background
    in addition to vegetative cover in the early portion of the irrigation season.
    Fractional soil water depletion increased at the reproductive stage (near flowering)
    from DOY 209 to 216 and then again prior to the soft dough stage. Variation of
    the CWSI-TT followed this pattern and was recorded as increasing from DOY 213
    to 216. Between DOY 233 and DOY 238, as soil water depletion increased the CWSI-TT
    trended upwards but was also impacted by irrigations and rainfall. Late in the
    irrigation season from DOY 242 to 246, soil water depletion decreased, but the
    CWSI-TT remained high. This may be due to IRTs viewing heads of drying grain (with
    no transpiration) more so than transpiring canopy leaves. There was a significant
    relationship between the CWSI-TT and Df in 2010 after DOY 210 and through DOY
    254; CWSI-TT = 783.9 × CWSI-TT + 139.4, r2 = 0.22, F = 6.5, p < 0.02. However,
    the relationship was not as strong as 2009, which may have been due to the smaller
    changes in Df over the 2010 growing season. Disadvantages to using the CWSI-TT
    was that cloud cover could reduce irrigation triggering at any time during the
    growing season, and IRT temperature readings could be influenced by changing crop
    aspect (e.g., leaf orientation and erectness, head formation) throughout the growing
    season. This problem motivates future research into multi-band sensor systems
    that may allow recognition of soil background and plant aspect changes that may
    allow corresponding qualification or correction of thermal IR data. Soil water
    sensors and soil water balance equations (estimated from ETo) could be used to
    augment decisions for irrigation scheduling with the CWSI-TT and may be helpful
    in the case where it takes a pivot more than two days to traverse a field. 4.
    Conclusions A theoretical CWSI index summed over daylight hours was investigated
    for its effectiveness as a trigger for automatic irrigation scheduling of two
    varieties of grain sorghum. Crop biomass and dry grain yield responses from the
    Automatic treatment plots compared well to those from manual scientific irrigation
    scheduling based on soil water content, in the highest irrigation treatment level
    (I80%) in 2009 and in all irrigation treatment levels in 2010. Soil water variability
    early in growing season 2009 affected yield production, and may have affected
    the results at the two lower irrigation amounts (I50% and I30%). Automatic irrigations
    generally occurred every 2–4 days after the crop was past boot stage. The constant
    irrigation applications in the amount of twice peak daily crop water usage on
    a frequent basis with LEPA drag socks was a favorable method for irrigation delivery
    to both early and late maturing grain sorghum. A shortcoming of using the CWIS-TT,
    which is common to all thermal-based indices using radiometric sensors, is that
    false positive irrigation triggers may be generated early in the season, which
    could lead to over irrigation. Although soil water variability confounded some
    results in 2009, yields from the automatic 80% treatment plots (plots from which
    the CWSI-TT were calculated over daylight hours) were similar to scientific irrigation
    scheduling using a neutron probe in the manual 80% treatment plots for both years
    and for all treatment levels in 2010. This supports the use of the CWSI-TT as
    an effective method for irrigation scheduling of grain sorghum. While farmers
    are not likely to use a neutron probe to take soil water measurements, they may
    invest in moving sprinkler systems that are outfitted with sensor networks for
    automated control and continuous plant water status feedback as a means to manage
    irrigation scheduling. Using the automated system would alleviate the additional
    time and expense required to drive to each pivot field and take soil water measurements
    on a weekly basis. Further research is necessary to investigate whether the CWSI-TT
    is effective for irrigation scheduling of other crops in this region and to determine
    which decision support methods would best augment plant feedback irrigation scheduling.

    An adaptive scheduling algorithm relying on a theoretical crop water stress index
    (CWSI) was developed to automatically irrigate apple trees. Unlike the traditional
    CWSI algorithm where the threshold is a constant value, in the present approach
    the threshold is dynamically determined by following the CWSI trend. A previous
    work on the energy budget analysis of a single apple leaf provided the base for
    calculating lower and upper boundaries of CWSI. To test the feasibility of the
    algorithm, it was applied to the thermal and meteorological data collected during
    the 2007 and 2008 growing seasons. A computer-based wireless control system was
    also developed to automatically schedule irrigations in three plots of apple trees
    in the 2013 growing season. In a small scale field experiment, two treatments
    were compared: (1) automatic irrigation using the new algorithm (CWSI-DT) and
    (2) irrigation scheduling based on weekly readings of neutron probe (NP). The
    soil water deficit under the CWSI-DT treatment was maintained within the well-watered
    range with no signs of over or under irrigation. This was better than the results
    in the NP treatment where there were occasions of under irrigation. Midday canopy
    and air temperature difference exhibited a close agreement with midday stem water
    potential ( ; R2 = 0.63, ). Normalizing in the form of CWSI resulted in a much
    higher correlation between midday CWSI and midday (R2 = 0.91, ) suggesting CWSI
    as a reliable indicator of apple trees water status. The automatic control system
    running the new CWSI-DT algorithm was able to avoid over-irrigation under humid
    and cool weather conditions, and adapted itself to the changing conditions of
    the apple trees. The results of this study were promising in terms of using ground-based
    thermal sensing for automatic irrigation scheduling of sparse, discontinuous apple
    trees. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Wireless control

    stress indexDynamic threshold 1. Introduction To increase profit and water savings,
    and agricultural sustainability, and to reduce environmental impacts, implementation
    of appropriate irrigation scheduling methods is necessary (Smith et al., 1996).
    The use of infrared thermometry and most recently thermal imagery, along with
    a number of supplemental environmental measurements, have been introduced as an
    alternative approach to soil- or weather-based methods of irrigation scheduling
    (Jackson et al., 1977, Wanjura et al., 1995, Cohen et al., 2005). Various thermal
    methods/indices have been developed such as the crop water stress index (theoretical
    CWSI; Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1988; empirical CWSI: Idso et al.,
    1981) and time–temperature threshold (TTT; Wanjura et al., 1992, Wanjura et al.,
    1995). CWSI is defined by a comparison of the actual canopy and air temperature
    difference with an upper water-stressed base line (WSBL) and a lower non-water-stressed
    baseline (NWSBL) which are calculated using empirical or theoretical approaches.
    Compared to row crops, relatively less work is reported in the literature on the
    irrigation scheduling or water stress detection in tree crops using CWSI. Thermal
    methods in the form of empirical CWSI have been studied in different trees such
    as pistachios (Testi et al., 2008), peaches (Wang and Gartung, 2010, Paltineanu
    et al., 2013), olives (Agam et al., 2013a, Berni et al., 2009, Akkuzu et al.,
    2013), and citrus trees (Gonzalez-Dugoa et al., 2014). Osroosh et al. (2015) developed
    theoretical NWSBLs for apple trees based on the energy balance of a single leaf.
    CWSI is traditionally calculated at or averaged over a short period of time around
    solar noon. This is the time when the crop is exposed to the maximum level of
    solar radiation and believed to show signs of stress. However, this calculation
    approach makes the index susceptible to many unwanted transitional weather related
    factors such as dust or passing clouds (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012, Agam et al.,
    2013b). Analytical models respond to different meteorological conditions including
    high wind speed and radiation change which are not accounted for in empirical
    models (Jackson et al., 1988, Jones, 1999). The dynamic conditions of the tree
    canopies including fruit load change, a change in optical/thermal properties and
    light interception due to vegetative growth, or short term oscillations of canopy
    temperature (Casadesus et al., 2012, Gonzalez-Dugoa et al., 2014, Osroosh et al.,
    2015) disconnect between soil water content and CWSI response. The conventional
    CWSI-based approach of irrigation scheduling used a static/fixed threshold above
    which an irrigation signal is triggered. This is while the threshold actually
    changes as a function of many factors including weather conditions and crop growth.
    This threshold is not easy to determine and might require field experiments with
    crops under full or deficit irrigation. The CWSI value for a crop under no stress
    is normally assumed to be zero (minimum CWSI), and for a severely stressed crop
    to be close to one (maximum CWSI; Jackson et al., 1981). While these assumptions
    might be true in the instance of homogeneous canopies of major row crops, it is
    not applicable to heterogeneous tree canopies. The interference of thermal radiation
    from the ground with canopy temperature readings, as well as the rough nature
    of the tree canopies can lead to smaller canopy and air temperature differences
    and consequently result in CWSI values greater than zero even in well-watered
    canopies (Fereres et al., 2012). On the other hand, the temperature of apple tree
    canopies increases as low fruit loads are reached because stomatal conductance
    is a function of load and reduces as the load decreases (Lakso, 2003). As a result,
    non-water stressed baselines are dependent on the load and might not reach zero
    in well-watered trees with no or very low load. To date, the efforts have primarily
    concentrated on improving the empirical or theoretical methods of estimating the
    baselines (Clawson et al., 1989, Jones, 1999, Meron et al., 2003, Leinonen and
    Jones, 2004, Möller et al., 2007). This is while the common approach is still
    as basic as simple comparison of the midday CWSI with a predetermined crop and
    site specific threshold. In order to improve the performance of the CWSI algorithm
    as a trigger for automatic irrigation scheduling of grain sorghum, O’Shaughnessy
    et al. (2012) incorporated a time threshold (TT) into a theoretical index (CWSI-TT).
    They used CWSI-TT successfully to automate irrigations of grain sorghum in a semi-arid
    region. However, they still reported an under-irrigation problem caused by cloud
    cover and the impact of changing crop aspect on IRT measurements. The main objective
    of this research was to develop and evaluate an adaptive CWSI-based irrigation
    algorithm with a dynamic threshold (CWSI-DT). The goal was to maintain the trees
    in a well-watered condition and to avoid over irrigation mainly due to erroneous
    irrigation signals on cool and humid days, caused by temporary weather conditions,
    and canopy growth. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The field experiments
    were conducted in a Fuji apple orchard on the Roza Farm of the Washington State
    University Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser, WA,
    at the coordinates of latitude 46.26°N, longitude 119.74°W, and 360 m above sea
    level. The site was located in a semi-arid zone with almost no summer rains and
    an average annual precipitation of 217 mm. The site’s soil was a shallow Warden
    Silt Loam, ∼1-m deep with an impermeable rocky layer limiting soil depth to less
    than 0.6 m in some locations. The average volumetric water content at field capacity,
    , was estimated in the field to be 32.5% (measured as drained soil water content
    after an irrigation event), and the value of the volumetric water content at permanent
    wilting point, , was assumed to be 13.8% (Saxton and Rawls, 2006). The trees were
    spaced 4 m (row spacing) by 2.5 m (tree spacing) apart in the orchard. In 2007
    and 2008, they were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler irrigation system (Hurricane,
    NaanDanJain Irrigation Ltd., Post Naan, Israel) with water emitters of 27 L h−1
    spaced at 2.5 m intervals. During the 2013 growing period, the orchard was irrigated
    with two lines of pressure compensating drip tubing laterals (∼0.6 m apart) of
    in-line 2.0 L h−1 drippers (BlueLine® PC, The Toro Company, El Cajon, CA), spaced
    at 0.914 m intervals along laterals. 2.2. Treatments and experiment design The
    proposed CWSI-DT algorithm as discussed later was initially applied to the data
    collected in field experiments in 2007 and 2008 where young, well-developed apple
    trees were fully-irrigated. A fully-watered status was assured by maintaining
    the soil water deficit within the management allowable depletion for apple trees
    recommended by Allen et al. (1998) ( of total available water). The control algorithm
    was then used to automatically schedule irrigations in three plots in 2013 (CWSI-DT
    irrigation treatment) where the same apple trees that while healthy, for various
    reasons bore little or no fruit. Irrigation scheduling using neutron probe (NP)
    was also conducted in three similar plots (NP irrigation treatment). Soil moisture
    readings were made weekly and the soil was fully replenished to field capacity.
    The irrigation treatments (i.e. CWSI-DT and NP) were evaluated in a randomized
    complete block design (RCBD) with three replications/blocks (total of 6 plots).
    2.3. Control system and automatic measurements Real-time canopy temperature ,
    relative humidity , solar radiation , wind speed and air temperature were required
    field measurements for calculating theoretical CWSI (described later). To collect
    data and implement automatic irrigations, a wireless central control system including
    hardware and graphical user interface (GUI) was developed. The electronic hardware
    consisted of a centrally located 900 MHz spread-spectrum radio as master (RF401,
    Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) and six wireless sensor nodes as slaves.
    The master was connected to a laptop computer and the slaves to dataloggers located
    in the orchard. A sensor node was made up of a CR10(X) datalogger (Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA) and all or some of the following sensors/components: (a) shielded
    air temperature sensors (Model 109, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA), (b)
    infrared thermometers (IRT/c.2: Type J, Exergen, Watertown, Mass.) with a field
    view of 35° and ±0.6 °C accuracy, and (c) latching solenoid valves (Irritrol,
    Riverside, CA) actuated by L298 dual H-bridge motor drive (Robotshop Inc., Mirabel,
    Quebec, Canada), and 900 MHz spread-spectrum radio (RF401, Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA) to transmit data and receive control signal to/from the central
    control. All of the nodes were powered using batteries and 10 W solar panels (SYP105,
    Instapark Co., Santa Fe Springs, CA). The nodes took measurements from the field
    sensors and reported them to the control computer. The GUI was developed in VB.Net
    (V.2010, Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA). The GUI collected data from the sensor
    nodes, acquired real-time weather data from web, ran the adaptive irrigation algorithm,
    and automatically scheduled irrigation to the plots (three CWSI-DT and three NP
    plots). Weekly NP readings of soil water content were entered into the GUI to
    let the control system schedule irrigations and automatically turn on/off the
    valves. The GUI ran the algorithms everyday at midnight and scheduled irrigation
    events of different plots (if decided) for the following morning at 10:30AM. Meteorological
    data of the 2007, 2008 and 2013 growing seasons were obtained from two electronic
    weather stations in the Washington State Agricultural Weather Network (AgWeatherNet):
    Roza and WSU HQ weather stations located about 0.5 km and 4.5 km away from the
    orchard, respectively. In 2007 and 2008, three pairs of IRTs (IRt/c.03 ™ : Type
    T, Exergen, Watertown, Mass.) with a field view of 17° and an accuracy of ±0.6
    °C wired to a Campbell CR21X datalogger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA)
    were used. Two IRT orientations and positions were employed: (a) in 2007 and 2008,
    the IRTs were pointed at 0° and 45° azimuth and zenith angles, respectively, at
    both the north and south sides of a tree (Osroosh et al., 2014, Osroosh et al.,
    2015) and (b) in 2013, three individual IRTs (IRT/c.2) were installed perpendicularly
    above a tree (∼1 m high) at the center of the plots (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2006,
    Testi et al., 2008). The IRTs were calibrated/checked using a blackbody calibrator
    (BB701, Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, CT) and shielded by PVC white case.
    Canopy temperature and meteorological data were acquired every 15 min. 2.4. Manual
    field measurements Stem water potential was measured at midday (between 13:00
    and 15:00) with a pressure bomb (Model 615, PMS Instrument Co., Albany, OR) once
    per week in the plots under the CWSI-DT treatment from July 31st to October 2nd.
    Each time shaded leaves from the lower inner part of tree, close to the trunk
    were targeted. They were enclosed in plastic envelopes covered with aluminum foil,
    and left attached to the tree for a period of 15–60 min (Fulton et al., 2001).
    A total of six readings (two readings per tree) were averaged to calculate the
    corresponding to each sampling date. The measurements were made under different
    atmospheric conditions including cool, humid and overcast days. Soil water content
    was measured using a neutron probe (503DR Hydroprobe, Campbell Pacific Nuclear,
    Concord, CA) in the center of each irrigation plot where an IRT was mounted. Due
    to presence of the rocky layer in the study site, soil moisture readings were
    limited to depths as shallow as 0.6 m in the experimental plots. Hence, measurements
    taken down to 0.6 m (0.15 m increments) were used for the purpose of irrigation
    scheduling. PVC access tubes were placed between the drip tubing laterals about
    1.25 m from tree trunk. The neutron probe was field-calibrated using soil samples
    (Evett, 2008): (1) where is the volumetric soil water content (m3 m−3), R is the
    neutron probe reading, SC is the standard count, and a and b are the calibration
    coefficients. To check the accuracy of neutron probe readings, lab calibration
    was also carried out with soil in barrels annually. The soil water deficit (mm)
    was calculated as , where D is the managed soil depth, is the measured volumetric
    soil water content. The allowed water deficit (mm) for the managed soil depth
    was calculated as . 2.5. Calculation of CWSI The crop water stress index was calculated
    after Jackson et al., 1981, Idso et al., 1981 as: (2) where is the difference
    between the measured temperatures of canopy and air is the temperature difference
    between canopy and air for a well-watered tree canopy (non-limiting soil water
    availability), and is the temperature difference between canopy and air for a
    non-transpiring canopy. was computed after Osroosh et al. (2015): (3) where (Idso
    et al., 1981), is the saturated vapor pressure (kPa) at the air temperature is
    the actual vapor pressure of air (kPa), is the atmospheric pressure (kPa), is
    the latent heat of vaporization (J mol−1), is the heat capacity of air (29.17
    J mol−1 C−1), is the slope of the relationship between saturation vapor pressure
    ( , kPa) and air temperature ( , °C). is similar to the psychrometric constant
    defined by Campbell and Norman (1998), , and is the air boundary layer conductance
    to heat calculated as Eq. (4) (Campbell and Norman, 1998): (4) where u is the
    wind speed (at 2 m high above the ground) and d is the characteristic dimension
    defined as 0.72 times the leaf width ( : measured in the field). The factor 2
    accounts for the fact that apple leaves are hypostomatous (Green et al., 2003).
    and n are defined by the following equations (Osroosh et al., 2015), respectively:
    (5) and (6) where is the air temperature (K), is the global solar irradiance and
    is the transmitted shortwave radiation through apple leaf . is the atmosphere
    longwave flux density computed using the Stefan–Boltzmann equation. and are green

    waveband, respectively ( and ). was calculated as where is the albedo . The optical/thermal
    properties of apple leaf were adapted from Green et al. (2003). is the vapor conductance
    estimated using the following equation (Osroosh et al., 2015): (7) where b is
    the calibration adjustment coefficient. This equation accounts for the fact apple
    leaves are well-coupled to the atmosphere and therefore respond to change in relative
    humidity (Dragoni et al., 2005). The upper limit, , was calculated by assuming
    closed stomata for a non-transpiring canopy , and replacing with zero in Eq. (3):
    (8) 2.6. CWSI-DT irrigation algorithm To address some of the issues with the conventional
    CWSI approach, an adaptive CWSI algorithm relying on a dynamic threshold (CWSI-DT)
    was developed (Fig. 1). The design was based on three major facts: (a) no irrigation
    is required as long as the index has a decreasing trend, (b) irrigation has to
    stop if no decrease was observed in the index after several successive irrigation
    events exceeding soil water holding capacity, and (c) no irrigation is needed
    if evaporative demand is too low. The CWSI-DT approach and its new terminology
    are described in the following paragraphs. Download : Download high-res image

    , (b) is compared with , (c) maximum air temperature is compared with a temperature
    threshold , and (d) the total amount of water (net) applied successively is compared
    with the water holding capacity of the soil in the MAD fraction. If all of the

    follow a simple yet useful traditional approach of farmers. They do not irrigate
    when it is too cold as the ET rate at this temperate is low enough to be neglected.
    Such temperatures are very probable to be seen early (Day of Year = DOY = 110–143)
    or late (DOY ⩾ 243) in the growing season. On a very humid, overcast, or cool
    day, it is very probable that which results in . This is an uncertain condition
    and no comparison with the threshold or irrigation management decision is made.
    Considering that the control system relies on a feedback from the trees (i.e.
    canopy temperature) and the irrigation system is high frequency, the quantity
    of irrigation water is not important (Jones, 2004). Based on this fact, the system
    applies some amount (discussed later) of water and then waits for the trees to
    respond. This is to account for a possible lag in the physiological response.
    If the amount of the water is adequate, it will be reflected in a decreasing .
    If is still greater than , the system keeps watering (on a daily time step) until
    drops below the threshold or the total amount of water (net) applied successively
    exceeds 80% of MAD. At this point is reset to “1”. If drops below the current
    base, is reset to the lower value. Again, below zero is assumed “0” and a value
    greater than “1” is treated as “1”. The required application settings were determined
    based on the observations in 2007 and 2008. The value of was the temperature that
    farmers in the region traditionally consider too cold to irrigate. The value of
    , in 2013 was set based on the variations of midday CWSI in well-watered apple
    trees in 2007 and 2008. The irrigation depth was calculated as three times the
    average crop evapotranspiration in June and July. This amount of water was expected
    to avoid deep percolation while wetting the root zone at the highest evapotranspiration
    demand. The daily mean crop evapotranspiration was computed using the ASCE standardized
    Penman–Monteith equation (ASCE-EWRI, 2005) in combination with the crop coefficient
    values adjusted for the local climate (Karimi et al., 2013): (9) where is the

    measures used were: (a) the mean absolute error , (b) the root mean square error
    , (c) a linear regression between midday and CWSI in 2013, (d) standard deviation
    and standard error of mean as measures of variance, and (e) ANOVA . The RMSE was
    exploited as a measure of the variance between measured and predicted calculated

    and air temperature difference The theoretical non-water-stressed baseline described
    in Eq. (3) requires one calibration coefficient . b-value is used to estimate
    the vapor conductance, (Eq. (7)). It is a function of fruit load and changes from
    year to year and as the trees grow older (Osroosh et al., 2014). b-value was determined
    by minimizing the MAE between the simulated and measured values of during mid-season
    (DOY = 143–243) of 2007, 2008 and 2013 (Table 1). The b-value in 2007 was also
    used to estimate in other years (second row in 2008 and 2013 in Table 1). Midday
    values of measured and predicted canopy and air temperature differences (1-h mean)
    for two years of field investigations are depicted in Fig. 2a–b. Considering the
    apple trees were well-watered, midday was expected to represent the NWSBL for
    the growing season. The average mid-season values for 2007, 2008, and 2013 were
    estimated to be 0.94  , 0.50  and 0.41  with corresponding b-values of 8.2, 5.0
    and 2.6, respectively. The use of b-value in 2007 to estimate and in other years
    resulted in relatively large discrepancy between and . This is one of the reasons
    why CWSI might not reach a zero value even when the trees are well-watered. The
    adaptive algorithm, however, was expected to resolve this issue by finding the
    actual NWSBL by following the trend of CWSI. Table 1. Comparison of predicted
    potential canopy and air temperature difference ( ) and observed ( ). The value
    of b (first row in each year) was obtained by minimizing the MAE between and during

    within a degree of in the experimental years with average MAEs of 1.0 °C, 0.9
    °C and 0.5 °C in 2007, 2008 and 2013, respectively (Table 1). Moreover, the mean
    prediction errors in 2008 and 2013 were better than that of measurement errors
    (2008: ; 2013: ) while in 2007, RMSE was about half degree (0.5 °C) higher than
    the measurement error . As the predictions agreed relatively well with the measurements
    during mid-season when nearly equals (Osroosh et al., 2015), it was concluded
    that the significant difference between early-season and was most probably caused
    by the error in the measurements of canopy temperature. Due to incomplete canopy
    growth during early-season thermal readings are affected by the soil background
    with temperatures much higher than canopies (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). This
    led to erroneous canopy temperature measurements which was more severe in 2008.

    occasions including early, mid and late in the season in 2007 and 2008 (Fig. 3).
    As it can be seen, reached its potential value early in the morning during early-season
    (beyond days when canopy temperature measurements were associated with considerable
    error) and shifted towards afternoon with potential occurring late in the morning/noon
    on a mid-season day and afternoon/midday on a late-season day. A similar pattern
    was detected in many other days during the experimental years. This pattern has
    also been previously reported in apple trees by Tokei and Dunkel (2005). This
    could be perhaps considered as another source of error once solar noon/midday
    is used for detecting water stress especially early in the season. We, however,
    followed the traditional approach and justified it by the fact that irrigation
    events were scheduled during mid- and late-season of 2013. Download : Download

    3.2. Soil water status The use of double laterals for each tree and Silt Loam
    soil type allowed for a large wetted area of approximately 2–3 m wide (Keller
    and Bliesner, 1990) with the soil surface layer wet as a result of irrigations.
    Depending on soil water content, neutron probe can have a sensing volume of up
    to 4.2 m3 being large enough to meet required precision for research and irrigation
    scheduling purposes (Evett et al., 2009). Taking these into account and the fact
    that access tubes were installed at the center of the wetted area, soil water
    spatial and temporal variability was not an issue. The total amount of irrigation
    water automatically scheduled to the individual plots within the CWSI-DT treatment
    showed some variability. The total irrigation water scheduled for Plot A was about
    32% and 36% more than Plot B and Plot C , respectively. Although the amount of
    applied water to Plot A was larger than the other two plots, soil water content
    was within the well-watered range in the three plots with no signs of over irrigation.
    As depicted in Fig. 4a, the mean soil water depletion under the CWSI-DT treatment
    did not exceed the maximum allowed depletion for apple trees . The variability
    of applied irrigation water in the plots of the NP treatment was 37 mm which was
    slightly less compared to the CWSI-DT treatment . There was no significant difference
    between the means of applied irrigation water in the CWSI-DT and NP treatments
    . The mean soil water content of the plots under the NP treatment was also close
    to the well-watered range with occasions of minor under irrigation (Fig. 4b).
    The means of soil water deficit (during the period of experiment) in the CWSI-DT
    treatment was significantly lower than the NP treatment . This supports use of
    the adaptive irrigation algorithm, which responded to the water status of the
    apple trees as measured by the neutron probe. Download : Download high-res image

    allowed water deficit (AWD) of 56 mm (dotted line) for the measured depth. The
    error bars show the standard error of the mean. 3.3. CWSI and During the growing
    season of 2013, there were occasional days with overcast sky (Fig. 5). Rainfall
    from May through September totaled 48 mm, most of which (43 mm) occurred in July.
    The 2013 season was a relatively warmer year compared to the 2007 and 2008 growing
    periods. In 2013, the trees maintained relatively high solar noon over the period
    of the experiment with fluctuations mainly driven by the weather conditions (Fig.
    6a). There was no detectable difference between measurements of two sample leaves
    on an individual tree. Solar noon values were limited to a range with a minimum
    (mean) of −1.1 MPa and maximum (mean) of −0.35 MPa which was in agreement with
    the reference values reported in well-watered woody plants in general (De Swaef
    et al., 2009) and apple trees specifically (Naor and Cohen, 2003). Midday measured
    in the plots under the CWSI-DT treatment during the period of irrigation (mid
    to late summer) followed the course of change very closely (Fig. 6a–b). Download

    As it can be seen in Fig. 6a–b, both and had a wide range of values under different
    weather conditions. The highest variability in was observed on days with low atmospheric
    demand (i.e. humid, cold and/or overcast) when the signal-to-noise ratio was low
    (Jones, 2004). In this situation, slight error in the measurement of canopy temperature
    led to a high SEM of up to 0.47. Another reason for the variability was the fact
    that, although the plots were within the allowed water depletion they were under
    different levels of soil water stress. More stressed trees show a more pronounced
    change in canopy temperature in response to rapid changes in radiation on cloudy
    days (Agam et al., 2013b). To study the relationship between and , all data from
    the three plots under the CWSI-DT treatment were pooled together. The linear regression

    difference, (b). The error bars show the standard error of the mean. At first
    glance, the relationship between and (Fig. 7a) seems to be inverted as higher/lower
    values correspond with higher/lower CWSI values. Our results, however, were similar
    to the observations of Gonzalez-Dugo et al. Gonzalez-Dugoa et al. (2014) for mandarin
    and orange. This misleading relationship can be explained by the availability
    of water in the soil and atmospheric demand as discussed by Testi et al. (2008)
    for pistachio. Considering the trees were maintained well-watered, atmospheric
    condition played the main role in the variations of (Abrisqueta et al., 2015).
    Thus, intense transpiration on days with high atmospheric demand (warmer, drier
    conditions (DOY < 261)) led to lower values whereas under more humid, cooler conditions
    (DOY ⩾ 261), when the transpiration rate was low, showed to be higher (Fereres
    and Goldhamer, 2003, Doltra et al., 2007). CWSI is also a function of relative
    transpiration (Jackson et al., 1981: where and are the actual and potential transpiration,
    respectively) which means both transpiration and atmospheric demand determine
    CWSI value. As discussed, on a humid and cool day may result in high CWSI value.
    Under high atmospheric demand and well-watered condition, on the other hand, CWSI
    will be closer to 0. This relationship is not valid for trees under deficit irrigation
    (limiting soil water availability). 3.4. Control algorithm response Taking values
    were calculated using meteorological and thermal data for fully-irrigated apple
    trees in the growing seasons of 2007 and 2008. Following the farmers in the region,
    the value of was also set for 20 °C. Both the traditional and new algorithms were
    applied to the generated data series at the end of the season for evaluation purposes.
    As in the conventional definition of CWSI threshold, is a site and crop specific
    value. Here, we took the same approach as in the conventional CWSI threshold to
    determine . No reference values have been established for most crops including
    apple trees; however, values close to zero are expected to maintain crops far
    from being stressed. Higher thresholds are normally used in deficit irrigation
    (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). For the purpose of this study, the control system
    was set for a conservative value of which was similar to the amplitude of midday
    CWSI variations/fluctuations in mid-season in 2007 and 2008 . The net irrigation
    depth was also set to 16.5 mm to ensure irrigation events replenished the soil
    water deficit. Considering the low application rate of the drip irrigation system
    (i.e. 1.1 mm h−1), it took about 15 h to deliver 16.5 mm of water to the trees.
    The response of the control algorithm in the plots of the CWSI-DT treatment (i.e.
    Plots A, B and C) is illustrated in Fig. 8a–c. On some days during the growing
    season of 2013, was reset to “1” by the irrigation control algorithm (dotted circles
    in Fig. 8a). This was in response to high RH and low radiation (DOY = 214, 249)
    which made it difficult to detect water stress, or low (DOY > 265) which reduced
    transpiration to a negligible rate. The days on which the measurements of took
    place included very hot, very cool, overcast and very humid days. Download : Download

    figure (a) indicate days on which the irrigation algorithm decided not to irrigate
    due to low temperature (no water stress) or high relative humidity (not possible
    to detect water stress). The dotted circles in the second figure (b) indicate
    days on which the irrigation algorithm stopped irrigating the plot after three
    successive irrigation events (to avoid excessive watering) and reset the base
    line . Three irrigation events fulfilled , thus after each three irrigations was
    reset to “one”. The dotted circles in the third figure (c) indicate days on which
    the irrigation algorithm detected water stress and scheduled irrigation. CWSI
    dropped to values below the threshold after one or two successive irrigation events.
    On a very hot but very humid day (DOY = 219), both and reached their lowest values
    at solar noon. On this day, high RH and high solar radiation were driving transpiration
    to opposite directions. The value of on this day was less than in all of the plots.
    It is known that readings made under unusually cold or overcast days should not
    be relied on for the purpose of irrigation scheduling (Mitcham and Elkins, 2007,
    Agam et al., 2013b). Similarly, interpretation of values calculated on days with
    low atmospheric demand (i.e. humid, cold, overcast) needs to be carried out with
    caution. Such a situation occurred on DOY = 275 (Fig. 8b). On a very cool, relatively
    humid and overcast day like DOY = 275, both midday and reached their highest values.
    On moderately humid, overcast or cool days, on the other hand, had a value close
    to “1” (for example ) and higher than . This borderline condition was detected
    as stress by the algorithm. In some cases, this condition continued to persist
    for several days. The blind act of the control system on these days led to scheduling
    irrigation events. To avoid excessive watering, however, the control system stopped
    irrigating a plot after three successive irrigation events (dotted circles in
    Fig. 8b). This was carried out by resetting to “1” after each three irrigation
    events which expected to fulfill . Regular days on which the algorithm detected
    water stress and scheduled irrigation are illustrated in Fig. 8c. It can be seen
    that dropped to values below the threshold after one or two successive irrigation
    events. The thermal readings for plot displayed a relatively large discrepancy.
    This was not unexpected considering the use of only one IRT per plot and a relatively
    large non-uniformity observed among the trees in terms of fruit load and shoot
    growth in 2013. This resulted in comparatively dissimilar patterns and consequently
    in the three plots of the CWSI-DT treatment. Interestingly, the variations of
    in 2013 (average of three plots; Fig. 9) were similar to 2007 and 2008, however
    the mean was higher . A higher mean in 2013 was mainly due to less fruit load
    on the trees and consequently a smaller canopy and air temperature difference
    (Osroosh et al., 2015). The fluctuations of , on the other hand, may be mainly
    attributed to thermal and microclimatic measurements and partially to the physiology
    of apple trees as similarly observed in citrus trees (Gonzalez-Dugoa et al., 2014).
    The results showed that the set threshold constant was large enough to capture
    natural fluctuations caused by noise, errors, weather conditions, etc. in non-stressed
    conditions and lower than a value causing water stress. Overall, compared to the
    conventional CWSI method, the CWSI-DT irrigation algorithm yielded consistently
    fewer false irrigation signals on cloudy, humid, or cool/cold days and adapted
    well to the changing conditions of apple trees. Download : Download high-res image

    to the traditional definition of CWSI threshold. The algorithm helped the trees
    reach their potential transpiration by providing them with enough water and observing
    their subsequent response. The adaptive nature of the algorithm, through the use
    of a dynamic non-stressed threshold, allowed for monitoring the water demand of
    the trees in real-time, avoiding wrong stress signals caused by the effect of
    the wind, shoot growth or other unwanted factors. It was minimally impacted by
    CWSI response to temporary atmospheric conditions, IRT installation and measurement
    errors, apple tree architecture and model uncertainties. The new irrigation algorithm
    also yielded significantly fewer false irrigation signals on cloudy, humid, or
    cool/cold days and adapted well to the changing conditions of apple trees. It
    was concluded that the performance of the irrigation control system was satisfactory.
    In the current study, we mainly focused on developing an adaptive algorithm capable
    of detecting erroneous irrigation signals or limiting water delivery under low
    atmospheric demands rather than improving CWSI baseline estimations. While it
    has been developed for and evaluated in apple trees, the proposed adaptive control
    algorithm is independent of crop or irrigation method because of its logical basis.
    Application of the new algorithm can also prevent over-irrigation during early-season
    period when crop canopies are under development, and thus the soil background
    might interfere with canopy temperature measurements. It is concluded that the
    crop water stress index can become more efficient in conjunction with a well-developed
    control algorithm. This is an initial step towards implementing plant-based irrigation
    scheduling in apple trees. It has the potential to improve water use efficiency,
    which leads to increased production, reduced production costs, reduced pumping
    energy requirements, and improved fruit quality. Acknowledgments This research

    Get rights and content Abstract In scientific irrigation scheduling water should
    be applied to a crop at an appropriate soil water tension to fulfil its evapotranspiration
    requirement. Automatic control of water application at predecided soil water tensions
    is an effective irrigation scheduling technique. This can be achieved through
    an indigenously developed auto irrigation system. In this system soil water tension
    is sensed through a modified manometer type tensiometer. The design provides control
    of irrigation at the predecided soil water tensions and preprogrammed timer. The
    circuitry can be operated with a 12 V d.c. storage battery for a long period.

    with on/off strategies based on feedback (Luthra et al., 1997; Miranda et al.,

    @2010 Authors:   S. A. O''Shaughnessy, S. R. Evett Keywords:   Crop canopy temperature,
    Infrared thermometry, Wireless sensors, Sensor networks The objectives of this
    study were to characterize wireless sensor nodes that we developed in terms of
    power consumption and functionality, and compare the performance of mesh and non-mesh
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) comprised mainly of infrared thermometer thermocouples
    located on a center pivot lateral and in the field below. The sensor nodes mounted
    on masts fixed to the lateral arm of a center pivot irrigation system functioned
    to monitor crop canopy temperatures while the system moved; the sensor nodes established
    in the field below the pivot were to provide stationary reference canopy temperatures.
    The WSNs located in cropped fields independent of the irrigation system functioned
    in a highly reliable manner [packet reception percentage (PRP) > 94]. Mesh-networking
    was the single communication protocol that provided functionality for the WSN
    located on the center pivot lateral. Its PRP was 84 and 87 during the 2007 and
    2008 growing seasons, respectively. Future research is required for thorough testing
    and optimizing of WSNs for automatic control and irrigation scheduling of a center
    pivot system. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 34 Share Facebook X Email

    and content Highlights • We developed a decision support system integrated with
    a wireless sensor network. • We developed and field-tested seven irrigation scheduling
    algorithms for drip-irrigated apples. • We used the time-temperature threshold
    (TTT) method in apple trees for the first time. • The thermal-based treatments
    competed well with neutron probe (NP). • Thermal/weather-based irrigation scheduling
    reduced applied water by about 70% compared with conventional irrigation. Abstract
    Seven irrigation scheduling algorithms and an automatic control system along with
    a wireless network of soil, thermal and weather sensors were developed and assessed
    in Prosser, WA in the growing season of 2013. The system was comprised of six
    wireless sensor and valve actuating nodes installed across an apple orchard, a
    central base station made up of a transceiver connected to a laptop, and a graphical
    user interface (GUI). The irrigation algorithms/treatments included the time-temperature
    threshold (TTT), crop water stress index with dynamic threshold (CWSI), soil-based
    using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), weather-based using a temperature-only-based
    evapotranspiration (ET) model and soil water balance (WB), a combination of SOIL
    and WB (SL + WB), a conventional irrigation practice used in the region (CNTRL),
    and soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark. Different treatments were
    compared based on the total irrigation water (It) applied during the season. They
    were also compared based on simplicity and expense for a grower to implement.
    Soil water content (θs) and stem water potential (ψstem) were monitored in a number
    of treatment plots. The total applied water for CNTRL was significantly higher
    than all other treatments (p < 0.001). The thermal-based TTT and CWSI treatments
    applied the same amount of water as NP and WB (p < 0.001). CWSI and TTT substantially
    reduced water applied (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range.
    In addition, θs in the treatment plots of TTT and CWSI did not exceed the maximum
    allowed deficit recommended for apple trees (MAD of 50%) showing a strong agreement
    with NP. The SOIL and SL + WB treatments resulted in tangible under-irrigation
    as leaf drop, decreased leaf turgidity, growth reduction and abnormally small
    fruits were seen. Among all the strategies, WB seemed to bear the characteristics
    of being economical, easy to implement and fairly accurate. Our preliminary results
    also support the use of wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management
    of drip-irrigated apple trees. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    sensingDrip irrigation 1. Introduction A sound choice of irrigation scheduling
    method can lead to increased profit and water savings for farmers, reduced environmental
    impacts and sustainable agriculture (Smith et al., 1996). Proper management of
    irrigation water to maintain balanced soil water content is crucial for health
    and productivity of apple trees (Black et al., 2008). To date, research has offered
    a large number of approaches to detect water stress, compute crop water needs,
    and automatically schedule irrigation (Al-Kaisi et al., 1997, Orta et al., 2003,
    Jones, 2004, Farahani et al., 2007, Vellidis et al., 2008, McCready et al., 2009,
    Ko and Piccinni, 2009, Migliaccio et al., 2010, Romero et al., 2012). Irrigation
    scheduling approaches may be grouped into three main categories (Zhang and Pierce,
    2013): (i) monitoring of soil water status (soil-based), (ii) soil water balance
    calculations using weather information (weather-based), and (iii) sensing of crop
    water stress (plant-based). Automation of irrigation has been evaluated in a number
    of row plants including tomato, onion and bell pepper using soil sensors measuring
    tension (Thompson et al., 2007, Enciso et al., 2009) or volumetric water content
    (Zotarelli et al., 2009). Vellidis et al. (2008) developed and evaluated a real-time,
    smart soil moisture and temperature sensor array prototype for scheduling irrigation
    in cotton. Romero et al. (2012) reported that the approach of combining weather
    data with soil moisture signal could increase irrigation efficiency in almond
    trees. Tensiometers have been used by Meron et al. (2001) as a feedback to manage
    irrigation of apple trees. Soil water tension sensors provide a direct measure
    of plant water status (Pedro Vaza et al., 2013). Watermark™ sensors (Irrometer
    Co., Riverside, CA) have been identified as good indicators of irrigation start
    and stop (Leib and Matthews, 1999); however, sensor accuracy is contingent to
    site-specific calibration (Varble and Chávez, 2011). The calibration need of individual
    sensors can make the use of Watermark™ sensors tedious and unattractive to most
    farmers, thus very often they are used with only factory calibration. Neutron
    probe is a scientific-based method for precise measurement of soil water content
    and has shown to be a reliable reference for other irrigation scheduling techniques
    (Evett et al., 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b). How change in weather parameters
    can affect plant water needs can be predicted using an evapotranspiration (ET)
    model. Frequently used ET models are the Penman-Monteith (PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) equations. The Hargreaves model requires
    fewer data than the PM model and can provide estimations of ET using air temperature
    as sole input (Allen et al., 1998). The most common approach to estimate actual
    water use of apple trees (ETc) is to multiply the reference ET (ETr) by a crop-specific
    coefficient (Kc) (Lakso, 2003). Osroosh et al., 2014, Osroosh et al., 2015a developed
    models based on infrared thermometry and the energy budget of a single apple leaf
    to estimate the actual and potential transpiration of whole tree. However, like
    the PM model, they require a wide range of input data. The weather-based irrigation
    scheduling has a long history of implementation using commercial irrigation controllers
    for both research (Davis et al., 2009, Davis and Dukes, 2010, Cardenas-Lailhacar
    et al., 2008, Cardenas-Lailhacar et al., 2010) and commercial applications; however,
    few research studies have investigated its application on fruit trees. In a study
    by Kisekka et al. (2010), ET-based irrigation scheduling saved significant quantities
    of water compared with a calendar-based grower’s approach of irrigation in a Carambola
    Orchard. Leaf water potential measured using a pressure bomb has long been used
    to monitor crop water status and as trigger point for irrigation (Stegman et al.,
    1976, Turner, 1988). However, this method is very tedious, labor-intensive and
    not appropriate for automation. The use of infrared temperature of plant canopies
    along with a number of ancillary meteorological measurements is an alternative
    plant-based approach (Cohen et al., 2005). Irrigation scheduling systems based
    on a feedback from crop have shown to outperform scientific-based irrigation scheduling
    using the neutron probe in row crops (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015). Various thermal-based
    scheduling algorithms have been developed such as the crop water stress index
    (CWSI: Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1988) and time-temperature threshold
    (TTT: Wanjura et al., 1992, Wanjura et al., 1995, Upchurch et al., 1996). CWSI
    compares the measured canopy-air temperature differences (ΔTm) with theoretically/empirically
    determined temperature differences of a non-transpiring (ΔTu) and well-watered
    (ΔTl) plants as defined by Jackson et al. (1981): (1) Different varieties of the
    CWSI have been suggested over the years including the CWSI and time threshold
    (CWSI-TT: O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), integrated CWSI (iCWSI: O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2013) and CWSI-DT (Osroosh et al., 2015b). CWSI has been rarely used to
    schedule irrigation in trees (Osroosh et al., 2015b) and more often to detect
    water stress (Testi et al., 2008, Wang and Gartung, 2010, Paltineanu et al., 2013,
    Agam et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009, Osroosh et al., 2016). The CWSI might be
    affected by many unwanted factors such as dust or passing clouds (O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2012b); however, it has proven to be reliable if integrated into a robust
    algorithm accounting for these temporary conditions (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The
    TTT method, also patented as “BIOTIC”, requires a “time threshold” and a “temperature
    threshold.” The temperature threshold is the optimal leaf temperature for enzyme
    activity determined in lab. The time threshold is the accumulated time above the
    temperature threshold for non-stressed crop in specific climate calculated using
    experimental/simulated data. O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) carried out automatic
    irrigation experiments on cotton using the TTT algorithm in Texas. Peters and
    Evett (2008) used the TTT method to automate water delivery to the center pivot-irrigated
    plots of soybean. To our knowledge, no reports are available on irrigation scheduling
    of woody fruit trees using the TTT approach. Nowadays, some growers rely on wireless
    sensor networks (WSN) to obtain information remotely on a wide range of parameters
    but rarely to automatically schedule irrigations (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013).
    In research, WSNs have been employed to collect weather, soil and environmental
    information using soil moisture, temperature, or agro-meteorological sensors,
    and to control a variety of irrigation systems (Coates and Delwiche, 2009, Kim
    and Evans, 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015, Ojha et al., 2015). A site-specific
    irrigation control system uses a WSN to monitor field variables and minimize the
    spatial variability of irrigation. In order to make the wireless technology available
    to growers, Coates et al. (2013) developed and integrated a valve actuation system
    with a commercially-available WSN. Both wired and wireless sensors network systems
    have been used in automatic irrigation scheduling (Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012a, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013) with
    the later being more flexible, convenient and economical. Besides reducing labor
    requirements, automatic software scheduling tools are necessary for optimizing
    the amount of irrigation water in response to crop development and type, and environmental
    conditions (Casadesús et al., 2012). The software must be user-friendly and allow
    for simple management of the WSN and irrigation valves by growers (Kim and Evans,
    2009). Various computer software packages have been developed for monitoring soil
    parameters and irrigation scheduling over a wide range of irrigation systems (Stone
    et al., 1985, Hess, 1996, Abreu and Pereira, 2002). Kim and Evans (2009) developed
    decision support software to collect information from a WSN and control a site-specific
    linear-move irrigation system on a malting barley field. The aforementioned approaches
    have been widely used in research; however, farmers are still far from adopting
    them. They are eager to see reliable irrigation scheduling methods which are affordable
    and not necessarily complicated, yet accurate and suit their field and crop conditions.
    Our specific objectives here were to (i) develop fully automatic irrigation supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, and wireless sensor network, (ii)
    develop computer soil-, plant-, and weather-based algorithms for scheduling irrigation
    of drip-irrigated apple trees, (iii) collect information on these various strategies
    in terms of total amount of water applied, root zone soil water status (content/tension),
    plant water status (stem water potential), cost and simplicity. This paper emphasizes
    on the plant-based approaches and presents the results of a preliminary field
    evaluation in a growing season in the arid region of central Washington. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area and irrigation system The study was conducted in a
    Fuji apple orchard on the Roza Farm of the Washington State University Irrigated
    Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser, WA (46.26°N, 119.74°W)
    during the irrigation period of 2013. The region was semi-arid with an average
    annual precipitation of 217 mm and little summer rainfall. The site’s soil was
    Warden Silt Loam, ∼1-m deep limited by a rocky layer to shallower depths in some
    plots. The average volumetric water content at field capacity, θFC, was 0.33 m3
    m−3 measured as drained soil water content after a heavy irrigation event. The
    trees were spaced 4 m (row spacing) by 2.5 m (tree spacing) apart. In 2007, the
    trees were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler irrigation system (Hurricane, NaanDanJain
    Irrigation Ltd., Post Naan, Israel) with water emitters of 27 L h−1 spaced at
    2.5 m intervals. In 2013, the irrigation system was drip tubing with two lines
    of pressure compensating laterals (∼0.6 m apart) of in-line 2.0 L h−1 (equivalent
    to 1.1 mm h−1) drippers (BlueLine® PC, The Toro Company, El Cajon, CA), spaced
    at 91.4 cm intervals along the laterals. In 2013, the irrigation system was configured
    for twenty-one irrigation zones (discussed later) and flow to each zone was controlled
    with a latching solenoid valve (LSV) (Irritrol, Riverside, CA). A conservative
    value of 85% was assumed for the efficiency of the irrigation system. 2.2. Wireless
    control and monitoring system A wireless control and monitoring system was developed
    to take measurements from in-field sensors and control the on/off time of LSVs
    to create zone-specific irrigation rates in the orchard (Fig. 1). The system was
    comprised of two main components: (1) central base station (master) including
    a laptop computer and graphical user interface (GUI), and (2) six slave wireless
    nodes (sensing and valve actuation stations). The laptop was located in a room
    only 50 m far from the field. A laptop cooling pad and a backup battery were used
    to cope with room’s high temperature during the hot summer and unexpected power
    blackouts, respectively. The base station also consisted of a 900 MHz spread spectrum
    radio (model RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) to communicate with the nodes,
    and a USB mobile broadband stick (model DataJack, Inc., Dallas, TX) to provide
    internet access. Irrigation control was managed by the base station using the
    GUI developed by the authors (discussed later). Download : Download high-res image

    control and monitoring system: a typical wireless node (a), base laptop and graphical
    user interface (GUI) (b), and weather station (c). The GUI was accessed by the
    office computer using the Teamviewer software (d). A sensing and valve actuating
    node included all or some of the following sensors and components: CR10(X) datalogger,
    solar panel, battery, Watermark™ sensors, infrared thermometers (IRTs), shielded
    air temperature probe (Air Temp), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (RF), H-bridge
    and latching solenoid valve (LSV). The base control was made up of a laptop computer,
    dongle (USB modem) and RF. A wireless node was made up of a datalogger (model
    CR10(X), Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (model
    RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) with 3 dBi omni-directional rubber-duck
    antenna (L-COM Inc., North Andover, MA) to transmit data to and receive control
    signals from the base, 10 W solar panel (model SYP105, Instapark Co., Santa Fe
    Springs, CA) including voltage regulator, and 12 V, 7 Ah sealed lead acid battery.
    Each node controlled up to four LSVs operated by two L298 dual H-bridge motor
    drives (Robotshop Inc., Mirabel, Quebec). Nodes were also taking readings from
    a number of in-field sensors including granular matrix sensors (model Watermark
    200SS, Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA), a soil temperature sensor (Model 107, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT), shielded air temperature sensors (model 109, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT), and industrial thermocouple infrared thermometers (model
    IRT/c.2: Type J, Exergen, Watertown, MA) with a field view of 35° and ±0.6 °C
    absolute accuracy. Depending on its location in the orchard, a node was comprised
    of all or only some of the aforementioned sensors. The furthest sensing and valve
    actuating station/node was located about 150 m far from the central base radio.
    The in-field sensors were scanned/sampled by the node dataloggers every 5 s and
    averaged every 15 min. The collected data by the nodes were then retrieved by
    the GUI every 15 min and time stamped. 2.3. Sensor installation and field measurements
    The air temperature probes were installed at a height of 2 m (in-line with trees).
    It is known that the rooting depth of a mature apple tree is about 70–90 cm (Atkinson,
    1980) and soil water content measurements should take place from about 10 (cultivation
    depth) to 60 cm (0.7 times effective depth of rooting) (Black et al., 2008). Taking
    this into consideration, the soil temperature probe and Watermark™ sensors were
    installed horizontally at a depth of 30 cm placed between the drip tubing laterals
    about ∼1.25 m from tree trunk. The Watermark™ sensors were soaked in water for
    two days and then installed in a soil wetted to near saturation. All the sensors
    were installed at the center of plots. The near real-time agro-meteorological
    data (air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall)
    measured at Roza weather station (located about 0.5 km away from the orchard)
    was pulled from the Washington State AgWeatherNet website. This data was used
    to calculate daily ETr and provided the supplementary measurements for the CWSI
    and TTT algorithms (discussed later). Midday Stem water potential (Ψstem) was
    measured with a pressure bomb (model 615, PMS Instrument Co., Albany, OR) once
    per week between 13:00 and 15:00. A total of six Ψstem readings (two readings
    per zone/plot per sampling day) were averaged to calculate mean Ψstem corresponding
    to a treatment. Soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron
    probe (503DR Hydroprobe, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Concord, CA) on a weekly basis.
    Soil moisture and Ψstem measurements took place in the plots under the plant-based
    treatments (CWSI and TTT). An irrigation treatment was managed using the neutron
    probe (discussed later). The IRT installation methods, neutron probe calibration,
    and Ψstem measurement procedure were similar to those described by Osroosh et
    al. (2015b). 2.4. Irrigation scheduling algorithms The computer algorithms required
    for implementing seven different irrigation treatments were developed based on
    main plant-, soil- and weather-based irrigation scheduling approaches and included
    feedback and feed-forward control strategies. The irrigation scheduling treatments
    were (1) a soil water budget model using a temperature-only-based ET equation
    (WB), (2) Watermark™ soil water tension sensor (SOIL), (3) a combination of WB
    and SOIL algorithms (SL + WB), (4) the scientific-based method of using neutron
    probe (NP), (5) Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT), (6) Canopy
    temperature signal and the CWSI-DT method (CWSI), and (7) conventional irrigation
    scheduling method in the region (CNTRL). All the strategies were completely automatic
    except for NP in which soil moisture data collected manually. The main required
    inputs to the algorithms were canopy temperature (infrared) to determine crop
    water status, soil water tension to measure soil water availability, and meteorological
    data to estimate daily water needs using ET model and to calculate theoretical
    CWSI. These algorithm are described in the following paragraphs. 2.4.1. Soil water
    budget model and a temperature-only-based ET equation (WB) The algorithm was established
    on a simple soil water balance (Dukes et al., 2009) and daily estimations of reference
    ET (ETr) using the Hargreaves model (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). Reference ET
    was adjusted by local crop coefficients (Kc; Karimi et al., 2013) interpolated
    for daily values. Daily (net) irrigation water depth (Id, mm) was calculated as
    the following: (2) where Re is effective rainfall, and ETc is the crop ET (ETc
    = KcETr), all in units of mm. ETc was determined at midnight using 24-h air temperature
    data obtained from sensors installed in the orchard. For simplification, the effective
    rainfall was assumed to be equal to the amount of rainfall from the nearby weather
    station. The difference between soil water content at the beginning of the season
    (θi) and soil water content at field capacity (θFC) was added to the irrigation
    depth in the first irrigation event. ET was calculated using the FAO-56 Hargreaves
    equation (Allen et al., 1998). Twenty years worth of historical weather data and
    the ASCE Standardized PM equation (Allen et al., 2005) were used to calibrate
    the Hargreaves model for the region. Given that the drip system had a very low
    discharge rate, a threshold (Ith) was set for irrigation depth. This guaranteed
    the amount of water applied was enough to wet the whole root zone and yet avoid
    deep percolation. The irrigation water depth per application day was calculated
    according to the following model: (3) The accumulated depth over several consecutive
    days had to exceed the threshold in order for the system to schedule an irrigation
    event. 2.4.2. Soil-based irrigation using Watermark™ sensor (SOIL) This irrigation
    scheduling algorithm (Fig. 2a) was developed based on soil water potential readings
    from a Watermark™ sensor (one sensor per plot), and dry (50% depletion) and wet
    (field capacity) thresholds of −80 and −30 kPa, respectively, recommended for
    the soil type (Black et al., 2008). The field soil was assumed to be homogenous.
    Previous studies in a drip-irrigated soil have shown that the overall water status
    can be reliably extracted from single spot measurements (Rolston et al., 1991).
    An irrigation event was automatically scheduled whenever soil water potential
    exceeded the dry threshold and stopped if it reached the wet threshold. Therefore,
    the amount of applied water was dependent on the time when the wet threshold was
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (357KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Soil-based irrigation scheduling algorithm (SOIL) (a), and combined
    Watermark™ and water budget irrigation scheduling algorithm (SL + WB) (b). Varble
    and Chávez (2011) showed that diurnal soil temperature fluctuations could impact
    readings of Watermark™ sensor. A non-linear temperature compensation formula (Thompson
    and Armstrong, 1987) was applied to resistivity readings as the following: (4)
    where Rs is the measured resistance (kΩ), Ts is the soil temperature (°C), and
    PSW is the soil water potential (kPa). We did not field-calibrate the sensors
    for the soil type to comply with the common approach and ease the use of the sensors.
    2.4.3. Combination of WB and SOIL (SL + WB) This algorithm was the combination
    of the WB and SOIL algorithms similar to the algorithm proposed by Casadesús et
    al. (2012). SL + WB combines a compensating mechanism (feedback control) based
    on soil sensor readings and an estimation of water demand by a water balance method
    (feed-forward control) (Fig. 2b). SL + WB used soil water tension data to correct
    the ET model prediction of water consumption. An irrigation event was scheduled
    based on Eq. (2) and stopped whenever a soil tension of −30 kPa (wet threshold)
    was detected. 2.4.4. Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT) The TTT
    algorithm described in Evett et al. (1996) and examined in DeJonge et al. (2015)
    was the basis for the computer algorithm evaluated here. To determine the temperature
    threshold (Ttemp, °C), leaf samples were collected and sent in sealed refrigerated
    envelop to a lab in Lubbock, TX, where enzyme assays performed. The value of time
    threshold (Ttime, min) was obtained from canopy temperature and meteorological
    measurements collected over well-irrigated apple trees in 2007 in the same orchard.
    The accumulated time (t24) during 24 h was calculated as the following: (5) where
    Tm is the canopy temperature (°C) in minute m, and Ttemp is the temperature threshold.
    If t24 > Ttime then an irrigation signal was generated. The values of t24 was
    reset to 0 every day at midnight. The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated
    as twice the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 2 × ETc) in June and July (twice
    the peak crop water use), enough to wet the root zone at the highest ET rate in
    the region while avoiding deep percolation (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). 2.4.5.
    Canopy temperature signal with the crop water stress index (CWSI) The CWSI algorithm
    relied on a theoretical CWSI and a dynamic threshold. The theoretical lower and
    upper boundaries of the CWSI were calculated using biophysical models thoroughly
    detailed by Osroosh et al. (2015b). The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated
    as three times the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 3 × ETc) in June and July.
    This computer algorithm (called CWSI-DT) and its field evaluation results are
    also described in Osroosh et al. (2015b). Here, the results from the original
    experiment were compared with the rest of the approaches. 2.4.6. Scientific-based
    method of measuring soil moisture using neutron probe (NP) The NP treatment was
    assumed to represent the best irrigation scheduling practice by an advanced farmer.
    In this approach, soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron
    probe on a weekly basis. Using the soil moisture readings, soil water deficit
    (SWD) to field capacity was calculated and irrigation was scheduled. The soil
    water depletion under the NP treatment was never allowed to exceed a maximum allowed
    depletion (MAD of 50%) recommended for apple trees (Allen et al., 1998). The net
    irrigation depth was calculated as I = d × [θFC − θS], where d is the rooting
    depth (d = 0.6 m), and θs is the average volumetric soil water content for d.
    Manual neutron probe readings (raw values) were entered into the GUI right after
    field measurements every Wednesday. Irrigation was automatically schdeuled based
    on the entered reading for following day. 2.4.7. Conventional irrigation scheduling
    in the region (CNTRL) In addition to the precision algorithms described, water
    delivery to a number of zones was managed using the conventional irrigation scheduling
    method of apple trees in the region. The CNTRL algorithm (Fig. 3) was designed
    to mimic the growers’ approach of using the calendar (irrigation events on specific
    days of week) and weather conditions (low, high air temperature thresholds). In
    the CNTRL algorithm, any air temperature between the maximum (TMax) and minimum
    (Tmin) thresholds would have resulted in applying Ib = 63 mm of water. If air
    temperature exceeded the maximum threshold (TMax = 32 °C) the amount of irrigation
    water would be doubled (I = 2 × Ib). If air temperature was below the minimum
    threshold (Tmin = 21 °C), the trees would receive half the usual amount of water
    (I = 0.5 × Ib). Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download : Download

    (CNTRL). I is the amount of irrigation water applied, and Ib is the base amount
    of water which was doubled or halved depending on minimum (Tmin) and maximum (TMax)
    air temperature thresholds. 2.5. Graphical user interface A Windows-based GUI
    was developed in Microsoft VB.Net (V.2010, Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA) to manage
    and control the irrigation system and wireless nodes. Embedded routines in CoraScript
    (V.1.1.9.8, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) were used to send command signals
    to the six slave nodes/dataloggers. LoggerNet (V.3.5, Campbell Scientific, Logan,
    UT) automatically downloaded data from the nodes every 15 min and populated a
    database on the laptop. The recorded data was then managed by the GUI. Fig. 4
    shows a task flowchart of systems’ software and firmware components and their
    relationship. Instead of wireless communication between the field and office computers,
    Teamviewer (V.8, TeamViewer Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) was used to remotely
    access the GUI in the field. Download : Download high-res image (588KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Flowchart displaying the routines performed
    by the software (LN and GUI) and firmware (Node) components of the control and
    monitoring system. The node firmware was responsible for scanning the sensors
    and sending the collected data to the base. LoggerNet (LN) regularly retrieved
    data from the nodes and recorded them in a file. The GUI used this data to run
    the irrigation algorithms, and make irrigation control decision. The GUI has a
    tabular design and comprises several tabs including: (1) a “Blocks” tab for displaying
    raw real-time data from the in-field sensors and valves on/off status, (2) a tab
    for showing real-time weather data (“Roza”), and (3) a tab for monitoring the
    commands sent out and program codes in action (“Console”). Fig. 5 shows a screenshot
    of the “Blocks” tab. The rest of the tabs were dedicated to system settings, crop
    and soil properties, sensor calibration parameters, and entering manual field
    measurements into the GUI. The GUI was capable of running in three main functioning
    modes: simulation, automatic irrigation and manual irrigation. The simulation
    and manual modes were used for the purpose of testing the system’s hardware and
    software. The simulation mode was added mainly to test the internal functions
    without having to operate the hardware. The manual mode, on the other hand, allowed
    for testing and tuning the hardware more easily. Download : Download high-res

    tab of the graphical user interface. In this tab, sensor readings taken by the
    in-field sensors and remaining irrigation time are displayed in real-time. The
    values were updated every 15 min. The GUI collected data from the sensor nodes,
    downloaded weather data from the nearby weather station, and provided a real-time
    display of the measurements in individual zones regardless of the node collecting
    them. The remaining irrigation time corresponding to each sensor/plot was displayed
    next to the sensor’s name. The GUI ran the irrigation scheduling algorithms (WB,
    SOIL, SL + WB, TTT, CWSI, NP and CTNRL) every day at midnight, and automatically
    made decisions for scheduling irrigation events for twenty-one individual zones
    within the orchard. It sent control signals to the individual data-loggers which
    opened or closed latching solenoid valves to turn the water on and off to each
    block of trees. The software also allowed for manual control of individual zones.
    The data recorded in the database by LoggerNet were automatically pulled by the
    GUI and used to execute the algorithms in parallel everyday at midnight. This
    led to generating irrigation schedules for 10:30 AM of following day. The exceptions
    were the CNTRL and NP algorithms which were, respectively, run only on Mondays
    and Wednesdays as depicted in the flowchart in Fig. 4. The decision support process
    for the SOIL and SL + WB algorithms was slightly different as a continuous monitoring
    of feedback from the in-field Watermark™ sensors (every 15 min) was required to
    determine the end of irrigation event. LoggerNet was responsible for handling
    wireless communication errors and retries. The GUI monitored dataloggers battery
    voltage levels, handled coding errors and sent alert and digestion emails to the
    user. The system routinely logged irrigation events and reported the start/stop
    time of irrigations via email to the user. Due to possible exposure of in-field
    sensors to malfunction and disturbances, sensor-specific routines automatically
    analyzed the data for any signs of failure or anomalies such as abnormally high
    or low values beyond the expected range for a variable and negative/erroneous
    sensor readings. Noise or temporary abnormal changes in values were handled by
    the software and those of serious nature were reported back to the user via email.
    Besides the software error handling, the status of the wireless network was checked
    by the user regularly. 2.6. Experimental design and statistical analysis The seven
    irrigation treatments were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with
    three replications/blocks, each plot consisting of three rows of 6 trees (21 management
    zones). The trees at the center of the plots were used for measurement purpose.
    The plots were also observed for tree health and difference in the size and quality
    of apple fruits. The statistical analysis methods included the standard error
    of the mean (SE of Mean), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SigmaPlot (V.11.0,
    Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) to test for difference among the treatments
    in terms of applied irrigation water (mm season−1). To conduct multiple comparisons
    of the means, the Bonferroni t-test was employed (at p = 0.05). 3. Results and
    discussion During the 2007 growing season when the time threshold for TTT was
    determined, maximum daily evapotranspiration (ETMax), total applied irrigation
    water (It), total rainfall (May–September), and total irrigation days (dt) were
    calculated to be 9.7 mm d−1, 1077  , 32 mm and 110 d, respectively. The theoretical
    temperature threshold returned by the lab was 10 °C and the corresponding time
    threshold to this value was 1035 min. Considering the low value determined by
    the lab, a range of time threshold (Ttime) and temperature threshold (Ttemp) values
    were plotted against each other. The temperature threshold was then chosen to
    be 22.2 °C, and an irrigation event ( ) was scheduled following a day when canopy
    temperature exceeded Ttemp = 22.2 °C for more than 225 min. The rainfall totaled
    91 mm from May through September of 2013 most of which (77 mm) occurred in May
    and July. The 2013 growing season was relatively warmer compared to the 2007 growing
    period with greater daily mean temperatures, ETr values (Table 1) and ETMax of
    14.0 . Considerable amount of rainfall received during May and June, a number
    of manual irrigation events, and presence of a perched water table in the study
    site led to the availability of enough moisture in the root zone until June (θs
    > θMAD = soil moisture at MAD). As a result, the automatic irrigation system did
    not become operational until the soil water profile reached a defined irrigation
    trigger point. The wireless control system was configured and tested during March,
    April and May, and automatically managed the water delivery to the plots during
    the rest of the season. The number of automatic irrigation days was less than
    100 d for most of the treatments. Table 1. Climatic conditions for the 2007 and

    water The ANOVA test revealed that the difference in the mean values among the
    seven irrigation treatments was significant (p < 0.001). A comparison of the treatments
    in terms of total irrigation water applied can be found in Table 2. The applied
    water for CNTRL was significantly higher than all other treatments with a value
    of 1359 mm. This was over three times (340%) the amount of water applied by NP
    (401 mm). On the other hand, SOIL resulted in the lowest mean applied water (214
    mm) which was 53% of the amount delivered by NP. WB, CWSI and TTT applied 469,
    408 and 436 mm of water, respectively (no significant difference: p = 1), which
    accounted for slightly more than 100% of water applied by NP and resulted in about
    70% water saving over the irrigation period. The WB algorithm applied significantly
    greater amount of water than SOIL (p < 0.001) and SL + WB (p = 0.004; 273 mm).
    There was no significant difference between CWSI and SL + WB (p = 0.072). SOIL
    applied significantly less amount of water than the rest of the treatments, while
    there was no significant difference between NP and SL + WB (p = 0.1). Table 2.

    Watermark™ sensor readings showed no sign of water stress in the plots of SOIL
    and SL + WB as the soil water potential fluctuations were within the range of
    0 to −80 kPa (Fig. 6a). However, field inspections disclosed that the trees under
    the SL + WB algorithm may have been severely water-stressed as leaf drop and loss
    of turgidity, trees reduced overall growth, and abnormally small fruits in these
    plots were evident. Having under-irrigated the trees, SOIL and SL + WB exhibited
    an insufficient response to water stress. The under-irrigation of the plots under
    SOIL can be explained by the fact that the soil sensors monitored only a limited
    volume of the soil profile and might have not been at a location where the root
    system was active (Cohen et al., 2005). The Watermark™ sensors were not calibrated
    and single predefined wet and dry thresholds were applied to all of them. In addition,
    it was difficult to make a representative tension measurement due to the heterogeneity
    of soil water distribution under the drip irrigation system. Download : Download

    of in-field Watermark™ sensors data collected using the wireless sensor network:
    mean of three plots under the SL + WB (a), and SOIL (b) treatments. The dotted
    lines show the standard error of the mean. The dashed lines show the wet (Wet
    Thresh) and dry (Dry Thresh) thresholds. Using a feed-forward ET-based scheduling
    method in combination with a soil feedback (SL + WB) did not improve irrigation
    scheduling as signals to stop irrigation were perhaps issued too soon. The general
    algorithm of Casadesús et al. (2012) suggests that the use of the water balance
    model allows for a quick response to weather changes by predicting its effects,
    while at the same time the feedback mechanism can adapt the amount of water to
    the requirements of individual orchards by compensating for prediction errors.
    However, the accuracy of feedback is very important. Currently, available soil
    water content sensors including Watermark™ sensors cannot provide the required
    precision as achievable with the neutron probe. The soil water content of the
    plots under the CWSI and TTT treatments was measured weekly as for the NP plots.
    As depicted in Fig. 7a, mean soil water deficit (SWD) in the treatment plots of
    CWSI, TTT and NP in the top 0.6 m was within the well-watered range (<MAD of 50%).
    Mean SWD in the TTT plots was significantly lower than NP (p < 0.001) which was
    in agreement with applying slightly more irrigation water under TTT (not significant).
    Seasonal courses of midday ψstem for the trees under CWSI and TTT are depicted
    in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the trees under TTT maintained a relatively similar
    values of Ψstem to the trees under CWSI over the period. The measured values of
    Ψstem agreed well with non-stressed values reported for woody plants including
    apple trees (De Swaef et al., 2009, Naor and Cohen, 2003). As discussed in Osroosh
    et al. (2015b), the CWSI algorithm demonstrated a good response to the water status
    of the apple trees. The results here support the use of the TTT thermal-based
    approach to maintain well-watered apple trees under drip irrigation system in
    the semi-arid climate of central Washington. Download : Download high-res image

    Seasonal courses of midday ψstem in the CWSI and TTT treatments (b). The error
    bars show the standard error of the mean. The cumulative applied water for individual
    plots under TTT, WB and CWSI is illustrated in Fig. 8a and b for the growing period
    of 2013. Plots within the TTT and WB treatments had similar amounts of irrigation
    water delivered to them during the season, whereas the plots under CWSI showed
    some degree of variability. WB did not receive any feedback from the trees, thus
    microclimatic variability within the orchard was the only source of discrepancy
    among the plots and consequently the irrigation depths. The WB algorithm can lead
    to over- or under-irrigation if the estimates of crop water use are incorrect,
    the soil water content at the beginning of the season is unknown, or the application
    efficiency of irrigation system is lower than expected (Fereres et al., 2012).
    Apple trees have shown to close their stomata in response to a reduction in fruit
    loads (Palmer et al., 1997, Lakso, 2003, Girona et al., 2011). This reduction
    in evapotranspiration can challenge the WB approach as a lack of plant feedback
    may lead to significant errors in the estimations of water needs. The CWSI algorithm
    required meteorological data in addition to canopy temperature as input meaning
    it had to respond to atmospheric demand and signs of plant stress. This is while
    TTT only responded to increased canopy temperature which could be a result of
    increased air relative humidity not stomatal closure driven by water stress (Wanjura
    and Upchurch, 1997, Jones, 2004). This is reflected in TTT having a wetter soil
    profile as depicted in Fig. 7a. The CWSI algorithm, on the other hand, had a mechanism
    for withholding irrigation on humid days. It is known that CWSI values measured
    on cool and humid days are not reliable generating false stress signals and consequently
    resulting in over irrigation (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The CWSI algorithm interprets
    CWSI value in relation to the air relative humidity level and no irrigation decision
    is made on a humid day. Download : Download high-res image (274KB) Download :

    fruit yield Due to the fact that the trees were in an alternate bearing year,
    no quantitative information on the fruit yield was collected. However, our observations
    revealed that apple size in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments was noticeably smaller
    than CNTRL and never ripened (same number of fruits on trees). Larger shoot growth
    in the CNTRL treatment was observed compared with a much lower shoot and foliage
    growth in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments leading to shorter trees. The distance
    between rows in the CNTRL was covered with grass or algae and was always wet.
    This was not the case in other treatments. 3.3. Labor requirement and cost In
    the discussed control and monitoring system, the algorithms were executed using
    commercially available hardware and off-the shelf components. The major hardware
    cost included Campbell Scientific dataloggers and IRT sensors. We used an old
    model notebook as the central processing hardware which was worth roughly $100
    (U.S. dollars). The base cost of a sensing and actuating unit with the current
    hardware (datalogger, radio, battery, solar panel, actuator, 4 latching solenoids)
    is approximately $2500 in 2016. Considering the available commercial options,
    an IRT sensor adds an additional amount of $450–655 per measurement point. A soil/air
    temperature probe (without the shield) and a Watermark™ sensor can be purchased
    for $100 and $35–120, respectively. In the calculation of the cost, we replaced
    the CR10(X) with the CR1000 (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and the RF401 with
    the RF401A (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) as they are no longer manufactured
    by the company. We obtained real-time meteorological data from a nearby weather
    station which was part of the WSU AgWeatherNet. The cost of such a station in
    case a farmer decides to invest in one is $9500 (sensors, hardware, installation,
    first year maintenance) (AgWeatherNet, 2013). Major costs for the control and
    monitoring system and alternative options for some components are summarized in
    Table 3 for comparison. A summary of the irrigation scheduling algorithms evaluated
    in the present study including the in-field sensor requirements, total upfront
    cost, advantages and shortcomings of the system are also summarized in Table 4.

    weather station is available. b This technique is manual in nature; however, we
    developed and implemented an automatic algorithm based on the original conventional
    irrigation practice. Although the GUI was designed to manage a specific orchard,
    it has the potential to be retrofitted to other irrigation systems or fields.
    Especially for research purposes, the laptop/PC and dataloggers can be replaced
    with Linux-based single-board computers such as the BeagleBone Black (BeagleBoard.org
    Foundation, Oakland Twp, MI), and the spread-spectrum radio with the XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, MN) to significantly reduce the cost. A network
    of inexpensive air temperature sensors can provide enough microclimatic data for
    estimation of ET. The WB algorithm requires only an air temperature sensor with
    no need for calibration which keeps the labor and capital investments very low.
    CWSI needs a network of infrared thermometers and meteorological sensors with
    no need for site-specific calibration. From both research and practice perspectives,
    the upfront cost and labor requirements of both CWSI and TTT are relatively low;
    however, regular maintenance (mainly cleaning) of IRTs is necessary to keep the
    network up and running. Despite the low sensor cost and ease of implementation,
    SOIL and SL + WB did not show to be reliable in terms of delivering enough water
    to stressed trees or detecting stress on-time. To achieve higher accuracies, using
    a larger number of Watermark™ sensors to account for sources of variability, site-specific
    calibration of individual sensors, or a combined use of soil water potential and
    soil water content sensors appears to be necessary. The maintenance was a major
    issue with the soil sensors wiring. There were several cases of wire damage accidents
    due to animal rodent activity in the field. Wireless IRTs (O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2013) and less commonly wireless soil sensors are alternatives to wired sensors
    which will also lead to reduced installation and maintenance cost. These results
    support the suitability of simple irrigation scheduling techniques like WB for
    the automatic irrigation of apple orchard. Approaches like CWSI, TTT and WB are
    slightly more expensive, however they provide a higher degree of reliability compared
    to SOIL or SL + WB strategies. 4. Conclusions In this study, we developed and
    initially evaluated seven irrigation scheduling algorithms including two well-known
    plant/thermal-based strategies of the Time and Temperature Threshold (TTT) and
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). Irrigation water delivery was automatically scheduled
    to twenty-one management zones in an apple orchard using a wireless control and
    monitoring system. Precision irrigation algorithms were compared with the scientific-based
    method of irrigation scheduling using neutron probe and the conventional approach
    in the region in terms of ability to improve the current practice and simplicity
    of implementation from grower’s perspective. Our preliminary results supported
    the use of weather- and plant-based algorithms, decision support and monitoring
    software, and wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated
    apple trees. The weather- and plant-based algorithms evaluated here were able
    to deliver enough irrigation water to the apple trees and avoid water stress.
    The soil-based approaches, on the other hand, failed to deliver enough water to
    the trees which resulted in severe water stress and impaired growth. The weather-
    and plant-based methods exhibited a promising performance at the level of the
    scientific irrigation scheduling method in terms of applying precise amount of
    water when needed and had the great advantage of being fully automatic. While
    the weather-based control algorithm showed a similar performance to the plant-based
    methods under the conditions of the experimental site, we believe a control algorithm
    with plant feedback is a superior choice when it comes to site- and crop-specific
    precision. However, the weather-based approach is a better choice when lower cost
    and complexity are more important to growers. This was an initial step towards
    implementing automatic irrigation on drip-irrigated apple trees. The presented
    irrigation scheduling approaches have the potential to improve water use efficiency,
    increased production, reduced production costs, reduced pumping energy requirements,
    and improved quality. Here, we mainly examined the various hardware and software
    aspects of a SCADA system and the suitability of the irrigation scheduling algorithms
    for maintaining well-watered trees. Future studies will reveal more on their benefits
    for decreasing losses of water and nutrients to deep percolation and their effect
    on yield and fruit quality. Acknowledgments This research was funded by the US

    Recently, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems have become
    widely used in agricultural applications, particularly in conjunction with irrigation
    management systems that require calculated applications of water. The objective
    of this study is to present a new SCADA platform for the regulated deficit irrigation
    management of almond trees. This new platform implements a wireless architecture
    that ensures error-free communication among the irrigation system components with
    no need to maintain cables. The implemented SCADA application performs the following
    irrigation-related tasks: (1) based on the edaphoclimatic data from the parcel
    to be treated, an estimation of the crop water requirements, including the values
    required for drip irrigation scheduling, is computed; and (2) using the calculations
    from the previous step, the different components of the irrigation system, such
    as the electrovalves, pump system, variable frequency drive, and pressure alarms
    are placed under either automatic control or the control of manual activating
    actuators. The proposed platform was installed in a parcel of almond trees located
    at Fuente Alamo de Murcia, Spain, with half of the parcel configured with regulated
    deficit irrigation and the other half configured with conventional irrigation.
    The results demonstrate the benefits of using this new platform, as well as a
    method for reducing water consumption through the use of regulated deficit irrigation.
    Introduction In the arid and semiarid regions of southeastern Spain, the low availability
    of water for irrigation makes the development of new water-conserving irrigation
    techniques necessary (Pereira et al. 2002; Prasad et al. 2006; Smout and Gorantiwar
    2006; Martinez et al. 2011; Corcoles et al. 2012). In Mediterranean regions, a
    portion of almond orchards are located in dry areas because these trees can withstand
    water stress (Romero et al. 2004, 2006; Girona et al. 2005; Goldhamer et al. 2006;
    Nortes et al. 2009), salinity (Franco et al. 2000), and other adverse conditions.
    The adoption of new irrigation techniques in these areas (Stambouli et al. 2012),
    such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), allows for the reduction of water
    consumption for similar production volumes (Capra et al. 2008; Kirnak et al. 2009;
    Marsal et al. 2008; Samani et al. 2005). Regulated deficit irrigation strategies
    are based on the reduction of irrigation during certain periods of the annual
    plant cycle (Ruiz-Sanchez et al. 2010). These selected periods occur when ongoing
    growth processes are less sensitive to water stress and when effects derived from
    water stress are advantageous for yield, such as for reducing vigor in high-density
    orchards (Jensen et al. 2010). Because intensification is not an issue in almond
    orchards, a successful design for deficit irrigation scheduling may reduce water
    consumption without affecting the yield (Egea et al. 2009; Stewart et al. 2011).
    During the last three decades, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
    systems have been used as a valid solution for resolving specific issues in different
    technical and scientific fields, such as chemical or physical process monitoring,
    transportation monitoring for water supply systems, production management, quality
    control, and maintenance and control of industrial processes. Moreover, these
    systems have also been used in the agriculture sector to monitor weather conditions,
    fertirrigation, and irrigation in greenhouses (van Meurs et al. 1996). Supervisory
    control and data acquisition systems have also been used with success for monitoring
    and controlling the flow of irrigation canals (Rijo and Arranja 2010), controlling
    pumping systems (Dobriceanu et al. 2008), drainage and water quality control (Yin
    and Yong 2009), and global irrigation (Gensler et al. 2009). However, SCADA systems
    have not been used for regulated deficit irrigation scheduling in almond trees.
    In the agricultural sector, supervisory control and data acquisition systems usually
    monitor sensors that are far from the base station; therefore, a direct cable
    connection is not feasible. To address this issue, wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    are used instead (Hedley and Yule 2009; Wang et al. 2006). Of the diverse types
    of wireless technologies currently available, the wireless local area network
    (WLAN), Bluetooth, ZigBee, and global system for mobile communications/global
    packet radio service (GSM/GPRS) are the most popular in the agriculture and food
    industry sectors. Concretely, ZigBee is an open and global standard for WSN with
    a low rate, low cost, low power consumption, and self-forming wireless communication,
    which makes it ideal for the development of applications focused on sensor and
    automatic control. Several applications using ZigBee technology can be found in
    the literature, such as soil moisture monitoring (Morais et al. 2008; Sulaiman
    et al. 2009), microclimate real-time monitoring (Watthanawisuth et al. 2009),
    temperature monitoring in all phases of wine production (Boquete et al. 2010),
    and soil water monitoring for decision making in a sprinkler irrigation system
    (Kim et al. 2009). The objective of this paper is to present a new SCADA platform
    for regulated deficit irrigation management with ZigBee architecture for wireless
    communication among components. The developed platform was installed in a parcel
    of almond trees in Fuente Álamo de Murcia, Spain. Half of the parcel was configured
    with regulated deficit irrigation and the other half was configured with conventional
    irrigation. This setup was used to demonstrate that water consumption was improved
    using regulated deficit irrigation and that this type of system is useful for
    irrigation management tasks. This system may also be extended to all types of
    cultivation. Description of the Platform The SCADA platform has been used in a
    parcel of almond trees (Amygdalus communis L. cv. Antonietta) located in southeastern
    Spain, in the municipality of Fuente Álamo, in Murcia (latitude 37°47′33″N, longitude
    1°14′27″W, and altitude 125 m). The parcel, which is divided into one sector with
    277 almond trees and another sector with 280 almond trees, is over a surface area
    of 2.3 ha that is divided into 6 × 7 - m crop grids. The parcel has drip irrigation
    laterals of 16 mm and four emitters of 8 L · ha − 1 per tree. The irrigation system
    contains two primary parts, which are approximately 1 km apart: (1) a pump and
    control station; and (2) an irrigation head (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Architecture of
    the irrigation system The pump and control station contains the following components:
    (1) a pump system with a variable speed drive, which is responsible for the water
    supply to the irrigation head and is controlled by the SCADA application; (2)
    a data acquisition card that translates the signals between the components of
    the irrigation system and the computer; (3) a computer running the SCADA application;
    and (4) an XBee-PRO module with a high-gain antenna for wireless communication
    with the irrigation head, for distances up to 1.6 km. For the irrigation head,
    the following elements are present: (1) three electrovalve actuators controlled
    by the SCADA application from the control station, with two electrovalves irrigating
    both sectors and one electrovalve for the fertirrigation system; (2) a pressure
    alarm control, which warns the pump and control station when overpressure or underpressure
    occurs; (3) photovoltaic panels with a battery to provide power to the irrigation
    head; and (4) an additional XBee-PRO module with a high-gain antenna for wireless
    communication with the pump and control station. Because of the distance between
    the control station and the irrigation head, the use of a direct cable connection
    was initially dismissed. A wireless communication architecture using the ZigBee
    standard was chosen instead because it has been proved with success in the agricultural
    sector (Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2009). For the existing platform, two XBee-PRO 802.15.4
    modules from Digi International Inc. (Minnetonka, Minnesota) were selected to
    create a virtual cable using the “I/O Line Passing” feature of these devices.
    This configuration permits the setup of virtual wires between the XBee-PRO modules,
    establishing a pin-to-pin virtual connection (Caprile 2009; Ponraj and Daniel
    2012). Because these modules work with 3.3 V, the following two signal conditioning
    circuits were also developed: (1) one circuit for adapting the signals between
    the data acquisition card and the XBee-PRO module in the control station [Fig.
    2(a)]; and (2) another circuit for activating the electrovalve relays based on
    the signals provided by the XBee-PRO module in the irrigation head, as well as
    supplying this XBee-PRO module with the alarm monitoring signals [Fig. 2(b)].
    Fig. 2. Signal conditioning circuits: (a) pump and control station; (b) irrigation
    head The next section introduces the software application, which is the core of
    the SCADA platform. Software Application For implementation of the SCADA application,
    the LabVIEW graphical programming language from National Instruments has been
    used because it offers a powerful, natural, and intuitive engineering environment
    for designers developing hardware-software systems for measurement, test, and
    control tasks (Larsen 2010). The proposed SCADA application has been developed
    to perform the following irrigation-related tasks: (1) estimate the crop water
    requirements and the values for drip irrigation scheduling based on the edaphoclimatic
    data from the parcel to be treated; and (2) using the values obtained from the
    previous stage, perform the automatic control of the different components of the
    irrigation system, including the electrovalves, pump system, variable speed drive,
    and pressure alarms. To differentiate between the two tasks, the application contains
    the following two well-differentiated interfaces (Fig. 3): (1) a configuration
    interface where all the necessary values are introduced and the calculations are
    performed; and (2) a control interface where the user can control the irrigation
    process and the different elements of the system are monitored. Fig. 3. Configuration
    interface Configuration Interface When the SCADA application is first executed,
    the configuration of several parameters is required, although it is possible to
    change them at a later time. For this procedure, the application has a configuration
    tab (Fig. 3) where several edaphoclimatic parameters can be introduced. Based
    on this, the application calculates the variables that will be used to estimate
    the values necessary for drip irrigation scheduling, according to the mathematical
    model described in Fig. 4. Hereafter, a more detailed description of the calculation
    is provided. Fig. 4. Mathematical model for regulated deficit irrigation scheduling
    Calculation of Crop Evapotranspiration under Drip Irrigation According to the
    Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) methodology (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt 1977; Allen et al. 1998), the evapotranspiration of a determined crop
    ( ET C ) is directly related to the reference evapotranspiration ( ET O ) by a
    crop coefficient ( K C ), which reflects the effects of the plant properties to
    the water requirements. In turn, this crop evapotranspiration parameter ( ET C
    ) can also be affected by local conditions, the effects of which are considered
    using a weather variation coefficient ( K V ) (Hernández Abréu et al. 1987) and
    an advection correction factor ( K A ) (Sepaskhah and Andam 2001). Finally, for
    drip irrigation, a shading coefficient ( K S ), which relates crop evapotranspiration
    under conventional irrigation ( ET C ) with crop evapotranspiration under drip
    irrigation ( ET D ), should also be applied, resulting in the following equation
    (ASCE 1996): ET D ( mm · day − 1 ) = ET O · K C · K A · K V · K S (1) The ET O
    value is automatically obtained from the Murcian Agricultural Information Service
    (Spain) website by selecting the agricultural weather station that is closest
    to the area where the SCADA platform is installed (see Fig. 3, top left). Concretely
    in this case, the CA21—Corvera (Murcia) weather station, which is located near
    the analyzed parcel, is equipped with sensors for temperature (PT-1000), relative
    humidity (Humicap 180), global solar radiation (SP1110), net radiation (Q-7.1
    Net Radiometer), wind speed (A100R), and a pluviometer (FDD500). To obtain the
    crop coefficient ( K C ), the values in Table 1 (Muncharaz 2004) were manipulated
    according to established methods. In this study, the K C values for soils without
    vegetal cover and without weeds and with weak and moderate wind speeds (dry air)
    are the most closely related to the area where the almond trees are planted; therefore,
    these values have been initially introduced (Fig. 3, top right). Table 1 shows
    the lack of K C values for December, January, and February. Because almonds retain
    a good percentage of leaves during those months, irrigation with low K C values
    can be performed. K C values of ≈ 0.20 for bare, dry soil or dead ground cover,
    and K C values of 0.50 to 0.80 for actively growing ground cover are usually recommended
    (Allen et al. 1998). Table 1. Crop Coefficients (Kc) for Full-Size Almond Trees

    0.7 For estimation of the advection correction factor ( K A ), which takes the
    parcel size into consideration, the graphic in Fig. 5 can be used (Sepaskhah and
    Andam 2001). For the weather variation coefficient ( K V ), the value recommended
    for semiarid zones is 1.2 (Hernández Abréu et al. 1987). Fig. 5. Correction factor
    for evapotranspiration caused by advection using data outside or before irrigation
    development for different sizes of irrigated areas under arid and moderate wind
    conditions The last value required for calculation of the ET D is the shading
    coefficient ( K S ), which is obtained from Fereres et al. (1982) according to
    the shaded surface percentage (Table 2). According to previous studies (Hutmacher
    et al. 1994), these values provide good results for calculating evapotranspiration
    in almond trees. Because the values of the shadowed surface shown in Table 2 are
    multiples of 10, a second-degree polynomial approximation function [Eq. (2)] has
    been used in the application. Therefore, the user can introduce the desired shaded
    surface percentage ( S S ), and the corresponding K S value is then automatically
    calculated (Fig. 3, top center): K S = − 0.0001 · S S 2 + 0.0214 · S S + 0.0983

    0.49 0.64 0.76 0.87 0.89 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 Based on the ET O , K C , K A , K
    V , and K S values, the application internally calculates the crop evapotranspiration
    under drip irrigation ( ET D ) using Eq. (1). Estimation of Net Irrigation Dose
    and Irrigation Interval After the crop evapotranspiration under drip irrigation
    ( ET D ) is calculated, the net irrigation dose ( D N ) is required to estimate
    the irrigation interval that will be used by the SCADA application for irrigation
    scheduling. This parameter represents the maximum amount of water that the soil
    can retain (Pizarro 1996) and is given by the following equation: D N ( mm ) =
    [ ( α 100 ) · θ V AW · Z · ( P 100 ) ] (3) where α (%) = ratio of available stored
    water in the soil; Z (m) = rooting depth; P (%) = percentage of wet soil; and
    θ V AW ( mm · m − 1 ) = available water in the soil. For almond trees, the maximum
    values recommended for the rooting depth ( Z ) are 1.0 to 2.0 m, and 0.40 for
    the percentage of wet soil ( P ) (Allen et al. 1998). To calculate the available
    water in the soil parameter θ V AW (Pizarro 1996; Hoffman et al. 2007), the following
    formula is used: θ V AW ( mm · m − 1 ) = θ V FC − θ V WP (4) In this formula,
    θ V FC ( mm · m − 1 ) = volumetric content of the soil moisture at field capacity;
    and θ V WP ( mm · m − 1 ) = volumetric content of the soil moisture at the wilting
    point. With the net irrigation dose calculated ( D N ), the interval I (days)
    between complete irrigations of the parcel (sector 1 + sector 2) are estimated
    with Eq. (5) (Martín de Santa Olalla et al. 2005), usually at a daily interval.
    However, for soils with coarse texture, the irrigation interval is lower than
    the unit; therefore, several irrigations per day are required. By contrast, if
    water-retentive soils are treated, several days between consecutive irrigations
    are necessary to avoid root asphyxiation. I ( days ) = D N ET D (5) Calculation
    of Gross Irrigation Dose and Irrigation Time To estimate the irrigation time,
    the gross irrigation dose ( D G ) must be calculated. This parameter is obtained
    using the following two equations (Martín de Santa Olalla et al. 2005), and the
    higher value is then selected: D G ( L · tree − 1 ) = ET D · I · C G · RDI AE
    · UC D G ( L · tree − 1 ) = ET D · I · C G · RDI ( 1 − LR ) · UC (6) where ET
    D ( mm · day − 1 ) = crop evapotranspiration under drip irrigation; I (days) =
    irrigation interval; C G ( m 2 · tree − 1 ) = crop grid; AE = application efficiency;
    UC = uniformity coefficient; RDI = regulated deficit irrigation coefficient; and
    LR (Pizarro 1996, Hoffman et al. 2007) = leaching requirement, which is calculated
    with the following equation: LR = EC w 2 · EC e max (7) In this equation, EC W
    ( d S · m − 1 ) = electrical conductivity of the irrigation water; and EC e max
    ( d S · m − 1 ) = maximum electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract
    at which the plant dies. The values of these parameters for almond crops can be
    obtained from Table 3 (Martín de Santa Olalla et al. 2005). Table 3. Almond Tree

    7.0 For the RDI coefficient (Egea et al. 2010), the application provides a table
    in which the percentage of irrigation for each fortnight is introduced by the
    user depending on the phenological period of the tree (see Fig. 3). On the upper-left
    side of this table, the user can use two buttons to select whether the RDI coefficients
    of the table will be applied to each one of the sectors or whether conventional
    irrigation will be used instead ( RDI = 1 ). Depending on this RDI value, the
    irrigation dose ( D G ) and the irrigation time ( T I ) can differ for each sector.
    The irrigation time ( T I ) is obtained with the following formula (Martín de
    Santa Olalla et al. 2005): T I ( hours ) = D G N E · q E (8) where N E = number
    of emitters per tree; and q E ( L · h − 1 ) = flow rate of the emitters. After
    all the parameters have been introduced and the variables have been calculated,
    the configuration tab of the application shows the interval between complete irrigations
    of the parcel (irrigation interval) and the time needed for the irrigation of
    each sector (irrigation times) (Fig. 3, bottom right). Control Interface After
    the application has been configured, the control interface is used to monitor
    the irrigation process and control the elements of the system, which are managed
    automatically by the application according to the calculated scheduling parameters.
    The main window [Fig. 6(a)] shows a map of the irrigation head and the pump and
    control station, and several indicators providing quick information regarding
    the valves states and pressure alarms. At the bottom of the screen, the main parameters
    calculated for irrigation scheduling (irrigation times and interval) are also
    indicated. The application also allows automatic control of the system to be disabled
    to give complete access to the user with a manual button. Fig. 6. Control interface:
    (a) main window (map data: Google Cnes/Spot Image, DigitalGlobe., based on BCN
    IGN Spain); (b) irrigation head; (c) pump and control station; d) fertirrigation
    When the irrigation head button is pressed in the main screen, a new window showing
    the electrovalve states and pressure alarms appears [Fig. 6(b)]. On this screen,
    the state of the fertilizing valve is also displayed. If the control and pump
    station button is pressed, a window showing the pump system pressure and variable
    speed drive appears and can be configured [Fig. 6(c)]. One advantage of the control
    of the variable speed drive performed by a Modbud/RS-485 protocol is the potential
    to detect problems in the irrigation networks when an increase in revolutions
    is detected by the application. An additional screen that allows for the configuration
    of the fertirrigation process is also provided [Fig. 6(d)]. Results To evaluate
    the SCADA platform and the benefits of applying regulated deficit irrigation scheduling,
    the SCADA platform was installed in a parcel of almond trees at Fuente Álamo de
    Murcia, Spain. Half of the parcel (sector 1) was configured with regulated deficit
    irrigation and the other half was configured (sector 2) with conventional irrigation.
    The RDI coefficient values used for sector 1 can be extracted from Fig. 3. During
    a two-year period, the volume of water used for the irrigation of each sector
    was measured, and the results are shown in Table 4. These results demonstrate
    that application of RDI reduces water consumption and, consequently, provides
    economical savings. Additionally, a nonsignificant reduction in almond harvesting
    was observed compared with water savings. Because of the low availability of water
    resources for irrigation in southeastern Spain, an irrigation treatment of 100%
    ET O is not always possible, and irrigation alternatives are necessary. Table

    and day for irrigating sectors 1 (with RDI) and 2 (without RDI) is provided in
    Fig. 7, and it shows that water consumption decreases for RDI, particularly during
    the grain-filling phase (May 15–August 15). In addition, if these volumes per
    tree and day are accumulated for each year and the average values of the two years
    are calculated, a more representative graphic of the water savings is obtained
    (see Fig. 8). This demonstrates an approximately 40% reduction in water because
    of RDI. These results demonstrate the benefits of using this type of platform
    and shows that water consumption can be improved using regulated deficit irrigation.

    platform for regulated deficit irrigation management with ZigBee architecture
    that ensures wireless communication between the irrigation system components.
    The proposed platform has the following benefits: 1. The irrigation process is
    automatically managed by the SCADA application, and no human presence is required.
    However, a manual-operating mode is also available for maintenance tasks. 2. The
    SCADA platform can work under both conventional irrigation management and regulated
    deficit irrigation. This is achieved through modification of the RDI coefficients,
    which can be set in the configuration tab. 3. The user can continually monitor
    and control the system remotely using another computer. For this purpose the Remote
    Panels functionality of the LabVIEW software has been implemented. Additionally,
    any other free remote control software, such as virtual network computing (VNC)
    or TeamViewer, can also be used. 4. The irrigation scheduling parameters are continuously
    recalculated by the application because monthly and fortnightly values for the
    K c and RDI coefficients, respectively, have been supplied, and a daily value
    for ET O is automatically obtained from the selected agricultural weather station.
    The acquisition of the ET O parameter directly from the closest station avoids
    the additional cost of installing a new weather station at the parcel because
    the data obtained from the nearest station should be similar. 5. The ZigBee architecture
    provides error-free wireless communication with no need of cable maintenance.
    ZigBee architecture also provides an easily extensible, low-cost, and low-power
    consumption option for future improvements. 6. The platform has a supervision
    feature that allows for the detection of possible failures at the installation.
    Precisely, this functionality allowed the detection of an underpressure condition
    at the pressostat, indicating a failure at the irrigation system. The developed
    platform has been evaluated over a two-year period at an almond orchard at Fuente
    Álamo de Murcia, Spain. Half the parcel was configured with regulated deficit
    irrigation and the other half was configured with conventional irrigation. This
    demonstrated the benefits of this type of platform for irrigation management tasks
    and also showed that water consumption can be improved using regulated deficit
    irrigation. Although this study demonstrates a specific application for almond
    trees, similar systems may be implemented under different field conditions. References

    pivot irrigation, sensors, software, irrigation scheduling. Abstract. Scientists
    with the USDA-ARS Conservation & Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX,
    have developed and patented an Irrigation Scheduling Supervisory Control and Data
    Acquisition System (ISSCADAS, patent ser. no. 61/513,767). The ISSCADAS assists
    irrigation management by automating the collection of data from plant sensing
    systems, as well as applying algorithms to process those data. This paper describes
    advances in the development of software, ARSmartPivot (ARSP), for the operation
    of the ISSCADAS. Besides serving as a communication port between users, sensors,
    and center pivots, ARSP includes decision support tools that enhance irrigation
    management. For example, mathematical algorithms were implemented into ARSP‘s
    computational engine to generate recommended prescription maps. In the summer
    of 2014, ARSP was applied to the automatic control of a center pivot equipped
    for Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI). One-half of a six-span center pivot field
    was planted with two corn hybrids (Pioneer ® P0876HR and 33Y75). Irrigation management
    of both hybrids was accomplished using two irrigation scheduling methods: an automatic
    control based on a plant feedback system and a manual control based on the neutron
    probe. Three irrigation levels were applied in the experiment for both types of
    control: 100%, 75%, and 50%. Automatic plots were irrigated if a mean integrated
    crop water stress index (iCWSI) calculated for the automatic 100% plots for each
    hybrid was above a pre-determined threshold (based on well-watered corn in Bushland).
    For the P0876HR hybrid, average corn yields for automatic plots were 1.48 to 1.86
    kg m-2 and 1.35 to 1.72 kg m-2 for manual plots. For the 33Y75 hybrid, average
    corn yields for automatic plots were 1.47 to 1.91 kg m-2 and 1.62 to 1.83 kg m-2
    for manual plots. Total water use amounts for the P0876HR hybrid were 549 to 759
    mm for automatic plots and 513 to 632 mm for manual plots. For the 33Y75 hybrid,
    the corresponding amounts were 587 to 824 mm for automatic plots and 548 to 749
    mm for manual plots. The ARSP software managed irrigation scheduling of the automatic
    plots by combining the operation of the ISSCADAS and the center pivot system.

    shelf life DOI:   10.17660/ActaHortic.2010.852.16 Abstract: Drip-based fertigation
    may improve the application efficiency of water and nutrients while maintaining
    or improving marketable yield and quality at harvest and post-harvest. Two plantings
    of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were grown in the UK, with six N treatments and two
    methods of irrigation and N application. The conventional overhead irrigated treatments
    had all N applied in the base dressing with irrigation scheduled from SMD calculations.
    The closed loop treatments had nitrogen and irrigation delivered via drip automatically
    controlled by a sensor and logger system. The work established that water content
    in the root zone can be monitored in real time using horizontally oriented soil
    moisture sensors linked to data logging and telemetry, and that these data can
    be used to automatically trigger drip irrigation for commercially grown field
    vegetables. When the closed loop irrigation control was combined with fertigation
    treatments, lettuce crops were grown with savings of up to 60% and 75% of water
    and nitrogen respectively, compared to standard UK production systems. However,
    excess supply of N through fertigation rather than solid fertiliser was more detrimental
    to marketable yield and post harvest quality highlighting that care is needed
    when selecting N rates for fertigation. Article - full text (enhanced PDF format,

    scheduling, crop water stress index, center pivot irrigation, variable rate irrigation,
    wireless sensors, wireless sensor network system Robust automatic irrigation scheduling
    has been demonstrated using wired sensors and sensor network systems with subsurface
    drip and moving irrigation systems. However, there are limited studies that report
    on crop yield and water use efficiency resulting from the use of wireless networks
    to automatically schedule and control irrigations. In this study, a multinode
    wireless sensor network (WSN) system was mounted onto a six-span center pivot
    outfitted with a commercial variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. Data from the
    WSN was used for automatic irrigation scheduling and irrigation control to produce
    an early hybrid variety of grain sorghum in 2011. An integrated crop water stress
    index (CWSI) was used as a threshold to schedule irrigations. Half of the center
    pivot field was divided into six sectors, three were irrigated using automatic
    control, and three were irrigated based on weekly direct soil water measurements.
    Wireless sensor nodes, i.e. infrared thermometers, GPS unit, and multiband radiometers
    were integrated onto the center pivot system and field below. The WSN system was
    scaled to 40 different nodes and was operational throughout 98% of the growing
    season. An assessment of the reliability of the nodes, demonstrated that delivery
    rates for data packets from the different nodes ranged between 90% to 98%. Automatic
    irrigation scheduling succeeded in producing mean dry grain yields and controlling
    crop water use efficiency (WUE) at levels that were similar to those from soil
    water based irrigation scheduling. Average seasonal integrated crop water stress
    indices were negatively correlated to irrigation treatment amounts in both the
    manual and automatic plots and correlated well to crop water use. These results
    demonstrate that it is feasible to use WSN systems for irrigation management on
    a field scale level. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) Share Facebook X Email

    \ primary goal of all those working in the ﬁeld of sustainable water management,\n\
    particularly in the arid and semi-arid zones, is to increase irrigation eﬃciency,\
    \ reduce irrigation water\nlosses, and improve water productivity for all crops.\
    \ This study assessed the automatic irrigation\nscheduling and irrigation management\
    \ on the growth, yield, and water productivity of cucumber\nunder greenhouse conditions.\
    \ A ﬁeld experiment was conducted using cucumber grown in aplastic\ngreenhouse\
    \ during the winter of 2017/18 and 2018/19 at the research farm station of the\
    \ National\nResearch Centre (NRC), El-Noubaria Region, Behaira Governorate, Egypt.\
    \ In a split-plot experiment,\ntwo diﬀerent methods to control irrigation scheduling\
    \ (manual control (MC) and automatic control\n(AC)) were used in the main plots\
    \ and three deﬁcit irrigation treatments (100% of full irrigation (FI),\n80% of\
    \ FI, and 60% of FI). Through the obtained results, it was found that the use\
    \ of the automatic\ncontrol of the irrigation schedule led to an improvement in\
    \ the productivity and quality characteristics\nof the cucumber crop. Automatic\
    \ irrigation control created healthy conditions for the plant roots\nlocated under\
    \ the least water stress. This led to an increase in nitrogen uptake at the ages\
    \ of 3, 5, 7,\nand 9 weeks after planting in addition to improving the total leaf\
    \ area and the chlorophyll content\nof leaves, which consequently had a greater\
    \ eﬀect on increasing yield and water productivity of\ncucumber. Although the\
    \ highest values of cucumber productivity were obtained with irrigation\nat 100%\
    \ of FI, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between 100% FI and 80% of FI, therefore\
    \ it is\npreferable to irrigate at 80% of FI, and this means saving 20% of irrigation\
    \ water that can be used\nto irrigate other areas. The SALTMED model simulating\
    \ all of the following evaluation criteria\nperformed well for soil moisture content\
    \ and N-uptake as well as the leaves area, the yield, and water\nproductivity\
    \ of cucumber for all treatments for the two growing seasons 2017/18 and 2018/19,\
    \ with the\noverall R2 of 0.882, 0.903, 0.975, 0.907, and 0.933, respectively.\n\

    \ shortage are one of the most important and serious problems and challenges\n\
    facing the irrigation process in the Arab Republic of Egypt and arid and semi-arid\
    \ regions, hence the\nnecessity to reduce the consumption of irrigation water.\
    \ This can be achieved by many means,\nincluding the development and improvement\
    \ of new and innovative technologies that can be an\neﬀective tool [1,2]. In arid\
    \ countries as well as semi-arid regions, which are characterized by high\nSustainability\

    Sustainability 2020, 12, 9819\n2 of 20\npopulation growth and low water resources,\
    \ there is stress, negative impact, and high pressure on\nall sectors, chieﬂy\
    \ the agricultural sectors to rationalize water consumption for irrigation and\
    \ also\nrationalize the use of water for the urban and industrial sectors [3–5].\
    \ The agricultural production\nsector faces a great and dangerous challenge in\
    \ increasing food production with less irrigation water,\nwhich can be achieved\
    \ by many diﬀerent technologies that lead to increased crop water productivity\
    \ [6].\nIncreasing crop water productivity [7] is an important and necessary goal\
    \ to increase the demand\nfor food while increasing the rate of continuous population\
    \ growth [8,9]. The increasing demand\nfor scarce water resources resulted in\
    \ all innovative and new applications competing with new\nirrigation technologies\
    \ that aim to increase and improve water productivity for diﬀerent crops [10]\
    \ and\nAbdelraouf and Ragab [11]. The concept of increasing crop water productivity\
    \ in the Arab Republic of\nEgypt and all dry areas is extremely important in light\
    \ of the limited water resources resulting from\nlimited rainfall [12]. To save\
    \ part of the limited irrigation water, the application of modern irrigation\n\
    methods and associated technologies is an important concept that must be undertaken\
    \ and worked on\nin arid and semi-arid regions as is the case in Egypt [3,13].\n\
    Applying optimal irrigation scheduling and relying on water use patterns as well\
    \ as the plantation’s\nresponse to the conditions of irrigation water shortage\
    \ improve water productivity and water use\neﬃciency. It is highly recommended\
    \ to use drip irrigation methods due to their high eﬃciency in\nusing water, which\
    \ results in saving water and increasing water productivity [14]. Eﬀective ﬁeld\n\
    pursuits with a drip irrigation system may aﬀect the achievement of the objectives\
    \ of increasing\nirrigation water savings and improving crop productivity [15,16].\
    \ Farmers and users of a drip irrigation\nsystem may suﬀer from the reduced hydraulic\
    \ performance of this system due to error in design\nor management, and they may\
    \ have to resort to using a system that is cheaper in ﬁnancial cost if\nthey are\
    \ unable to manage capital needs. Inexperienced farmers will also have diﬃculty\
    \ controlling\nirrigation scheduling with their irrigation systems in the most\
    \ optimal way as well as having little\nexperience monitoring irrigation system\
    \ performance. Modern irrigation water management systems\nbased on various environmental\
    \ measurements provide better and signiﬁcantly improved control of\nsupply in\
    \ relation to demand. In general, many irrigation systems are semi-automatic,\
    \ using timers\nto control irrigation scheduling, i.e., the exact time of irrigation.\
    \ Farmers should also renew these\ntimers in a way that is more dependent on changes\
    \ in environmental conditions and the water use\nrequirements of the plant [17].\
    \ The use of automatic control systems in irrigation scheduling provides\nsuitable\
    \ solutions to overcome the unwanted eﬀects resulting from the presence of either\
    \ poor design,\npoor control and operation, or both. This advanced management\
    \ and automatic control, when used\nin scheduling irrigation water for diﬀerent\
    \ crops, will be an eﬀective and appropriate monitoring\ntool to increase irrigation\
    \ eﬃciency [18]. Predicting irrigation water needs is an eﬀective and key\ntopic\
    \ for automatic control systems in order to reach eﬃcient and appropriate scheduling\
    \ of irrigation\nwater. In general, the results of studies conducted by [19–21]\
    \ conﬁrm the necessity and importance of\nusing and applying automatic control\
    \ systems to improve the performance of irrigation systems and\nmethods, with\
    \ the eﬃciency of water and energy use. Irrigation standardization plays an important\n\
    and essential role in improving and increasing crop productivity, water productivity,\
    \ and increasing net\nproﬁts [22,23]. Eﬀective and successful management of the\
    \ limited amount of irrigation water required\nfor various agricultural uses depends\
    \ on better agricultural practices and techniques to improve water\nproductivity\
    \ [24,25].\nIrrigation deﬁcit (i.e., irrigation that falls below the water requirements\
    \ critical to crop growth) is\nan eﬀective irrigation-water-saving strategy where\
    \ the cultivated crops are exposed to a certain level of\nwater stress either\
    \ during a certain period or throughout the entire growing season [26]. The main\
    \ goal\nof using deﬁcit irrigation” DI “is to increase water use eﬃciency.\nCucumber\
    \ is one of the most popular and best vegetables grown in greenhouses in the Arab\n\
    Republic of Egypt. The fresh crops of cucumbers are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the\
    \ irrigation schedule\nand by the total volume of irrigation water added in its\
    \ diﬀerent growth stages [27].\nSustainability 2020, 12, 9819\n3 of 20\nThe model\
    \ of SALTMED by Ragab [7] is considered one of the important models developed\
    \ that\nhas proven its ability to simulate many crops under various ﬁeld administrations\
    \ taking into account\nall irrigation systems, diﬀerent water characteristics,\
    \ irrigation strategies, diﬀerent types of soils,\ncrops, fertilizer applications,\
    \ and the eﬀect and simulation of abiotic stress such as drought, salinity,\n\
    temperature, shallow groundwater quality, and various drainage systems. The current\
    \ version of the\nmodel released in2015 allows simultaneous simulations of 20\
    \ ﬁelds, each with all irrigation systems,\nsoil and crops, irrigation strategies\
    \ and N fertilizers, etc. This model simulates soil moisture, dry matter,\ncrop\
    \ productivity and soil salinity, soil nitrogen dynamics and requirements for\
    \ salinity ﬁltration,\nnitrate ﬁltration and drainage, soil temperature, evaporation\
    \ and water absorption, water salinity,\ngroundwater level, and eﬄuent ﬂow. This\
    \ model was calibrated and validated using observed ﬁeld\ndata by [8,11,28–38].\
    \ They demonstrated and conﬁrmed their high predictability of ﬁeld-measured\n\
    yield, soil moisture content, N-uptake, dry matter, yields, water productivity,\
    \ and salinity.\nThis study aimed to improve the yield and water productivity\
    \ of cucumber plants grown in\naplastic greenhouse by the automatic control of\
    \ irrigation scheduling under deﬁcit irrigation strategy\nthrough a ﬁeld and modeling\
    \ study using the SALTMED model in the North of Egypt.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\

    irrigation, and the ﬁeld capacity and wilting point were taken as evaluation lines\
    \ in consideration as an\nevaluation parameter for exposure of the range of plants\
    \ to water stress (WS) [39]. Measurements were\ntaken at soil depths at all growth\
    \ stages of cucumber plants. Soil moisture content was measured by the\nproﬁle\
    \ probe device (PR2 Proﬁle Probe https://www.delta-t.co.uk/pr2-proﬁle-probe-sdi-12-version/.\n\

    \ after 90 days\nfrom the transplanting of the cucumber plants grown under greenhouse\
    \ conditions.\nTotal yield of cucumber: At the harvest time of cucumber, the total\
    \ weight of fruits in each\ntreatment was recorded by harvesting the cucumber\
    \ (calculated as kg per 1 m2) fruits twice weekly,\nand then the total yield as\
    \ ton per hectare was calculated.\nWater productivity of cucumber: WPcucumber\
    \ was calculated according to James (1988) using\nEquation (2) as follows:\nWPcucumber\
    \ = Ey/Ir\n(2)\nwhere WPcucumber is water productivity of cucumber (kgcucumber\
    \ m−3irrigation water), Ey is the\neconomical yield (kgcucumber ha−1/season),\
    \ and Ir is the applied amount of irrigation water\n(m3irrigation water ha−1/season).\n\
    SALTMED Model: The SALTMED model description and the equations for the key processes\n\
    of evapotranspiration, water and solute transport, nitrogen cycle, drainage, and\
    \ crop growth were\nprovided by Ragab [7]. The model is suitable for all irrigation\
    \ systems including drip irrigation.\nThe reference evapotranspiration (ETo) according\
    \ to Allen et al. [40] was selected for this study using\nmeteorological data\
    \ obtained from the ﬁeld weather station. The crop-speciﬁc input data were the\n\
    leaf area index (LAI), plant height, maximum and minimum root depth, and each\
    \ growth stage\nduration. The irrigation input values were those applied in the\
    \ ﬁeld for drip irrigation with the\ndeﬁcit irrigation strategy during the 2017/2018\
    \ and 2018/2019 growing seasons. The soil proﬁle\nwas determined based on one\
    \ layer of 0.00–0.40 m; this one layer provided the initial soil moisture\nconditions\
    \ for the model run. The soil hydraulic property of that layer was obtained from\
    \ ﬁeld and\nlaboratory measurements. Model calibration was performed for each\
    \ control of irrigation scheduling\n(manual and automatic control) under study\
    \ individually due to the diﬀerent growth and other\ncharacteristics of each control\
    \ as shown in Table 3, and the simulated soil moisture content, N-uptake,\nleaves\
    \ area, total yield, and water productivity of cucumber at fully irrigated 100%\
    \ FI under drip\nirrigation were compared with the measured and observed values\
    \ during the 2017/2018 season by\nﬁne-tuning the relevant SALTMED model parameters.\
    \ Model validation was carried out using the\nremaining treatments (using the\
    \ calibrated parameter) by comparing simulated soil moisture content,\nN-uptake,\
    \ leaves area, yield, and water productivity of cucumber with the observed ones.\
    \ Statistical\nand graphical methods were used to evaluate model performance.\
    \ For the model calibration and\nvalidation statistical measures, the R2, root\
    \ mean square error (RMSE), and the coeﬃcient of residual\nmass (CRM) were used.\
    \ The CRM is a measure of the tendency of the model to overestimate or\nunderestimate\
    \ the measurements. Negative values for the CRM indicate that the model underestimates\n\
    the measurements, and positive values for the CRM indicate a tendency to overestimate.\
    \ For a perfect\nﬁt between observed and simulated data, values of RMSE, CRM,\
    \ and R2 should equal 0.0, 0.0, and 1.0,\nrespectively. All the analyses were\
    \ made using Excel (Microsoft Inc.).\nSustainability 2020, 12, 9819\n7 of 20\n\

    \ and Water Stress Inside the Root Zone of Cucumber Plant\nThe soil moisture content\
    \ was measured before irrigation (as this indicates the extent to which\nthe roots\
    \ are exposed to water stress) within the root propagation area of cucumber plants\
    \ for all\ntreatments under the conditions of diﬀerent control systems for irrigation\
    \ scheduling and irrigation\ndeﬁcit strategy during the diﬀerent growth stages\
    \ of cucumber plants as in Figure 2.\nThe soil moisture content values were slightly\
    \ higher with automatic irrigation scheduling\ncompared to the manual irrigation\
    \ scheduling system due to the regularity of water addition under the\nautomatic\
    \ irrigation scheduling system, with which there was no opportunity to subject\
    \ the cucumber\nroot spread area to water stress at all, but on the contrary with\
    \ manual irrigation scheduling, which then\nexposed the spread area of cucumber\
    \ roots to water stress at many times during the diﬀerent growth\nstages due to\
    \ the irregularity of adding water at inappropriate and inaccurate times with\
    \ manual\nirrigation scheduling, as indicated in Figure 2.\nSustainability 2020,\

    \ the different growth stages due to the irregularity of adding water at inappropriate\
    \ and \ninaccurate times with manual irrigation scheduling, as indicated in Figure\
    \ 2. \nThe soil moisture content is affected by the irrigation deficit level.\
    \ With a decrease in the \namount of added irrigation water, the moisture content\
    \ within the root spread area decreases, which \nexposes the roots of cucumber\
    \ plants to increase the water stress on them with a decrease in the \namount\
    \ of added irrigation water, and this seems logical to a great extent. The highest\
    \ values of soil \nmoisture content before irrigation were when 100% of complete\
    \ irrigation was added, and the lowest \nvalues were when 60% of complete irrigation\
    \ was added, as shown in Figure 2. \nThe best and highest moisture content values\
    \ were when scheduling automatic irrigation and \nwhen adding 100% of full irrigation,\
    \ while the lowest values were when scheduling manual \nirrigation and when adding\
    \ 60% of full irrigation. Overall, the model was able to simulate \nreasonably\
    \ well the observed data during both the calibration and validation processes.\
    \ These \nresults are consistent with those obtained by Pulvento, Riccardi, Lavini,\

    \ for the layer (0–40 cm). Good correlation between the simulated \nand observations\
    \ were obtained for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons. Table 4 indicates that the\
    \ \nSALTMED model proved its high sensitivity to simulate the soil moisture changes\
    \ caused by \nirrigation events. Overall, the simulated and the observed soil\
    \ moistures for all treatments combined \nshowed a strong correlation for two\

    Deﬁcit irrigation: Regarding the eﬀect of deﬁcit irrigation treatments, it was\
    \ clear from the obtained\ndata in Table 5 that deﬁcit irrigation with the treatment\
    \ of 100% FI followed by 80% FI had a signiﬁcantly\nmore obvious eﬀect on nitrogen\
    \ uptake by cucumber plants through the whole vegetative growth\nstage at 3, 5,\
    \ 7, and 9 weeks from planting compared with 60% of deﬁcit irrigation, and for\
    \ that, deﬁcit\nirrigation at 80% is economically more recommended than 100%.\n\
    Interaction: Deﬁcit irrigation with the treatment of 80% and AC were found to\
    \ be the best treatment\nfor better nitrogen uptake by cucumber plants through\
    \ the whole vegetative growth stage. This positive\neﬀect of automatic control\
    \ on nitrogen uptake by cucumber plants through the whole vegetative\ngrowth stage\
    \ could be due to more available water in the rhizosphere which reﬂects on nitrogen\n\
    availability and simultaneous uptake of water and nitrogen at a satisfactory level\
    \ [42]. On the other\nhand, over-irrigation can increase nitrogen uptake to higher\
    \ levels which in turn could have a negative\nhealth eﬀect because of the too-high\
    \ nitrate content of vegetable fruits (Saleh et al.; 2010). Oppositely,\nunder\
    \ water stress drought conditions, nutrient uptake by roots was aﬀected by a reduction\
    \ in the\ntransportation of nutrients from the soil surface to the absorbing roots,\
    \ and transportation from the\nroots to the shoots was also adversely aﬀected\
    \ [43].\nFigures 5–7 indicated that a positive correlation between the simulated\
    \ and observations was\nobtained for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons, and the\
    \ SALTMED model proved its high sensitivity to\nsimulate the N-uptake under automatic\
    \ irrigation scheduling and deﬁcit irrigation scheduling.\nOverall, the simulated\
    \ and the observed N-uptake for all treatments combined showed a strong\ncorrelation\
    \ for the two seasons 2017/18 and 2018/19, where R2 was 0.903.\nSustainability\

    \ 80%FI, had a more\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect than 60%, and for that 80% is more recommended\
    \ than 100% (Table 6).\nInteraction: The interaction eﬀect between irrigation\
    \ scheduling treatments and deﬁcit irrigation\ntreatments is presented in Figure\

    \ 80% and automatic control (AC) of irrigation were found to be the best treatment\

    \ content. Similar results were obtained\nby Amer et al. [44] who found that the\

    \ applied (100%FI treatment). In addition, the same trend was detected\nby Saleh\
    \ and Ibrahim [45] for cantaloupe (Cucumis melo L.). This positive eﬀect of automatic\

    simulate the leaves area under automatic irrigation scheduling and deﬁcit irrigation\

    \ \nABSTRACT \nMoisture sensing devices are considered the main element to reach\
    \ better \nirrigation management especially for irrigation systems that are based\
    \ on \nautomatic control. Moisture devices location accuracy may affect the \n\
    accuracy of their sent data which will lead to a poor performance under \nvarious\
    \ operating conditions and consequently, affect irrigation efficiency \nthat affects\
    \ dependency on water productivity and thus, water use energy \nefficiency. For\
    \ this purpose, a lab experiment was carried out using a \nfiberglass box (100\
    \ x 100 x 20 cm) and digital moisture meter (SKZ-\nDM300L), 2 digits accuracy\
    \ to determine the optimal position of a \ncalibrated moisture sensing device.\
    \ The experiment was carried out on \ntwo soil types (sandy, and clay) under three\
    \ flow rates (4.2, 5.6, and 6.2 \nl/h) for each soil type. Soil moisture content\
    \ (SMC) average and total \nmoisture content average were calculated for both\
    \ soil types throughout \nfour investigation periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 h) respectively,\
    \ after \napplying the water for an hour. Standard deviation (SD) was estimated\
    \ \nfor each quarter of the total investigation depth to determine the amount\
    \ \nof variation or dispersion of the obtained average (mean) moisture \ncontent\
    \ values. For sandy soil, (15 cm) vertically (under the emission \npoint directly)\
    \ is the optimal position recommended putting a calibrated \nmoisture sensing\
    \ device use in irrigation scheduling under the lowest flow \nrate (4.2 l/h) whereas,\
    \ (15, 15 cm) horizontally and vertically \nrespectively, (from the emission point)\
    \ is recommended for clay soil under \nflow rate (5.6 l/h) to obtain highly irrigation\
    \ efficiency and thus, highly \nwater productivity and water use energy efficiency.\

    \             - 158 - \n1. INTRODUCTION \noil moisture content (SMC) is a major\
    \ determinant of plant growth \nand crop productivity. SMC has a major role in\
    \ ecological and \nhydrological processes at different scales, including root\
    \ water \nabsorption, \nphotosynthesis, \nnutrient \ntransport, \nevapotranspiration,\
    \ \ninfiltration, runoff, and soil erosion (Chaney et al., 2015). Therefore, \n\
    Investigation of the soil moisture dynamics of agricultural lands is vital \n\
    not only to improve agricultural water use efficiency, but also to \nunderstand\
    \ the impact of agricultural cultivation and irrigation on the \nwater cycle (Ren\
    \ et al., 2016).Consequently, it must be a considerable \nparameter in environmental,\
    \ agricultural, hydrological, and geotechnical \nstudies and projects (Brocca\
    \ et al.,2014).Soil moisture content (SMC) \nshows high spatiotemporal variability,\
    \ its spatial pattern is characterized \nby temporal stability, defined as the\
    \ temporal persistence of spatial \npatterns of soil water content over time(Joshi\
    \ et al., 2011).The temporal \nstability concept can be used to determine locations\
    \ that represent the \nmean SMC of an area, to up- or downscale SMC measurements,\
    \ and to \nprovide missing data in hydrological analyses (Penna et al., 2013).\
    \ It can \nalso be used to determine the mean SMC of an area using a small number\
    \ \nof monitoring points, which saves time and reduces the labor required \ncompared\
    \ with traditional monitoring methods (Jia et al., 2013).Micro \nirrigation systems\
    \ have greater potential for accurate irrigation delivery \nthan other irrigation\
    \ systems and also easily to control and are commonly \nautomated on a time ,soil\
    \ moisture, or time–temperature basis (Evett et \nal., 2006).Automation of these\
    \ irrigation systems plays an important role \nin the provision of water efficiency\
    \ in agricultural farming systems \nirrigated because it can provide the required\
    \ amount of water in a timely \nmanner according to the needs of the plant and\
    \ the circumstances of the \nactual \nwater \nthroughout \nthe \nseasons \nof\
    \ \nthe \nyear \n(Boutraa \net.,2011).According to Irrigation Association., 2007\
    \ a variety of \ntechnologies are designed to minimize excessive irrigation by\
    \ measuring \nor estimating soil moisture content these technologies include soil\
    \ \nmoisture sensor (SMS) controllers, evapotranspiration (ET) based \ncontrollers\
    \ and rain sensors. Many researchers have investigated the \nautomation of irrigation\
    \ systems and the use of soil moisture sensing \nS \nIRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE \n\

    \ blocks, granular matrix sensors \n(GMS), and electromagnetic (EM) sensors. Several\
    \ studies investigated \nthe use of EM sensors in novel automated irrigation management\
    \ \napplications (Miralles-Crespo and Van Iersel., 2011). In these studies, \n\
    significant water savings in comparison with traditional irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ approaches, as high as 60%, were reported without a negative \neffect on crop\
    \ yield. Blonquist et al., 2006 installed a soil moisture \nsensor(time domain\
    \ transmission) for the registration of volumetric water \ncontent in the soil,\
    \ compared with an irrigation threshold, and link this to \na solenoid  valve\
    \ on the  irrigation line  supplying water to the irrigation \nsystem. This system\
    \ applied 53% less water than under the traditional \nmethod. Ooi et al., 2010\
    \ used automation to irrigate an apple orchard, \nThe system developed allowed\
    \ fully automated on-farm irrigation based \non real-time feedback control increased\
    \ economic water use efficiency \nand water use efficiency by 73% compared with\
    \ the manual irrigation \nsystem. Large variations in water content and matric\
    \ potential may exceed \nthe range of operation for certain sensors (e.g., tensiometers).Also,\
    \ Soil \nmoisture sensors positioning and accuracy may affect the performance\
    \ \nand irrigation efficiency of soil moisture based irrigation scheduling \n\
    systems under various conditions (soil types, potential evapotranspiration \n\
    rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths, drip line spacing).(Soulis et al.,\
    \ \n2015).Also, as position of sensors plays a significant role in irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling as poor sensor positioning that is not representative of the soil\
    \ \nmoisture conditions in the root zone can result either in crop water stress,\
    \ \nor in over-irrigation that negates the water saving capabilities of soil \n\
    moisture scheduling (Wang et al., 2012).Thus, in agriculture, knowledge \nof soil\
    \ moisture allows proper irrigation management and forecasting of \ncrop yields\
    \ (Grabow et al., 2013).Soil moisture wetting patterns can be \nobtained either\
    \ experimentally, which are case-specific, or by simulation \nusing suitable mathematical\
    \ models. As a result, several studies were \nconducted to understand the extent\
    \ and patterns of spatial and temporal \nvariations in water content and matric\
    \ potential within drip irrigated fields \n(Or., 1996). \nUsually, many of these\
    \ irrigation studies focus on the top 1–2 m or even \nshallower depths, as the\

    \ and Simunek., 2016). However, \nfew studies have investigated the distribution\
    \ of SMC temporal stability \ncharacteristics at a fine scale (e.g., every 20\
    \ cm or less) (Gao et al., \n2015).In this context, the main purpose of this study\
    \ is to investigate the \ninfluence of soil moisture sensor position on the performance\
    \ of soil \nmoisture based irrigation scheduling systems under different conditions\
    \ of \nsoil types, flow rates and investigation periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 h)\
    \  to \ndetermine the optimal location of a moisture sensing device under \nconditions\
    \ of soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems to \nmaximize water productivity\
    \ and thus, water use energy efficiency. \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n2.1. Physical\
    \ description of the experiment. \nA lab experiment was carried out using a transparent\
    \ fiber glass box (100 \nx 100 x20 cm) as shown in Fig.1 to simulate a soil profile\
    \ to the root zone \narea. The box was made of fiberglass to facilitate the observation\
    \ of water \nmovement in the soil profile after water application. A grid of holes\
    \ was \ndrilled in one side of the box on equal spaces (5 cm in both horizontal\
    \ and \nvertical directions) from the emission point to investigate soil moisture\
    \ \ncontent distribution throughout the soil. Long path outline emitter was \n\
    fixed at the emission point (0, 0) coordinates. One terminal of the lateral \n\
    (16 mm inner diameter) was connected to the water supply and the other \nterminal\
    \ was closed by an end cap. The investigation was carried out after \napplying\
    \ the water for an hour from the emission source. The total \ninvestigation area\
    \ was 80 cm width (40 cm horizontally on both side of \nthe emission point) and\
    \ 60 cm depth. Electric conductivity (EC) of the \napplied water was measured\
    \ and an amount of water was applied to the \nbox before the experiments in order\
    \ to leach the salts in the soil to avoid \nthe expected effect of their non-uniform\
    \ distribution in the proposed \nsensing device’s readings accuracy. The bottom\
    \ of the box had a drain \nhole to discharge the leaching water. This water EC\
    \ was measured \ngradually till reaching a reading near to the EC of applied water.\

    \ \nThree flow rates (4.2, 5.6, and 6.2l/h) were used during the study to \nchange\
    \ the behavior of water movement which will be investigated to \nconsider the\
    \ expected variation in the distribution of soil moisture content \nin the root\
    \ zone. This is expected to clarify whether there will be a change \nin the selected\
    \ position of the sensor regarding the variation of water \nmovement and wetting-front\
    \ advance or not. The change in emitter flow \nrate was achieved by using three\
    \ operating pressure heads (5, 8, and 10 m \nof water) that are suitable for trickle\
    \ irrigation network operation. \nOperating pressure head was measured by using\
    \ pressure gauge 1 m \naccuracy which was monitored continuously during operation\
    \ to avoid \nany change that may happen in the pressure which was controlled by\
    \ a \nvalve at the water outlet source. \n2.2.2. Soil texture. \nClay and sandy\
    \ soil types were studied to determine the optimal position \nof the moisture\
    \ sensing device for each soil type. The used volume of \neach soil type which\
    \ was put in the box was transferred from outside \nfield. The used soils were\
    \ sifted before entering the box and compacted \nby hand to avoid the existence\
    \ of gravels or air cavities that may affect \nthe measurements. The soil leaching\
    \ process helped in soil compaction \nand the soil was allowed to dry before the\
    \ tests. \n2.2.3. Investigation periods. \nThe investigation was carried out for\
    \ each soil type for four investigation \nperiods (6, 12, 24, 48 hs) after applying\
    \ the water for an hour from the \nemission source. \nIRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE\

    A digital moisture meter (SKZ-DM300L), 2digits accuracy was used to \ninvestigate\
    \ soil moisture distribution throughout the soil profile. The \nprobe of the device\
    \ was assumed to act any proposed sensing device. The \ndevice was calibrated\
    \ before investigation to ensure its accuracy. The \ngravitational method was\
    \ used to calculate the moisture content of the two \nsoil types (sandy and clay)\
    \ by putting the wet sample in a pot and \nrecorded the weight of the sample (wet\
    \ weight) and then, samples were \ndried at 105 °C for 24 h. Soil moisture content\
    \ was measured by the \ndevice before the drying process. Six different weight\
    \ samples for each \ntype of soil were used in the calibration. The dry weight\
    \ was recorded to \ncalculate the per cent of moisture content referring to the\
    \ formula used by \n(Gardner et al., 2001). \nThe obtained results were fed to\
    \ software (curve expert version 1.3) to \nobtain the calibration formula which\

    \ the \namount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values (Bland and \n\
    Altman., 1996).As a result, SD were estimated for each quarter of the \ntotal\
    \ investigation depth to determine the amount of variation or \ndispersion of\
    \ the obtained average (mean) moisture content values by \nusing the following\

    \ AND DISCUSSION \n3.1. Moisture content variation. \n3.1.1. Soil texture effect.\
    \ \nThe obtained results are listed in (Table 1,and 2),by comparing two soil \n\
    types (sandy, and clay) under the study, the obtained results indicate large \n\
    variation in moisture content average throughout the investigation periods \n\
    for the same flow rate values, for example, after (6 h ) the values were \n(1.53,\
    \ 1.88, 2.86, and 6.94 %) respectively, for sandy soil under flow rate \n(4.2\
    \ l/h) as shown in (Table 1), while the values were (20.04, 17.02, 9.25, \nand\
    \ 4.85% ) respectively, for clay for the same investigation period under \nthe\
    \ same flow rate as shown in (Table 2). For sandy soil, the observed \nincrease\
    \ in the values of moisture content average in the latest quarter of \nthe root\
    \ zone area (45-60 cm) during the investigation periods (6, 12, 24, \nand 48 h)\
    \ respectively, under three flow rates (4.2, 5.6, and 6.2 l/h) as \nshown in (Table\
    \ 1) maybe because of the accumulation of the water in the \nlatest quarter of\
    \ the fiberglass box due to the decrease in water drainage \nrate through the\
    \ drainage holes because of the fast downward movement \nin vertical direction\
    \ where macro-pores are dominant in sandy soil. On \nthe other hand, for sandy\
    \ soil, the obtained results illustrated that the \nincrease in flow rate from\
    \ (4.2 l/h) up to (6.2 l/h) led to increase in the \ntotal average of moisture\
    \ content from (3.30, 3.30, 2.86, and 2.53 %) to \n(4.58, 4.53, 4.46, and 4.45%)\
    \ by an estimated increase of \n(27.94,27.15,35.87,and 43.15%) for the investigation\
    \ periods (6, 12, 24, \nand 48 h) respectively, as shown in (Table 3). In comparison,\
    \ for clay \nsoil, there was also an increase in the total average of moisture\
    \ content \nfrom (12.79, 12.18, 10.98, and10.96 %) to (19.30, 19.18, 18.91, and\
    \ 17.69 \n%) by an estimated increase of (33.73, 36.49, 41.93 and 38.04%) \nrespectively,\
    \ under the same flow rate values and for the same \ninvestigation periods as\
    \ shown in (Table 4).These obtained results of \nmoisture content and total average\
    \ of moisture content were compatible \nwith (Siyal and Skaggs., 2009) who illustrated\
    \ that the water content in \nthe wetted zone was the largest in the clay loam,\
    \ followed by the loam \nand sandy loam. (McNeal et al., 1995) illustrated that\
    \ sandy soils \ngenerally have higher internal drainage with a lower water holding\
    \ \ncapacity than finer-textured soils. Also, This difference in moisture \ncontent\
    \ average values actually due to the fact that, clay soil is different \nIRRIGATION\

    \ texture, structure, water holding capacity, nutrient \nstatus, soil strength\
    \ and even soil temperature (Coelho and Or., 1999) \nand the difference between\
    \ soil texture (coarse or fine) is considered to be \nthe main factor that affects\
    \ soil water movement (Jury and Horton., \n2004).These obtained values of total\
    \ average moisture content were used \nto determine the horizontal and vertical\
    \ dimensions which meet the \nrecommended location to put a moisture sensing device\
    \ in the sandy and \nthe clay soil as shown in (Table 3, and 4). \n3.1.2. Flow\
    \ rate effect. \nThe obtained results shown in (Table 1, and 2) showed variation\
    \ in the \naverage of moisture content values along the wetted- front for each\
    \ \nquarter of the root zone (0-60 cm).For the two soil types (sandy, and clay)\
    \ \n, there was a positive correlation between the average of moisture content\
    \ \nvalues and the increase in flow rate up to ( 6.2 l/h ) and this variation\
    \ \nconsequently led to different values of standard deviation, for sandy soil,\
    \ \nthe obtained results shown in (Table 1) indicate that the lowest flow rate\
    \  \n(4.2 \nl/h) \ncaused \nin \nthe \nlowest \nstandard \ndeviation \nvalues\
    \ \n(0.64,0.62,0.65,and 0.77) respectively, along the investigation depth (0-15\
    \ \ncm) throughout the investigation periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 h) \nrespectively,\
    \ followed by flow rates (5.6,and 4.2 l/h). In contrast, for clay \nsoil, the\
    \ obtained results as shown in (Table 2) illustrate that, for the same \ndepth,\
    \ the flow rate (5.6 l/h) caused in the lowest standard deviation \nvalues (11.55,11.03,11.50,and\
    \ 12.72) respectively, for the same \ninvestigation periods followed by flow rates\
    \ (6.2, and 4.2 l/h).Whereas, \nthe lowest standard deviation values refers to\
    \ a convergence in the \nmoisture content values along the investigation depth\
    \ (0:15cm) as the low \nstandard deviation values indicate that the values of\
    \ moisture content for \nthe investigation points tend to be close to the mean\
    \ of the set, while the \nhigh standard deviation values which opposite (15:60\
    \ cm ) depth indicate \nthat the values of moisture content for the investigation\
    \ points are spread \nout over a wider range of values. The obtained results provided\
    \ clear \nevidence that the first quarter of the root zone area is the most important\
    \ \nquarter in this was actually fully compatible with (USDA., 1997) which \n\
    indicated that the most effective root zone depth where most of the field \ncrops\
    \ extract 40% of the water uptake takes place from the first quarter of \nthe\
    \ total rooting depth. \nIRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE \n \nMisr J. Ag. Eng., January\

    \ period and wetting-front advance. \nBy investigating the points which represented\
    \ the total moisture content \naverage, the results shown in (Table 3, and 4)\
    \ have been reached which \nrepresent its recommended location from the discharge\
    \ source. For two \nsoil types, the obtained results illustrate that by increasing\
    \ the flow rate up \nto (6.2 l/h),the total moisture content average movement\
    \ increased along \nthe wetting-front for the vertical  and horizontal directions\
    \ throughout the \ninvestigation period (6, 12, 24, 48 h) respectively, but the\
    \ movement in \nthe vertical direction was clearly high for sandy soil which reached\
    \ the \nmaximum  depth value (60 cm) vertically compared with clay soil which\
    \ \nreached (35cm) vertically under the same flow rate (6.2 l/h) at the end of\
    \ \nthe investigation period (48 h) ,while  the results showed decreasing in the\
    \ \nhorizontal movement of the total moisture content average compared with \n\
    the movement in the vertical direction which ranged  from (0 : 15 cm) \nhorizontally\
    \  for both two soil types (sandy, clay) throughout the \ninvestigation period.\
    \ The obtained results stressed the concept that using \nthe high flow rate (e.g.,\
    \ 6.2 l/h) in a single irrigation event maybe result in \nmoving the irrigation\
    \ water out the effective root zone of the plants. \nWhereas, using the high flow\
    \ rate which leads to increase in vertical \nmovement than horizontal movement\
    \ especially for sandy soil where \nmacro-pores are dominant and allow for fast\
    \ downward movement and \nthis maybe lead to increase deep percolation which leads\
    \ to exposing the \nirrigation water to move beyond the effective root zone especially\
    \ at the \ninitial stage of growth. Also, the results provided clear evidence\
    \ the total \nmoisture content average is spatiotemporal variable and these results\
    \ were \nin agreement with (Liu and Shao., 2014) who illustrated that soil \n\
    moisture content (SMC) shows high spatiotemporal variability. Also, The \nresults\
    \ are compatible with (Siyal and Skaggs., 2009) who found that \nvertical wetting\
    \ distances in soil treated with a porous clay pipe under \npositive pressure\
    \ irrigation were in the order of sandy loam, loam and \nclay loam respectively\
    \ , and the horizontal wetting distances were in the \norder of loam , sandy loam\
    \ and clay loam respectively. Furthermore, the \nwater content in the wetted zone\
    \ was the largest in the clay loam, \nfollowed by the loam and sandy loam. Also,\

    \ who \nused emitters with different discharge rates, found that increasing \n\
    discharge rate up to (8 l/h) resulted in an increase of wetting area in the \n\
    vertical direction and a decrease in the horizontal direction and thus, \nemitters\
    \ of high discharge rate of (8 l/h) caused water runoff on fine \ntextured soils,\
    \ and emitters of discharge of (4 l/h) are recommended to use \nin this soil and\

    \                   - 168 - \n4. CONCLUSION \nThe obtained results indicated large\
    \ variation in moisture content average \nat different depths (0:60 cm) throughout\
    \ the investigation periods for the \nsame flow rate values, for example, after\
    \ (6 h) the values were (1.53, \n1.88, 2.86, and 6.94 %) respectively, for the\
    \ sandy soil under flow rate \n(4.2 l/h), while the values were (20.04, 17.02,\
    \ 9.25, and 4.85%) \nrespectively, for the clay for the same investigation interval\
    \ under the \nsame flow rate. On the other hand, for the sandy soil, the obtained\
    \ results \nillustrated that the increase in flow rate from (4.2 l/h) up to (6.2\
    \ l/h) led to \nincrease in the total average of moisture content from (3.30,\
    \ 3.30, 2.86, \nand 2.53 %) to (4.58, 4.53, 4.46, and 4.45%) by an estimated increase\
    \ of \n(27.94,27.15,35.87, and 43.15%) for the investigation periods (6, 12, 24,\
    \ \nand 48 h) respectively. In comparison, for clay soil, there was also an \n\
    increase in the total average of moisture content from (12.79, 12.18, \n10.98,\
    \ and10.96 %) to (19.30, 19.18, 18.91, and 17.69 %) by an estimated \nincrease\
    \ of (33.73, 36.49, 41.93 and 38.04%) respectively, under the same \nflow rate\
    \ values and for the same investigation periods. Also, the obtained \nresults\
    \ illustrated also that, for both soil types, by increasing the flow rate \nup\
    \ to (6.2 l/h) there was a clear variation in moisture content average and \n\
    wetting-front \nadvance \n(horizontal \nand \nvertical) \nthroughout \nthe \n\
    investigation period the wetting-front advance.  \nFor the sandy soil, the lowest\
    \ flow rate (4.2 l/h) caused in the lowest \nstandard deviation values (0.64,\
    \ 0.62, 0.65, and 0.77) respectively, along \nthe investigation depth (0:15 cm)\
    \ which refers to a convergence in the \nmoisture content values along the investigation\
    \ depth (0:15cm) \nthroughout the investigation periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 h)\
    \ respectively, \nfollowed by flow rates (5.6, and 4.2 l/h). In contrast, for\
    \ clay soil, the \nflow rate (5.6 l/h) caused in the lowest standard deviation\
    \ values (11.55, \n11.03, 11.50, and 12.72) respectively, for the same depth and\
    \ the same \ninvestigation periods followed by flow rates (6.2, and 4.2 l/h).\
    \ \nIt is recommended to locate a calibrated moisture sensing device in \ndimensions\
    \ (15 cm) vertically (under the emission point) under flow rate \nIRRIGATION AND\

    Get rights and content Abstract This paper describes some new approaches for enhancing
    infrared thermometry (IRT) as a technique for detecting stomatal closure as a
    measure of plant water stress in humid environments. Although infrared thermometry
    has been widely used in arid climates for detecting plant stress (as indicated
    by stomatal closure) and for irrigation scheduling it has been found to be less
    reliable in more cooler humid climates. The use of wet and dry reference surfaces
    to reduce the method''s sensitivity to environmental variation is described and
    indexes based on IRT measurements of the temperatures of individual leaves and
    of reference surfaces in the same environment are evaluated. Both an index that
    corresponds to Idso''s original crop water stress index, but based on `wet'' and
    `dry'' reference leaves, and an index that is linearly related to leaf conductance
    were derived and shown to be closely related to measured leaf conductance in runner
    bean crops under a range of conditions. Various types of reference surface were
    evaluated and the use of non-transpiring and wet real leaves was found to be particularly
    convenient. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop water

    stressStomatal conductance 1. Introduction Lack of water is frequently the major
    factor limiting crop production and there is an increasing premium on making the
    best use of available water for irrigation. Irrigation scheduling is most usually
    based on soil water balance approaches (see e.g. Jones, 1990), though there is
    increasing interest in the use of methods that depend on plant responses to water
    deficit. The most sensitive plant responses to soil water deficit, and hence those
    with the greatest potential value for irrigation scheduling, tend to be actual
    growth rate and stomatal closure; these are generally much more sensitive to soil
    water status than is the leaf water potential (ψl) itself (e.g. Bates and Hall,
    1981; Jones, 1990; Davies and Zhang, 1991). Although it is feasible to measure
    stomatal conductance directly by means of leaf porometers, the problems of calibration
    and of adequately sampling the population of leaves in a field crop has restricted
    the use of porometers for practical irrigation scheduling. An important consequence
    of the stomatal closure that occurs when plants are subject to water stress is
    that energy dissipation is decreased so leaf temperature tends to rise; the idea
    of using leaf or canopy temperature as an indicator of plant water stress is not
    a new one (e.g. Tanner, 1963), but it was popularised by Idso and colleagues (Idso
    et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981) in the early 1980s. On the basis of results
    obtained in the arid climate of Arizona they proposed a `crop water-stress index''
    (here given the symbol ICWSI) based on the difference between canopy temperature,
    as measured using infrared thermometry (IRT), and that of a `non-water stressed
    baseline'' representing the typical canopy temperature of a well watered crop.
    A range of empirical studies (e.g. Idso, 1982) have shown that there may be different
    non-water-stressed baselines for different crops and that ideally these need to
    be determined for each agroclimatic zone in which the crop is being grown. Although
    the theoretical basis of the approach is well established (see Jackson, 1982;
    Jones, 1992) and many studies have confirmed that in arid and semi-arid environments
    infra-red thermometry can provide a useful indicator of crop water stress and
    of yield loss, and even of leaf water potential (e.g. Hatfield, 1983; O''Toole
    et al., 1984), it does have some severe limitations in humid climates and in environments
    with significant climatic variability (Hipps et al., 1985). In particular, for
    any given stomatal conductance, the leaf-to-air temperature difference depends
    not only on the atmospheric water vapour pressure deficit, which is fully accounted
    for in the calculation of ICWSI, but it also depends on windspeed, on canopy surface
    roughness, and on net radiation. In humid climates these errors can lead to variation
    in the non-water stressed baseline becoming of the same order as the range of
    canopy temperatures over the full range of stomatal conductances. A further problem
    is that the cloudless conditions that are required for application of the original
    approach may not occur often enough in maritime climates such as in the United
    Kingdom to allow the regular measurements of ICWSI that are required for effective
    irrigation scheduling. Another difficulty that has commonly been found with the
    application of infrared thermometry to assess crop water stress has been the difficulty
    of separating measurements of leaf temperature from soil temperature, which is
    often many degrees higher than leaf temperature. One approach is to combine thermometry
    with the use of a spectral vegetation index to correct for the amount of soil
    in the field of view (Moran et al., 1994), alternatively, as in the present study,
    one can avoid the problem by studying single leaves using a narrow acceptance
    angle IRT sensor. A number of approaches have been suggested for improving the
    sensitivity of infrared thermometry as a measure of crop water stress in humid
    regions. Fuchs and Tanner (1966)and Berliner et al. (1984)used well watered plots
    as a reference rather than the empirical non-water-stressed baseline, as a means
    of improving precision in humid environments. Unfortunately well-watered plots
    are not usually available, so De Lorenzi et al. (1993), for example, have proposed
    modelling the behaviour of the well-watered crop by simulating the variation in
    canopy resistance as a function of weather conditions. Other approaches have involved
    extension of the ICWSI concept to include other environmental variables. For example,
    indexes that include net radiation as well as water vapour pressure deficit have
    been proposed (Jackson et al., 1981; Keener and Kirchner, 1983). Yet others have
    suggested a very different approach to detection of stress by infra-red thermometry
    based on variability in canopy temperature. For example, Aston and Van Bavel (1972)and
    Fuchs (1990)have pointed out that as a crop becomes water stressed canopy temperature
    becomes increasingly variable. The objective of the present study was to investigate
    the potential for improving the sensitivity of infrared thermometry for calculation
    of stress indexes, or even for the direct estimation of stomatal conductance,
    in temperate climates by using in-canopy measurements of similarly exposed wet
    and dry reference surfaces as a basis for comparison with measured leaf temperatures.
    2. Materials and methods. 2.1. Theory The value of the ICWSI is defined as (Idso
    et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981) (1) where Ts is the actual canopy surface
    temperature under given environmental conditions, Tmax is the upper bound for
    canopy temperature and equates to the temperature of a non-transpiring canopy
    such as would occur if the stomata were completely closed as a result of drought,
    while Tbase is the `non-water-stressed baseline'' representing the `typical''
    canopy temperature when the stomata are fully open. If instead of referring temperatures
    to those of a well watered crop one uses a wet surface, it becomes straightforward
    to rearrange the basic energy balance equation to estimate the canopy resistance
    to water vapour transfer directly. The theoretical values for leaf or reference
    surface temperatures can be calculated using a standard rearrangement of the leaf
    energy balance (Jones, 1992; Eq. 9.6): (2) where Tl − Ta is the leaf-to-air temperature
    difference, rlW is the leaf resistance to water vapour transfer (assumed to be
    largely determined by the stomatal resistance), raW is the boundary layer resistance
    to water vapour, Rni is the net isothermal radiation (the net radiation that would
    be received by an equivalent surface at air temperature), δe air water vapour
    pressure deficit, rHR is the parallel resistance to heat and radiative transfer,
    γ is the psychrometric constant, ρ is the density of air, cp is the specific heat
    capacity of air and s is the slope of the curve relating saturation vapour pressure
    to temperature. For the following analyses the leaf boundary layer resistance
    to heat transfer (raH) was estimated using the following equation (see Fig. 3.6
    in Jones, 1992) (3) where resistances are expressed in s m−1, d is the leaf characteristic
    dimension (m) and u is windspeed (m s−1). For a dry surface having the same radiative
    and aerodynamic properties the sensible heat loss will equal the net radiation
    absorbed, so that using the concept of net isothermal radiation (see Jones, 1992)
    one can estimate Tdry ( = Tmax in Idso''s formulation) from (4) The temperature
    of the corresponding wet surface (Twet) can be calculated from Eq. (2)by setting
    rlW equal to zero which gives (5) Subtracting Eq. (5)from Eq. (4)and dividing
    by the difference between , , reduces to (6) which can be rearranged to give a
    simple expression for the leaf resistance (7) An important feature of Eq. (7)is
    that rlW can be determined solely from a combination of measurements of the temperatures
    of the leaf and of equivalent wet and dry surfaces and a term that depends only
    on the resistance to heat and water loss through the leaf boundary layer. It is
    notable that the multiplier in this equation is independent of net radiation absorbed
    or of air vapour pressure deficit and only weakly dependent on temperature. Because
    the term (Tdry − Tl) in this equation tends to be quite small and is the difference
    between two quantities that are each quite variable in the field, the behaviour
    of this equation can be rather unstable, so it is generally preferable to use
    its reciprocal, the leaf conductance (glW) (8) In much of what follows we will
    use conductances rather than resistances because transpiration rates are more
    closely related to conductances. For compatibility with much of the micrometeorological
    literature, results are presented using mass units for stomatal conductances (mm
    s−1), though approximate conversion to the molar units (mol m−2 s−1) used in most
    physiological literature can readily be achieved by multiplication by 0.04 (noting
    that this factor is slightly temperature sensitive: Jones, 1992). In addition
    to the basic crop water stress index (ICWSI) defined in Eq. (1), it follows that
    one can define further indexes using the above equations. One possibility is to
    use an index of analogous form to ICWSI but substituting Tdry for Tmax and Twet
    for Tbase, giving (9) An alternative is to define an index (I3) which is proportional
    to stomatal resistance. From Eq. (7), therefore, one can write (10) Finally, from
    Eq. (8)one can define an index (I4) which is proportional to stomatal conductance
    (and hence decreases as stomata close) as (11) 2.2. Field measurements In order
    to test the principles underlying the use of infrared thermometry for estimation
    of stomatal conductances, a number of studies were conducted in the field. The
    studies reported here were conducted on crops of runner beans grown on a slightly
    sandy loam overlying calcareous gravel at Horticulture Research International,
    Wellesbourne, Warwick UK (1°36′W, 52°12′N, 45 m a.m.s.l.) during the summers of
    1995 and 1996. In each year there were three replicates of runner bean with three
    levels of irrigation (A, B and C) in a fully guarded randomised block arrangement
    (40 experimental plants per plot). Soil moisture was monitored using one neutron
    probe per plot in 1995 and by theta-probes (Delta-T Devices, Burwell, Cambs, UK)
    in 1996. Plants were sown in groups of four and grown up 2.5 m canes arranged
    in wigwams with four canes per wigwam. The wigwams were arranged in double rows
    1.2 m apart and 2.6 m between wigwams in each row, an arrangement which approximates
    normal commercial practice in the region. The ground was slightly sculpted into
    broad ridges before planting to ensure effective runoff of rainfall from experimental
    plots using clear polyethylene sheeting laid on the soil; this largely excluded
    rainfall. All plots were provided with seep hose along the rows for irrigation.
    Well irrigated treatments were irrigated two to three times per week (aiming to
    maintain soil moisture close to field capacity), mild stress treatments were irrigated
    at half the rate of the well watered plots and no water was applied to the drought
    plots. Treatments were switched between plots once or twice each season to ensure
    that a range of stomatal conductances were available for testing the sensitivity
    of infrared thermometry. Initial trials with a number of various sized rectangular
    `model'' leaves showed that they responded much more slowly than real leaves to
    environmental changes. The most satisfactory reference surfaces were found to
    be real attached leaves. `Wet'' and `dry'' reference surfaces, respectively, were
    obtained by either wetting both sides thoroughly using a handheld sprayer containing
    water plus a small amount of detergent to act as wetter, or by covering both surfaces
    with a thin coating of petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to prevent transpiration. Leaf
    temperature measurements were made using a `Scheduler® Crop Stress Monitor'',
    kindly provided by Agrichandlers™ (Emma Nash), Hartley Witney, Basingstoke, UK.
    The quoted angle of view was 2.5° and the spectral range was 8–14 μm nominal.
    Estimates of Idso''s crop water stress index (ICWSI) were obtained using necessary
    variables measured by the Scheduler and the inbuilt software (using the calculations
    for grape as there was no calculation available for runner bean). Reference leaves
    were also measured with the Scheduler, with a wet and a dry leaf reading being
    taken before and after each pair of readings on experimental leaves, and the appropriate
    reference values averaged for calculation of stress indexes. Direct measurements
    of the temperature of some leaves were also made using 40 gauge copper-constantan
    thermocouples inserted into minor veins on the underside of leaves and fixed using
    glue from medical sticking plasters supplemented by 3 mm squares of plaster at
    least 5 mm from the thermocouple junction. Outputs were recorded on a DL2 data
    logger (Delta-T Devices, Burwell, Cambs, UK) along with meteorological data (air
    temperature, humidity, solar radiation (Kipp solarimeter) and windspeed as recorded
    by a Delta-T Devices Meteorological station). The meteorological station was situated
    adjacent to the trial, no more than 20 m from any individual plot. Stomatal conductances
    were measured using a steady-state porometer (EGM-1, PP-Systems, Stotfold, Beds,
    UK) on the same leaves as used for infrared measurement within 2 to 4 min following
    the infrared measurements (during which time stomatal conductance is unlikely
    to have changed significantly, Barradas and Jones, 1996). 3. Results 3.1. Theoretical
    sensitivity and effect of comparison with different reference surfaces The sensitivity
    of leaf temperature to a given change in stomatal (or `surface'') conductance
    sets the limit to the resolution of infrared thermometry. This sensitivity is
    strongly dependent, not only on the value of the leaf conductance, but also on
    environmental conditions. The magnitude of the change in leaf temperature for
    a 20% reduction in leaf conductance from a `typical'' value of 5 mm s−1 (200 mmol
    m−2 s−1) is shown for a range of values of net radiation, windspeed (and hence
    boundary layer resistance) and humidity in Fig. 1. These values were calculated
    using Eq. (2)and assuming Tair = 293 K, a windspeed of 0.5 m s−1, a characteristic
    leaf dimension of 0.05 m, and a relative humidity of 66%, unless otherwise stated.
    It is clear from this figure that the sensitivity of leaf temperature to changes
    in conductance increases with net radiation absorbed, with decreasing windspeed
    (equivalent to increasing leaf size and increasing boundary layer resistance)
    and with increasing vapour pressure deficit. Download : Download full-size image

    ——— ———125 W m−2; — — — = 300 W m−2; – – – = 450 W m−2), and (c) dependence on
    windspeed and net radiation (symbols as for b). Although the leaf temperature
    change for a given change in stomatal conductance is, of course, independent of
    whether it is measured as (Tl − Ta) or (Tl − Tdry) or (Tl − Twet), it is worth
    noting that the sensitivity of each of these measures to changes in environment
    can be very different depending on stomatal conductance and environmental conditions
    (Jones, 1994; Jones et al., 1997). 3.2. Use of reference leaves A key feature
    of natural environments is that leaf temperatures fluctuate rapidly as radiation,
    windspeed and air temperatures vary. The example in Fig. 2 shows typical natural
    variation in the field of bean leaf temperature from a moderately stressed plot,
    with changes of 5° or more occurring within minutes. Also shown in this figure
    are the corresponding dynamics of similarly exposed wet and dry reference leaves
    showing that the temperature dynamics of these were similar to those of the experimental
    leaf with all leaves having time constants of the order of 10 s at the typical
    windspeeds involved. Although the time constant would be expected to depend slightly
    on the surface conductance (see Eq. 9.11; Jones, 1992), it appears that for practical
    purposes the dynamics of these different leaves are similar. Temperature measurements
    with the Scheduler® of bean leaves and of the `wet'' and `dry'' reference bean
    leaves were consistently within 0.5°C of the temperatures measured using thermocouples
    with no evidence for any consistent differences between the three types of leaf.
    The various artificial models tested all had significantly longer time constants
    (data not shown) than the `wet'' or `dry'' bean leaves so were abandoned for subsequent
    studies. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Typical dynamics over a period
    of about 40 min of (a) the temperatures of a runner bean leaf (⋯⋯), a `wet'' reference
    bean leaf (— — —), a `dry'' reference bean leaf (——————) and of the air (∘), together
    with (b) variation in incident short-wave irradiance (W m−2). 3.3. Performance
    of stress indexes Assuming for illustrative purposes that the conductance of fully
    open stomata is 16 mm s−1 (Körner et al., 1979), one can use Eq. (2)to calculate
    the appropriate value of Tbase for calculation of the ICWSI and hence, by substituting
    into Eq. (1), get the dependence of ICWSI on leaf conductance and windspeed. Typical
    results are shown in Fig. 3(a) which was calculated assuming a net radiation of
    200 W m−2, a temperature of 293 K, a leaf characteristic dimension of 0.1 m, a
    maximum conductance (glW) for fully open stomata of 16 mm s−1, and a relative
    humidity of 66%. The dependence on leaf conductance is clearly non-linear with
    the degree of curvature increasing with decreasing windspeed. If instead of referring
    temperatures to that of a surface with open stomata, one refers them to that of
    a wet surface (glW = ∞; i.e. I2), the lines diverge further (Fig. 3(b)), with
    the degree of curvature again being strongly dependent on windspeed. Download

    humidity of 66%, (b) Corresponding variation in I2 calculated from Eq. (9). As
    pointed out above, I3 is somewhat unstable so a more convenient index is provided
    by its reciprocal (Eq. (11)). Fig. 4(a) shows that this index (I4) is linearly
    related to the leaf conductance (glW), while Fig. 4(b) shows that the slope is
    a function only of temperature and the boundary layer conductance (gaH, which
    is defined as the reciprocal of raH). Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    (T; ⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯ = 15°C; – – – = 20°C; =— — — 25°C; ——— ——— = 30°C; ——— = 35°C). Scheduler
    and porometer data were obtained on the runner bean crops on 16 dates in 1995
    and 13 in 1996 to allow testing of the various stress indexes. Some contrasting
    examples taken from days when a good range of stomatal conductances were available
    are shown in Fig. 5 to illustrate how the different indexes perform under typical
    UK conditions. Generally both I2 and I4 showed substantially better relationships
    to measured stomatal conductance than did the ICWSI calculated by the Scheduler.
    There was greatest disparity between methods on cooler days with less sunshine,
    with the Scheduler ICWSI being particularly variable on 4 September 1995 when
    air temperature was between 19 and 21°C and solar radiation between 150 and 400
    W m−2. Similarly 14 August 1996 was much cooler and cloudier (ca. 17.5°C and 200–300
    W m−2) than 19 August (ca. 30°C and 400–800 W m−2). On consistently hot and sunny
    days all methods gave reasonable relationships with measured stomatal conductance
    (data not shown). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Comparisons of ICWSI
    (as calculated by the Scheduler using the built in calibration for grape) (a,

    as (Tdry − Tl)/(Tl − Twet)) (g, h, i) using data for runner beans. Different symbols
    indicate different irrigation treatments. On each occasion the best discrimination
    of stomatal conductance was achieved with I4, which was linearly related to measured
    conductance. The discrimination was especially good at the higher conductances
    (compare Fig. 5(i) and (f)). Note that the indexes often show values in ranges
    not expected from the theory. ICWSI and I2 should be in the range 0–1, while I3
    and I4 should not fall below zero. Values outside these ranges indicate that the
    measured leaf temperature is out of the range defined by the wet and dry references
    used. Such variation is only to be expected as stomata close and Tl approaches
    Tdry. The extreme sensitivity of I3 to observations where leaf temperature exceeds
    the temperature of the dry reference surface are illustrated for the 4 September
    1995 data in Fig. 6(a) (compare with other indexes calculated for the same data
    and shown in Fig. 5(a),(d) and (g), of which all except ICWSI appear more reliable).

    1 : 1 relationship. The different symbols indicate different irrigation treatments.
    Although accurate estimates of the boundary layer resistance corresponding to
    individual infrared readings were not available for the present study, an approximation
    was obtained by assuming that the wind speed estimates at the meteorological station
    approximated the values within the plot and that raH could be calculated from
    Eq. (3)assuming a leaf breadth of 15 cm. As can be seen from Fig. 6(b), these
    estimates of stomatal conductance were of the same order as the values measured
    with the porometer. 4. Discussion Major limitations to the use of infrared thermometry
    as an indicator of stomatal closure and hence as a basis for irrigation scheduling
    have included the sensitivity of leaf temperature to environmental conditions
    (e.g. Walker and Hatfield, 1983) and the small absolute temperature changes that
    occur as stomata close in the more humid environments and low levels of incident
    radiation that are common in more temperate or maritime climates. The purpose
    of the work described here was to provide a method to improve the reliability
    of infrared-based stress indexes in such conditions by reducing the error associated
    with estimation of the necessary values of Tmax and Tmin. The approach was based
    on replacing theoretical estimates of Tmax and Tbase by measured temperatures
    of appropriate reference surfaces. Across a wide range of weather conditions at
    a site in the UK the new indexes were clearly better, or at least equivalent to,
    the original Crop Water Stress Index (Idso et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981;
    Idso, 1982). The results also show that Eq. (11)can even be used to estimate glW
    from IRT measurements, but it requires reliable estimates of the gaH. A number
    of questions arise, however, when one attempts to optimise such an approach. Perhaps
    the most important is the choice of reference surface. Preliminary trials established
    that the typically rapid leaf temperature fluctuations in the runner bean canopy
    at Wellesbourne, ruled out the use of slowly responding physical model reference
    surfaces, leading to the use of real leaves as wet and dry references. Because
    of the localised turbulence structure within crop canopies any reference surfaces
    need to be physically close to the sampled leaves and with similar orientation
    and exposure. Rather than using automatic recording of reference surface temperatures,
    it was found convenient to use the IRT to measure temperatures of `wet'' and `dry''
    reference leaves established within the canopy. Most effective minimisation of
    errors could be achieved by averaging reference temperatures measured immediately
    before and after the sample. Although the ICWSI or any of the other leaf temperature-based
    measures described in this paper can provide a useful indication of the need for
    irrigation, or its timing, they are less well adapted to estimation of the amount
    of irrigation water that is needed. Estimation of amount of irrigation requires
    empirical calibration for different systems. The use of infrared thermometry,
    and the modifications described in the present paper, are therefore most suited
    as a readily portable system for spot measurements in crops as a check for monitoring
    the success of routine soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling schemes. Establishing
    the representative wet and dry reference leaves in the crop that are needed for
    the present approach only takes a few minutes at any site. The availability of
    such a spot check is particularly valuable because calculations of soil water
    balance can be subject to significant cumulative errors (Doorenbos, 1984). It
    is also possible for infrared thermometry-based approaches to be applied to the
    automatic control of trickle irrigation or other irrigation systems where small
    amounts of water are applied frequently. Indeed Wanjara et al. (1992)have described
    an automated trickle irrigation system based on continuous infrared monitoring
    of canopy temperature. The present approach of using reference surfaces could
    potentially improve the reliability of such automated control systems for humid
    environments, though it would probably be necessary to use physical models as
    reference surfaces which would need to be monitored using thermocouples. Our preliminary
    studies indicated that it would be necessary for these reference surfaces to have
    similar time constants to those of real leaves. 5. Concluding remarks The results
    presented above support the concept that the sensitivity of infrared thermometry
    as an indicator of plant stress (acting through changes in stomatal aperture)
    can be improved for humid environments by the use of artificial wet and dry reference
    surfaces and careful choice of the stress index used. The improvement in sensitivity
    arises from a reduction in errors associated with short-term variability of the
    values of Tbase and Tmax which is not accounted for in the usual formulation of
    Idso''s crop water stress index. Reformulation of the energy balance equation
    to derive an index proportional to stomatal conductance was found to be particularly
    stable, and with some further assumptions could be used to estimate stomatal conductance
    directly from infrared thermometry. Acknowledgements I am grateful to the Ministry

    In this paper, we propose developing a system optimally watering agricultural
    crops based on a wireless sensor network. This work aimed to design and develop
    a control system using node sensors in the crop field with data management via
    smartphone and a web application. The three components are hardware, web application,
    and mobile application. The first component was designed and implemented in control
    box hardware connected to collect data on the crops. Soil moisture sensors are
    used to monitor the field, connecting to the control box. The second component
    is a web-based application that was designed and implemented to manipulate the
    details of crop data and field information. This component applied data mining
    to analyze the data for predicting suitable temperature, humidity, and soil moisture
    for optimal future management of crops growth. The final component is mainly used
    to control crop watering through a mobile application in a smartphone. This allows
    either automatic or manual control by the user. The automatic control uses data
    from soil moisture sensors for watering. However, the user can opt for manual
    control of watering the crops in the functional control mode. The system can send
    notifications through LINE API for the LINE application. The system was implemented
    and tested in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province, Thailand. The results showed
    the implementation to be useful in agriculture. The moisture content of the soil
    was maintained appropriately for vegetable growth, reducing costs and increasing
    agricultural productivity. Moreover, this work represents driving agriculture
    through digital innovation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    farmIoTs 1. Introduction Advanced technologies can bring benefits to the majority
    of people. In the recent years, the Internet of Things (IoTs) has begun to play
    a major role in daily lives, extending our perceptions and ability to modify the
    environment around us. Particularly the agro-industrial and environmental fields
    apply IoTs in both diagnostics and control. In addition, it can provide information
    to the final user/consumer about the origin and properties of the product (Talavera
    et al., 2017). Thus, this paper aims to apply IoTs for computer aided optimization
    of agriculture. In such optimization of agriculture, installing a Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) in the field has improved effectiveness and efficiency of the farmers
    (Capello et al., 2016, Fang et al., 2014, Hashim et al., 2015, Kodali et al.,
    2014). It can help evaluate field variables such as soil state, atmospheric conditions,
    and biomass of plants or animals. It can also be used to assess and control variables
    such as temperature, humidity, vibrations, or shocks during product transport
    (Pang et al., 2015). Moreover, WSN can be used to monitor and control factors
    that influence crop growth and yield. They can also be used to determine the optimum
    time to harvest, which farmer is more suitable for what conditions, detect diseases,
    control machinery, etc., (Ndzi et al., 2014). In this study, we focus on data
    consisting of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture in the crop fields. In
    order to develop a proper system, we require data storage and an approach to discover
    knowledge from accumulated data, and interactions with the user. A database system
    will be designed and implemented as a web-based application. The stored data will
    be used for decision making to control automatic watering of crops. The agriculture
    data will be analyzed to optimize and modify the environment around, and to predict
    the water need of crops in the future. As one of the key contributions, this work
    applied data mining to extract the best value from precise measurements with automatic
    computerized devices monitoring crops, land, and climate. Data mining has been
    applied in agriculture to discover knowledge (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Tripathy
    et al., 2014). Association rules approach has been mostly used to discover interesting
    relations between variables in large databases. It helps analyze and establish
    hidden relationships among the attributes of agricultural data, supporting scientific
    decision-making (Tripathy et al., 2014). Thus, this performed agriculture data
    analysis by association rules using the Apriori algorithm in the general rules
    acquisition, while linear regression was applied to model the relationships between
    several input variables and an outcome variable. In addition, this work aimed
    to design and implement a WSN system for sensors in the crop field, along with
    data management interfaced with the user via a smartphone and a web application.
    The proposed system can support mixed crop farming and help farmers that have
    anytime and anywhere connectivity with the system. This article is organized as
    follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 presents the proposed diagnostic
    system, Section 4 shows the agricultural data analysis, Section 5 has results
    and discussion, and finally, Section 6 concludes the article. 2. Related work
    In this section, we discuss relevant prior research pertaining to two aspects.
    The first involves the application of IoTs, while the second aspect focuses on
    agricultural data analysis based on IoTs devices. 2.1. Application of IoTs In
    the recent years, IoTs have been applied in many studies, as surveyed in (Ojha
    et al., 2015, Talavera et al., 2017). The applications of technology in the field
    of agriculture are used to improve crop yields or quality and to reduce costs.
    The application of WSN in precision agriculture assists the farmers in a statistical
    manner, helping them make better and well informed decisions (Fang et al., 2014,
    Kodali et al., 2014). Fang et al. (2014) introduced a novel integrated information
    system (IIS) for regional environmental monitoring and management, based on IoTs,
    for improving the efficiency in complex tasks. The proposed IIS combines IoTs,
    Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics (RS, GIS, and GPS), and e-Science for environmental
    monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its
    ecological responses, which is one of the hottest issues in the scientific world.
    The results showed great benefits from such an IIS, not only in data collection
    supported by the IoTs, but also in web services and applications based on cloud
    computing and e-Science platforms. Effectiveness of monitoring and decision-making
    were obviously improved. In addition, IoTs was applied in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Capello et al., 2016, Medela et al., 2013, Li et al., 2013,
    Ruan and Shi, 2016). Medela et al. (2013) applied IoTs in the agro-industrial
    production chain. They proposed an innovative architecture based on the concept
    of IoTs, combining wireless and distributed specific sensor devices with the simulation
    of climatic conditions, in order to track the evolution of grapes for wineries.
    Li et al. (2013) presented an information system for agriculture based on IoTs,
    with a distributed architecture. In that study, tracking and tracing the whole
    agricultural production process were done with distributed IoTs servers. Moreover,
    an information-discovery system was designed to implement, capture, standardize,
    manage, locate, and query business data from agricultural production. Pang et
    al. (2015) proposed a value-centric business-technology joint design framework
    to provide information to the final user/consumer about the origin and properties
    of the product. Capello et al. (2016) applied IoTs for a real-time monitoring
    service in order to enable the tracing of products from the end consumer back
    to the field. Ruan and Shi (2016) presented an IoTs framework to assess fruit
    freshness in e-commerce deliveries, which was a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation, due to product perishability and
    expensive logistics. Many studies have attempted to improve the functionality
    of IoTs (Hashim et al., 2015, Luan et al., 2015). Diedrichs et al. (2014) presented
    the development of a WSN, based on IEEE-802.15.4, for use in frost characterization
    in precision agriculture by measuring the temperature. Fourati et al. (2014) proposed
    a web-based decision support system communicating with a WSN for irrigation scheduling
    in olive fields. For this purpose, the authors used sensors to measure humidity,
    solar radiation, temperature, and rain. Hashim et al. (2015) reviewed the control
    with an electronic device (Arduino) of temperature and soil moisture, and used
    an Android-based smartphone application for flexibility and functionality. They
    found advantages in low cost and flexibility for agriculture control in contrast
    with expensive components such as high-end personal computers. Luan et al. (2015)
    designed and developed a synthetic system that integrated drought monitoring and
    forecasting and irrigation amount forecasting into a platform based on IoTs, hybrid
    programming, and parallel computing. Kanoun et al., 2014, Kaewmard and Saiyod,
    2014 focused on irrigation systems using WSN for collecting environment data and
    control of the irrigation system via a smartphone. Kaewmard and Saiyod (2014)
    provided a long-term sustainable solution for automation of agriculture to get
    data from vegetable crops, or for environmental measurements. The authors developed
    a portable measurement technology including soil moisture sensor, air humidity
    sensor, and air temperature sensors. Chen et al. (2014) proposed systems for monitoring
    multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland field using WSN to improve
    the water utilization and to collect basic data for research on soil water infiltration
    variations and for intelligent precision irrigation. Li et al. (2012) proposed
    an agricultural greenhouse environmental monitoring system based on IoTs, with
    remote real-time monitoring of environmental information on the greenhouse, combining
    internet, wireless network and mobile network. Furthermore, Lukas et al. (2015)
    designed a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based
    on LoRa transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for
    livestock even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented
    a web service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller
    that updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Sarangi et al. (2016) proposed an agriculture support system based
    on Wisekar to provide automated value-added services that integrate the interoperability
    of an IoTs web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. 2.2. Agriculture
    data analysis The use of IoTs leads to a large-scale or big data that provides
    valuable information. For this reason, many studies have attempted to turn such
    data into useful information and knowledge, as surveyed in (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017). Pahuja et al. (2013) developed an online microclimate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN for gathering and analyzing
    plant related sensor data to provide control of climate, fertilization, irrigation,
    and pests. Tripathy et al. (2014) used data derived from WSN to discover knowledge
    by data mining. This study focused on leaf spot disease assessing the crop-weather-environment-disease
    relations, based on wireless sensors and field level surveillance. A classifier
    was trained to predict the disease. Kehua Xian (2017) proposed a new convenient
    online monitoring system for IoTs, based on cloud computing. After accumulating
    enough data from an agricultural IoTs system, modeling of relevant functional
    requirements was demonstrated to promote the application of large data analysis
    in agriculture. However, only few studies have applied data mining to extract
    useful information and knowledge, so this current work will mine the data from
    IoTs. 3. Research methodology 3.1. The real-situation test area This work will
    demonstrate real installations at 3 points (villages). The three example villages
    are located apart from each other and have differences in farming. The first example
    village has lime cultivation and homegrown vegetables. The second example village
    has a salad farm and homegrown vegetables. The final example village has an integrated
    farming system with salad farm, chicken farm, mushroom farm, and herbal farm.
    The three example villages are represented by the models in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig.

    villages showed that IoTs can be used to support and help farmers with any type
    of agriculture. Moreover, the farmers can spend the time saved on other activities
    for increased income. The real-time information from IoTs devices in each village
    was used to control on-off switching of water sprinklers, automatically. Initially,
    we collected IoTs information for 5 months (170 days) and performed yield analysis
    with these data. The obtained IoTs information consists of temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture, and was collected every 20 min, but for analysis the daily
    averages were used. Moreover, recorded the yields of lime cultivation and homegrown
    vegetables to determine relationships between IoTs information and the agricultural
    products. 3.2. Design and overview of the system This work aims to design and
    implement systems with sensors in the crop field and data management by using
    a smartphone with web application. The three components are hardware, web application,
    and mobile application, as shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image

    Referring to Fig. 4, the first component was designed and developed in control
    box form. This control box is designed to control the IoTs devices and obtain
    data from the crops. The control box and IoTs devices used in this work are shown
    in Table 1. Table 1. Deployment parameters. Parameter Value Voltage nodeMCU –

    is the web-based application. This component involves managing the real-time information
    from IoTs devices in each village. The web-based application allows an administrator
    to manipulate the conditions for water need of each crop. In addition, the details
    of information from IoTs devices can be viewed by an administrator to manage each
    kind of agriculture. These data were analyzed to predict the water need of crops
    in the future. The web-based application to manipulate IoTs data from each installation

    show the process with web-based and mobile application. The final component was
    used by farmer on a mobile phone. The mobile application was designed to control
    watering after the data had been analyzed. The mobile application provided two
    modes, such that farmers can control watering manually, or the proposed system
    can automatically turn on/off watering based on IoTs information, as shown in
    Fig. 5. We summarize the formal mechanisms in the proposed system with the system
    architecture shown in Fig. 6. This system architecture consists of 3 parts i.e.
    environmental data acquisition layer, data and communication layer, and application
    layer. The environmental data acquisition layer is designed to collect data on
    environmental factors from the sensors and device control. The next layer transports
    all of the gathered sensor data to collect it into a server. The application layer
    uses the accumulated data to monitor and control the crop and for data management.

    Fig. 6. The architecture of the control system. 3.3. Implementation The proposed
    system is implemented with three parts i.e. control box, web-based application,
    and mobile application. The control box keeps electronic devices in a waterproof
    box, as shown in Fig. 7. The control box could be located anywhere in farm or
    near the farm, having the soil moisture sensors, solenoid valve, DHT22 sensor,
    and an ultrasonic sensor connected to the control box. In this study, IoTs is
    applied to the soil moisture sensors to measure the humidity of crop soil and
    to control switching on-and-off water sprinklers automatically. The solenoid valve
    was used to control water flow with on/off action. The DHT22 sensor was used to
    control the humidity of mushroom farm. Ultrasonic sensor was applied to measure
    the level of water in the chicken farm. Download : Download high-res image (493KB)

    The second part is a web-based application that gets agriculture information from
    NodeMCU. It accesses the internet via WiFi connection. The web-based application
    was implemented to manage agricultural plots and to manage watering of crop, or
    to analyze what is suitable watering. Fig. 8 provides an example web page presenting
    the water need and IoTs information from each installation. Moreover, this part
    involves the agriculture data analysis that is explained in Section 4. Download

    The final part was implemented in order to interface with the farmer. The mobile
    application is used to control on-off switching of the electrical system by the
    farmer. This application has 2 modes; automatic and manual. The automatic system
    was activated when IoTs devices were detected with defined values of field sensors
    without user input. The farmer can take over the control and turn the water on
    or off with the mobile application. Fig. 9 is an example of the mobile application
    to control watering. The main functions of the application are monitoring watering,
    set-up of crop details in each plot, and notifications via LINE application. Download

    Data mining was applied to extract important and useful knowledge from large data
    on crops, obtained with IoTs. The knowledge discovery processes are discussed
    in (Han and Kamber, 2006). Data mining refers to extracting knowledge from large
    amounts of data. This paper divides data mining into 4 steps as follows. 1. Data
    pre-processing: This is an important step in the knowledge discovery process,
    because the quality of knowledge depends on the quality of data. In the real world,
    data tend to be dirty, incomplete, and inconsistent. Thus, this step can help
    improve the accuracy and efficiency of the subsequent mining. This step includes
    data cleaning, data integration, and data transformation. This work used the large
    amounts of data from IoTs devices on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture,
    to predict yields, and data for the first example village are shown in Fig. 10.
    We converted the IoTs information to discrete format in order to support data
    modeling. Download : Download high-res image (160KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. IoT information and products from the first example village. 2.
    Data reduction: This step can encode the data to a smaller reduced representation.
    The integrity of the original data was preserved in order that mining the reduced
    data should be more efficient yet produce the same (or almost the same) analysis
    results. This work used numerosity reduction, where nonparametric methods for
    storing reduced representations of the data include histograms. We used equal-width
    histograms with uniform width buckets and 3 buckets for low, middle, and high
    level. 3. Data modeling/discovery: This step extracts knowledge from the prepared
    data. Mostly, data modeling/discovery applies intelligent methods to identify
    patterns in the data. The analysis tools can include classification, clustering,
    association, and so on. Association rules are the data mining technique applied
    in this work. Association rules are if/then statements that help discover relationships
    between subjectively unrelated agriculture data. They were used to find relationships
    among temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, as well as yields of lemons and
    homegrown vegetables. There are two basic criteria that association rules use,
    support and confidence, and they represent relationships and rules as frequently
    true if/then patterns. In this work the minimum support was 0.75 and confidence
    was better than 90%. The Apriori algorithm available in Weka 3.6.9 (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
    was used to extract association rules from data. In addition, we applied linear
    regression to model the relationship between several input variables and an outcome
    variable. The model type is shown in Eq. (1), (1) ∊ where y is the outcome variable,
    are the input variables, for , is the value of y when each equals zero, is the
    change in y based on a unit change in for , and ∊ is a random error term that
    represents the difference in the linear model and a particular observed value
    for y. The outcome variables are products of lime cultivation and homegrown vegetables
    (each has its own model), while the input variables are temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture. The R environment was used to fit the models at 95% confidence
    level, shown in Eqs. (2), (3) for products of lime cultivation ( ) and for homegrown
    vegetables ( ), respectively, (2) (3) 4. Solution analysis: This step involved
    an analysis of the results from data modeling/discovery. The solution in our work
    will be discussed with the real implementation. 5. Results and discussion The
    proposed system can use IoT devices to collect data on humidity derived from the
    DHT22 sensor, soil moisture derived from soil moisture sensor, and temperature
    derived from web service of the Thai Meteorological Department Homepage (https://www.tmd.go.th/).
    This information can be displayed on a mobile device to the farmer, and is used
    by automatic on/off control of watering. Moreover, the farmer can manually turn
    on/off the watering. The functional status of on-off switching and time stamps
    can be notified via LINE Application. Further, an administrator can manipulate
    the obtained IoTs information and control the data from each installation. The
    admin can also mine the data to discover knowledge. This knowledge is applied
    to optimize the farming by season. From data modeling/discovery, the knowledge
    results showed that if the product of homegrown vegetables is high (more than
    4 kg./day) and lime cultivation is high (more than 6 kg./day) then the temperature
    will middle level (between C and C), and if the product of lime cultivation is
    high (more than 6 kg./day) then the humidity will middle level (between 72% and
    81%). The knowledge discovery from real data is illustrated in Fig. 11. We found
    that the knowledge discovery represented the real data well. Download : Download

    of IoT information with productivity. From an economic perspective, this proposed
    system was considered an investment because of its low cost of approximately 93.27
    US Dollars per field. We focused on the first example village. The lime cultivation
    productivity improvement indicates payback within 2 months. In addition, the increased
    productivity means that the farmer can spend more time on other tasks. In addition,
    this study has been carried out in a mixed crop environment with three example
    villages. Each village had different crops and purposes of agriculture. Knowledge
    discovery can be applied to suggest a control strategy for watering when the farmer
    would like to have mixed crops. 6. Conclusion IoTs was applied in agriculture
    to improve crop yields, improve quality, and reduce costs. For these reasons,
    we proposed WSNs application to watering crops, in this paper. We designed and
    implemented a system to control environmental factors in the crop fields. The
    system had the three parts hardware, web application, and mobile application.
    The first part was designed and implemented in control box form. This control
    box included hardware and electronic control system to connect to sensors and
    obtain data on crops. The control box was designed for real-life testing. The
    implemented design connected to and received IoT information from any field in
    this study. The second part was the web-based application designed and implemented
    to manipulate details of crop data and field information. In this step, large-scale
    data from IoT is stored and utilized in data analysis. As one key contribution,
    this work applied data mining by association rules to discover useful information
    on effects of environment and climate. The results showed that suitable temperature
    for high productivity of homegrown vegetables and lemons was between C and C.
    Moreover, suitable humidity for high productivity of lemons was within 72–81%.
    The final part was to control the crop watering with a mobile application on a
    smartphone. This allowed for both automatic and manual functional control to the
    user. The user can use the automatic function based on data from soil moisture
    sensors for watering. However, manual control was possible in the functional control
    mode. The system sent notifications through LINE API of the LINE application.
    The developed system was installed in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province,
    Thailand. The results showed clear benefits to agriculture. The moisture content
    in the soil was appropriately controlled for the vegetables, reducing costs and
    increasing agricultural productivity. This case study shows high potential for
    digital technology applications in agriculture. Acknowledgments The authors are

    and content Abstract Prior to the discussion on approaches to combine irrigation
    scheduling and water application practices, several farm irrigation performance
    indicators are defined and analysed. These indicators concern the uniformity of
    water distribution along an irrigated field and the efficiency of on-farm water
    application. Then, the analysis focus is on three main irrigation systems: surface,
    sprinkler and microirrigation. For each of these systems, the analysis concerns
    the main characteristics and constraints of the systems, more relevant aspects
    influencing irrigation performances, and approaches which could lead to a more
    appropriate coupling of irrigation scheduling and water application methods. Conclusions
    point out on the need for combined improvements in irrigation scheduling and methods,
    for expanding field evaluation of irrigation in farmers fields, for improved design
    of on-farm systems, and for quality control of irrigation equipments and design.

    1. Introduction Irrigation scheduling is the farmers'' decision process related
    to `when'' to irrigate and `how much'' water to apply to a crop. The irrigation
    method concerns `how'' that desired water depth is applied to the field. Irrigation
    scheduling requires knowledge on crop water requirements and yield responses to
    water, the constraints specific to each irrigation method and irrigation equipment,
    the limitations relative to the water supply system and the financial and economic
    implications of the irrigation practice (Heermann, 1996). To improve the irrigation
    method requires the consideration of the factors influencing the hydraulic processes,
    the water infiltration and the uniformity of water application to the entire field
    (Hlavek, 1992). The consideration of all these aspects makes irrigation management
    a complex decision making and field practice process. Research has made available
    a large number of irrigation scheduling tools including procedures to compute
    crop water requirements, to simulate the soil water balance, to estimate the impact
    of water deficits on yields and to estimate the economic returns of irrigation.
    However, irrigation scheduling is not yet utilised by the majority of farmers.
    Furthermore, only limited irrigation scheduling information is utilised worldwide
    by irrigation system managers, extensionists or farmer advisers. However, it is
    recognised that the adoption of appropriate irrigation scheduling practices could
    lead to increased yields and greater profit for farmers, significant water savings,
    reduced environmental impacts of irrigation and improved sustainability of irrigated
    agriculture (Smith et al., 1996). Enormous progress has been achieved in modernizing
    irrigation methods. This includes numerous equipments and automation tools, field
    evaluation techniques and models for design and analysis. However, with limited
    exceptions, developments concerning the irrigation methods and irrigation scheduling
    are not combined to the desirable extent. Consequently, there is a need to better
    identify the factors that could enhance the adoption of appropriate irrigation
    management practices and favour the transfer of technology from research to practice.
    These aspects are particularly important in that they concern the inter-relationships
    between on-farm irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling (Pereira, 1996b),
    and involved two related disciplines: irrigation engineering and agronomy. This
    paper aims at discussing those questions and, particularly, some approaches which
    could contribute to the achievement of higher irrigation performances when combined
    improvements on irrigation methods and irrigation scheduling are considered. 2.
    Irrigation performances 2.1. Uniformity Several parameters are used as indicators
    of the uniformity of water application to a field. Most commonly used (Heermann
    et al., 1990) are given below. 2.1.1. Distribution uniformity The distribution
    uniformity, DU (%), defined by the ratio (1) where Zlq is the average infiltrated
    depth in the low quarter of the field (mm), and Zav the average infiltrated depth
    in the entire field (mm). The infiltrated depths are replaced by the observed
    applied depths in sprinkler irrigation, and by the observed emitter discharges
    in trickle irrigation. Distribution uniformity is often named emission uniformity
    in trickle irrigation. Some authors prefer to replace the low quarter averages
    in the numerator by the minimum observed depth. This indicator then becomes the
    absolute distribution uniformity (DUabs). 2.1.2. Coefficient of uniformity The
    coefficient of uniformity, CU (%), introduced by Christiansen (1942)and, defined
    as (2) where X are the absolute deviations of application depths observations
    from the mean (mm), m is the mean of observed depths (mm), and n is the number
    of observations. This indicator is more often utilized in sprinkler irrigation.
    When it concerns surface irrigation, then the application depths are replaced
    by infiltrated depths and, in trickle irrigation, by the observed emitter discharges.
    The approximated relationship between DU and CU is (Keller and Bliesner, 1990)
    (3) or (4) The parameter CU relates with the standard deviation (SD) and the mean
    (m) of the individual observations (Hart and Reynolds, 1965) by (5) which can
    be rearranged to give (6) Hart and Reynolds (1965)adopted a normal distribution
    of applied depths over a field, with mean m and standard deviation SD (Eq. (6)),
    to design the average depth D (mm) to be applied in sprinkler irrigation when
    a pa percentage of the field should be adequately irrigated. More recently, Keller
    and Bliesner (1990)assumed a similar but more evoluted design strategy, relating
    uniformity with efficiency, as analysed further under sub-heading 3.2.2. With
    the same objective, several distribution functions are analysed by Seginer (1987).
    A uniform distribution was adopted by Mantovani et al. (1995)to derive yield-water
    relations as influenced by uniformity of water application and water prices. A
    normal distribution was utilized by de Juan et al. (1996)and Tarjuelo et al. (1996)to
    optimize irrigation strategies under sprinkler irrigation. However, these approaches
    utilize a different concept, based on the deficit coefficient (Cd) developed by
    Losada et al. (1990). 2.1.3. Statistical uniformity coefficient The statistical
    uniformity coefficient, Us (%), defined as (7) where Vq is the coefficient of
    variation of emitter flow, Sq is the SD of emitter flow (1 h−1) and qa is the
    average emitter flow rate (1 h−1). Bralts et al. (1987)adopted Us for design and
    defined Vq from the geometric mean of the coefficients of variation relative to
    emitters clogging, manufacturing variation and pressure variation. 2.2. Efficiency
    The concept of efficiency is not well established despite it is utilized worldwide.
    Reviews on various efficiency terms are provided by Heermann et al. (1990), Wolters
    (1992)and Bos et al. (1994). The classical definition of irrigation efficiency
    proposed by Israelsen (1932)is the ratio between the irrigation water consumed
    by the crops of an irrigated farm or project during crop growth and the water
    diverted from a river or other natural source into farms or project canals during
    the same time. Jensen (1996)considers that term `efficiency'' inappropriate and
    cause of misinterpretation, and proposes to rename the above term as a consumptive
    use coefficient. This allows a better understanding of the terms water consumption
    – which includes evaporation, transpiration or embodiment in a product – and water
    use, which involves both consumptive and nonconsumptive components. Along these
    lines are the `fraction'' indicators recently proposed by Allen et al. (1997).
    Jensen (1996)proposes that the term efficiency be restricted to output/input ratios
    of the same nature, like the ration diverted/delivered water volumes or applied/infiltrated
    water depths. In both cases it is possible to identify which is the non-consumed
    fraction that can be recovered or reused for agriculture or other purposes. The
    combination of the terms water use and efficiency should be restricted to the
    term water use efficiency (WUE), which represents the ratio between a water output
    and the corresponding water input (Steduto, 1996). The review by this author clearly
    distinguishes the photosynthetic WUE, the biomass WUE and the yield WUE. These
    concepts apply to a plant or a crop and are not specifically related to irrigation.
    Considering what said above, the efficiency terms utilized in on-farm irrigation
    are the following: 2.2.1. Application efficiency The application efficiency, ea
    (%), defined as (8) where Zr is the average depth of water added to the root zone
    storage (mm) and D is the average depth of water applied to the field (mm). Zr
    must be limited to Zr ≤ SWD everywhere in the field, SWD being the soil water
    deficit (mm) in the root zone at time of irrigation. When this condition is respected
    ea reflects the impacts of overirrigation. This indicator takes into consideration
    the tailwater runoff and deep percolation. These nonconsumptive components are
    particularly important in surface irrigation, where two other indicators can be
    used (Walker and Skogerboe, 1987): the deep percolation ratio (DPR) between the
    volume of water percolated below the root zone and the volume of water applied
    to the field, and the tailwater runoff ratio (TWR) between the volume of surface
    runoff and the volume of water applied to the field. 2.2.2. Application efficiency
    of low quarter The application efficiency of low quarter, AELQ (%), defined by
    Merriam and Keller (1978)as (9) where Zr,lq is the average low quarter depth of
    water added to root zone storage (mm) and D is the average depth of water applied
    (mm). As for ea, the condition Zr,lq ≤ SWD is also applied. The fact that Zr in
    Eq. (8)is replaced by Zr,lq allows to take into consideration the non uniformity
    of water application when underirrigation is practised. Both ea and AELQ are utilized
    for surface, sprinkler and trickle irrigation. 2.2.3. Potential efficiency of
    the low quarter The potential efficiency of the low quarter, PELQ (%), which can
    be used for design and corresponds to the system performance under good management,
    when the desired depth and timing are applied (Merriam and Keller, 1978). The
    PELQ can be given by (10) where Zlq,MAD is the average low quarter depth infiltrated
    (mm) when equal to MAD, DMAD is the average depth of water applied (mm) when SWD
    = MAD, and MAD is the management allowed deficit (mm). MAD may be selected according
    the crop and the environmental conditions (Martin et al., 1990), or adopting more
    sophisticated approaches including optimization models (de Juan et al., 1996;
    Tarjuelo et al., 1996). 3. Relating irrigation scheduling with the irrigation
    methods 3.1. Surface irrigation 3.1.1. Surface irrigation systems Surface irrigation
    is the most common irrigation method worldwide. There are several types of surface
    systems: basin, furrow, border, contour ditches and water spreading. The latter
    two are primarily used to irrigate pasture lands and have little interest. This
    analysis concerns basin, furrow and border irrigation systems. 3.1.1.1. Basin
    irrigation Water is applied to levelled surface units (basins) which have complete
    perimeter dikes to prevent runoff and to allow infiltration after cutoff. The
    best performance is obtained when advance time is minimised by using large non-erosive
    discharges and the basin surface is precision levelled. This method is the most
    commonly practised worldwide, both for rice and other field crops including orchard
    tree crops. In general, basins are small and uneven and water application is manually
    controlled. Level-basin irrigation using large laser-levelled units with automated
    or semi-automatic control is practised in few areas in developed countries. 3.1.1.2.
    Furrow irrigation Water is applied to furrows using small discharges to favour
    water infiltration while advancing down the field. Fields must have a mild slope
    and inflow discharges must be such that advance is not too fast and produce excessive
    runoff losses, nor too slow to induce excessive infiltration in the upper part
    of the field. Short blocked furrows with manually controlled water applications
    are practised by traditional irrigators. Long and precisely levelled furrows with
    automated or semi-automated control have become increasingly popular in developed
    countries. 3.1.1.3. Border irrigation Water is applied to short or long strips
    of land diked on both sides and open at the downstream end. Irrigation takes place
    by allowing the flow to advance and infiltrate along the border. Smaller inflow
    discharges and longer time duration of application are utilized in graded fields
    to reduce downstream losses, like for furrow irrigation. Larger inflow rates are
    utilised when the field slope is very small with management becoming similar to
    that of basins. Likewise basin irrigation, automated water control is often applied.
    Two types of systems can be considered under the perspective of irrigation scheduling
    practices: 3.1.1.4. Traditional systems The water control is carried out manually
    according to the ability of the irrigator. In small basins or borders and in short
    furrows, a common practice is that in which the irrigator cuts off the supply
    when the advance is completed. Because the fields are often uneven and the discharges
    are variable and largely unknown, this practice induces large variations in the
    volumes of water applied in each irrigation. It is, therefore, extremely difficult
    to control `how much'' water is applied and overirrigation often occurs. 3.1.1.5.
    Modernised systems In these systems some form of control of discharge such as
    siphons, gated pipes, lay-flat tubes or gates and/or some form of automation including
    surge flow valves, cablegation or automated canal gates is used. The fields are
    often precision levelled, while the advance and supply times and the inflow rate
    can be measured or estimated. Thus, in these systems it is possible to control
    `how much'' water should be applied at a given irrigation. 3.1.2. Issues on irrigation
    performances The distribution uniformity (Eq. (1)) is the result of several designs
    and management variables that characterise a surface irrigation event. Functionally,
    it can be described as: (11) where qin is the inflow rate to the furrow or per
    unit width of the border or basin, L is the length of the furrow, border, or basin,
    n is the roughness coefficient, So is the longitudinal slope of the field, Ic
    represents the intake characteristics of the soil, Fa represents the furrow, border,
    or basin sectional form, and tco is the time of cut-off. The application efficiency
    (Eq. (8)or Eq. (9)) also depends on several design and management variables, and
    these can be expressed functionally as follows: (12) where SWD is the soil water
    deficit at time of irrigation. All other variables as defined above. These functions
    show that the application efficiency is a function of both the distribution uniformity
    and the irrigation scheduling. The latter controls the value of the soil water
    deficit at the time of irrigation, SWD. During the last decades, research provided
    many advances in technology and management aiming at modernizing surface irrigation
    as recently reviewed (Pereira, 1996a). Advances include land levelling, equipment
    for water supply and automation, and soil management (Sousa et al., 1995; Humpherys,
    1997; Trout et al., 1990). However, these improvements mostly help to control
    the variables which determine DU (Eq. (11)). Improving ea (Eq. (12)) requires
    the appropriate irrigation scheduling techniques be also applied. Field evaluations
    play a fundamental role in improving surface irrigation systems. They provide
    the information required for design, model validation, and mainly for advising
    irrigators on how to improve their systems and management practices. Field observations
    required for conducting a system evaluation include: • Inflow and outflow volumes,
    • irrigation times/phases, particularly advance and recession, • soil moisture
    before and after irrigation, • the slope/topography of the field being irrigated,
    and • the management rules currently utilised by the irrigator. To estimate the
    infiltrated depths required for computing the uniformity and efficiency indicators,
    field data from evaluation can be utilised to derive the infiltration parameters
    for a Kostiakov type infiltration model (Walker and Skogerboe, 1987). The estimation
    of the infiltration parameters and the roughness coefficient n from field data
    has also been achieved through the solution of the inverse surface irrigation
    problem (Katapodes et al., 1990). Using field data on advance, recession, inflow
    rates, field length and slope, the infiltration and roughness parameters are calculated
    iteratively by coupling a hydraulic model and optimisation procedures (Malano
    et al., 1996). 3.1.3. Field implementation of irrigation scheduling Most of surface
    irrigated areas are supplied from collective irrigation canal systems. Farm irrigation
    scheduling depends upon the delivery schedule, e.g., rate, duration and frequency,
    which are dictated by the system operational policies. Discharge and duration
    impose constraints to the volume of application, and frequency determines the
    timing of irrigation. In general, surface irrigation delivery systems are rigid
    and often the time interval between successive deliveries is too long. Irrigators
    tend to compensate for this by applying all the water they are entitled to use.
    For deep-rooted crops and soils without excessive permeability this strategy can
    be appropriate; however, for shallow-rooted crops and/or soils with small water
    holding capacity, percolation losses can be substantial and crops may become highly
    stressed by waterlogging. Under rigid delivery schedules it is extremely difficult,
    both to modernize the irrigation methods and to implement irrigation scheduling
    programs. In the case of modernised surface systems, the adoption of improved
    irrigation scheduling methods should go, and it often goes together with the improved
    operation of the delivery system to allow more flexibility in selecting the appropriate
    inflow rates and supply time (Goussard, 1996). Substantial improvement can be
    achieved if delivery is made by an arranged delivery schedule, which normally
    requires a certain notice time between the demand of water by the farmer and the
    time of supply. This can be achieved more easily when users are in control of
    the distribution. Farm surface irrigation systems that rely on large irrigation
    depths and large irrigation intervals have enough flexibility to accommodate a
    demand lag time of 2 or 3 days without inducing severe water stress for most crops.
    This could favour the adoption of arranged delivery schedules. In general, it
    is difficult to apply small irrigation depths by surface irrigation. Smaller depths
    may be applied in basin irrigation provided that the land is precision levelled
    and the discharge rate is sufficiently large to obtain a very fast advance. In
    furrow irrigation, this may be also difficult because the time of cutoff is often
    larger than the advance to provide for sufficient intake opportunity time. This
    implies that surface irrigation applications are usually large, which makes this
    method more suitable for situations where the SWD and the MAD are relatively large.
    Under these circumstances scheduling can be simplified when adopting simple irrigation
    calendars (Hill and Allen, 1996), These are also advantageous for collective system
    management and for introducing improved tools for controlling the discharge rates
    at farm level. However, it is desirable that volumes delivered be known: irrigators
    should have control on the discharge rate and duration. An example of development
    of irrigation scheduling calendars for basin irrigation with identification of
    constraints imposed by the irrigation method is presented by Liu et al. (1997).
    Another irrigation scheduling option is provided by the use of irrigation scheduling
    simulation models to perform the soil water balance using soil, crop and meteorological
    data, and providing information on the soil moisture status. Numerous examples
    of such models are available in the literature, namely through the ICID Workshops
    (Pereira et al., 1992, Pereira et al., 1995). However, the use of models in real
    time require not only validation but a support advisory service and training of
    irrigation extensionists, managers and/or farmers (Smith et al., 1996). The use
    of soil water monitoring devices generally is more appropriate for large fields
    and crops that may economically justify the costs of purchase and operation. Normally,
    the use of these techniques requires the selection of an irrigation threshold
    corresponding to the MAD. Observations of the SWD have to be regularly performed
    in time and space to allow the prediction of the irrigation date, when SWD = MAD.
    A further degree of sophistication can be achieved by combining soil water balance
    simulation with soil moisture observations. This can be done in two ways: (a)
    soil moisture information is used to validate the model predictions, and (b) continuous
    soil moisture and meteorological monitoring are coupled in a model for forward
    prediction of the soil water status. An example of the latter approach is presented
    by Malano et al., 1996. 3.2. Sprinkler irrigation 3.2.1. Sprinkler irrigation
    systems Sprinkler irrigation systems are normally used under more favourable operational
    conditions than surface systems because farmers may control the discharge rates,
    duration and frequency. Many sprinkler systems have independent water supply or
    are connected to networks which may be operated on demand. However, the pressure
    from the hydrants or farm pumps is often not appropriate resulting in lower (or
    higher) discharges than those envisaged during the design phase. Pressure head
    (and discharge) variations at the hydrant should be identified by the user when
    appropriate equipment is available. Different types of sprinkler systems can be
    considered in relation to irrigation scheduling: • Solid set systems. Sprinklers
    irrigate in a fixed position. There are no limitations in the duration of the
    set time. Thus, they can be utilised to apply small depths and frequent watering
    (not suitable for the movable systems because of operational constraints) or large
    depths and large irrigation intervals (less appropriate when very low application
    rates are required). • Travelling guns, hose-reel or hose-pull. These systems
    apply irrigation depths ranging from 15 to 40 mm. They are not suitable for applying
    very small or large depths mainly because of limitations in their system and capacity.
    • Continuous move laterals. These systems are well adapted to apply small and
    frequent irrigations . The hydraulic design of sprinkler irrigation is generally
    well understood. The overall sprinkler design process is however complicated since
    it requires the best combination of the following (see Keller and Bliesner, 1990):
    • system layout and application rate (is) according to soil infiltration and climate
    characteristics; • pressure (P), nozzle diameter (dn), sprinklers discharge (qs)
    and wetted diameter (Dw); • spacings between sprinklers and/or laterals, or towpaths
    of travelling guns, which relate to the application rate and wind conditions;
    • sprinkler characteristics, including the coarseness of drops and the water distribution
    pattern, in relation to soil and climate conditions. The most common design criteria
    for sprinkler laterals is that sprinkler discharge (qs) should not vary by more
    than 10% between the points of highest and lowest pressure in the system. However,
    this condition is often not achieved in practice. Dubalen (1993)reports that in
    France, 56% of solid set systems evaluated showed a pressure variation higher
    than 20%. Consequences of pressure and discharge variations in a pressurized irrigation
    system operating at demand can be dramatic, during peak demand periods with the
    pressure dropping to unacceptable values (Lamaddalena, 1997). Under these circumstances,
    depths applied decrease drastically when the duration of the irrigation is not
    adjusted (Tizaoui et al., 1997). In the case of direct supply by a farm pumping
    system, the pressure can also be lower (or higher) than expected due to design
    shortcomings or lack of maintenance. When appropriate measurement devices are
    installed, these problems can be identified and either the set time or the travelling
    speed can be corrected according to the actual discharge. Many sprinkler systems
    have not been properly designed, not being operated according to design rules,
    or their operation is hampered by poor maintenance. This results in inadequate
    pressures and discharges along the system. Unfortunately, these problems are frequent.
    In France, as reported by Dubalen (1993), the actual application depths deviate
    by more than 20% from the designed ones in 46% of travelling guns and 34% for
    solid set systems. This indicates that the main limitation to irrigation scheduling
    is that most farmers do not know the discharges delivered by their systems and
    are only in control of the duration. In many cases they may be only in control
    of the frequency of irrigations. 3.2.2. Issues on irrigation performances The
    distribution uniformity DU (Eq. (1)) is determined by several design variables
    and can be functionally expressed by the following relation: (13) where P is the
    pressure available at the sprinkler, ΔP is the variation of the pressure in the
    operating set or along the moving lateral, S represents the spacings of the sprinklers
    along the lateral (and between laterals) or the spacings between travellers, dn
    is the nozzle diameter, which influences the discharge qs and wetted diameter
    Dw (and the coarseness of water drops) for a given P, WDP represents the water
    distribution pattern of the sprinkler, and WS represents wind speed and direction.
    All the above variables are set at the design stage (including a forecasted WS).
    However, less appropriate spacings often occur in practice: excessive spacing
    occurs in 65% of travelling guns and 70% of solid set systems evaluated in France
    (Dubalen, 1993). Spacings greatly influence DU. The application efficiency ea
    (Eq. (8)or Eq. (9)) depends not only on the design but on management variables
    and can be functionally described by: (14) where besides variables defined above,
    Ic represents the intake characteristics of the soil, is is the application rate
    of the sprinkler, ti is the duration of the irrigation event, and SWD is the soil
    water deficit before the irrigation event. Most of the parameters in Eq. (14)are
    controlled by the designer. However, the pressure P depends on the functioning
    of the pressurized supply system. The duration of the application, ti, and SWD
    are management variables controlled by the irrigator. Hence, likewise surface
    irrigation, the application efficiency depends upon the application uniformity
    and the irrigation scheduling. Keller and Bliesner (1990), following Hart and
    Reynolds (1965), propose an interesting methodology relating uniformity and efficiency
    to decide the depth of water to be applied. They define the distribution efficiency
    DEpa (%), for the target percentage, pa, of field area adequately irrigated: (15)
    where pa is the percentage of the field area receiving a net irrigation depth
    not lower than the target depth, and CU is the coefficient of uniformity (Eq.
    (2)) (%). CU may be computed from actual observations in the field or from simulating
    the overlap of sprinkler water distribution patterns at the design phase (Tizaoui
    et al., 1997). DEpa allows the calculation of the design application efficiency,
    Epa (%), for the same percentage pa of the area adequately irrigated, given by
    (16) where Re is the effective portion (0.1–1.0) of water applied, i.e., after
    estimating the losses by evaporation and wind drift (computed from the reference
    evapotranspiration, windspeed and coarseness of water drops), and Oe is the effective
    portion (0.9–1.0) of water discharged, i.e., after estimating the losses by leakage
    (see Keller and Bliesner, 1990). The gross application depth D (mm) is then calculated
    from the net depth Dn (mm) required to satisfy the crop demand and the efficiency
    Epa (17) This procedure is very useful to adjust the application depths to the
    characteristics of the system and, at the design phase, it provides for more realistic
    approaches by anticipating the performances which are likely to occur in practice.
    3.2.3. Field implementation of irrigation scheduling Overall, in sprinkle irrigation
    the task of the irrigator to manage the system is made easier than in surface
    irrigation but performance is largely dependent on the system design. Therefore,
    quality control of design, equipment and services are very important in supporting
    farmers operations. For set systems and travelling guns, the MAD is commonly smaller
    than for surface irrigation. The methods for irrigation scheduling that can be
    used are the same as for surface irrigation: (a) water balance simulation models,
    (b) monitoring the soil water status and (c) a combination of both. The observation
    of the SWD requires more accuracy when irrigation depths are small and the frequency
    of irrigations is higher. In areas with a large number of small farmers, the use
    of simple irrigation scheduling calendars may be more appropriate. The successful
    use of a simulation model through a videotel system for advising farmers within
    a large irrigation project has been recently reported by Giannerini (1995). Other
    approaches are discussed in Smith et al. (1996). When frequent irrigations are
    applied, the error in estimating the SWD may be too large relative to depths to
    be applied. This is the case for daily irrigations with centre pivot laterals.
    Thus, other scheduling strategies based on the replacement of the volume of water
    consumed during the precedent irrigation interval must be applied. For centre
    pivots, special irrigation scheduling models have been developed, which often
    associate modules for water application, fertigation, chemigation and energy management.
    An illustration is model SCHED (Buchleiter, 1995). 3.3. Microirrigation irrigation
    3.3.1. Microirrigation systems Microirrigation systems are set systems that use
    a variety of low discharge emitters to apply water to the field. Systems for tree
    crops have several emitters per tree, depending on the wetted area, hydraulic
    properties of the soil, emitters discharge and emitters wetting pattern, which
    varies with the type of emitter. There are several types of emitters: drippers,
    microsprayers, spinners and bublers. For row crops, a lateral supplies water for
    each one or two crop rows when drippers are utilised. Underground perforated pipes
    have also become popular. For tree crops, microsprayers are mostly utilized. Emitters
    discharge, qe (1 h−1), relates to the pressure P (kPa) through the following relation:
    (18) where x is the characteristic exponent of the emitter, and K is the discharge
    coefficient of the emitter. The parameter x varies from near x = 0, for self compensating
    emitters, upto x = 1 for laminar flow emitters. Most commonly x values vary from
    0.4 to 0.55. Self compensating emitters are used to minimise discharge variations
    along very long laterals or in sloping fields. The design of microirrigation systems
    involves the appropriate combination of: • pressure P, discharge qe, and emitter
    characteristic exponent x; • percent area wetted; • emitter type and spacings;
    • emitter susceptibility to clogging, ability to cleaning and to compensate variations
    in temperature; • type of filters, their location and cleaning capability; • equipments
    for application of fertilisers and chemicals, • control of pressure and/or flow,
    and location of respective devices in the system, • automation facilities. To
    achieve this, the designer must know the irrigation requirement of the crop duration
    and frequency of irrigations (including fertigation/chemigation requirements).
    Hence, design and irrigation scheduling processes are intertwined. Performance
    is highly dependent on the quality of design and equipment selected. 3.3.2. Issues
    on irrigation performances The distribution uniformity, DU (Eq. (1)), is determined
    by a combination of design parameters which can be functionally expressed as follows:
    (19) where P is the pressure at emitters, ΔP is the variation in pressure along
    the system, x is the characteristic exponent of the emitter, Ec represents emitter
    characteristics related to variations in discharge, Cv is the coefficient of manufacturing
    variation for the emitter (which is also a function of the number of emitters
    per plant), and FI stand for the filtering capabilities of the system. As for
    sprinkler systems, the irrigator has very little control on the uniformity performance
    of the system except for the standard of maintenance of the system. As with surface
    and sprinkler irrigation systems, the application efficiency, ea (Eq. (8)or Eq.
    (9)), is determined by the combination of design and management variables as indicated
    in the following functional relation: (20) where, besides variables defined above,
    Ks is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, SW stands for soil water conditions
    before irrigation, ti is the duration of the irrigation, and Δti are the time
    intervals between irrigations. The irrigator''s control is basically reduced to
    the timing of irrigation and the volumes and frequency of applications. Thus,
    to achieve good performance in microirrigation, good support to farmers for quality
    control of equipment, services and design is required. Field evaluations of systems
    under operation can play a fundamental role in improving performance. Field evaluations
    reveal that performances are often below the potential ones (Pitts et al., 1996).
    The most useful performance indicators for microirrigation field evaluations are
    the statistical uniformity coefficient, Us (Eq. (7)), and the distribution uniformity,
    DU (Eq. (1)). For design purposes, also two performance parameters are widely
    used, the emission uniformity and Us. The emission uniformity, EU (%), is defined
    (ASAE, 1997; Keller and Bliesner, 1990) by where Cv is the coefficient of manufacturing
    variation for the emitter, N is the number of emitters per tree (N = 1 for row
    crops), qn is the minimum emission rate (1 h−1) corresponding to the minimum pressure
    in the system, and qa is the average (or design) emission rate (1 h−1). The EU
    allows to anticipate the potential uniformity of the system, and to compute the
    seasonal irrigation efficiency, Es (%) (Keller and Bliesner, 1990), defined as
    (22) where Tr is the seasonal transmission ratio (1.0–1.35) representing the extrawater
    applied to offset the unavoidable deep percolation on a seasonal basis, and LR
    is the leaching requirement fraction (0.0–0.3). At its limit, Es equals EU. The
    parameters Es is an appropriate estimate of AELQ (Eq. (9)) at the design stage.
    3.3.3. Field implementation of irrigation scheduling Farmers adopting microirrigation
    systems are in control of flow rate, duration and frequency of irrigations. However,
    likewise sprinkler systems, they may not be aware of the discharge when pressure
    variations occur in the supply system (Lamaddalena, 1997). Problems also arise
    when systems are not properly designed. These problems can be lessen when self
    compensating emitters are utilised. Most of the problems derive from inappropriate
    design and selection of equipment. These unfavourable conditions are often related
    to the fact that farmers are induced to adopt microirrigation systems to save
    water, without appropriate technical support, Microirrigation systems may use
    less water when application losses are minimized, but they should not be designed
    or managed for saving water. They should be managed to supply the water as required
    by the crops with high frequency. Trickle irrigation systems are normally used
    for frequent or very frequent applications, daily or twice a week. Under intensive
    horticultural production, more than one application per day may be necessary.
    Larger irrigation intervals of few days are appropriate for deep-rooted orchard
    trees and vines. Irrigation scheduling can be based on crop indicators or soil
    water status. Videotel or Irritel systems, as well as other forms of water balance
    models are also appropriate (Smith et al., 1996). For very frequent waterings,
    the irrigation, and fertigation strategies must be integrated, and are commonly
    based on the daily crop requirements. 4. Conclusions Two main performance criteria
    are considered, one relative to uniformity of water distribution in the irrigated
    field, the second concerning the water application efficiency. Several indicators
    can be used for both. Its selection mainly depends on the objectives for their
    use. The usefulness of such parameters could be improved when they would be applied
    either to support farmers advices, either for irrigation systems design. Uniformity
    indicators can be utilized to better decide on irrigation depths to be applied,
    namely in relation to the percentage area of the irrigated field which should
    receive a target depth. However, for surface irrigation further developments are
    required. Progress is expected by using uniformity indicators in relation to yield
    and to economic factors which allow to optimize water allocation and the definition
    of irrigation strategies. The relationships between uniformity and efficiency
    may lead to further practical applications. The use of appropriate simulation
    models may also play an important role to select the irrigation practices which
    lead to improved performances. For sprinkler and trickle irrigation, it has been
    shown that design efficiencies can be computed from uniformity indicators. Adopting
    this approach in the design practice could lead to improved design, more appropriately
    oriented for management of on-farm systems. The importance of the quality of design
    and, thus, of quality control of design should be stressed. Field evaluations
    should expand and be used as a common practice to support improvements of on-farm
    irrigation management by farmers. Their results should also be used to improve
    systems design and to help the quality control of equipments and services. Efforts
    from irrigation engineers to improve the irrigation systems are often hampered
    by the irrigation scheduling practices being applied. These definitely influence
    the application efficiency. Efforts to adopt better irrigation scheduling practices
    often find serious limitations due either to the delivery scheduling being applied,
    either to the practical limits to apply the desirable irrigation depth in the
    field practice. Under these circumstances, it is advisable that research (and
    extension) adopt a coupled approach to the water application practice and the
    irrigation scheduling decisions. Engineering and agronomic competences must be
    combined. References Allen et al., 1997 Allen, R.G., Willardson, L.S., Frederiksen,

    and content Highlights • Sensor positioning and accuracy effect on irrigation
    efficiency is investigated. • A mathematical model incorporating a system-dependent
    boundary condition is used. • Soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy considerably
    affect irrigation efficiency. • Models are efficient tools for irrigation scheduling
    characteristics investigation. Abstract Recent advances in electromagnetic sensor
    technologies have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art
    soil moisture sensing devices. However, many of the available guidelines for sensor
    placement were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments.
    Sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting irrigation efficiency.
    This study investigates how soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may
    affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling
    systems under various conditions. For this purpose several numerical experiments
    were carried out using a mathematical model, incorporating a system-dependent
    boundary condition in order to simulate soil moisture based irrigation scheduling
    systems. The results of this study provided clear evidence that soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation efficiency
    in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. In specific cases the
    effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was as high as 16%; however, when
    nearby sensor positions were examined, the observed differences were generally
    low. The effect of sensors accuracy was even clearer. For the lower sensor''s
    error level studied (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) the effect on irrigation efficiency ranged
    between 2.5% and 6.4%, while for the higher error level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3) the effect
    ranged between 10.2% and 18.7%. These results highlight the importance of a detailed
    study taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation, and
    scheduling systems as well as soil moisture sensors in order to provide a sound
    basis for improved irrigation scheduling. The need for soil specific calibration
    of the sensors used in such systems is highlighted as well. Lastly, a significant
    outcome of this study is the ability of computer models to serve as efficient
    tools for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning and accuracy, or other
    automated scheduling system characteristics. Previous article in issue Next article

    sensors 1. Introduction Water conservation in agriculture has recently received
    much attention in the light of increasing competition for fresh water resources
    between the various users, especially in semi-arid and arid regions facing limited
    water availability and at the same time increased water needs. Among the most
    promising current strategies to increase irrigation water use efficiency is the
    use of drip irrigation systems, which facilitate water management due to the highly
    localized application of water and nutrients, and the improvement of irrigation
    scheduling, i.e. by applying the right amount of water to cropland at the right
    time over the growing season. Even though drip irrigation can be proven much more
    efficient than other irrigation systems since only the root zone of the cropped
    area is irrigated, improper management may lead to waste of water or leaching
    of soluble chemicals such as nitrate (Dukes et al., 2007, Zotarelli et al., 2011).
    However, efficient irrigation management is challenging, due to the many factors
    that should be considered, including climate, crop type, irrigation method, and
    system parameters (Dabach et al., 2013). The goal of irrigation scheduling is
    to make the most efficient use of water and energy by applying the right amount
    of water to cropland at the right time and in the right place, making sure water
    is available when the crop needs it (Tam, 2006). Scheduling maximizes irrigation
    efficiency by minimizing runoff and percolation losses. Proper irrigation management
    requires a sound basis for making irrigation decisions. Methods of irrigation
    scheduling can be classified as static or dynamic. According to the static approach
    the total amount of water for irrigation is allocated without specifying its temporal
    distribution along the growing season. By contrast, in the dynamic approach irrigation
    water is allocated at specific time steps along the growing season in order to
    achieve optimal soil water content conditions in the root zone at every growth
    stage (Shani and Dudley, 2001, Shani et al., 2004). Irrigation scheduling is normally
    based on environmental measurements such as evapotranspiration and soil water
    content or on monitoring plant stress. Many researchers have investigated the
    automation of irrigation systems and the use of soil moisture sensing devices
    such as tensiometers, gypsum blocks, granular matrix sensors (GMS), and electromagnetic
    (EM) sensors. An automated irrigation scheduling system generally consists of
    soil moisture or matric head sensing devises, a control system, and the irrigation
    system components (Dukes and Scholberg, 2005). The use of switching tensiometers
    to automatically control irrigation events has been studied among others by Smajstrla
    and Koo (1986), Clark et al. (1994), Torre-Neto et al. (2000). In most of these
    studies, significant water savings were reported without a negative effect on
    crop yield. However, the use of tensiometers to initiate irrigation is associated
    with several problems, such as entrapped air in the tensiometers, organic growth
    on the ceramic cups, and need for recalibration (Smajstrla and Koo, 1986, Dukes
    and Scholberg, 2005). GMS require less maintenance and can be more easily integrated
    in automated irrigation systems. However, they are very sensitive in soil salinity
    and they often need recalibration. Muñoz-Carpena et al. (2005) found that GMS-based
    irrigation behaved erratically. The above issues of the available matric head
    sensing devises limited the extensive use of automated irrigation scheduling systems.
    Recent advances in EM sensor technology, including their ability to be easily
    automated and the lower cost of recently developed capacitance and frequency EM
    sensors, have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art
    soil moisture sensing devices (Blonquist et al., 2006). Several studies investigated
    the use of EM sensors in novel automated irrigation management applications (Blonquist
    et al., 2006, Coates et al., 2006, Dukes et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2009, Kim and
    Evans, 2009, Miralles-Crespo and van Iersel, 2011). In these studies significant
    water savings in comparison with traditional irrigation scheduling approaches,
    as high as 60%, were reported. However, a still unanswered question is how sensor
    positioning and accuracy may affect irrigation efficiency in soil moisture based
    automated irrigation scheduling systems. The wetting profile in the root zone
    of irrigated crops is dynamic and influenced by crop and irrigation system parameters
    such as soil hydraulic properties, irrigation system characteristics (e.g. emitter
    flow rate), root length and structure, and even mulch type when mulches are used.
    Especially in the case of drip irrigation, the non-uniform water distribution
    patterns about drippers make soil water sensor placement a key factor in the performance
    of soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling schemes (Coelho and Or, 1996).
    More specifically, poor sensor positioning that is not representative of the soil
    moisture conditions in the root zone can result either in crop water stress, or
    in over-irrigation that negates the water saving capabilities of soil moisture
    scheduling (Stieber and Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005,
    Wang et al., 2012). However, many of the available guidelines for sensor placement
    were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. Soil moisture
    sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting the efficiency of
    soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems. Several recent studies
    on the performance of new electrical capacitance and frequency EM sensors extensively
    discuss issues of sensor-to-sensor variability and sensor accuracy (e.g. Seyfried
    and Murdock, 2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons and
    Bandaranayake, 2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). Regarding the sensor-to-sensor
    variability, variations as high as 0.04 cm3 cm−3 are being reported. In most cases
    the sensors accuracy when the factory calibration equations are used ranges between
    0.03 cm3 cm−3 and 0.04 cm3 cm−3. However, using soil specific calibration the
    accuracy can be significantly improved, reaching 0.01 cm3 cm−3 or even better.
    It should be noted that the above general figures may vary among the various sensors
    technologies and models. One of the most important aspects of studying soil moisture
    based drip irrigation scheduling schemes in the case of drip irrigation systems,
    is the determination of the soil moisture patterns formed under the emitter. Wetting
    patterns can be obtained either experimentally, which are case specific, or by
    simulation using suitable mathematical models. In most of these models, the Richards
    equation is used to simulate soil water matric potential or water content distribution
    during drip irrigation. Both numerical and analytical methods are used to solve
    the Richards flow equation (Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Several analytical solutions
    have been developed for the linearized form of the flow equation (Lomen and Warrick,
    1974, Warrick and Lomen, 1976, Ben-Asher et al., 1978). Chen et al. (2009) obtained
    a series of closed-form analytical solutions for the water content distribution
    during trickle irrigation under either a single line source flux or multiple line
    sources. However, the application of analytical solutions is limited given the
    various assumptions needed (Coelho and Or, 1996). Therefore, numerical simulation
    models are used more often to analyze soil water dynamics under surface drip irrigation
    (e.g. Šimůnek et al., 1999, Vrugt et al., 2001, Elmaloglou and Malamos, 2005,
    Šimůnek et al., 2006, Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos, 2008a, Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos,
    2008b, Diamantopoulos and Elmaloglou, 2012, Elmaloglou et al., 2013, Elmaloglou
    and Soulis, 2013). In a recent study Dabach et al. (2013) investigated irrigation
    scheduling by combining the results of HYDRUS 2D/3D simulations with experimental
    data for the case of matric head triggered drip irrigation systems in order to
    optimize their main operational parameters, i.e. irrigation thresholds and water
    amounts. In their study the merits of using numerical simulation models in studying
    sensor based irrigation management were highlighted as well. In this context the
    main objective of this study is to investigate how soil moisture sensors positioning
    and accuracy may affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation
    scheduling systems under various conditions (soil types, potential evapotranspiration
    rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths, drip line spacing). For this purpose
    several numerical experiments were carried out using a mathematical model, which
    incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve, evaporation from
    the soil surface, and water extraction by roots (Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos,
    2008a, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Furthermore, a system-dependent boundary condition
    was implemented into the mathematical model considering changing conditions in
    specific locations of the flow domain in order to simulate soil moisture based
    automated drip irrigation scheduling systems. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. The
    mathematical model In order to study how soil moisture sensor positioning and
    accuracy affects the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation
    scheduling systems, the soil moisture patterns formed under the emitters for various
    conditions and various configurations of the studied system were determined using
    the mathematical model presented by Elmaloglou et al. (2013), which simulates
    soil water dynamics under surface drip irrigation from equidistance line sources.
    This mathematical model incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve, evaporation from the soil surface, and water extraction by roots. Furthermore,
    due to the fact that the code of the model was developed in-house, it was possible
    to implement a system-dependent boundary condition considering changing conditions
    in specific locations of the flow domain, which correspond to the soil moisture
    sensors positions. In this manner it was made possible to simulate the operation
    of an automated soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling system for several
    irrigation cycles. In Fig. 1a graphical representation of the three-dimensional
    physical model is illustrated. As it can be seen, surface drip irrigation is applied
    from horizontal line sources, of width 2x0. In the same figure, the laterals spacing,
    which in this study was selected equal to 60 cm and 80 cm, the crop rows, and
    the two-dimensional spatial distribution of the active root zone, are also shown.
    The width of the plant root system is minimal on the surface and increases with
    depth up to 20 cm, where it acquires its maximum width. Then the width is reduced
    up to 60 cm, which is equal to the root zone depth. The spatial distribution of
    the active root zone was selected to represent a normal rooting pattern for various
    crops suited by drip irrigation systems (e.g. beans, tomato, potato, cucumber,
    and other vegetable crops) (FAO, 1989, FAO, 1998, Machado and Oliveira, 2005).

    the rectangle ABFE (b). This figure was created based on the corresponding figure
    presented by Elmaloglou et al. (2013). The plane flow symmetry allows for the
    physical model to be examined in one of the infinite vertical planes, which are
    perpendicular to the length of the line sources, and are determined from the x
    and z axes. In Fig. 1b, the discretization of the computational domain, which
    corresponds to the rectangle ABFE of Fig. 1a, is illustrated. The space steps
    Δx, Δz that were used for the numerical solution of the mathematical model were
    taken equal to 2 cm. The phenomenon of hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve is incorporated in the mathematical model with the simplification made by
    Kool and Parker (1987) for the empirical model of Scott et al. (1983). More specifically,
    it was assumed that αd = αw/2, where aw and ad are the values of the a parameter
    in the relationship of van Genuchten (1980) for the main wetting and drying curve,
    as proposed by Kool and Parker (1987). Lastly, the mathematical model was successfully
    validated against an existing analytical solution and the Hydrus 2D numerical
    model as described in detail by Elmaloglou et al. (2013). 2.2. Simulation inputs
    In this study, the cases of two homogenous soil profiles consisting of loamy sand
    (LS) and silt (Si), respectively, were examined. The hydraulic properties of these
    soils were taken from the Rosetta database (Schaap and Leij, 1998). The soil hydraulic
    properties are modeled using the van Genuchten–Mualem constitutive relationships
    (Mualem, 1976, van Genuchten, 1980) as follows: (1) and (2) where Θs is the saturated
    water content (L3 L−3); Θr is the residual water content (L3 L−3); Ks is the saturated
    hydraulic conductivity (L T−1); and α (L−1), n (−), and m (−) are shape parameters.
    The Se is the effective saturation (dimensionless) (0 < Se < 1). The values of
    the parameters included in the van Genuchten equations are summarized in Table
    1. The unique K(Θ) relation for each soil type always follows from the parameter
    set (n, Θs, Θr, Ks) according to Eq. (2) (Kroes et al., 2008). The values of the
    initial volumetric water content Θi are 0.164 cm3 cm−3 for the loamy sand and
    0.198 cm3 cm−3 for the silt soil, respectively. The above values were chosen so
    that for time t = 0, both soils had the same value of effective saturation (Se
    = 33.7%). This Se value corresponds to initial hydraulic conductivity values small
    enough to minimize redistribution due to gravity. The corresponding pressure head
    values (−120 cm for the loamy sand and −756 cm for the silt soil) are well above
    the wilting point and are not related to significant crop water stress (water
    stress response according to Feddes et al. (1978), a(H) ≈ 1). More details can
    be found in Elmaloglou et al. (2013). Table 1. Values of the shape parameter (n),

    Dabach et al. (2013) demonstrated the effect of irrigation thresholds on the irrigation
    efficiency of matric head triggered irrigation systems. Therefore, test simulations
    with different Se values were also performed. These tests provided similar results,
    at least as related to the effect of sensor positioning and accuracy, which are
    the main topics of this study. The potential evapotranspiration rate at any time
    point (mm h−1) , is calculated by distributing the daily potential evapotranspiration
    (mm day−1) over a 24-h period (Vellidis and Smajstrla, 1992). A sinusoidal type
    distribution is used: (3) where is the period of the cycle (h), in this case 24
    h, and is the current time on the 24-h clock minus the beginning time of the cycle
    (h). Early in the growing season, soil evaporation is the highest part of the
    total evapotranspiration, but it gradually decreases as the plants grow and the
    canopy closes. However, even under a fully closed canopy, some soil evaporation
    occurs. In fully developed crops, transpiration is the dominant part of the total
    evapotranspiration, ranging between 80% and 90% of the latter (Bufon et al., 2012).
    The actual transpiration rate of a given crop is influenced by many factors, including
    crop type, soil and plant management practices, irrigation regime, climatic conditions,
    plant growth stage, plant genetic characteristics, leaf orientation, leaf age,
    etc. Accordingly, the daily potential evapotranspiration was partitioned into
    daily potential evaporation and daily potential transpiration , so that the ratio
    have a value around 0.14, which corresponds to average real conditions for a fully
    developed crop in semi-arid regions. In this study, two different potential evapotranspiration
    rates were investigated. The higher rate was selected to be equal to 8.4 mm day−1,
    which is an acceptable value for a fully developed crop in the dry period and
    in semi-arid regions. The lower value was selected to be equal to 4.2 mm day−1
    in order to test the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy
    under intermediate conditions in comparison to the more extreme case of the higher
    potential evapotranspiration rate. 2.3. Numerical experiments As it was previously
    stated, recent progress in EM sensor technology promoted the broader application
    of automated irrigation scheduling using soil moisture sensing devices (Blonquist
    et al., 2006). Considering also the problems of matric head sensors that limited
    the wider application of automated irrigation scheduling up to now (Smajstrla
    and Koo, 1986, Dukes and Scholberg, 2005, Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005), the case
    of soil moisture based automated irrigation scheduling is examined in this study.
    Furthermore, soil moisture triggered drip irrigation systems can be more consistently
    modelled through the implementation of a system-dependent boundary condition when
    hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve is considered. In the case of
    matric head triggered drip irrigation systems the triggering matric head value
    corresponds to different soil moisture values in the drying and the wetting curves
    due to the phenomenon of hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve, thus
    complicating the modelling of such systems. Soil water distribution under drip
    irrigation is mainly affected by the hydraulic properties of the soil, the drip
    lines discharge rate, the irrigation depth, the drip lines spacing and the root
    water uptake spatial and temporal distribution. As it was already mentioned above,
    two soil types (loamy sand and silt) and two potential evapotranspiration rates
    (8.4 and 4.2 mm day−1) were investigated. Furthermore, the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy was investigated for two discharge rates (2 and
    4 l m−1 h−1), for two irrigation depths (30 and 40 mm), and for two laterals spacings
    (60 cm and 80 cm). Usually, soil moisture sensing devices were used to initiate
    a preset timed irrigation event; therefore, the irrigation event was stopped after
    a preprogrammed irrigation time (corresponding to a specific irrigation depth)
    rather than after specific soil moisture conditions were met (Phene and Howell,
    1984, Smajstrla and Koo, 1986, Clark et al., 1994, Torre-Neto et al., 2000, Dukes
    and Scholberg, 2005). For the above combinations corresponding to various conditions
    and irrigation system configurations, the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning
    was investigated by simulating the operation of an automated soil moisture based
    scheduling system and by calculating the corresponding irrigation efficiency for
    different sensor positions. The simulated sensor positions are illustrated in
    Fig. 1a. The various positions were selected to represent a wide range of possible
    sensor placement options including the most commonly used practices (Stieber and
    Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2012). As
    it was already mentioned, soil moisture sensors accuracy may also be an important
    factor affecting the efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling
    systems. Therefore, in order to investigate the magnitude of sensors accuracy
    impact a final set of numerical experiments was carried out. In these numerical
    experiments two levels of sensor errors were examined. A higher error level was
    selected equal to ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 so as to correspond to the accuracy of most EM
    sensors using the factory calibration equations under normal conditions, while
    the lower error level was selected equal to ±0.01 cm3 cm−3 so as to correspond
    to the accuracy of most EM sensors using the soil specific calibration equations
    (Seyfried and Murdock, 2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons
    and Bandaranayake, 2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). In this approach the previously
    described combinations of conditions and irrigation system configurations were
    simulated supposing a systematic error of +0.03, −0.03, +0.01, and −0.01 cm3 cm−3.
    In total more than 200 numerical experiments were carried out. The main combinations
    investigated are presented in Table 2. Table 2. The main simulated cases for the
    investigated characteristics in the performed numerical experiments. Characteristic

    investigated, a period corresponding to eight irrigation cycles was simulated
    in order to diminish the influence of the initial conditions on the result obtained.
    The length of each irrigation cycle varied according to the various conditions
    (soil types, potential evapotranspiration rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths,
    drip line spacings) and the various sensor positions and accuracy values simulated
    and it ranged between 72 h and 120 h for = 8.4 mm day−1 and between 140 h and
    232 h for = 4.2 mm day−1. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Suitable sensor positions
    The main parameters characterizing irrigation performance such as deep percolation,
    irrigation efficiency in terms of actual transpiration, and actual evaporation
    were calculated for each case investigated. In this process the variation of soil
    moisture below 60 cm plus the water drained out from the bottom boundary are considered
    as deep percolation. Furthermore, the irrigation efficiency is defined as the
    ratio of the depth of irrigation water that is beneficially used by the plants
    to the depth of irrigation water applied (On Farm Irrigation Committee, 1978,
    Irmak et al., 2011). The main results of the numerical experiments considering
    the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1 and the high drip line
    discharge rate of 4 l m−1 h−1 are presented in Table 3, however, the following
    analysis is based on the results of all the numerical experiments described in
    Table 2. As it was expected, irrigation efficiency varies considerably according
    to the drip line spacing, the irrigation depth, and the soil type. More specifically,
    irrigation efficiency increases with decreasing drip line spacing (the observed
    difference ranges between about 2.7% and 8.8%) and with decreasing irrigation
    depth (the observed difference ranges between about 1.4% and 9.7%). As it can
    be also observed irrigation efficiency is lower for the coarse soil (loamy sand)
    in all cases studied due to the higher deep percolation losses. The above results
    are in agreement with results presented in other similar studies e.g. (Khan et
    al., 1996, Cote et al., 2003, Li et al., 2003, Souza and Matsura, 2003, Elmaloglou
    and Diamantopoulos, 2010, Selim et al., 2012, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Furthermore,
    the observed differences in irrigation efficiency are more significant for the
    case of the coarse soil (loamy sand). By contrast, drip line discharge rate was
    found to have a limited effect on irrigation efficiency, therefore, only the results
    considering the high drip line discharge rate are presented in Table 3. Considering
    the main question of this study, which is related to the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning on irrigation efficiency, a notable variation of irrigation
    efficiency among the various positions investigated was observed. In many cases,
    this variation was greater than the variation among the various irrigation system
    configurations. As an example, the irrigation efficiency related to the various
    sensor positions in the case of the loamy sand soil, the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 60 cm drip line spacing ranged between
    89.7% (sensor position X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) and 73% (sensor position X = 1 cm,
    Z = 30 cm), while the irrigation efficiency related to the various irrigation
    system configurations for the loamy sand soil and for the more suitable sensor
    position (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) ranged between 89.7% and 77.9%. The corresponding
    irrigation efficiency values for the case of the silt soil ranged between 93.7%
    and 78.7% and 93.7% and 86.4%, respectively. This observation highlights the importance
    of the proper positioning of the soil moisture sensors driving automated irrigation
    scheduling systems. However, when nearby sensor positions are examined, the observed
    differences are lower and in some cases they are negligible. Table 3. Sensor positions

    rate of 4 l m−1 h−1 and the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1.

    so as to be compatible. The irrigation efficiency variations observed among the
    investigated sensor positions noticeably vary among the irrigation system configurations
    and soil types studied. In order to quantify this variability, the standard deviations
    of the irrigation efficiencies corresponding to the various sensor positions for
    each irrigation system configuration and soil type were calculated (Table 3).
    The calculated standard deviations ranged from 5.8% for the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the loamy sand soil, for both drip line spacings
    to 2.8% for the 2 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 40 mm irrigation depth, for 60
    cm drip line spacing, for both soils. The higher standard deviations are observed
    in the case of the coarse soil (loamy sand) and especially for the case of the
    higher discharge rate. These observations may be attributed to the variation of
    the representativeness of the sensor readings according to its position, which
    is examined in more detail in the next section. Furthermore, higher standard deviations
    are related to conditions favoring the vertical movement of the wetting front
    through the soil profile e.g. coarse soils (Khan et al., 1996, Cote et al., 2003,
    Li et al., 2003, Souza and Matsura, 2003, Elmaloglou and Malamos, 2005, Elmaloglou
    and Diamantopoulos, 2010, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Besides the above mentioned
    irrigation efficiency variability among the various cases studied, it was observed
    that the most suitable position was 11 cm from the drip line and 10 cm below the
    soil surface (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) in all cases studied. Generally, sensor positions
    20 cm from the soil surface or deeper are related to noticeably lower irrigation
    efficiencies. When the sensors are positioned more deeply in the soil profile
    soil evaporation is reduced; however, this reduction cannot balance the increased
    deep percolation values due to increased soil water content values at the lower
    part of the root zone (Table 3), leading to more frequent irrigations. A characteristic
    example is presented in Fig. 2, where the soil water content spatial distribution
    patterns for a shallower (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) and a deeper (X = 11 cm, Z = 30
    cm) sensor position for the case of the loamy sand soil, the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 60 cm drip line spacing, in three representative
    times (last irrigation cycle, ti = end of irrigation, tend just before irrigation,
    tmid in-between time) are illustrated. Furthermore, it was observed that sensor
    positions directly under the emitters are also linked to lower efficiencies (Table
    3). It should be noted that in tests carried out for positions further away from
    the drip line or deeper in the soil profile than the positions presented here,
    irrigation efficiency drops considerably. Download : Download full-size image

    h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 60 cm drip line spacing, and
    the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1 in three representative
    times (last irrigation cycle, ti = end of irrigation, tend just before irrigation,
    tmid in-between time). The main conclusions obtained for the lower potential evapotranspiration
    rate of 4.2 mm day−1 were similar to that of the higher potential evapotranspiration
    rate analyzed above. However, irrigation efficiencies are generally lower in all
    cases due to higher deep percolation losses. As it was expected, soil evaporation
    is reduced due to the lower potential evapotranspiration rate; however these reductions
    are generally low. Finally, noticeable irrigation efficiency variations between
    the investigated sensor positions are still present, but the calculated standard
    deviation values are lower. 3.2. Representative sensor positions At a second step
    of analysis, it was investigated how soil moisture sensors positioning influences
    the representativeness of their readings regarding to the average soil water content
    in the root zone. In this analysis the readings of hypothetical soil moisture
    sensors located in several positions in the root zone were compared with the corresponding
    average soil water content in the root zone. The results obtained for the case
    of the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 80 cm drip
    line spacing for both soils studied and for both ETp rates are presented in Table
    4. As it can be clearly seen in this table, there is a considerable variability
    in the sensors’ representativeness according to their positioning. In the same
    table it can be seen that sensors’ representativeness may vary according to the
    soil hydraulic properties or the meteorological conditions. Additional numerical
    experiments data indicated that sensors’ representativeness may also vary according
    to the irrigation system configuration. This is an important finding as it highlights
    the significance of proper soil moisture sensors positioning according to each
    application''s requirements. This information could be proven valuable in irrigation
    management or in other applications requiring the monitoring of soil water content.
    The ability of computer models to serve as an efficient tool for the detailed
    investigation of sensors positioning schemes is a significant outcome as well.

    between the same hypothetical soil moisture sensors with the corresponding average
    soil water content in the root zone for the case of the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate, and the 60 cm drip
    line spacing for both studied soils is provided in Fig. 3. As it can be observed,
    in the case of loamy sand soil the most representative position was 11 cm from
    the drip line and 30 cm below the soil surface (X = 11 cm, Z = 30 cm). As it can
    be also observed, the readings of shallower sensor positions are characterized
    by steep rises and drops as they are influenced more directly by the soil surface
    conditions (irrigation, evapotranspiration), while conditions at the readings
    of deeper sensor positions are generally smoother. A similar behavior can be observed
    for the case of silt soil; however, in this case the most representative position
    was between the positions located 1 cm from the drip line and 20 cm below the
    soil surface and 11 cm from the drip line and 30 cm below the soil surface. Taking
    also into account the results for both soils presented in Table 4, it can be presumed
    that in conditions favoring slower water movement in the soil profile (e.g. finer
    soils or more uniform soil water content patterns) the most representative sensor
    positions are located nearer to the soil surface and to the plane of symmetry
    AE defined by the emitter (Fig. 1). A general observation considering the above
    results and the results regarding irrigation efficiency presented in the previous
    section is that in some cases the most representative sensor position is not necessarily
    linked to the best irrigation efficiency. As it was described in the previous
    section, deeper sensor positions are related to increased soil water content values
    at the lower part of the root zone. Therefore, in some cases that deep percolation
    is the most significant loss, the best irrigation efficiency is achieved for sensor
    positions a little higher than the most representative sensor position. On the
    other hand, irrigation efficiency is not the only decision parameter. As an example,
    crop stress as well as excessive irrigation may cause yield decreases relative
    to optimum irrigation amounts. Therefore, more representative sensor readings
    facilitate irrigation management as they provide more accurate information about
    the average conditions at the root zone. This observation highlights the complexity
    of the studied issue and the need for a detailed investigation for each particular
    application considering the specific conditions (e.g. soil, crop, irrigation system
    characteristics) and in relation to the applied irrigation management practices.

    4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate,
    and the 60 cm drip line spacing, for (a) the loamy sand soil, and (b) the silt
    soil (Only the last irrigation cycle is presented). In practice a great variety
    of soil moisture sensor types with different characteristics (e.g. volume of influence,
    measurement range, accuracy) and configurations (e.g. number of sensors, placement)
    are used (Stieber and Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005,
    Dukes et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012,
    Miller et al., 2014). However, the above results highlight the need for a more
    detailed study for each specific case. Numerical modelling can be proven an additional
    valuable tool in this effort. 3.3. Sensor accuracy In order to investigate the
    sensors accuracy effect on the efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation
    scheduling systems a set of numerical experiments was carried out assuming two
    levels of sensor errors as it was described in Section 2.3. The obtained results
    concerning the lower error level (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) indicated that there is a noticeable
    but generally limited effect. More specifically, the effect of this error level
    on irrigation efficiency ranged between 4.5% and 6.4% for the loamy sand soil
    and between 2.5% and 4.5% for the silt soil for the cases investigated. Similar
    results were obtained for the deep percolation and the evaporation losses. By
    contrast, more significant effects were observed in the case of the higher error
    level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3). More specifically, in the numerical experiments where
    the sensors underestimated soil water content by 0.03 cm3 cm−3 (i.e. the actual
    soil water contents were 0.03 cm3 cm−3 higher than the sensor readings), irrigation
    efficiency decrease varied between 15.7% and 18.7% for the loamy sand soil and
    between 10.2% and 12.9% for the silt soil for the cases investigated. On the contrary,
    in the numerical experiments where the sensors overestimated soil water content
    by 0.03 cm3 cm−3 (i.e. the actual soil water contents were 0.03 cm3 cm−3 lower
    than the sensor readings) deep percolation and soil evaporation losses dropped
    due to the lower soil water content values in the soil profile with positive results
    on irrigation efficiency. However, in this case, crop stress increased considerably
    (actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration ratios dropped) having
    as a possible effect serious crop production losses. Likewise, excessive irrigation
    may as well cause yield decreases relative to optimum irrigation amounts (Locascio
    et al., 1989, Sezen et al., 2006, Ngouajio et al., 2007). As an example, the soil
    water content spatial distribution patterns at the end of the final irrigation
    cycle for the case of the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 40 mm irrigation depth,
    the 60 cm drip line spacing, and the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate, for both soils studied
    are presented in Fig. 4 supposing a systematic error of +0.02 cm3 cm−3 (the actual
    soil water contents are 0.02 cm3 cm−3 higher than the sensor readings) and −0.02
    cm3 cm−3 (the actual soil water contents are 0.02 cm3 cm−3 lower than the sensor
    readings), which lies in-between the examined cases, in comparison to the standard
    case (no error). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Illustration of the

    sand soil, and (b) the silt soil, supposing a systematic error of +0.02 cm3 cm−3
    and −0.02 cm3 cm−3 in comparison to the standard case (no error). It should be
    noted that error levels of about ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 are generally optimistic for many
    EM sensors using the factory calibration equations under normal conditions and
    in specific cases it may even be as high as ±0.05 cm3 cm−3 (Seyfried and Murdock,
    2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons and Bandaranayake,
    2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). Therefore, taking also into consideration the
    above results, it can be concluded that soil specific calibration of the EM sensors
    used in soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems is a fundamental
    requirement. 4. Summary and conclusions In this study the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy on the performance of soil moisture based surface
    drip irrigation scheduling systems under various conditions (soil types, potential
    evapotranspiration rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths) was investigated
    using a mathematical model, which incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve, evaporation from the soil surface, and water extraction by roots. The use
    of a custom-made mathematical model allows the comparison of the obtained results
    with those of other similar models. Therefore, more reliable conclusions about
    important design and operation parameters of drip irrigation systems can be made.
    In addition, there is increased flexibility in the approach of the various irrigation
    problems due to the fact that the code of the model was developed in-house and
    therefore there is possibility for further development including the implementation
    of a system-dependent boundary condition into the mathematical model considering
    changing conditions in specific locations of the flow domain in order to be able
    to simulate soil moisture sensors based drip irrigation scheduling and to achieve
    the main goals of this study. The model was successfully validated against an
    existing analytical solution and the state of the art Hydrus 2D numerical model.
    The effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was investigated by simulating
    the operation of an automated soil moisture based scheduling system for a coarser
    and a finer soil, for a high and a low potential evapotranspiration rate, for
    two discharge rates, and for two irrigation depths. Furthermore, the effect of
    sensors accuracy was investigated for the same combinations of conditions and
    irrigation system configurations for two sensors accuracy levels. The results
    of the numerical experiments considering the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning
    on irrigation efficiency indicate that in many cases irrigation efficiency varies
    considerably among the different positions investigated. Furthermore, it was observed
    that in many cases, this variation was greater than the variation among the various
    irrigation system configurations. However, the observed irrigation efficiency
    variations for the investigated sensor positions noticeably differ for the irrigation
    system configurations and soil types studied. Generally, it was found that higher
    variations were related to conditions favoring the vertical movement of the wetting
    front through the soil profile. The above conclusions were valid for both potential
    evapotranspiration rates studied. However, irrigation efficiencies were generally
    lower in the case of the low potential evapotranspiration rate due to higher deep
    percolation losses. Furthermore, noticeable irrigation efficiency variations among
    the investigated sensor positions were observed for both potential evapotranspiration
    rates, but the variability is lower in the case of the low potential evapotranspiration
    rate. The above results highlight the significance of the proper positioning of
    the soil moisture sensors driving automated irrigation scheduling systems. Besides
    the above mentioned irrigation efficiency variability among the various cases
    studied, it was observed that the most suitable position was 11 cm from the drip
    line and 10 cm below the soil surface. Generally, sensor positions 20 cm from
    the soil surface or deeper were related to noticeably lower irrigation efficiencies.
    However, it should be noted that when nearby sensor positions were examined, the
    observed differences were generally low and in some cases negligible. When the
    influence of soil moisture sensors positioning on the representativeness of their
    readings regarding to the average soil water content in the root zone was considered,
    a clear effect was observed. It was also found that the effect of sensors positioning
    varies according to the soil hydraulic properties, the meteorological conditions,
    and the irrigation system configuration. These results further support the importance
    of proper soil moisture sensors positioning according to each application requirements
    (e.g. irrigation management or other applications requiring the monitoring of
    soil water content). Finally, concerning the effect of sensors accuracy on the
    efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems, it was
    found that while the lower error level (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) had an obvious but generally
    limited effect (between 2.5% and 6.4%), the higher error level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3)
    had a critical effect (between 10.2% and 18.7%). Considering that error levels
    of about ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 are generally optimistic for many EM sensors using the
    factory calibration equations, the need of soil specific calibration of the EM
    sensors used in soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems
    is highlighted. Concluding, the results of this study provide clear evidence that
    soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation
    efficiency in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. More importantly,
    it was found that sensor accuracy could be a critical factor for the successful
    implementation of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems. It
    should be also noted that in this study the effects of sensor positioning and
    accuracy were separately investigated. Therefore, even in cases that the observed
    errors for each of these two factors were not important, the synergistic effect
    of both factors could be more important. It was also found that a detailed study
    taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation systems,
    scheduling systems, as well as soil moisture sensors will provide a sound basis
    for improved irrigation scheduling. Lastly, the ability of computer models to
    serve as an efficient tool for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning
    schemes or other automated scheduling system characteristics is a significant
    outcome of this study as well. Acknowledgements The authors wish to sincerely

    automated using the temperature-time-threshold method of irrigation scheduling.
    An array of infrared thermometers was mounted on the center pivot, and these were
    used to remotely determine the crop leaf temperature as an indicator of crop water
    stress. We describe methods used to automatically collect and analyze the canopy
    temperature data and control the moving irrigation system based on the data analysis.
    Automatic irrigation treatments were compared with manually scheduled irrigation
    treatments under the same center pivot during the growing seasons of 2004 and
    2005. Manual irrigations were scheduled on a weekly basis using the neutron probe
    to determine the profile water content and the amount of water needed to replenish
    the profile to field capacity. In both years, there was no significant difference
    between manual and automatic treatments in soybean water use efficiency or irrigation
    water use efficiency. The automatic irrigation system has the potential to simplify
    management, while maintaining the yields of intensely managed irrigation. Introduction
    An automated irrigation scheduling and control system that responds to stress
    indicators from the crop itself has the potential to lower crop management and
    labor requirements, and to increase yields per unit of irrigation water (Evett
    et al. 2000). Burke (1993) and Burke and Oliver (1993) showed that plant enzymes
    operate most efficiently in a narrow temperature range termed the thermal kinetic
    window. Wanjura et al. (1992, 1995) demonstrated that the use of this window as
    a canopy temperature threshold could be used as a criterion for simplifying and
    automating irrigation scheduling. Upchurch et al. received U.S. Patent No. 5,539,637
    in 1996 for an irrigation management system based on this optimal leaf temperature
    for enzyme activity and a climate dependent time threshold. This was termed the
    temperature-time-threshold (TTT) method of irrigation scheduling. With this method,
    for every minute that the canopy temperature exceeds the threshold temperature,
    1 min is added to the daily total (Fig. 1). If this daily total exceeds the time
    threshold at the end of the day, then an irrigation of a fixed depth is scheduled.
    Since humidity can limit evaporative cooling, minutes are not accrued if the wet
    bulb temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus 2 ° C . Evett
    et al. (1996, 2000) demonstrated in drip irrigated plots near Bushland, Texas
    that automatic irrigation using the TTT method was more responsive to plant stress
    and showed the potential to outyield manual irrigation scheduling based on a 100%
    replenishment of crop water use as determined by neutron probe soil water content
    measurements. Fig. 1. Canopy temperatures of three replicate plots on corn in
    1999 (Evett et al. 2000) compared with air temperature. Shown also are horizontal
    bars drawn at the threshold temperature of 28 ° C and over the length of the threshold
    time ( 240 min ) . Because the canopy was above the threshold temperature for
    more than the threshold time on day 234, irrigation occurred in the evening of
    that day, but not in the evening of day 235. The TTT irrigation scheduling method
    is easily automated with solid set systems such as drip irrigation where canopy
    temperatures can be measured in stationary positions in the field throughout the
    day. However, infrared radiation sensors mounted on self-propelled center pivots
    or linear move irrigation systems can provide only one-time-of-day canopy temperature
    measurements at each field location, and these measurements occur at uncertain
    times of day. The application of the TTT system of irrigation scheduling to specific
    locations under a center pivot or linear move irrigation system requires a method
    of determining diurnal canopy temperature dynamics at each location from these
    one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurements. It also requires a method of
    automatically collecting and analyzing the canopy temperature data and controlling
    the moving irrigation system based on the data analysis. The objectives of this
    study were to: (1) apply the TTT method of irrigation scheduling to a center pivot
    irrigation system with an array of infrared thermocouples mounted on the center
    pivot itself; (2) configure the center pivot to be automatically controlled according
    to the plant water needs as determined from the TTT method of irrigation scheduling;
    and (3) compare the automatic irrigation scheduling to manual irrigation scheduling
    based on neutron probe soil water content measurements in the same field. Diurnal
    Canopy Temperature Determination Extrapolating a diurnal canopy temperature curve
    from a one-time-of-day measurement requires an estimation of the canopy temperature
    dynamics due to changing environmental conditions. Several different models exist
    that can predict the dynamics of the crop canopy temperature as part of a soil-plant-atmosphere
    energy balance (Evett and Lascano 1993). However, these models require as input,
    detailed weather data, as well as knowledge of soil- and plant-specific parameters
    that are neither readily available nor easy to measure. The most direct and simple
    way to determine how changing environmental conditions over a day affect canopy
    temperature dynamics is to measure canopy temperature in one stationary reference
    location. Canopy temperatures in other parts of a field, which may be under different
    stresses, may be modeled relative to this reference using one-time-of-day temperature
    measurements from those locations (Peters and Evett, 2004a,b). If predawn canopy
    temperatures throughout the field ( T e ; e for early) are assumed to be the same,
    then T rmt = T e + ( T rmt , t − T e ) ( T ref − T e ) T ref , t − T e (1) where
    T rmt ( ° C ) =calculated canopy temperature at the remote location; T ref ( °
    C ) =canopy temperature from the reference location at the same time interval
    as T rmt ( ° C ) ; T rmt , t ( ° C ) =one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurement
    at the remote location at any daylight time t ; and T ref , t ( ° C ) =measured
    reference temperature from the time t that the remote temperature measurement
    was taken. Materials and Methods The experimental site was a three-tower, 127
    m long research center pivot located at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production
    Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas ( 35 ° 11 ′ N, 102 ° 06 ′ W, 1,170 m elev.
    above MSL). The towers are located at the radial distances of 33.8, 73.3, and
    112.8 m . Data were collected during 2004 and 2005 on soybeans grown on a Pullman
    fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Torrertic Paleustoll. Only half of the field
    was used to allow the other half’s soil water content differences from the previous
    year to be evened up with a cover crop. Alternate halves were used in 2004 and
    2005. Soybeans were planted in concentric circles out from the center point (Fig.
    2). Four different water level treatments 12.2 m ( 40 ft ) wide were applied radially
    out from the center point (100, 66, and 33% of projected irrigation needs, and
    a dry land, or no irrigation treatment). Each drop was pressure regulated to 6
    psi . The irrigation level was controlled by nozzle sizes as appropriate. Drops
    were spaced every other row ( 1.52 m ) and irrigated with low energy precision
    application (LEPA) drag socks. The flow rate from each drop was evaluated using
    a large bucket, a scale, and a stop watch and the system performance was found
    to adequately match the design requirements. The furrows were dammed/diked to
    limit water movement in the furrows. Radially, two replications of each of the
    irrigation level treatments were applied in a randomized block pattern with the
    second tower wheel track serving as the block separation line. The innermost plot
    was not used. Along the arc of the irrigated half circle, there were three replications
    each of an automatically controlled (via the TTT method) treatment, and a treatment
    that was manually scheduled (using soil water deficiency as determined by neutron
    probe soil moisture content readings). These treatments were applied alternatively
    to 28 deg “pie slices” in order to block for any differences in soil types underneath
    the pivot. The two radial and three arc-wise replications created a total of six
    replicate plots for each treatment. A neutron probe access tube was located in
    the center of each plot (48 total tubes) in the crop row (top of the bed). Two
    additional rows of soybeans were planted around the outside and inside edges of
    the pivot to help minimize border effects. Agronomic practices common in the region
    for high yields were applied. Fig. 2. Automatic center pivot irrigation experiment
    plot plan divided into six “pie slices.” Pie slices labeled Auto were automatically
    irrigated, while those labeled Manual were manually irrigated. Irrigation amounts
    were 100% of the amount determined by each of the two irrigation scheduling methods
    used in the arcs labeled 100%, and in the arcs labeled 67% and 33%, the irrigation
    amounts were 67% and 33% of the amount applied in 100% arcs. The pivot’s position
    was determined using a low-cost GPS receiver mounted near the end of the pivot
    (Peters and Evett 2005). The pivot movement and positioning were controlled remotely
    by a computer, located in a nearby building, which communicated through two different
    900 MHz radios (Fig. 3). One radio was part of a center pivot remote control system
    “base station” produced by Valmont Industries. This radio communicated with the
    pivot through a second radio mounted at the pivot center point, thus, allowing
    status checks and control commands to be sent and received at the pivot control
    panel. The second system consisted of a Campbell Scientific RF400 radio that communicated
    to similar radios connected to a datalogger mounted on the pivot and a separate
    datalogger in the field. Fig. 3. Automatic center pivot control setup The center-pivot-mounted
    datalogger collected data from 16 infrared thermocouple thermometers (IRTCs) that
    were attached to the trusses of the pivot (Figs. 3 and 4). They were mounted on
    the leading side of the pivot trusses (approximately 3 m above the ground surface)
    and the pivot was only allowed to irrigate in one direction so that the sensors
    would not view wet canopy. The IRTCs were oriented so that they pointed parallel
    to the center pivot arm (perpendicular to crop rows) towards a spot in the middle
    of each concentric irrigation treatment plot. In order to minimize sensor angle
    related effects, two IRTCs were aimed at approximately the same spot from either
    side of each plot. The average of these two readings for each plot was used. Wanjura
    et al. (1995) reported that canopy temperatures differed less than 0.5 ° C when
    measured by either one sensor in the nadir position, or two sensors pointed at
    the row from opposite directions. The IRTCs were connected to a multiplexer (Campbell
    Scientific AM25T) at the second tower, which in turn was connected to a datalogger
    placed at the third and last tower. The IRTCs sensed canopy temperature on 10
    sec intervals, and the 1 min averages were logged. Fig. 4. Photo of the center
    pivot showing the infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) mounted on the pivot trusses,
    the field IRTCs, and the field datalogging equipment In 2004, the IRTCs used were
    narrow field of view (ratio of distance to view spot size was 10:1) (Exergen model
    IRt/c.JR-10) and were sensed by a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger. At the
    end of the season in 2004 it was discovered that the narrow field-of-view IRTCs
    were sensitive to the sensor body temperature, causing temperature errors. Thus,
    in 2005, a wider field-of-view (2:1) sensor (Exergen model IRt/c.2-T-80), which
    was relatively insensitive to sensor body temperature, was used and mounted on
    additional structures built on the pivot so that the sensors could be placed closer
    to the canopy (approximately 1 m from the ground surface) to avoid seeing wetted
    canopy. Sixteen IRTCs (Exergen model IRt/c.2-T-80) were mounted in stationary
    locations in the field and connected to a separate datalogger (Fig. 3). Each IRTC
    was mounted in the nadir position over the crop row close enough to the canopy
    so that soil was not included in the field of view. These IRTCs were adjusted
    up with the changing height of the canopy. One IRTC was mounted in each irrigation
    level of both the automatic and manual treatments. These IRTCs were similarly
    connected through a multiplexer (Campbell Scientific AM25T) and to a datalogger
    (Campbell Scientific CR21X). The datalogger logged the 5 min averages of each
    of the IRTC readings collected on 10 sec intervals. Each IRTC was separately calibrated
    using a black body (Omega Black Point, model BB701) before the season began. A
    second order polynomial was fitted to the results of the calibration and each
    IRTC was individually corrected by the data analysis software running on the control
    computer in the nearby building. The sensors were checked periodically throughout
    the season and they seemed relatively unaffected by dust or bugs. During an automatic
    irrigation event, the pivot stopped at the edge of the treatment, paused 10 min
    to drain, and then ran dry over the manual irrigation treatment. It would then
    pressure up again for the next automatic irrigation treatment, and continued on
    in this fashion until all of the automatic irrigation segments were irrigated.
    An application depth of 20 mm was applied at each automatic irrigation event.
    This was equivalent to the maximum, two-day evapotranspiration rate for the region
    during the hot, windy summer months. After irrigating the last automatic plot,
    the pivot continued on around dry to its starting point. During a manual irrigation
    event, the pivot performed similarly except it would irrigate only the manual
    irrigation treatments at a manually set application depth required to replenish
    soil water content to field capacity ( 0.33 m 3 m − 3 ) , thus, preventing crop
    stress for the 100% treatments. The soil water deficit was determined by weekly
    neutron probe readings in the 100% manual irrigation treatments. The neutron probe
    was field calibrated as in Evett and Steiner (1995) and was read at 20 cm depth
    increments. A depth control stand (Evett et al. 2003) was used to improve accuracy
    in the near-surface ( 10 cm depth) reading. In order to both manually and automatically
    control the same pivot, automatic irrigations were only allowed on even days of
    year, and manual irrigations were only allowed on odd days of year. The central
    control computer was programmed to call the pivot-mounted datalogger and the pivot
    control panel every minute to retrieve status reports. Software was written in
    Visual Basic that reviewed the status reports every minute to determine whether
    the pivot had crossed a plot boundary. If it had, new instructions were sent to
    the pivot depending on its location and the program (automatic or manual) that
    was running at the time. In this way, the complex motion of the center pivot was
    controlled. The field datalogger was polled only once a day soon after midnight.
    At this time, the previous day’s data were analyzed to determine the next day’s
    strategy. If the pivot did not move during the previous day, the temperature curve
    collected by the pivot-mounted IRTCs was used to determine whether irrigation
    was required based on the canopy temperature measurements from where the pivot
    was located. If the pivot did move during the previous day, then a subroutine
    was called that scaled one-time-of-day temperature measurements and made decisions
    based on the results. The two canopy temperature measurements from the field-mounted
    IRTCs in the 100%, automatic treatments were averaged together and used as the
    reference curve for scaling the one-time-of-day measurement into a diurnal curve
    [Eq. (1)]. To establish the plots, the plots were uniformly irrigated until the
    soil between the rows was not visible when viewed at a 45 deg angle from the pivot
    IRTCs. At the end of the season, the dry yield was determined by harvesting a
    3.48 m 2 sample near the center of each plot. The total dry biomass was measured,
    as well as the dry yield Y ( kg m − 2 ) , and average bean weight. The total water
    use W U (m) was determined by subtracting the soil profile water content (m) determined
    at the first measurement date from the water content determined after harvest,
    and adding the total amount of irrigation I (m) and rainfall (m) for that time
    period. Water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated as WUE = Y W U (2) and irrigation
    water use efficiency (IWUE) was calculated as IWUE = Y − Y D I (3) where Y D =mean
    yield ( kg m − 2 ) in the dryland plots. Both WUE and IWUE are given in units
    of kg ∕ m 3 . Results and Discussion Exergen IRTCs have a capacitor built into
    the sensor to help to minimize the effects of ambient electromagnetic noise on
    the sensor’s readings. This capacitance interacts with the Campbell Scientific
    CR10X datalogger to give readings that are slightly incorrect. The pivot IRTCs
    were wired into a CR10X. This is not an issue with the Campbell Scientific CR21X,
    which was used for the stationary field measurements. The readings from the narrow
    field-of-view sensors that were mounted on the pivot also were very sensitive
    to the sensor body temperature. These errors were much higher than those from
    the wider field-of-view sensors mounted in the field. It was learned that these
    were simply poor sensors that were subsequently replaced by the manufacturer for
    virtually no cost. Because the sensors were calibrated independently in the laboratory
    before mounting them on the pivot, and because the readings were reasonable, this
    error was not caught until after the 2004 season was effectively over. This resulted
    in pivot IRTC temperatures that were 3 – 5 ° C low. The pivot IRTC measured temperatures
    were compared to the field IRTC data from times when the pivot was located in
    approximately the same location. The temperatures from the pivot mounted IRTC
    temperatures varied linearly with the more correct field IRTCs. Regression was
    used to obtain the equation T corrected = 0.7641 × T pivot + 9.1713 (4) This equation
    was used to obtain a corrected ( T corrected , ° C ) canopy temperature using
    the observed IRTC pivot temperatures ( T pivot , ° C ) , ( r 2 of 0.9731). To
    evaluate the effect that this error had on the irrigation experiment, the corrected
    temperatures were processed with a specifically written computer program. The
    irrigation decisions (of what should have happened) were compared against what
    was actually done. The results showed that in five different instances throughout
    the season, automatic irrigations should have run, but did not because the temperatures
    were reported low. The temperature threshold was effectively set at 30 ° C instead
    of the 27 ° C for soybeans that is specified by theory. When tested, there was
    no difference in the irrigation decisions made by the uncorrected data with a
    30 ° C temperature threshold and the corrected temperatures with a 27 ° C temperature
    threshold. A different IRTC was used in 2005 as described above and the problem
    was corrected for the following season. The yield and water use data were analyzed
    using SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.) with a procedure for mixed models
    (proc mixed) with the Tukey-Kramer method for adjusting for multiplicity. Results
    are given in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1. 2004 Response Variables for the Treatment

    manual irrigation treatment yielded significantly more than the automatic irrigation
    treatment ( Pr > ∣ t ∣ = 0.035 ) with an average difference of 0.025 kg ∕ m 2
    (Table 1). We believe that this was mainly due to the sensor issue, which was
    equivalent to the temperature threshold being set 3 ° C greater than it should
    have been. Although not significantly different, the manual treatments also showed
    numerically larger WUE and IWUE. For this first season, there were no significant
    differences between the automatic and the manual treatments for any variable (yield,
    bean mass, etc.) within an irrigation level, with the exception of yield at the
    67% irrigation level. The automatic treatment yielded better in 2005 with the
    IRTC issue corrected than the manual irrigation treatment (Table 2). The differences
    in the treatments could be seen in the crop heights. This difference as measured
    in yield was not significant, however. Because the described system can sample
    the water stress of an entire field instead of discrete points and because the
    automatic system makes irrigation management easier, a nonsignificant difference
    is viewed as a win. In fact, yields from the manual and automatic treatments were
    not significantly different from each other at any of the irrigation levels. The
    automatic treatment used more water than the manual treatment and resulted in
    slightly smaller, though not significantly different, water and irrigation water
    use efficiencies. Yields at the 100% irrigation level were in the range reported
    by Evett et al. (2000) for three years of automatically drip irrigated soybean,
    and by Eck et al. (1987) for three years of fully furrow irrigated soybean. Water
    use efficiencies were larger than those reported by Evett et al. (2000), which
    ranged from 0.25 to 0.51 kg m − 3 for drip irrigated soybean at the same location.
    They were also larger than values ranging from 0.05 to 0.61 kg m − 3 reported
    by Eck et al. (1987). Contrary to results of Evett et al. (2000) and Eck et al.
    (1987), water use efficiency in 2005 was increased by deficit irrigation, though
    not in 2004. WUE was much higher in 2005 because the total water use was much
    lower due to lower evapotranspirative demand. The overall average total water
    use (WU) in 2005 was 236 mm . In 2004, it was almost twice that at 445 mm . In
    2005, there was only 27 mm of precipitation and an average of 133 mm of irrigation
    across all of the plots. In 2004, there was 211 mm of precipitation and 173 mm
    average irrigation across all of the plots. The large differences in the dry (no
    irrigation) treatment yields and total water use between years demonstrates the
    large difference in precipitation between the two years. Summary and Conclusions
    A center pivot was configured to automatically irrigate, based on crop stress
    signals sensed by infrared thermocouples mounted on the center pivot. These automatic
    treatments were compared with a manually scheduled treatment over two growing
    seasons in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, there was an interaction of the sensors with
    the datalogger, and incorrect canopy temperatures were recorded by the pivot-mounted
    IRTCs. This resulted in the equivalent of the threshold temperature being set
    at 30 ° C instead of the prescribed 27 ° C . Therefore, the automatic irrigations
    ran less often than they should have in 2004. Because of this, the manual treatments
    yielded significantly more than the automatic treatments. However, during the
    following season, the difference between the manual and automatic irrigation treatments
    was not significant, with the automatic treatment yielding slightly more than
    the manual treatment. There were no significant differences in water use efficiency
    in either year. By helping with irrigation scheduling on center pivots, the automatic
    irrigation system saves management time and lessens decision making, and a nonsignificant
    difference is viewed as a win. We believe that the costs and simplicity of methods
    presented here may become attractive to producers when available in a turnkey
    commercial package. This is especially true since the methods have the potential
    to simplify management and reduce labor costs, while maintaining or increasing
    yields compared with intensively and scientifically managed manual irrigation
    scheduling. Notation The following symbols are used in this paper: I = total amount

    and content Abstract The use of digital infrared thermography and thermometry
    to investigate early crop water stress offers a producer improved management tools
    to avoid yield declines or to deal with variability in crop water status. This
    study used canopy temperature data to investigate whether an empirical crop water
    stress index could be used to monitor spatial and temporal crop water stress.
    Different irrigation treatment amounts (100%, 67%, 33%, and 0% of full replenishment
    of soil water to field capacity to a depth of 1.5 m) were applied by a center
    pivot system to soybean (Glycine max L.) in 2004 and 2005, and to cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) in 2007 and 2008. Canopy temperature data from infrared thermography
    were used to benchmark the relationship between an empirical crop water stress
    index (CWSIe) and leaf water potential (ΨL) across a block of eight treatment
    plots (of two replications). There was a significant negative linear correlation
    between midday ΨL measurements and the CWSIe after soil water differences due
    to irrigation treatments were well established and during the absence of heavy
    rainfall. Average seasonal CWSIe values calculated for each plot from temperature
    measurements made by infrared thermometer thermocouples mounted on a center pivot
    lateral were inversely related to crop water use with r2 values >0.89 and 0.55
    for soybean and cotton, respectively. There was also a significant inverse relationship
    between the CWSIe and soybean yields in 2004 (r2 = 0.88) and 2005 (r2 = 0.83),
    and cotton in 2007 (r2 = 0.78). The correlations were not significant in 2008
    for cotton. Contour plots of the CWSIe may be used as maps to indicate the spatial
    variability of within-field crop water stress. These maps may be useful for irrigation
    scheduling or identifying areas within a field where water stress may impact crop
    water use and yield. Highlights ► In this study we demonstrate how an empirical
    crop water stress index was related to in situ stress measurements. ► Average
    seasonal empirical CWSI values were inversely related to crop water use and crop
    yield. ► Contour plots of the average seasonal CWSI can be used to map spatial
    variability of within-field crop water stress. Previous article in issue Next

    technologies have potential as tools for monitoring crop water status, predicting
    yields (Idso et al., 1978, Idso et al., 1980, Pinter et al., 1983), improving
    water use efficiency (Evett et al., 1996, Evett et al., 2001, Evett et al., 2006)
    and harvesting methods, and precisely managing irrigation (Wanjura et al., 1995).
    Useful information on crop canopy temperature and water relations can be derived
    from infrared thermography and thermometry. Infrared thermography has been used
    in agriculture as a non-invasive, versatile imaging tool to investigate biotic
    stresses (disease or insect infestation), and abiotic stresses (e.g., nutrient
    and water deficit). Chaerle et al. (2006) combined thermal and chlorophyll fluorescence
    imaging to study spatial and temporal heterogeneity of leaf transpiration and
    photosynthesis. These techniques helped identify pre-symptomatic responses (higher
    chlorophyll intensity co-located with thermal symptoms) and provided diagnosis
    of diseases (fungal and bacterial infections) and abiotic stresses not yet perceptible
    in visible spectrum images. Stoll et al. (2008) used an infrared camera to observe
    thermal responses in grapevine infected with a fungus well in advance of visible
    symptoms. Bulanon et al. (2009) fused digital and thermal images taken of the
    same area to improve the identification of fruit for robotic harvesters. Studies
    involving the analysis of abiotic stresses with thermal imagery include those
    by Jones (1999) and Jones et al. (2002) in which field studies were designed to
    assess the consistency and repeatability of using thermal imagery to measure stomatal
    conductance in grapevine canopies. They concluded that thermography allows for
    semi-automated analysis of large areas of canopy with much more effective replication
    than can be achieved with porometry. Leinonen and Jones (2004) classified thermal
    images to identify leaf area, sunlit, and shaded parts of the canopy. Their methods
    provided improved estimates of temperature distribution across a canopy by separating
    out mixed pixels and reducing the effects of thermal contribution from background,
    and angle of view (Luquet et al., 2003). Leaf water potential measurements became
    routine in the 1960s with the commercialization of pressure chambers (Turner,
    1988) and are considered an accurate and reliable technique to characterize crop
    water stress, leading to their common use in irrigation scheduling (e.g., Alchanatis
    et al., 2009, Kite and Hanson, 1984). These invasive and time consuming in situ
    measurements demonstrate diurnal changes with the minima occurring in mid afternoon
    (Reicosky et al., 1975, Bhattacharya et al., 1994), which is generally the time
    of greatest air temperature and least relative humidity. Cohen et al. (2005) and
    Möeller et al. (2007) used thermal and visible imagery to estimate the crop water
    status of irrigated cotton and wine grapes by calculating an empirical crop water
    stress index, CWSIe: (1) where Tc was the temperature (°C) of the crop (average
    of the leaves within a polygon drawn on a thermographic image) at the time of
    the thermal image, Tw was the average temperature of a wet reference (wetted white
    felt surface) that acted as a substitute for the well-watered base line temperature
    of Idso et al. (1978), and the dry baseline temperature, Tdry, was estimated by
    adding 5 °C to the maximum dry bulb temperature recorded (Möeller et al., 2007)
    for the specific field day. They used the temperature of the artificial wet reference
    as a surrogate for a fully transpiring leaf, i.e., a well-watered crop surface.
    The CWSIe value was then related to leaf water potential (ΨL) measurements. Spatial
    ΨL maps were developed based on predictions from the calculated CWSIe, which were
    themselves derived from canopy temperature maps. Since the wet reference temperature
    (Tw) required in Eq. (1) requires the establishment, maintenance and movement
    of a physical wet reference body, it is difficult to use for routine monitoring.
    An alternative Tw value can be estimated as (Monteith and Unsworth, 1990): (2)
    where Ta is air temperature (°C), es is saturated vapor pressure (Pa) at Ta, ea
    is actual vapor pressure (Pa), Δ is slope (Pa °C−1) of the saturated vapor pressure
    vs. temperature curve evaluated at (Ta), and γ is the psychometric constant (Pa
    °C−1); all evaluated at the time of Tc measurement for the CWSIe. In preliminary
    work, we found that Eq. (2) did not always yield a Tw value that compared well
    with Tw measured on the physical wet reference surface. Since the daily maximum
    dry bulb temperature is used in Eq. (1), and since it represents a sort of potential
    evaporative condition, it may be that it should be used in Eq. (2) as well. Alchanatis
    et al. (2009) found the midday leaf water potential measurements for cotton were
    optimal when mapping water status in cotton using high resolution thermal imaging.
    Their focus was to provide leaf water potential maps to irrigators modeled from
    thermal imagery alone. Ben-Gal et al. (2009) evaluated water stress of differentially
    drip irrigated olive trees on an orchard scale using infrared thermography. Canopy
    temperature measurements extracted from the thermal images were used to calculate
    a CWSI using both empirical and analytical approaches. It was determined that
    there was no significant difference between the two approaches when compared against
    stem leaf water potential, stomatal resistance, and soil water potential measurements.
    Although infrared thermography offers methods for infield spatial mapping, additional
    equipment (plane, helicopter or lift) is needed to obtain the images. Infrared
    thermometry, on the other hand, is currently more economical and infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) do not require a separate platform for crop monitoring when mounted on
    a moving sprinkler system. Crop canopy temperature measured with infrared thermometers
    has been used successfully to monitor plant water stress (Jackson et al., 1981,
    Howell et al., 1984, Sadler et al., 2002, Falkenberg et al., 2007) and, with appropriate
    algorithms, to control irrigation scheduling (Wanjura et al., 1995, Evett et al.,
    1996, Upchurch et al., 1998, Peters and Evett, 2007, O''Shaughnessy and Evett,
    2010). If a thermally based stress index requiring minimal ancillary inputs can
    be developed using ground-based remote sensors, the index may be a cost-effective
    means for timing irrigations or spatially monitoring crop water stress and potential
    yield. Our objectives were to: (1) determine if the CWSIe calculated from infrared
    thermography images can be reliably related to ΨL measurements from soybean and
    cotton taken in differentially irrigated treatment plots; (2) investigate the
    use of maximum daily dry bulb temperature, Tdry, as a substitute for air temperature
    at the time of measurement, Ta, in Eq. (2) estimates of wet reference surface
    temperature, Tw; (3) investigate the relationships between the CWSIe, calculated
    using data from IRTs mounted on a moving irrigation system, with seasonal crop
    water use and crop yield across differentially irrigated treatment plots; (4)
    investigate the strength of the CWSIe-yield relationship as a function of time
    since differential irrigation treatments were started; and (5) develop contour
    plots of the CWSIe as a means to represent within-field spatial and temporal crop
    water stress. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Agronomy This study was conducted
    during 2004–2008 at the USDA Agricultural Research Service Conservation and Production
    Research Laboratory, Bushland, Texas (35° 11′ N, 102° 06′ W, 1174 m above mean
    sea level). Crop water status was controlled spatially by full and deficit irrigation
    flow rates accomplished by appropriate sizing of drop hose nozzles (Allen et al.,
    2000). Irrigations were applied with a center pivot irrigation system using low
    energy precision application (LEPA) drag socks (Lyle and Bordovsky, 1983) in every
    other furrow. Treatment plots were arranged in six blocks arc-wise around half
    of the center pivot circle (Fig. 1) with alternating blocks for manual and automatic
    irrigation scheduling, which was part of a separate irrigation management study
    (Peters and Evett, 2008, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Within each block, irrigation
    amount treatments were randomly assigned with two replications arranged radially
    from the pivot point in blocks. Radial and arc-wise blocking was designed to allow
    for effects of position along the lateral on irrigation application rate and to
    minimize effects of possible runoff. Soybean (Glycine max L.), variety Pioneer
    94B731 RR (Roundup Ready), was planted on day of year (DOY) 152 (May 31) in 2004
    and variety 94M90 RR was planted on DOY 143 (May 23) in 2005. Cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.), variety Paymaster 2280 was planted on DOY 149 (May 29) in 2007,
    and Delta Pine 117 B2RF was planted on DOY 141 in 2008 (both varieties were Bollgard
    II® Roundup Ready®, Land Co., Scott, Miss.). The crops were grown in concentric
    rows with beds spaced 0.76-m apart. The width of each treatment plot was 18 rows
    across. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Experimental layout under
    the 3-span center pivot system shown for the (a) 2004 growing season; and (b)
    the 2005 and 2007 growing seasons. Pie-slice-shaped sections are blocked by irrigation
    control method (manual vs. automatic). Each block contains all irrigation amount
    treatments with two replications, 100%, 67% and 33% of full replenishment of soil
    water to field capacity and a no-irrigation ((Dry) treatment, which are randomized
    radially within each section and run concentrically. (Not shown is the plot plan
    for the 2008 growing season. The north half of the pivot field was cropped, but
    the order of irrigation treatment amounts was different from that of 2004.) 2.2.
    Irrigation scheduling and crop water use determination For the manual irrigation
    control treatment, irrigation amounts were 0%, 33%, 67%, and 100% of full replenishment
    of soil water in the root zone to field capacity (treatments designated I0%, I33%,
    I67% and I100%). Soil water content was determined weekly using a neutron probe
    in 0.2-m increments down to 2.4 m in the I100% treatment plots. In all other treatment
    plots, soil water was measured once every 30 days. Access tubes were placed in
    a row in the center of each plot. The neutron probe was field calibrated to accuracy
    of better than 0.01 m3 m–3, resulting in separate calibrations from three distinct
    soil layers, Ap, Bt and Btca, using methods described by Evett (2008). Irrigations
    for the manual control treatment were applied on odd DOY, over 3 days of the week
    if necessary. Any rainfall occurring prior to irrigation of the total amount for
    the week was subtracted from the required total. Irrigations for the automatic
    control treatment were applied on even DOY. Seasonal crop water use (ET) in each
    plot was calculated using the soil water balance equation (Evett, 2002): (3) where
    the change in soil water storage (ΔS, mm) was evaluated as the soil profile water
    content measured to 2.4-m depth, P was precipitation (measured at the adjacent
    weather station), I was irrigation (determined by nozzle discharge rate, horizontal
    spacing, lateral rotational speed and run times), F was deep flux into or out
    of the control volume at 2.4-m depth (assumed zero), and R was the sum of runoff
    and runon (assumed zero because furrow dikes were used to control runoff). Irrigation
    was scheduled for the automatic irrigation control treatment using the Time Temperature
    Threshold (TTT) method for irrigation management and control (Peters and Evett,
    2008), which is similar to the Biologically Identified Optimal Temperature Interactive
    Console (BIOTIC, Upchurch et al., 1998) method. Because irrigations were only
    possible every other day, the full irrigation level for automatic treatments in
    the I100% treatment was twice the crop''s peak daily ET rate (2 × 10 = 20 mm)
    so that irrigations could replenish water used by the crop even during the peak
    water use period. Automatic irrigation scheduling protocols, infrared thermometer
    sensors (IRTs) (Exergen model IRt/c.5:1-Type T, Watertown, Mass.). Automatic irrigations
    were triggered only after canopy temperatures exceeded 27 °C for more than 256
    min for soybean; and 28 °C for more than 452 min for cotton. Time thresholds were
    accumulated in a 24-h period on an odd-numbered DOY. Stationary IRTs were located
    in the field within automatically irrigated treatment plots and provided reference
    crop canopy temperatures. The irrigation control treatments were generally started
    in mid July when fraction of vegetative cover was approximately 20% (Table 1).

    canopy temperature measurement; and our implementation is fully explained in Peters
    and Evett (2008). It is well established that the TTT method results in yields
    and water use efficiencies at least as great or greater than those obtained with
    the heretofore acknowledged best scientific irrigation scheduling practice using
    the neutron probe (Evett et al., 1996, Evett et al., 2000, Evett et al., 2001,
    Evett et al., 2006, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010, Peters and Evett, 2004a, Peters
    and Evett, 2006, Peters and Evett, 2007, Peters and Evett, 2008). Note that the
    TTT automatic irrigation control method is discussed here mostly to complete the
    methods description. Manual irrigations were applied weekly on odd-numbered DOY
    at treatment levels of 33%, 67%, and 100% of full replenishment of soil water
    in the top 1.5 m of soil to field capacity (treatments designated MI33, MI67 and
    MI100); and a non-irrigated treatment designated MI0 was included. Manual irrigations
    were based on neutron probe readings taken weekly. The TTT method was a means
    to apply irrigations automatically; herein the present report focuses on CWSIe
    relationships to irrigation amount and control method, leaf water potential, crop
    water use and yield, and the strength of these relationships over the course of
    the irrigation season. 2.3. In situ measurements and thermographic image analysis
    In situ thermographic and ΨL measurements were limited to plots located on the
    outer edge of the field to avoid damaging the crop with the hydraulic lift that
    was used to position the thermographic camera over the plots. Thermal images and
    ΨL measurements were not taken in 2004 since the pressure chamber and thermal
    imager were not available until 2005. However, infrared thermometer measurements
    of canopy temperature were made as explained in the next section. Leaf stem water
    potential was measured during the 2005, 2007, and 2008 growing seasons (dates
    in Table 2) using a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Albany, Ore.). Ten
    measurements were made per plot near solar noon in plots 1 through 8 (Fig. 1).
    Samples were limited to eight plots because of manpower and time constraints.
    Since the four water treatments were replicated twice in these eight plots, and
    since 10 measurements of stem water potential were made in each plot, replication
    of stem water potential measurements for each water treatment was 20, considered
    adequate for this purpose. Table 2. Days of year (DOY) and dates of in situ measurements,
    leaf water potential (ΨL) and thermal images. Growing season Dates in DOY and

    (July 21); 213 (July 31); 261 (September 17) Leaves were excised with a razor
    blade, wrapped in aluminum foil, and placed in an ice chest until ΨL was measured.
    All ΨL measurements were performed within 1 h of excision. The number of in situ
    sampling dates per growing season was limited due to the amount of labor required
    to perform the tasks involved. A minimum of three in situ sampling dates were
    chosen so as to sample over different crop growth stages. For example, for soybean,
    sampling was conducted at flowering, pod formation, and mature pod stages; for
    cotton, sampling was done near square formation, after cutout and at the time
    of boll formation. The actual days were selected at random when afternoon cloud
    cover was minimal. Digital images were taken with a thermal infrared camera and
    corresponding software (model SC2000 and ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2.8 software,
    FLIR Systems, Billerica, Mass.) on the same sampling days and time as the ΨL measurements,
    near 1300 CST. Overlapping images were taken simultaneously with an RGB (red–blue–green)
    digital camera (model DSC-S85, Sony Electronics, Inc., Oradell, NJ) in 2005 and
    2007. In 2008, digital images were taken with a camera sensitive in the near infrared
    as well as in the visible RGB wavelengths and equipped with a near-infrared pass
    filter (model IS-1, FUJI, Edison, NJ). Cameras were mounted alongside the thermal
    imager to aid in image analysis. Images were taken at a nadir view angle from
    a hydraulic platform, 7.0 m above the ground. For each thermometric image acquisition,
    cardboard crosses covered with aluminum foil were placed in the plant canopy to
    define the boundaries of interest. The crosses appeared as colder areas in the
    thermometric images and as bright areas in the RGB images. Also imaged was the
    wet reference to simulate a non-stressed crop, which was a 27 by 42 cm wet surface
    constructed from a semi-permeable plastic foam block covered with white polyester
    felt resting in a basin filled with deionized water. The foam blocks and felt
    were submerged to re-wet them at least one min before images were taken. Capillary
    action kept the fabric wetted for several minutes. The wet reference was located
    in the center of the field-of-view of the image when placed in a treatment plot.
    Canopy temperature for the CWSIe was determined by averaging three different polygon
    areas from different crop rows within a single thermal image (e.g., Fig. 2a, c,
    and e). It was assumed that this method would be similar to the canopy temperatures
    recorded by IRTs mounted on the moving center pivot system. Download : Download

    Rectangles shown are the polygons discussed in the text. Shown are average temperature
    of crop rows, the artificial wet reference (AWR), soil, and individual leaves
    for: (a) and (b) soybean 2005 (DOY 258), I33%; (c) and (d) cotton 2007 (DOY 247),
    I0%; and (e) and (f) cotton 2008 (DOY 213), I100%. (b and d) are from a digital
    RGB camera without filtering; and (f) is from a digital camera that is sensitive
    in the near infrared and was taken with a filter that excluded wavelengths > near
    infrared. Shaded soils ranged between approximately 30 °C and 42 °C, sunlit soils
    were generally >50 °C, and crop canopy temperatures within polygons were between
    30 °C and 35 °C. The extracted wet reference temperatures were average values
    for the unshaded areas of the wet reference body. The digital photographs were
    used to improve digital analysis and to discriminate between vegetative and soil
    pixels of similar temperature (example in Fig. 2b). The empirical wet reference
    crop water stress index, CWSIe, was calculated using Eq. (1), with Tw being the
    average temperature of the wet reference and Tdry being estimated by adding 5
    °C to the maximum dry bulb temperature recorded. The CWSIe ranged from 0 (no stress)
    to nearly 1 (stressed), at which point Tc was nearly equal to Tdry. The CWSIe
    values calculated from thermal imagery represented a one-time-of-day measurement
    only and were not used to calculate the seasonal average CWSIe values discussed
    later. 2.4. Infrared thermometry In all four years (2004–2008), the CWSIe was
    also determined using canopy temperature measurements obtained using IRTs. Sixteen
    IRTs (Exergen model IRT/c.5, Watertown, Mass.) with a 5:1 field of view were mounted
    on masts attached to the center pivot lateral, with two sensors facing into each
    treatment plot pointed towards the canopy at an oblique angle. One sensor was
    mounted at the outside edge of each plot and one sensor on the inside edge so
    that the sensors were aimed nearly towards each other from opposite sides of the
    plot to reduce sun angle effects on the average temperature. The center pivot
    passed over each plot during different times of the day, which required a method
    to determine the canopy temperature, Ts, at 13:00 CST in order to calculate the
    CWSIe at 13:00 CST. We used the scaling procedure described by Peters and Evett
    (2004b): (4) where Te (°C) was the predawn canopy temperature; Tref (°C) was the
    reference canopy temperature at the same time interval as Ts (°C) (i.e., 13:00
    CST); Trmt,t was the one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurement at the plot
    (remote location, denoted by subscript rmt) at any daylight time t measured by
    the IRTs on the pivot lateral; and Tref,t (°C) was the measured reference temperature
    for the time t that the plot (remote) temperature measurement was taken. The diel
    Tref,t was obtained using stationary IRTs mounted on fixed masts in the fully
    irrigated treatment plots. Plot-mean scaled canopy temperature measurements, Ts,
    for each treatment plot were substituted for crop canopy temperature, Tc, in Eq.
    (1). Signals from IRTs were measured and recorded every 10 s and averaged and
    stored each min. Average seasonal CWSIe values for each of the 48 plots were calculated
    from data measured on the days the pivot moved using scaled canopy temperatures
    (Ts) estimated for 13:00 CST. Again, the CWSIe was calculated using Tdry as the
    maximum daily dry-bulb temperature (Tmax) + 5 °C. The wet reference temperature,
    Tw, was estimated using Eq. (2). The value of γ in Eq. (2) was estimated at a
    barometric pressure of 88.91 kPa. In a sub-study, we evaluated whether Tdry should
    be used in place of Ta in Eq. (2) by comparing the result of Eq. (2) to measurements
    of physical wet reference surface temperatures. 2.5. Data analysis Linear regressions
    of CWSIe vs. leaf water potential were developed using temperature data extracted
    from thermal images. The average seasonal CWSIe values, calculated using temperature
    data measured using IRTs on the pivot lateral and with Tw estimated at 13:00 CST
    (Eqs. (3) and (4)), were linearly regressed against irrigation treatment amounts,
    seasonal water use (obtained by soil water balance), and crop yield. An analysis
    of variance was used to determine if irrigation amounts (0, 33, 67, and 100%)
    had a significant impact on the CWSIe when grouped by irrigation control method
    (manual vs. automatic). The Bonferroni t-test was used to compare whether mean
    CWSIe values were the same across irrigation treatment amounts and irrigation
    scheduling methods (manual or automatic). Analysis was performed using the ANOVA
    and SAS PROC MIXED procedures (SAS Institute Inc., 2007). We tested the homogeneity
    of regression coefficients for the manual and automatic methods of irrigation
    scheduling, when regressing water use and crop yields against the CWSIe, using
    methods discussed by Gomez and Gomez (1984). All significant differences are reported
    at the 5% probability level. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Irrigations, crop
    water use and meteorological data Average irrigations, change in soil water content,
    seasonal ETc and climatic data are summarized in Table 3. For soybean, average
    irrigation levels and average seasonal ETc across irrigation treatment amounts
    were greater for the manual method. The 2004 growing season experienced below
    average temperatures and above average rainfall, while in 2005, the reverse occurred
    with total rainfall being nearly 50% less (Table 3). Overall soybean ETc was higher
    in 2004 than in 2005, and initial soil water levels for both years were higher
    than the final soil water levels. Table 3. Average irrigation amounts, change
    in soil water storage, and seasonal crop water use (ETc) for each irrigation treatment

    the Texas High Plains ET Network (Howell et al., 1998). b Rainfall used in soil
    water balance calculations was based on rainfall (27 mm) occurring between initial
    and final soil water readings. Reviewing climatological data for the cotton growing
    seasons, extreme weather conditions prevailed in 2008. During the months of May
    and June, high winds and elevated daily air temperatures resulted in a 6% increase
    in ETo as compared to the same period in 2007. A cumulative rainfall amount of
    70 mm occurred from August 11 (DOY 224) through August 21 (DOY 234) in 2008. During
    this time, the sky was consistently overcast. In August of 2007, 56% of the rainfall
    occurred on the second day of the month (DOY 214) followed by two weeks of dry
    hot weather. Also of notable difference, in 2007, maximum daily air temperatures
    and ETo were highest for the months of June through August. In contrast, the average
    maximum daily air temperatures for July and August in 2008 dropped nearly 3.5
    °C and 2 °C from June''s average maximum daily air temperature. Soil water levels
    were higher at the end of growing season 2008 than at its start. Microclimatological
    measurements (Table 4) for each sampling day showed that air temperature was highest
    during the first two sampling days of the season and decreased by between 5 °C
    and 7 °C on the last sampling day. DOY 240 in 2007 was periodically cloudy, and
    care was taken to capture thermal images only when the clouds were not blocking
    the sun. The greatest maximum average air temperature and reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) occurred in July and August for each growing season when the average midday
    temperatures were >30 °C and either wind speed was nearly 5.0 m s−1 or relative
    humidity was <30%. Table 4. Average climatic data at midday (1200–1500 h), cumulative

    Thermal and digital images taken from the hydraulic lift over the 8 treatment
    plots enabled a clear distinction between shaded and sunlit soil and shaded and
    sunlit vegetation and their corresponding temperatures (examples for 2005, 2007
    and 2008 shown in Fig. 2). For the sampling days listed in Table 2, the CWSIe
    calculated from digital thermal imagery over plots 1–8 were compared with corresponding
    ΨL measurements. On most sampling days, ΨL decreased linearly as the CWSIe, calculated
    from thermal imager data, increased (Fig. 3). The most negative slope occurred
    in 2005 on DOY 258, where variability in ΨL was well explained by the CWSIe, (Fig.
    3a, r2 = 0.93). The inverse linear relationship was consistent throughout the
    entire 2007 growing season (r2 = 0.88), and on DOY 213, 2008 with r2 = 0.81 (Fig.
    3b). These linear relationships were similar to those reported by Jackson (1991)
    and Ben-Asher et al. (1992) when investigating plant water stress in cotton using
    the empirical CWSI developed by Idso et al. (1981). Cohen et al. (2005) and Möeller
    et al. (2007) also described similar relationships when comparing ΨL to the CWSIe
    (where the artificial wet reference was substituted for the non-stressed baseline
    temperature) for cotton and grapevine plants, respectively. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The inverse relationship between leaf water potential
    taken at midday and the empirical crop water stress index, CWSIe calculated using
    temperatures extracted from thermometric images in treatment plots 1–8 during
    the growing season: (a) 2005, soybean; and (b) 2007 and 2008, cotton. When ΨL
    was not significantly related to the CWSIe, the cause was either the inability
    to quickly establish spatial stress across the irrigation treatment plots after
    different irrigation treatments began (sampling days on DOY 215, 2005 and DOY
    203, 2008 were 2 and 3 days after the start of differential irrigation treatments)
    or heavy and continuous rainfall that eliminated treatment effects (DOY 237, 2005).
    Measurements on DOY 261, 2008 showed some variability in ΨL, but smaller differences
    in CWSIe values than would be expected from the regression relationships, meaning
    that crop canopy temperature did not vary much across irrigation amount treatments.
    Irrigation was terminated 36 days prior to this last sampling date, leaving little
    plant available soil water for cotton plants in all treatment plots, which meant
    that all plants were stressed and CWSIe values could be expected to be similar
    across plots. Overall, these results showed that the CWSIe was a good indicator
    of in-field spatial crop water stress, but results may be rendered inconclusive
    by the timing of the CWSIe (too soon after differential irrigation treatment has
    begun, after a heavy rainfall, or when all plants are stressed such that Tc approaches
    Tdry). 3.3. CWSIe and irrigation amount treatments The effects of irrigation amount
    treatments were expected to produce different levels of water-stress, whereby
    the higher amounts would result in less stress. This effect was verified by CWSIe
    values calculated for treatment plots using canopy temperatures extracted from
    thermal images. For the example of Fig. 2, the CWSIe was calculated to be 0.76,
    0.61, and 0.40 in irrigation treatment levels of I0%, I33%, and I100%, respectively.
    The same trend of decreasing CWSIe as irrigation amount increased, this time calculated
    using data from IRTs on the pivot, occurred in all four years (Table 5). In 2005
    through 2007, the CWSIe means for the higher irrigation treatments (I67% and I100%),
    although numerically quite different, were not significantly different. This is
    likely due to some unevenness across plots in initial soil profile water content,
    which resulted in some I67% plots having nearly the same profile water content
    as some I100% plots. In 2008, the mean value for the I0% treatment was not significantly
    greater than that for the I67% treatment. This was not surprising due to the high
    amount of rainfall received during the boll filling stage. Seasonal mean CWSIe
    values were similar at any irrigation amount for both automatic irrigation and
    manual irrigation; and the pattern of statistical differences among irrigation
    amount treatments was identical for both irrigation control methods (Table 5).
    Indeed, the seasonal average CWSIe between the two irrigation control methods
    (manual and automatic) was not significantly different across the same irrigation
    treatments (statistics not shown in Table 5). Table 5. Average seasonal empirical
    crop water stress index (CWSIe) value derived from IRT measurementsa for each

    water use, and yield Estimates of wet reference temperatures calculated using
    Eq. (2) with Tdry in place of Ta were closer in value to the measured artificial
    wet reference values extracted from the thermal imagery than were Tw values estimated
    using actual Ta at the time of measurement (Table 6). Therefore, Tdry was used
    in place of Ta in Eq. (2) for all estimates of Tw used to calculate CWSIe using
    IRT data. Table 6. Wet references temperatures extracted from thermal images for

    using mixed statistical models with the growing season year and irrigation control
    method (i.e., manual vs. automatic) treated as random effects. The growing season
    inter-annual variability was a significant factor influencing water use and yields,
    so we analyzed these relationships separately by years. Overall, the irrigation
    control methods (manual vs. automatic) did not significantly affect yields and
    water use, with the one exception of 2008 cotton as discussed below. As expected,
    significant negative linear relationships existed between crop water use and the
    CWSIe for each irrigation season (Fig. 4a–d), similar to results reported by Dogan
    et al. (2007). Water use efficiency was significantly greater for the automatic
    control plots in 2008 due to less total irrigation amounts applied during the
    season (Fig. 4d). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Negative linear
    relationship between crop water use and the season-mean CWSIe for each season:
    (a) soybean 2004; (b) soybean 2005; (c) cotton 2007; and (d) cotton 2008 for manual
    and automatic irrigation control methods. Linear regression analysis between the
    CWSIe and crop yield for each growing season explained 88% and 83% of the variation
    in soybean yields in 2004 and 2005, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). A single regression
    line was used to represent the data since the slopes between manual and automatic
    control treatment plots were not significantly different with 44 degrees of freedom
    for the 5% level of significance. In general, the plots experiencing the smallest
    seasonal average CWSIe resulted in the greatest water use and yields. This same
    trend was reported by Nielsen (1990) for soybean grown in Akron, Colorado under
    irrigation scheduling based on varying CWSI values. Similar to our results, Dogan
    et al. (2007) reported yields in the range of 0.36–0.37 kg m−2 for fully irrigated
    soybean (I100%) and average yields of 0.19 kg m−2 (I50%), 0.10 kg m−2 (I25%),
    and 0.03 kg m−2 (I0%) for deficit irrigation treatment levels. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Inverse linear correlations between the season-mean CWSIe
    and yields for both manually and automatically irrigated plots: dry grain yields
    for (a) soybean, 2004; (b) soybean 2005; and lint yields for (c) cotton, 2007;
    and (d) cotton, 2008. For cotton, the seasonal mean CWSIe explained 78% of the
    yield variations for all treatment plots in 2007 (Fig. 5c). Again, there was no
    significant difference between the regression coefficients for the manual and
    automatic methods of irrigation with 44 degrees of freedom for the 5% level. Similar
    to soybean, cotton lint yield was significantly related to growing season inter-annual
    variability. The 2007 linear relationship between lint yield (kg m−2) and the
    seasonal mean CWSIe, Yield = −0.22CWSIe + 0.24, was similar to the lint yield
    (LY, kg m−2) relationships reported by Reginato (1983), LY = −0.21CWSI + 0.18,
    and Howell et al. (1984), LY = −0.19CWSI + 0.18, for conventional row cotton with
    1.0 m spacing, where the CWSI was calculated using the empirical method of Idso
    et al. (1981). Although, the 2008 average season-long CWSIe increased as the irrigation
    treatment amounts decreased, there was not a consistent negative linear relationship
    between yield and the CWSIe (Fig. 5d). The slopes between the manual and automatic
    treatment plots were not significantly different and were therefore represented
    by a single slope. Cotton production during this growing season was affected by
    extreme weather conditions. Hot, dry winds at emergence slowed emergence and plant
    establishment, while heavy rainfall in mid August encouraged vegetative growth
    and hampered boll filling, particularly in the fully irrigated treatments. The
    combination of these impediments reduced fully irrigated yields by 70% from 2007.
    Although the average CWSIe values were inversely related to average lint yields
    when the fully irrigated treatment plots (I100%) were considered outliers (O''Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010), cotton yields from individual treatment plots were highly variable
    and not well predicted by the CWSIe. To demonstrate how soon in the irrigation
    season the relationship between the temporal-mean CWSIe and crop yield may be
    useful, the crop yield was regressed against a progressive average of the CWSIe
    calculated from the first date that the pivot moved to progressive dates on which
    it moved, including at each successive date all the data from the first date to
    that date. The coefficient of determination, r2, of the regression analysis was
    plotted against the number of days after the start of irrigation treatment applications
    (Fig. 6). The approximate time required to establish a stable correlation between
    crop yield and CWSIe was approximately 5 days for soybean in 2004 and 35 days
    for cotton in 2007. Not shown is 2005 data for soybean where the trend took approximately
    11 days to establish a stable correlation. The use of crop temperature data in
    this manner may provide producers with useful information regarding the effect
    of crop water stress on production. However, caution is advised since this method
    can fail as shown from data on cotton in 2008 (Fig. 5d) where there was no correlation
    between the temporal-mean CWSIe and crop yield. Values of temporal-mean CWSIe
    from the early vegetative phase of a crop may be less related to yield because
    yield in many crops is more influenced by water deficit stress during anthesis
    and the subsequent yield formation stages (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979). Also,
    early season CWSIe values may be influenced by soil background emittance; consequently,
    high surface radiometric temperature at early stages of plant development may
    not be a good indicator of plant water use or stress. However, as leaf area increases,
    surface radiometric temperatures become better indicators of plant water use and
    plant water stress. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Trend of coefficient
    of determination, r2, for the relationship between CWSIe and crop yield for: (a)
    soybean (2004); and (b) cotton (2007). Spatial and temporal variability of CWSIe
    were visually demonstrated with contour plot maps drawn using a SAS routine and
    linear interpolation. As an example, progressive mean CWSIe values were plotted
    spatially and contours drawn for four dates in 2007 (Fig. 7). In these figures,
    the solid squares represent the centers of the inner 48 treatment plots with the
    inner arc (smallest radii) representing the fallow edge of the field at the pivot
    point with an assigned CWSIe = 1.0, and the most outer row representing the fully
    irrigated border plots with an assigned CWSIe value = 0.1. The plotted mean CWSIe
    values were the values averaged from DOY 196 (start of irrigation amount treatments)
    through the date in the lower right hand corner of each contour map. The map for
    DOY 204 (8 days after the start of irrigation treatments) indicates that crop
    water stress was fairly homogeneous, with CWSIe ranging primarily between 0.59
    and 0.74 (Fig. 7a). During this time, the crop canopy width ranged between 20
    and 30 cm (data not shown) across treatment plots, indicating that the fraction
    of vegetation was less than full, and therefore soil emittance was likely a contributing
    factor for temperature readings that led to these relatively large calculated
    CWSIe values. By DOY 227, 31 days after irrigation amount treatments began, the
    middle (radially) sections of the field showed less stress; the CWSIe declined
    from ∼0.67 earlier to ∼0.44 along concentric plots representing I100%, I67% and
    I100% irrigation amount treatments (Fig. 7b). By DOY 236, 40 days after irrigation
    treatments began, CWSIe values for the greater irrigation treatment amounts, I100%
    and I67%, became visibly differentiated (light purple) as less stressed than those
    receiving less irrigation, I33% and I0% (yellow to light green) (Fig. 7c). By
    DOY 254, (September 11), two weeks after irrigations ceased and 30 mm of rainfall,
    the seasonal mean CWSIe values between the larger irrigation amount treatments
    (I100% and I67%) and the severe deficit and dryland treatments (I33% and I0%)
    remained large (Fig. 7d). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Spatial

    236, 38 days after start of irrigation treatments; and (d) DOY 254, 2 weeks after
    halting irrigation treatments. Spatial map for soybean crops 2004, 2005 and for
    cotton 2008 are not shown. 4. Conclusions and vision Results from this study demonstrated
    that the CWSIe calculated from infrared thermography images are related to ΨL
    measurements for both soybean and cotton taken in differentially irrigated treatment
    plots. Leaf water potential measurements decreased as the CWSIe increased after
    irrigation treatments were established and maintained. However, it should be noted
    that measurements taken too soon after rainfall events and termination of irrigations
    can confound this relationship. This study also showed that a useful empirical
    crop water stress index (CWSIe) can be calculated from measurements of canopy
    temperature, air temperature, and a “well-watered crop” surface temperature. The
    well-watered crop surface temperature can be measured directly using a physical
    wet reference or modeled. The use of maximum daily dry bulb temperature, Tdry,
    can be used as a substitute for air temperature at the time of measurement, Ta,
    to estimate wet reference surface temperature. However, estimating the wet reference
    temperature (with Eq. (2)) introduced uncertainty relative to the wet reference
    or non-water stressed baseline temperature and needs further investigation. An
    average seasonal CWSIe was computed using a modeled wet reference temperature,
    canopy temperature measurements made from remote IRTs mounted on a pivot lateral,
    and a proven scaling method for estimating one-time-of-day canopy temperatures.
    The average seasonal CWSIe so calculated was shown to be significantly correlated
    to crop yield response for two years of soybean and one year of cotton data. With
    2008 data, it was shown that the stress index did not correlate well when extreme
    weather conditions impacted cotton development. The CWSIe-yield relationship as
    a function of time over the differential irrigation season indicated that the
    approximate time required to establish a stable correlation between crop yield
    and CWSIe was much earlier for soybean, approximately 5–11 days, than for cotton,
    almost 35 days. Contour plots of the CWSIe plotted over time revealed spatial
    patterns of crop water stress that became more defined over time and were related
    to irrigation treatment amounts. Because the CWSIe requires few supplementary
    inputs, it can be an inexpensive method for providing feedback to a producer and
    used as a tool for prediction of spatial variation in yield and for monitoring
    crop water status throughout a growing season when within season weather conditions
    are not extremely variable. Use of the index normalizes data to ambient conditions
    and our method of calculating an empirical CWSI was well correlated with ΨL measurements,
    water use, and yields. These results also compared well with those from Howell
    et al. (1984) and Reginato (1983) for cotton. This work also shows how current
    available technology (instrumentation and scaling algorithms) with infrared thermometry
    mounted on a moving sprinkler system can provide spatial maps to represent within-field
    crop water status. The benefits provided from use of infrared thermometry give
    momentum for automated analysis of whole-field crop status using thermal imagery.
    Thermal imagery would be of more assistance to a farmer since it can provide a
    more detailed level of critical qualitative and quantitative information regarding
    within-field spatial and temporal crop water status. Infrared thermography could
    be used to scan an entire pivot field independent of pivot movement. However,
    fraction of vegetation, view angle, and cloud cover need to be taken into account
    as with the radiometer footprint model by Colaizzi et al. (2010). Methods are
    needed to automate the conversion of field infrared imagery to spatial maps for
    irrigation scheduling and site specific delivery of water. As thermal imagers
    become more affordable, automated digital analysis of field imagery taken at different
    times of the day and converted to useful and easily accessible data could provide
    decision support information to a producer. Future studies are needed to evaluate
    the consistency of this empirical CWSI for different crops and in different regions.

    Abstract Irrigation water supplies are decreasing in many areas of the US Great
    Plains, which is requiring many farmers to consider deficit-irrigating corn (Zea
    mays L.) or growing crops like winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that require
    less water, but that are less profitable. The objectives of this study were to:
    (1) quantify the yield response of corn to deficit irrigation, and (2) determine
    which of several seasonal water variables correlated best to corn yield in a semiarid
    climate. Eight (T1–T8) and nine (T1–T9) deficit-irrigated treatments (including
    dryland), were compared in 2003 and 2004 in North Platte, Nebraska. The actual
    seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETd) (calculated with procedures in FAO-56)
    for the different treatments was 37–79% in 2003 and 63–91% in 2004 compared with
    the seasonal crop evapotranspiration when water is not limited (ETw). Quantitative
    relationships between grain yield and several seasonal water variables were developed.
    Water variables included, irrigation (I), total water (Wall), rain + irrigation
    (WR+I), evaporation (E), crop evapotranspiration (ETd), crop transpiration (Td),
    and the ratios of ETd and Td to evapotranspiration and transpiration when water
    is not limited (ETw and Tw). Both years, yield increased linearly with seasonal
    irrigation, but the relationship varied from year to year. Combining data from
    both years, ETd had the best correlation to grain yield (yield = 0.028ETd–5.04,
    R2 = 0.95), and the water variables could be ranked from higher to lower R2 when
    related to grain yield as: . Crop water productivity (CWP) (yield per unit ETd)
    linearly increased with ETd/ETw (R2 = 0.75), which suggests that trying to increase
    CWP by deficit-irrigating corn is not a good strategy under the conditions of
    this study. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords EvapotranspirationDeficit

    Introduction Irrigation water supplies are decreasing in many areas of the Great
    Plains of the USA. Some of the reasons for this decrease include extended drought
    periods, decline in groundwater levels (McGuire, 2004, McGuire and Fischer, 1999),
    litigation among states related to surface water allocations, and diversion of
    water from irrigation to environmental uses (Lingle and Franti, 1998). This situation
    is forcing farmers to consider the options of deficit-irrigating crops like corn
    or growing alternative crops like winter wheat that require less irrigation water,
    but that are generally less profitable. Knowing the quantitative response of crops
    to limited water supplies under specific environments is critical to be able to
    perform economic comparisons among local cropping options. In the US Great Plains,
    developing local and current information on water–yield relationships is particularly
    important for corn (Zea mays L.), since this crop covers more irrigated area than
    any other crop in the region (Norwood, 2000). Deficit irrigation creates water
    stress that can affect the growth and development of corn plants. The response
    of corn plants to water stress has been shown to change with hybrid (Lorens et
    al., 1987) and can be affected by improving technological level (Dale and Daniels,
    1995). Effects of water stress on corn include the visible symptoms of reduced
    growth, delayed maturity, and reduced crop yield. For instance, water stress has
    been shown to reduce corn canopy height (Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Gavloski et al.,
    1992, Traore et al., 2000), leaf area index (NeSmith and Ritchie, 1992, Traore
    et al., 2000), and root growth (Gavloski et al., 1992, Jama and Ottman, 1993).
    Jama and Ottman (1993) found that stressing corn during the vegetative stage in
    an arid environment hindered root development, which restricted deep water uptake.
    However, in a wetter environment in eastern Nebraska, Newell and Wilhelm (1987)
    found that although a fully irrigated corn treatment had greater total profile
    (0–1.5 m) and surface (0–0.15 m) root length at the reproductive stage, dryland
    and a deficit-irrigated treatments had relatively greater root length proliferation
    deep in the soil profile. The effect of water stress on reducing corn grain and
    biomass yields has also been studied (Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Traore et al., 2000).
    Grain yield can be reduced by decreasing yield components like ear size, number
    of kernel per ear, or the kernel weight. Claassen and Shaw (1970) observed that
    stress before or during silking and pollination resulted in reduced kernel number,
    while stress during or after silking reduced kernel weight. NeSmith and Ritchie
    (1992) attributed yield loss from water stress during pre-anthesis to a reduction
    in the number of well-developed kernels. Bryant et al. (1992) indicated that water
    stress reduces yield by reducing accumulated biomass and the harvest index (ratio
    of grain yield to aboveground plant dry weight). Traore et al. (2000), however,
    found that the harvest index was affected by water deficit only when stress was
    imposed during anthesis. Many researchers have evaluated the effect of stress
    timing on corn yield (Robins and Domingo, 1953, Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Barnes
    and Woolley, 1969, Downey, 1971, Claassen and Shaw, 1970, Jurgens et al., 1978,
    NeSmith and Ritchie, 1992, Bryant et al., 1992, Jama and Ottman, 1993). Others
    have developed models to quantify the effect of stress timing on yield (Jensen,
    1968, Nairizi and Rydzewski, 1977, Doorenbos et al., 1979, Doorenbos and Kassam,
    1979, Meyer et al., 1993a, Meyer et al., 1993b). For instance, Doorenbos et al.
    (1979) proposed that the effect of water stress on yield could be quantified by
    a linear function where the slope of the line (ky) was an empirical yield response
    factor that varied depending on the growth stage when water stress occurred. For
    corn, they reported ky values of 0.4, 1.5, 0.5, and 0.2 for the vegetative, flowering,
    yield formation, and ripening stages, indicating that yield was more affected
    by water stress during the flowering stage than at any other stage. This model
    suggests that if water is limited, the irrigator should time irrigation to coincide
    with the most sensitive stage. Despite the body of evidence indicating that stress
    timing has an effect on corn yield, there is also indication that corn yield is
    just a linear function of seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) or transpiration (T),
    with no regard for stress timing. For instance, good linear relationship between
    corn yield and seasonal ET have been reported by Robins and Domingo (1953), Hanks
    (1974), Hanks et al. (1976), Gilley et al. (1980), Schneekloth et al. (1991),
    Barrett and Skogerboe (1978), Stone (2003), and Klocke et al. (2004). The data
    reported by Benoit et al. (1965) also follow a linear yield-ET function with R2
    ≥ 0.79. Barrett and Skogerboe (1978) pointed out that the scatter in the published
    crop yield versus water use data largely resulted from the time of occurrence
    of water deficits in relation to the stage of growth. However, they also stated
    that if these yields are plotted versus seasonal ET rather than the quantity of
    water applied, the data would likely fall on a straight line. The objectives of
    this study were to: (1) quantify the grain yield response of corn to deficit irrigation
    and (2) determine which of several seasonal water variables correlated best to
    corn grain yield under deficit irrigation conditions in the semiarid climate of
    West-Central Nebraska. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description Field data
    for this study were collected in 2003 and 2004 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
    West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte, Nebraska (41.1°N, 100.8°W,
    861 m above sea level). The soil at North Platte is a Cozad silt loam (Fluventic
    Haplustolls) with field capacity of 0.29 m3 m−3 and permanent wilting point of
    0.11 m3 m−3 (Klocke et al., 1999). The corn hybrid DeKalb C57-40 RR was planted
    at 0.76-m row spacing in 2003 and Renze 9363 Bt RR was planted in 2004. These
    hybrids had comparative relative maturities that are commonly planted in the area
    and were chosen for being the top yielding hybrids in local variety trials during
    the previous year. In 2003 corn was planted on May 13, and harvested on October
    13. In 2004, corn was planted on May 10 and harvested on November 15. The experimental
    plots were located within a relatively large irrigated area. Plots were irrigated
    using a solid-set sprinkler system, which was arranged in a grid with a sprinkler
    head installed on a 3.35-m riser at each corner of each plot. Each experimental
    plot was 12.2 m × 12.2 m (148.8 m2) in size, which accommodated 16 corn rows.
    The center four rows of each plot were harvested using a plot combine. Experimental
    plots were separated from each other by 12.2-m wide border strips that were also
    planted to corn. Water for the system was pumped from the Ogallala aquifer, using
    an electric turbine pump with a capacity of 600 GPM at 483 kPa of pressure. The
    mainline at the pumping station was instrumented with two pressure gauges, two
    flow meters, a pressure relief valve, a chemigation check valve, and “high” and
    “low” pressure switches. The flow meters measured both the instantaneous flow
    rate and the cumulative volume of water pumped. The irrigation system had an automatic
    control panel hard-wired to electric valves installed at each plot. Each electric
    valve controlled the four sprinklers of each plot. The control panel was also
    connected to a manual relay panel, which allowed both manual and automatic operation
    of the irrigation system. This design allowed irrigating each individual plot
    independently, and changing the randomizing of the plots from year to year to
    accommodate different experimental designs. The average weather conditions at
    North Platte during the study are shown in Table 1. In general, weather conditions
    were cooler and wetter during the 2004 growing season than in 2003. Although the
    average air temperature during June–October was only 0.6 °C cooler in 2004, it
    was approximately 2.2 °C cooler during the months of June, July, and August. These
    cooler weather conditions during 2004 delayed crop maturity and harvest about
    a month compared with 2003. Warmer conditions, however, prevailed in 2004 compared
    with 2003 during the months of May and September. Although weather conditions
    were cooler in 2004, the average of the daily grass-reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) values for the entire May–October period was only 0.02 mm d−1 lower during
    2004 (Table 1). In 2004, the average daily ETo values were lower than 2003 during
    the months of July, August, and October, and higher during May, June, and September.
    Average daily ETo values in 2004 were particularly lower than 2003 during the
    months of July and August, which are usually the months with the peak ETo values
    for the North Platte area. Table 1. Average of daily values of maximum air temperature

    2004 (Fig. 1). A total of 22 rainfall events occurred during the 2003 growing
    season, which totaled 138 mm of water. In 2003, the total in-season rainfall was
    only enough to supply approximately 19.4% of seasonal crop water requirements
    (ETw). In 2004, however, there were 39 rainfall events, almost twice as many as
    in 2003. Rainfall in 2004 totaled 414 mm, which supplied more than half (54.5%)
    of the seasonal crop water requirements. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    treatments The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design
    with four replications. Eight irrigation treatments (T1–T8) were applied in 2003
    and the number of treatments was increased to nine (T1–T9) in 2004. Each year,
    treatments included a dryland treatment (treatment T8 in 2003 and T9 in 2004)
    (Table 2), which received no irrigation. This many treatments were included to
    obtain enough data points and a wide enough range of water stress levels to be
    able to develop meaningful quantitative relationships between grain yield and
    several seasonal water variables, including irrigation, total water, rain + irrigation,
    evaporation, evapotranspiration, and transpiration, among others. Table 2. Irrigation

    a % of ETw is the percent of seasonal crop evapotranspiration when soil water
    is not limiting that was supplied by irrigation. Irrigation to the different treatments
    was scheduled trying to create differences in soil water depletions of approximately
    10 mm between irrigated treatments, within the range of 150–250 mm. This range
    of soil water depletion represents between 50 and 85% of total available water
    in the maximum crop rooting depth. No irrigation was applied during the vegetative
    growth stage, following a common practice in the area, and to make sure that there
    would be some seasonal crop stress despite potential rainfall occurring later
    in the growing season. Depths and timings of irrigation events applied to each
    irrigation treatment during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons are shown in Table
    2. Due to more in-season rainfall, seasonal irrigation amounts and the number
    of irrigation events per treatment were significantly less in 2004 than 2003.
    In 2003, seasonal irrigation depths per treatment ranged from approximately 245
    to 395 mm. These seasonal irrigation depths supplied between 34.7 and 55.7% of
    seasonal crop water requirements (ETw). In 2004, seasonal irrigation depths ranged
    from 34 to 161 mm, representing between 4.7 and 21.2% of seasonal ETw. In 2003,
    the first irrigation to some of the irrigated treatments was applied in early
    July. In 2004, rainfall early in the season allowed delaying the first irrigation
    to any of the treatments until early August. The last irrigation during both years
    was applied in early September. Irrigation scheduling at both sites was done using
    a scheduling spreadsheet that used the calculated daily corn evapotranspiration
    as input to estimate daily soil water content in the crop root zone. When actual
    soil water measurements were available, they were used to adjust the spreadsheet
    estimates. Soil water measurements were made approximately every 2 weeks during
    the growing season using the neutron scattering method. Soil water readings were
    taken from 50-mm diameter aluminum access tubes installed at the center of two
    of the four replications for each treatment. Readings were taken at 0.3-m depth
    increments to a depth of 1.8 m. Weather data for this study were obtained from
    an automatic weather station located within 1.5 km from the research site. This
    weather station was part of the High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC) weather
    network. Daily weather data were downloaded from the HPRCC web site (http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/home.html),
    including daily maximum and minimum air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed,
    rainfall, solar radiation, reference ET, and crop ET for different crops, including
    corn. 2.3. Data analyses The statistical analyses of yield data, which included
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) and separation of means by the Duncan''s new multiple
    range test, were conducted using the SAS® System for Windows® statistical software
    (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). A computer program was written in Microsoft Visual
    Basic® to model the daily soil water status. Basic input to the program included
    daily weather data, rainfall, irrigation, the soil water profile at crop emergence,
    and crop-specific and site-specific information such as planting date, maturity
    date, soil parameters, maximum rooting depth, etc. Based on these inputs, the
    water balance in the crop root zone was calculated on a daily basis. Similar soil
    water balance models have previously been used by Robinson and Hubbard (1990),
    Swan et al. (1990), and Bryant et al. (1992) to estimate daily water status and
    yield for corn. The computer program calculated evapotranspiration using the procedure
    presented in FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998). Since this is a lengthy procedure, readers
    are referred to the original source for details. According to this procedure,
    crop evapotranspiration can be obtained as the product of the evapotranspiration
    of a reference crop (ETo) and a crop coefficient (Kc). ETo is calculated using
    the daily weather data as input to the Penman–Monteith equation, and the Kc is
    used to adjust the estimated ETo for the reference crop to that of other crops
    at different growth stages and growing environments. ETo is the evapotranspiration
    of a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0.12 m, a fixed
    surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23. The reference surface closely
    resembles an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively growing,
    completely shading the ground and with adequate water (Allen et al., 1998). The
    dual crop coefficient approach was used to separate the two components of evapotranspiration,
    namely evapotation (E) and transpiration (T) (Wright, 1982). For corn, this procedure
    linearly reduced crop evapotranspiration when the root zone depletion exceeded
    55% (taken from Table 22 in FAO-56) of total available water, which was used to
    quantify the effect of water stress on corn water use. The dual crop coefficient
    procedure also accounts for the sharp increases in evaporation due to a wet soil
    surface following rain or irrigation. This procedure permitted calculation of
    the crop evapotranspiration and transpiration when soil water is not limiting
    (ETw and Tw), and the actual crop evapotranspiration, transpiration, and evaporation
    (ETd, Td, and E). From the seasonal values, the seasonal ETd/ETw and Td/Tw ratios
    were calculated for each treatment. It was expected that the seasonal ETd/ETw
    and Td/Tw ratios would relate to crop yield. Additionally, in FAO-56, an equation
    was presented to estimate the fraction of total available soil water in the root
    zone (p) that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress (reduction
    in ETd) occurs. This equation estimates a variable p (pcalc) as a function of
    daily ETw as: (7) where, ptable is the p value taken from Table 22 in FAO-56,
    and ETw is in mm day−1 and 0.1 ≤ pcalc ≤ 0.8. This equation suggests that as ETw
    for a given day decreases, it is easier for the crop to sustain ETw rates, and
    therefore, higher soil water depletion levels could be allowed without yield loss,
    as previously proposed by Doorenbos et al. (1979). This way of calculating a variable
    p value differs from the common procedure of using a fixed p value for a given
    crop for the entire growing season. In this study, the daily pcalc values were
    calculated, which were taken as the theoretical optimum depletion value for a
    given day. Also, a daily actual p (pactual) was calculated as: (8) (9) where D
    is the soil water depletion in the crop root zone (mm), ⊖FC the soil water content
    at field capacity (m3 m−3), ⊖PWP the soil water content at permanent wilting point
    (m3 m−3), Zr the crop rooting depth (m), and TAW is the total available soil water
    in the crop root zone (mm). A maximum rooting depth of 1.7 m was assumed for corn
    (taken from Table 22 in FAO-56). In this study, it was expected that pdiff = (pactual
    − pcalc) accumulated for the entire season only for days when pdiff > 0 (seasonal
    pdiff) would be a good indicator of the level of crop stress and would, therefore,
    relate to crop yield. The greater the seasonal pdiff for a given treatment the
    greater the level of water stress. Seasonal pdiff was therefore calculated for
    each treatment. The effect of irrigation treatments on crop yield was also evaluated
    by calculating the crop water productivity (CWP) (Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004)
    as: (10) where Ya is the crop yield (kg ha−1), seasonal ETd the seasonal actual
    crop evapotranspiration (mm), and CWP is in kg m−3. Since 1 ha-mm = 10 m3, 10
    is needed to convert CWP from units of kg ha−1 mm−1 to kg m−3. The CWP is sometimes
    equivalent to water use efficiency (WUE) as defined by Howell (2000), although
    sometimes researchers define WUE in terms of seasonal irrigation applied instead
    of seasonal ETd. This study also evaluated the relationships between several other
    water variables and corn grain yield. These variables included seasonal ETd, Td,
    E, irrigation applied (I), rain + irrigation (WR+I), and total water available
    to crop during the growing season (Wall). Grain yields were also normalized by
    calculating the % yield potential (%Yp) and the % maximum yield (%Ymax). The maximum
    yield obtained within each season was taken as a reference to calculate %Ymax.
    The potential yield for each season was estimated using the Hybrid-Maize simulation
    model developed by Yang et al. (2004). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Yield response
    to water deficit Irrigation treatments resulted in differences in daily soil water
    depletions in the crop root zone as shown in Fig. 2. To avoid water stress, best
    management practices commonly recommend maintaining root zone depletion below
    the readily available water (RAW) line (Fig. 2). Fig. 2, however, shows that in
    2003, delaying irrigation until early July resulted in water stress for all treatments
    occurring after mid June. Limited water inputs after that time also resulted in
    water stress levels for the different treatments that ranged from mild to severe.
    In 2004, except for the dryland treatment, stress to most treatments only occurred
    after mid July. Limited water inputs in 2004 also resulted in some level of stress
    for all treatments, especially late in the growing season. In 2004, similarly
    to 2003, the dryland treatment suffered from water stress during most of the growing
    season, although the level of stress at the end of the growing season for this
    treatment was more severe in 2003 than 2004. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Daily soil water depletion in the crop root zone for the different irrigation
    treatments (T1–T9) at North Platte during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons. TAW
    is the total available water in the crop root zone and RAW is the readily available
    water (RAW = 0.55TAW). Irrigation treatments also resulted in differences in seasonal
    values of several water variables as shown in Table 3. Although the 2004 growing
    season was cooler and wetter than 2003, the seasonal values of ETw were higher
    in 2004 due to the longer growing season, resulting from delayed crop maturity,
    and to increased soil evaporation due to more frequent wetting of the soil surface
    by rainfall. Values of seasonal ETd for the different treatments were also higher
    in 2004 since there was more water available to the crop compared with 2003. The
    seasonal values of ETd/ETw per treatment ranged from 0.37 to 0.79 in 2003 and
    from 0.63 to 0.91 in 2004. The values of the ETd/ETw ratio indicate that all treatments
    experienced some water stress during the growing season. No deep percolation (Dp)
    occurred during the study for any of the irrigation treatments. Table 3. Seasonal

    ETw, seasonal crop evapotranspiration when soil water is not limiting; Wall, water
    available to the crop from all sources, including irrigation, rainfall and water
    already stored in the soil at crop emergence; WR+I, rainfall plus irrigation water;
    Wsoil, water stored in the soil profile at crop emergence, to a depth equal to
    the maximum root depth; Td, seasonal actual transpiration; Tw, seasonal transpiration
    when soil water is not limiting; E, seasonal evaporation; Dp, seasonal deep percolation;

    a ETd, seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration. In 2004, there was slightly more
    seasonal evaporation (E) for all treatments compared with 2003. The values for
    E/ETw in Table 3 show that the seasonal evaporation represented about 1/3 of ETw
    during both seasons for all treatments. This is a significant amount of water
    that does not directly contribute to crop yield. In this study, however, most
    of the evaporation resulted from rainfall instead of irrigation. Most of the E
    also occurred early in the growing season when there was a partial canopy cover
    and the soil surface was exposed to direct solar energy. To achieve the objective
    of producing more crop yield per unit of water there is still potential for reducing
    the evaporation component of ETw in addition to the application of other water-saving
    techniques (Kijne et al., 2003). Irrigation treatments also resulted in differences
    in grain yields as shown in Table 4. Higher yields were obtained in 2004 since
    there was more water available to the crop in all treatments compared with 2003.
    The analysis of variance resulted in significant yield differences during both
    growing seasons. However, during the 2003 season the separation of means analysis
    resulted in five different groups of treatments, while in 2004 only the dryland
    treatment (T9) had significantly lower grain yield than the other treatments.
    Running the Hybrid-maize simulation model of Yang et al. (2004) assuming adequate
    irrigation, potential yields for corn at North Platte were estimated at 13.3 Mg
    ha−1 for 2003 and 16.9 Mg ha−1 for 2004. These potential yields were used to calculate
    the % potential yield (%Yp) shown in Table 4. The maximum yield was 10.1 Mg ha−1
    in 2003 and 14.2 Mg ha−1 in 2004. Based on these maximum yields, the % maximum
    yield (%Ymax) per treatment was also calculated (Table 4). The %Yp for the different
    irrigation treatments ranged between 17.7 and 75.9% in 2003 and from 47.4 to 83.8%
    in 2004. During both years, soil water deficit was the main yield-limiting factor.

    for 2003 and 16.9 Mg ha−1 for 2004 using the Hybrid-Maize simulation model (Yang
    et al., 2004). a ANOVA was used to determine significance of treatment main effect
    for yield for each year. The Duncan New Multiple Range test was used to separate
    means when the treatment main effect was significant. For a given year, yields
    with the same letter are not significantly different. 3.2. Effect of seasonal
    water variables on grain yield The relationships between yield and several seasonal
    water variables obtained during 2003 and 2004 are shown in Fig. 3. Results of
    regression analyses for the different water variables are shown in Table 5, which
    include the results of the regression analyses for each year and also combining
    data for both years. Fig. 3 and Table 5 indicate that in 2003 there were very
    good linear relationships among all the yield and water variables. The poorest
    relationships were between evaporation and grain yield, which resulted in R2 =
    0.58, and between ETd/ETw and CWP, which resulted in R2 = 0.74. All other relationships
    resulted in R2 > 0.90. Among all variables, the ones relating best to grain yield
    in 2003 were irrigation, Wall, and rain + irrigation, and ETd, which all resulted
    in a high R2 value of 0.94. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Relationships

    yield for each season, grain yield is in Mg ha−1, and all water variables are

    evapotranspiration. For 2004, however, irrigation, rain + irrigation, and evaporation
    were all poorly related to grain yield. Also, ETd/ETw was poorly related to CWP
    in 2004, which could be due to the small range of CWP values obtained that year.
    All other variables were well-correlated to grain yield during 2004, resulting
    in R2 ≥ 0.84. The poor relationship between irrigation and grain yield during
    2004 could be due to several factors. First, the small seasonal irrigation amounts
    applied during 2004 did not provide a large enough range of irrigation among treatments
    to be able to observe significant yield differences, with the only exception of
    the dryland treatment. Second, some of the irrigation water may have been applied
    too late in the season to some of the treatments to be able to make an impact
    on crop yield. For instance, no grain yield increase resulted from applying an
    additional 48 mm of irrigation to treatment T1 late in the growing season (on
    September 8, 2004) compared to treatment T5, which received the last irrigation
    on August 25, 2004 (Table 2). Both of these treatments produced the same yield,
    although T1 received 161 mm of irrigation, while T5 only received approximately
    62 mm. The difference was that there was a higher amount of soil water left in
    the T1 treatment at the end of the season compared to T5 (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows
    that at the end of the growing season, there was still some water available in
    the soil profile that the crop did not have time to use because it resulted from
    rainfall or rain that occurred too late in the growing season to have an impact
    on crop yield. Norwood (2000) in a 4-year study with corn in Kansas found that
    considerable water remained in the soil profile after harvest. These results point
    out the importance of applying all irrigations early enough in the growing season
    so that the crop has time to use the water and convert it into grain. Fig. 3 reflects
    the considerable variations in the relationship between grain yield and irrigation
    that can occur from one season to the next, as previously reported by Norwood
    (2000). These variations depend on how much water is stored in the soil profile
    at crop emergence, and the amount and distribution of in-season rainfall. These
    results also point out the importance of calculating variables that relate crop
    yield to available soil water (i.e., CWP or water use efficiency) in terms of
    water variables that are more stable than seasonal irrigation. Some of these more
    stable water variables include seasonal ETd, Td, ETd/ETw, Wall, Td/Tw, or pdiff.
    When data for 2003 and 2004 were combined, irrigation had the poorest relationship
    to grain yield (R2 = 0.06) among all variables, followed by rain + irrigation
    (R2 = 0.65) (Table 5). Even evaporation was better related to grain yield than
    the two previous variables (R2 = 0.75). Although evaporation itself might not
    contribute to crop yield directly, it is well-correlated to ETd (R2 = 0.69), which
    does contribute to yield. All the remaining variables were highly correlated to
    grain yield. Combining both years, ETd had the best correlation to grain yield,
    and the water variables could be ranked from higher to lower resulting R2 when
    related to grain yield as: . The ranking of these variables, however, could change
    for other locations, when combining data for more than one location, or when considering
    an individual year or season. For instance, it was previously shown that during
    the dry 2003 season, irrigation, Wall, and rain + irrigation had the highest correlation
    to crop yield of all the variables, while irrigation and rain + irrigation had
    a poor correlation to yield when data for the two seasons were combined. Normalizing
    grain yield as %Ymax or %Yp did not produce a significant improvement in the relationships
    between yield and the seasonal water variables compared in this study. Fig. 3
    shows that in this study, it took approximately 180 mm of seasonal ETd for the
    crop to start producing grain yield. This number can be derived from the equation
    of the line obtained using the 2003 and 2004 data combined in Table 5 (yield =
    0.028ETd − 5.04), assuming a grain yield = 0 Mg ha−1 (seasonal ETd = 5.04/0.028
    = 180 mm). The slope of the line indicates that grain yield increased with seasonal
    ETd at a rate of 0.028 Mg ha−1 mm−1. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the yield-ETd
    linear relationship obtained in this study and those functions reported by other
    researchers. This plot seems to suggest that corn response to water could change
    with environment and time as new crop hybrids are developed and management practices
    improve. The slope of the line obtained in this study, however, is very similar
    to those reported by Schneekloth et al. (1991) and Klocke et al. (2004) for the
    same location. Schneekloth et al. (1991) reported an average yield-ETd slope for
    two corn crop rotations (continuous corn and wheat–corn–soybean) during a three-year
    study of 0.030 Mg ha−1 mm−1. Klocke et al. (2004) also reported yield-ETd slope
    for corn at North Platte of 0.030 Mg ha−1 mm−1, although the intercept of the
    line (−8.5 Mg ha−1) was smaller than the one obtained in this study (−5.04 Mg
    ha−1). For the same location, Hergert et al. (1993) also reported an average marginal
    return for corn from the application of a deficit irrigation treatment of 150
    mm of water of 0.027 Mg ha−1 mm−1, which was very similar to the slope of the
    yield-ETd line obtained in this study. Stone (2003), however, reported a long-term
    yield-ETd slope for corn in Kansas of 0.033 Mg ha−1 mm−1, which is slightly higher
    than the slope found in this study. This difference could be due to differences
    in techniques used to quantify seasonal ETd and yield, differences in climate
    between locations (especially the amount and distribution of in-season rainfall),
    differences in crop varieties and cultural practices, irrigation method, differences
    in irrigation scheduling practices, etc. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    4. Linear relationships between corn grain yield and actual seasonal evapotranspiration
    (ETd) reported in the literature and that obtained in this study. The CWP increased
    with ETd/ETw, resulting in a R2 = 0.75 when data for both years were combined
    (Table 5). These results suggest that trying to increase CWP by using deficit
    irrigation might not be a beneficial strategy under the conditions of this study
    as suggested by other researchers. For instance, Zwart and Bastiaanssen (2004)
    reviewed measured CWP for several crops around the world, including corn, and
    concluded that the CWP could be significantly increased if irrigation was reduced
    and crop water deficit was intentionally induced. Deficit irrigation would probably
    increase CWP only in situations where crops are being over-irrigated. The results
    of this study suggest that if the crop is already deficit-irrigated, lowering
    irrigation inputs would only contribute to further reduce yields, lowering CWP.
    Howell (2000) showed that WUE (calculated the same as CWP in this study) for corn
    increased as yield increased. It is important, however, to point out that the
    objective of most farmers is not to maximize CWP, but to maximize profits. Therefore,
    there could be very good reasons for applying deficit irrigation other than trying
    to maximize CWP. For example, Norwood (2000) concluded that for corn, deficit-irrigation
    combined with proper fertility and plant population was a viable alternative to
    dryland in Kansas where groundwater resources are declining. Some economic justifications
    for deficit irrigation strategies for corn in Nebraska have been reported by Klocke
    et al. (2004) and Schneekloth et al. (1995). 4. Conclusions Quantitative relationships
    between grain yield and several seasonal water variables were developed. Seasonal
    water variables included, irrigation (I), total water (Wall), rain + irrigation
    (WR+I), evaporation (E), actual crop evapotranspiration (ETd), actual crop transpiration
    (Td), ETd/ETw, Td/Tw, and pdiff. Several of the water variables were also related
    to grain yield normalized as % maximum yield and % potential yield. A relationship
    between crop water productivity (CWP) and ETd/ETw was developed. Results indicated
    that E accounted for about 1/3 of seasonal ETw, which indicates that technologies
    to minimize E should be developed and implemented. The linear relationship between
    grain yield and some of the water variables changed significantly from year to
    year, while others were very consistent. Combining data from both years, ETd had
    the best correlation to corn grain yield (yield = 0.028ETd − 5.04, R2 = 0.95).
    The water variables could be ranked from higher to lower R2 when related to grain
    yield as: . The CWP linearly increased with ETd/ETw (R2 = 0.75). These results
    indicate that trying to increase CWP by imposing deficit irrigation for corn might
    not be a beneficial strategy under the conditions of this study. However, it is
    recognized that there could be other good justifications for deficit irrigating
    corn in this environment, other than increasing CWP. References Allen et al.,

    all metrics Abstract Because of the increasing worldwide shortage of freshwater
    and costs of irrigation, a new plant-based irrigation scheduling method is proposed.
    In this method, two real-time plant-based measurements (sap flow and stem diameter
    variations) are used in combination with a mathematical water flow and storage
    model in order to predict the stem water potential. The amount of required irrigation
    water is derived from a time integration of the sap flow profile, while the timing
    of the irrigation is controlled based on a reference value for the predicted stem
    water potential. This reference value is derived from the relationship between
    midday values of maximum photosynthesis rates and stem water potential. Since
    modelling is an important part of the proposed methodology, a thorough mathematical
    analysis (identifiability analysis) of the model was performed. This analysis
    showed that an initial (offline) model calibration was needed based on measurements
    of sap flow, stem diameter variation and stem water potential. Regarding irrigation
    scheduling, however, only sap flow and stem diameter variation measurements are
    needed for online simulation and daily model calibration. Model calibration is
    performed using a moving window of 4 days of past data of stem diameter variations.
    The research tool STACI (Software Tool for Automatic Control of Irrigation) was
    used to optimally combine the continuous measurements, the mathematical modelling
    and the real-time irrigation scheduling. The new methodology was successfully
    tested in a pilot-scale setup with young potted apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh)
    and its performance was critically evaluated. Similar content being viewed by

    Today, irrigation is the largest single consumer of water on the planet, accounting
    for about 20% of the total amount of freshwater consumed and about two-thirds
    of the total diverted for human uses (Fereres and Evans 2006). Given the increasing
    worldwide shortage of freshwater and costs of irrigation, there is an urgent need
    for improved, more accurate irrigation strategies to conserve water, minimize
    water wastage and to keep the associated costs down. These new irrigation strategies
    should provide agricultural and horticultural plants with an optimal amount of
    water at an optimal time instance. Initially, irrigation scheduling was developed
    to avoid plant drought stress. To this end, sensors to continuously monitor either
    soil moisture or plant water status have been proposed as tools for irrigation
    scheduling (e.g. Campbell and Campbell 1982; Jones 1990; Goldhamer et al. 1999;
    Goldhamer 2003; Jones 2004; Intrigliolo and Castel 2004). The strengths and weaknesses
    of each of the available irrigation approaches have been reviewed in detail by
    Jones (2004). Techniques for sensing plant drought responses have shown that a
    potential problem with traditional soil-water based approaches is that many plant
    physiological features respond directly to changes in water status in the plant
    tissues, rather than to changes in the bulk soil water content (or potential)
    (McCutchan and Shackel 1992; Jones 2004). Irrigation scheduling decisions based
    on soil moisture status are therefore less appropriate when, for instance, a certain
    level of plant water deficit is considered favourable when attempting to control
    the flow of carbohydrates to reproductive structures such as fruit (Chalmers et
    al. 1981; Fereres and Evans 2006; Naor 2006). As a result, it has been suggested
    that greater precision in the application of irrigation can be obtained by using
    plant-based measurements (e.g. Jones 1990; Jones 2004), which fits within the
    “speaking plant” approach (Udink ten Cate 1978). The use of the plant itself as
    an indicator of irrigation requirements implies a rigorous and sensitive measure
    of the plant water status. Various workers have proposed the use of the stem water
    potential (Ψ(stem)) as a robust and direct indicator of the plant water status,
    which can be of use in irrigation scheduling (e.g. Begg and Turner 1970; Garnier
    and Berger 1985; McCutchan and Shackel 1992; Naor et al. 1995, 1997; Shackel et
    al. 1997; Goldhamer 2003; Naor and Cohen 2003; Intrigliolo and Castel 2004; Doltra
    et al. 2007). However, the use of the classical pressure chamber method (Begg
    and Turner 1970; McCutchan and Shackel 1992) to determine Ψ(stem) is not suited
    for automatic irrigation scheduling or control, because of its destructive nature.
    Although it may be possible to use automated stem hygrometers (Dixon and Tyree
    1984), these instruments are notoriously unreliable in practice (Naor and Cohen
    2003; Jones 2004; Doltra et al. 2007), giving good data only in expert hands (Jones
    2007). Modelling the dynamics of Ψ(stem) based on continuously measured variables
    on the plant itself or in its microenvironment may serve as a good alternative
    to the tedious measurements of Ψ(stem). Such models are already available in scientific
    literature (e.g. Zweifel et al. 2001; Steppe et al. 2006), but their practical
    application in irrigation scheduling has not been exploited so far. The main objective
    of this paper is to present a newly developed methodology for plant-based irrigation
    scheduling. The proposed methodology predicts when and how much water is required
    by the plant based on modelling stem water potential and continuous measurements
    of sap flow and stem diameter variations. In contrast to earlier studies, sensors
    for continuous plant-based monitoring are not used as alternatives for direct
    water status measurements or to directly sense the plant response to water deficit,
    but are used in combination with a mechanistic water flow and storage model to
    predict the dynamic behaviour of Ψ(stem). The paper highlights how the water flow
    and storage model, which was originally developed to gain new scientific insight
    in the functioning of the stem diameter, is combined with continuously measured
    sap flow rates and stem diameter variations to predict the amount of water required
    by the plant as well as the timing for irrigation using modelled Ψ(stem). Initial
    model calibration and determination of a critical threshold of Ψ(stem) pertinent
    to the successful use of the methodology are also described. Application of the
    proposed irrigation methodology is assessed in a pilot-scale setup with young
    potted apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh). Materials and methods Plant material
    and pilot-scale setup The new plant-based irrigation scheduling system was tested

    grafted on ‘Malus M26’ rootstock) with a stem diameter of 25.6 mm and a height
    of ∼2 m was used as test plant. The selected apple tree was part of a batch of
    apple trees, which were grown outdoors and transplanted in 50-L containers (0.4
    m diameter × 0.4 m height) at the beginning of March 2006 when freezing ended.
    The containers were filled with a mixture of fine (45%) and coarse (40%) white
    peat, complemented with black peat fibres (15%) and fertilized with a NPK plus
    magnesium mix (Basacote Plus 6 M, COMPO Benelux, Belgium). The soil surface was
    covered with mulch (10–20 mm pieces of fir bark, DCM, Grobbendonk, Belgium) in
    order to prevent possible soil evaporation losses. Microclimate and plant measurements
    Microclimate and soil measurements Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) was measured
    with a quantum sensor (Li-190 S, Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) in the greenhouse above
    the treetops. Air temperature (T a) was recorded with a copper-constantan thermocouple
    (Omega, Amstelveen, The Netherlands), installed at a height of 1.5 m, between
    the trees. Relative humidity of the air (RH) was measured with a capacitive RH
    sensor (Type HIH-3605-A, Honeywell, Morristown, NJ, USA) at the same height of
    the thermocouple. Both the RH sensor and the thermocouple were mounted in a radiation
    shield. Soil water potential (Ψ(soil)) in the container of the test tree was monitored
    with an electronic tensiometer (Type SWT4, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) at
    a depth of 15 cm. Plant measurements Continuous measurements of sap flow rate
    and stem diameter variation, which are required for the proposed irrigation scheduling
    methodology to work, were acquired every 20 s with a data-acquisition system (HP75000
    Series B, Hewlett Packard, USA) and were stored as 5-min mean values in a database.
    The sap flow measurements served as model input to simulate Ψ(stem), while the
    stem diameter variation measurements were used to calibrate the water flow and
    storage model (see below). Sap flow rates (F(stem)) were measured continuously
    at the base of the stem (∼30 cm above the soil) with a Dynagage sap flow sensor
    (Model SGB19-WS, Dynamax Inc., Houston, TX, USA), and was installed according
    to the operation manual (van Bavel and van Bavel 1990). Variations in stem diameter
    (D) were measured continuously with a linear variable displacement transducer
    (LVDT) (Model LBB 375-PA-100 and transducer bridge 8C-35, Schaevitz, Hampton,
    VA, USA). The LVDT-sensor was placed ∼5 cm below the sap flow sensor and was attached
    to the stem with a custom-made stainless steel holder. Stem water potential (Ψ(stem))
    was measured destructively with a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Corvallis,
    OR, USA). Mature leaves, close to the trunk, were enclosed in black plastic bags
    covered with aluminium foil at least two hours prior to the measurements (Begg
    and Turner 1970; McCutchan and Shackel 1992). On selected days, Ψ(stem) was measured
    hourly between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. on two leaves each time. These measurements
    were used for initial model calibration or validation purposes (see below). Determination
    of a critical threshold or reference value The use of Ψ(stem) as steering variable
    in the proposed irrigation scheduling methodology requires the definition of a
    critical reference or threshold value (Ψc(stem)), beyond which irrigation is necessary.
    To determine Ψc(stem), an experiment was conducted from August 4–15 on two other
    potted apple trees selected from the batch in order to establish the response
    of maximum photosynthesis rate (P n(max)) to Ψ(stem). One of the selected trees
    was subjected to drought stress (non-irrigated treatment), while the other tree
    was kept well watered (irrigated treatment). Midday measurements of Ψ(stem) and
    P n(max) were carried out daily in both trees. P n(max) was measured with a portable
    gas exchange system (LI-6400, Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Sampling was always done
    on the same four selected leaves per tree. Simulation model A simplified version
    of the mechanistic water flow and storage model ‘RCGro’, developed by Steppe et
    al. (2006), was applied to simulate changes in Ψ(stem) (Fig. 1). Since this is
    the model’s primary use, the original ‘RCGro’ model with a crown and stem compartment
    could be simplified into a model that only describes the processes occurring in
    the stem compartment. This simplified model enables simulation of tree sap flow
    dynamics (water transport submodel), which are directly linked to variation in
    stem diameter D (stem diameter variation submodel), using the radial flow of water
    f(stem) (see Fig. 1) between the xylem and the stem storage compartment (i.e.
    the living, extensible cells external to the xylem). This radial flow can contribute
    to the vertical upwards sap flow because of the hydraulic connection R s between
    stored water and xylem water (Simonneau et al. 1993; Zweifel et al. 2001; Zweifel
    and Häsler 2001; Génard et al. 2001; Steppe and Lemeur 2004) and is driven by
    the water potential difference between xylem and bark. Continuously measured sap
    flow rate in the stem (F(stem)) is used as input to the model, and is modelled
    as the algebraic difference between direct root water uptake F(soil) and f(stem).
    F(soil) is described as the water potential difference in the xylem (Ψ(soil) −
    Ψ(stem)) across a hydraulic resistance R x. The radial flow between stem storage
    and xylem causes changes in stem water content, in capacitance C(stem), and hence
    in turgor. D varies due to reversible stem shrinkage/swelling and irreversible
    radial stem growth. If turgor is smaller than the threshold value at which wall
    yielding occurs (Γ), then variations in D only reflect reversible shrinkage/swelling.
    If turgor is larger than Γ, then irreversible radial stem growth occurs according
    to Lockhart’s (1965) equation, in addition to shrinkage/swelling (Fig. 1). This
    radial stem growth is proportional to the extensibility (ϕ) of the cell walls.
    For a detailed description of the model see Steppe et al. (2006). Model simulations
    were performed with a variable step size integrator (Press et al. 1992). Fig.
    1 Scheme and mathematical equations of the water flow and storage model used for
    plant-based irrigation scheduling. The model is driven by the stem sap flow rate
    F(stem). The stem of diameter D is modelled by two coaxial cylinders (xylem and
    stem storage compartment, respectively) separated by a membrane. The radial flow
    rate into and out of the stem storage compartment is represented by f(stem). This
    radial water flow (bold arrow) establishes the direct link between the submodel
    for calculating dynamic water transport and the submodel for predicting stem diameter
    variations. Depending on the value of the pressure potential in the stem storage
    compartment, the stem diameter variation resulting from growth is also included.

    Full size image Newly developed plant-based irrigation scheduling methodology
    Up till now, plant-based irrigation methods are limited in the sense that they
    only provide information on whether irrigation is needed (Jones 2004). The proposed
    irrigation-scheduling algorithm aims at determining “how much” irrigation to apply
    and “when” it should be applied. The methodology involves several steps, which
    are outlined below and summarized in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Scheme of the plant-based
    irrigation scheduling methodology. An initial model calibration based on measurements
    of the stem diameter variation (D), complemented with additional (destructive)
    measurements of the stem water potential (Ψ(stem)), is required prior to the start
    of the online irrigation control in order to unambiguously estimate the parameter
    subset {ϕ, R s, R x, C(stem)} (a, b) (see text for details). A moving window of
    past data (a) is used for daily model recalibration in order to assure a good
    model fit at all times. During online irrigation control, simulated Ψ(stem) is
    continuously compared to the critical reference value (determined from a drought
    experiment, Fig. 6) in order to determine when an irrigation event should be applied
    (b), and the required amount of irrigation water is determined by time integration
    of the measured sap flow pattern (F(stem)) (c) Full size image When to irrigate
    The model was used to simulate changes in Ψ(stem) using 5-min mean values of F(stem)
    as model input. Modelled values of Ψ(stem) were continuously compared to the reference
    value Ψc(stem). An irrigation event started when Ψ(stem) exceeded Ψc(stem) (see
    Fig. 2b). A time delay of 30 min between two consecutive irrigation events was
    included in the algorithm in order to deal with the possible delayed reaction
    of the plant on the irrigation event. How much to irrigate Information on “how
    much” water to apply during an irrigation event was determined from the measured
    sap flow profile by cumulating the amount of water that is used by the plant between
    the previous and current time where simulated Ψ(stem) exceeds Ψc(stem) (Fig. 2c).
    A safety factor of 10% was used to slightly increase the calculated amount of
    irrigation water to supply in order to deal with possible sap flow measurement
    errors (van Bavel and van Bavel 1990). This corrected amount was supplied to the
    plant at each irrigation event (see Fig. 2b). Upon detection of an irrigation
    requirement, a 2/2 way solenoid valve (Type 6213, Bürkert, Ingelfingen, Germany)
    was triggered to supply the required irrigation amount at a preset flow rate of
    1.23 L min−1. Initial model calibration An identifiability analysis of the model
    (see De Pauw et al. 2008) showed that Ψ(stem) is influenced by three identifiable
    key parameters: R s, R x and C(stem), with R x being the most influential. A model
    parameter is said to be identifiable if it has sufficient influence on the model
    output (high sensitivity) and at the same time is not correlated with other model
    parameters (no linear dependencies with other model parameters) (De Pauw et al.
    2008). Since simulations of Ψ(stem) are used as steering variable for irrigation
    control, these parameters need to be assigned a correct value in order for the
    predictions of Ψ(stem) to be valid. To assess whether measurements of D are sufficient
    to assign unique values to these parameters during model calibration, an identifiability
    analysis of the D variable of the model was performed. This analysis showed that
    for measurements of D, the parameter sets {ϕ, R s, R x} or {ϕ, R s, C(stem)} are
    identifiable. Measurements of D can thus be used to assign unique values to the
    key parameters driving Ψ(stem), and can also be used to obtain a unique value
    for ϕ, although not strictly necessary for a correct prediction of Ψ(stem). Notice,
    however, that R x and C(stem) cannot be both identified from measurements of D
    alone since they are highly correlated. Indeed, a change in D caused by a change
    in C(stem) can be completely compensated by a change in R x and vice versa. Therefore,
    the use of measurements of D alone is not sufficient to unambiguously estimate
    the parameters, which determine the behaviour of the modelled Ψ(stem). Hence,
    an initial model calibration based on measurements of both D and Ψ(stem) (Fig.
    2a, b) is required prior to the start of the online irrigation control. Several
    days of D measurements, complemented with additional measurements of Ψ(stem) around
    midday allow unambiguous estimation of ϕ, R s, R x and C(stem). Based on the results
    of this calibration, a correct unique value can be assigned to C(stem) and further
    estimation of ϕ, R s and R x can be conducted during the irrigation control experiment
    based on measurements of D only. Online model calibration At first sight, one
    might be tempted to only perform the initial model calibration and keep all parameters
    fixed throughout the irrigation control experiment. However, this proved impossible.
    Figure 3 shows a typical model simulation of D with a fixed parameter set. With
    fixed parameters, the model is unable to predict the actual irreversible radial
    stem growth in the long term. The model is not longer valid after ∼4 days due
    to a temporal variability of some of the model parameters (Steppe 2004). Indeed,
    it seems logical to assume that some physiological characteristics of the plant
    (e.g. R x, ϕ) do not remain constant throughout the growing season (e.g. Steppe
    2004, Lechaudel et al. 2007). Since such time-dependencies are not incorporated
    in the model, a need for online model recalibration presents itself. Fig. 3 Typical
    model simulation of the stem diameter variation (D) with: (1) a fixed parameter
    set, obtained after model calibration based on the first four measurement days
    (Simulation 1), and (2) a daily recalibrated parameter set, based on a moving
    calibration window of 4 days of past data (Simulation 2) Full size image Measurements
    of D were used for sequential online model recalibration. The parameter subset
    {ϕ, R x, R s} was adjusted daily at 4 am so as to fit D using a moving time window
    of 4 days of previous data. Adjustment of the model parameters was done based
    on the minimization of the sum of squared errors between the simulated values
    and the measured data of variations in D of the four past days. This search for
    new parameter values was performed using the automated search algorithm Simplex
    (Nelder and Mead 1965). At each calibration event the Simplex method used the
    previously calibrated parameter values as initial values from where an automatic
    search for new parameters started. The newly calibrated parameter values were
    used with a time delay of 1 day. This time delay was deliberately introduced in
    the algorithm to give the user a chance to verify the model calibrations offline
    and, when irregularities were observed, to take appropriate action by correcting
    the parameter values. STACI: Software tool for automatic control of irrigation
    A research tool, STACI (Software Tool for Automatic Control of Irrigation) was
    used as the framework for combining the online measurements of F(stem) and D with
    the model to allow (1) online simulation of Ψ(stem), (2) online model calibration
    and (3) real-time plant-based irrigation scheduling (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Scheme of
    the research tool STACI (Software Tool for Automatic Control of Irrigation), enabling
    (1) continuous measurements of F(stem) and D, (2) online simulation of Ψ(stem),
    (3) online model calibration and (4) real-time plant-based irrigation scheduling
    Full size image Results Initial model calibration The initial model calibration
    was performed offline, prior to the start of the irrigation experiment, using
    a 3-day dataset of D and a daily pattern of hourly measured Ψ(stem) (Fig. 5).
    A unique value could be successfully assigned to the model parameter subset {C(stem),
    R s, R x, ϕ} (Table 1). C(stem) was fixed to this value for the remainder of the
    irrigation experiment. This was necessary to facilitate and to allow estimation
    of the remaining parameter subset {ϕ, R s, R x} during online calibration of the
    model for which only D measurements were available. The reason why C(stem) was
    fixed, and not R x, is the strong sensitivity of both Ψ(stem) and D to R x, meaning
    that a change in R x will strongly affect simulation of both Ψ(stem) and D, whereas
    this was less the case for C(stem). It was observed that greater parameter values
    of R x corresponded with greater maximum daily stem shrinkages and lower Ψ(stem)
    values. Fig. 5 Initial model calibration showing the comparison between a measured
    and simulated stem diameter variation (D), and b measured and simulated stem water
    potential (Ψ(stem)). Initial model calibration was performed prior to the start
    of the irrigation experiment, using a 3-day dataset of D measurements, complemented
    with a daily pattern of hourly (destructively) measured Ψ(stem) Full size image

    irrigation scheduling methodology Full size table Critical Ψ(stem) reference value
    The response of P n(max) to Ψ(stem) obtained in an irrigated and a non-irrigated
    apple tree was used to define the reference value for Ψ(stem) beyond which irrigation
    was necessary. This response was well-described by a sigmoidal function (R 2 =
    0.973) for the non-irrigated tree (Fig. 6). Intersection of the mean P n(max)
    of the irrigated apple tree (14.6 μmol m−2 s−1) with this sigmoidal trajectory
    resulted in a reference value of −1 MPa, which was further used in the plant-based
    irrigation scheduling. Fig. 6 Typical relationship between maximum photosynthesis

    of the control tree, which intersects with the sigmoidal trajectory of the drought-stressed
    tree at the point representing Ψc(stem) (vertical dashed line). P n(max) values
    are means (±SE, n = 4) Full size image Online model calibration Online model calibration
    was performed using D measurements and a moving time window of 4 days of past
    data (Fig. 7b). The use of this 4-day moving window implied that a 4-day dataset
    of D measurements needed to be acquired before the first online model calibration
    (on DOY 240) could be performed. Since newly calibrated parameter values were
    used with a time delay of 1 day in the model, Ψ(stem) was simulated the first
    5 days of the experiment with the parameter values obtained during the initial
    model calibration (Fig. 8). Fig. 7 Daily patterns of a measured stem sap flow
    rate (F(stem)) and b stem diameter variation (D) of the potted apple tree across
    the 14-day online irrigation experiment. Model simulations of D were obtained
    with the daily recalibrated model parameter subset (see Fig. 8). Model recalibration
    was performed with a moving window of 4 days of past data. Time is expressed in
    hours (bottom axis) and in Day of Year (DOY, top axis) Full size image Fig. 8

    resistance of the xylem (R x), and c radial resistance between xylem and stem
    storage compartment (R s). Time is expressed in Day of Year (DOY). First model
    recalibration was performed on DOY 240, and newly calibrated parameter values
    were used in subsequent model simulations with a time delay of 1 day Full size
    image From DOY 240 on, a daily online model recalibration took place at 4 am,
    but the obtained values were only used the next day at 4 am. This time delay caused
    a decreased responsiveness of the model, which, for instance, can be seen in the
    overestimation of D during the night (e.g. DOY 241, Fig. 7b). Another consequence
    of the incorporated time delay is that steeper shrinkages of the tree stem (e.g.
    DOY 244, Fig. 7b), which are expected to result in higher R x values (Fig. 8b)
    and, thus, more negative Ψ(stem) values (according to the electrical analogon
    model), are only picked up with a certain time delay, affecting the performance
    of the proposed methodology. Besides removal of this time delay, the model’s responsiveness
    and accuracy, particularly during stress conditions (DOY 244/245, Fig. 7b), can
    also be improved by including measurements of Ψ(soil) as an extra input into the
    model, as is discussed below. Daily model recalibration showed variation in both
    the hydraulic resistance parameter values R x and R s (Fig. 8b, c) and in the
    estimated cell wall extensibility ϕ (Fig. 8a). This online adaptation of the parameter
    values was needed to assure a good model fit at all times (Fig. 7b). Plant-based
    irrigation scheduling Modelled Ψ(stem) was continuously compared to Ψc(stem) (initially
    defined at −1 MPa, see Fig. 6) to detect whether irrigation was necessary (Fig.
    9a). Upon detection of an irrigation event, the calculated amount of water (corrected
    cumulative plant water uptake since the last irrigation event, Fig. 7a) was supplied
    and a waiting time of 30 min was maintained before executing a new event when
    Ψ(stem) was still below the threshold value (Figs. 9a, 10a). Measurements of Ψ(soil)
    confirmed that the supply of water was really effectuated (Fig. 10b) and measured
    Ψ(stem) showed the validity of the method (Fig. 11a). However, due to less demanding
    atmospheric conditions on DOY 242–245 (data not shown), Ψ(stem) did not reach
    the critical threshold value and irrigation was withheld during these days, resulting
    in lowered soil water potentials (Fig. 9b). This might suggest that reference
    or threshold values should be standardized to the evaporative conditions in order
    to be successful, but more research on this topic is needed. A drought stress
    in the irrigated tree was feared, because measured D shrinkages apparently increased
    on DOY 244 and 245 (Fig. 7b). Based on these apparent stress indications, it was
    decided to induce an irrigation event on DOY 245 and to increase the threshold
    value of Ψ(stem) to −0.6 MPa (Fig. 9a). This value corresponds with the upper
    limit of the range of threshold values reported by Doltra et al. (2007) for apple
    trees. On DOY 245, the irrigated apple tree received the amount of water that
    had been accumulated during the previous 4 days (5.4 L in total) (Fig. 9b). With
    this higher threshold setting of Ψ(stem), the tree was watered daily at several
    time instances and validation of Ψ(stem) with offline measurements again confirmed
    a proper performance of the method and realistic model predictions (Fig. 11b).

    Full size image Discussion The potential use of mechanistic models in practice
    The main purpose of mechanistic plant models (like the one presented by Steppe
    et al. 2006) has been to integrate detailed knowledge as well as to gain new scientific
    insight and to increase the understanding of plant functioning, but their practical
    application in irrigation scheduling has not been exploited so far due to implementation
    issues, difficulties with selecting the identifiable key model parameters, or
    temporal variability issues of certain model parameters. However, this paper argues
    that these issues, inherently related to mechanistic models, should no longer
    constitute a problem due to progress made in mathematical modelling and computer
    technology. A thorough mathematical analysis of the model (according to De Pauw
    et al. 2008) allowed selecting the identifiable model parameters and the newly
    developed research tool STACI helped in solving the implementation issues as well
    as the problems related to temporal variability of the model parameters. This
    highlights that also explanatory mechanistic models (like the one presented in
    this paper) provide a possibility to successfully control and manage the plant
    health status and the environment around the plant, although argued otherwise
    by Lentz (1998). Moving window size and frequency of online model calibration
    An issue that has to be considered when performing online model calibrations is
    the selection of a moving window size, since this setting strongly influences
    the responsiveness of the model. For a successful application of the mechanistic
    model, it was of importance to seek a moving window size that assured an appropriate
    balance between (1) model responsiveness and (2) stability of the model parameters
    when varying microclimatic conditions presented themselves. As temporal variability
    of some of the model parameters existed (Fig. 8), the use of very large moving
    window sizes was prohibited. On the other hand, a too small moving window size
    would make the system too responsive to rapidly changing microclimatic conditions.
    Therefore, a moving window of medium size (i.e. 4 days) was selected in the present
    study. This size prevents unrealistic parameter estimates and model predictions
    in situations with alternating cloudy and sunny days. However, further research
    is needed in order to obtain more extensive information on the optimum window
    size. Another important issue that needs to be addressed is the required frequency
    of model calibrations. The relative short computational time needed to calibrate
    the model (less than 5 minutes) could allow recalibration at a high frequency.
    But because values of the parameters {R x, R s, ϕ} are not expected to change
    on a very short time scale, the choice of one calibration per day (at 4 am) seemed
    appropriate for the proposed application. Daily model recalibration showed temporal
    variation in the model parameter values. While the hydraulic resistance parameter
    values (Fig. 8b, c) showed a slight day-to-day variation due to the sensitivity
    of D to environmental conditions, a clear decrease in estimated cell wall extensibility
    ϕ was observed (Fig. 8a). This decrease was caused by the decrease in radial stem
    growth across the experimental period (Fig. 7b), which was selected near the end
    of the growing season. A correlation between the decrease in ϕ and the cessation
    of growth has also been reported elsewhere (Büntemeyer et al. 1998, Proseus et
    al. 1999; Lechaudel et al. 2007). Note that daily estimates of ϕ, R s and R x
    are conditional on the fixed values of the other model parameters (Table 1). The
    three identifiable key parameters capture all the day-to-day variation in D, but
    it is not unlikely that some of this variation is also caused by changes in other
    tree characteristics, whose parameter values were fixed during model calibrations.
    Absolute values of the model parameters in Fig. 8 should therefore be interpreted
    with care. Critical reference value As with other irrigation scheduling protocols,
    our proposed methodology also requires the definition of a critical reference
    value, beyond which irrigation is necessary. Such critical reference values are
    commonly determined for plants growing under non-limiting soil water supply (Fereres
    and Goldhamer 2003; Jones 2004). Tentative reference or threshold values for well-watered
    fruit trees range between −0.5 and −1.5 MPa (McCutchan and Shackel 1992; Shackel
    et al. 1997; Naor and Cohen 2003; Intrigliolo and Castel 2004, 2005; Ortuño et
    al. 2006; Doltra et al. 2007). Although these trees were watered well, the obtained
    reference values showed variations due to correlation with vapour pressure deficit
    (e.g., Shackel et al. 1997; Intrigliolo and Castel 2004). Instead of relying only
    on non-limiting soil water supply, we proposed a reference value (Fig. 6) that
    also sustained optimum photosynthesis activity (Patakas et al. 2005). This approach
    allowed estimation of a critical reference value above which photosynthesis was
    unaffected by water status. Note, however, that by selecting another (lower) reference
    value from the trajectory (Fig. 6), a certain level of stress could be maintained
    in order to positively influence, for instance, the quality of the harvested produce
    (Fereres and Evans 2006). If canopy growth is considered, a higher reference value
    should be selected from the trajectory, since extensive growth will decrease before
    stomatal conductance decreases. Obtaining extensive information on the behaviour
    of the critical reference value with changing environmental conditions or plant
    age still remains an important stage in the further development and validation
    of the method (Jones 2004). Indeed, a decrease in plant water potential during
    the season, even under non-limiting soil water conditions, is not uncommon (Fereres
    et al. 1978; McCutchan and Shackel 1992; Goldhamer and Fereres 2001). Osmotic
    adjustment across the season might explain this observed trend in water potential.
    The variability of the critical reference value, which might be expected to change
    within a tree across the growing season and with tree age, as well as the variability
    among individual trees, should therefore be further investigated. However, for
    the short-term irrigation experiment performed here, we feel that this effect
    might be neglected. Plant-based irrigation scheduling The use of a mathematical
    model in combination with continuous plant-based measurements is innovative in
    the sense that it allows accurate prediction of Ψ(stem); a variable, which is
    still difficult to measure continuously, but which is interesting for steering
    purposes. Prediction of Ψ(stem) with the model was very successful under non-stressed
    conditions (Fig. 11). Comparison of modelled and measured Ψ(stem) under non-stressed
    conditions also revealed that the actual daily minimum water status was lacking
    in the datasets obtained with the pressure chamber due to the discrete measurement
    frequency. Care should therefore be taken when irrigation is scheduled on the
    basis of daily measured midday Ψ(stem). It might be possible that such instantaneous
    measured values underestimate the actual plant water status; a problem, which
    might be resolved when being able to model Ψ(stem) accurately in real-time (Fig.
    9a). Despite the very good predictions of Ψ(stem) under non-stressed conditions,
    the expected reduction in Ψ(stem) (Fig. 9a) in response to a significant decrease
    in Ψ(soil) (up to −0.06 MPa) (Fig. 9b) was not observed. Measured D, unlike predicted
    D, was in agreement with the decrease in Ψ(soil) (Fig. 7b). This suggests that
    model predictions of D and Ψ(stem) failed under stressed conditions. This failure
    can, however, be resolved by using continuous measurements of Ψ(soil) as an additional
    input variable to the model, as has been demonstrated by De Pauw et al. (2008).
    As drought stress was feared given the significant decrease in Ψ(soil) (Fig. 9b),
    irrigation was forced on DOY 245 and the reference value increased (Fig. 9a).
    Although an enhanced stem growth was expected following this action of forced
    irrigation (Daudet et al. 2005), no clear effect was observed (Fig. 7b). This
    lack in stem growth response suggests that no severe drought stress had occurred
    on DOY 244 and 245. It is also noteworthy that, in case no forced irrigation had
    been performed, the online model calibration with D measurements with steeper
    stem shrinkages would eventually have resulted in higher R x values, which, in
    turn, would have led to predicted Ψ(stem) values beyond the critical threshold
    value and, hence, an irrigation event. These interdependencies in the model (between
    maximum daily stem shrinkage, R x and Ψ(stem)) suggest that the developed plant-based
    irrigation-scheduling tool is a self-regulating system, of which the opportunities
    should be further investigated. To do so, the model should be carefully tested
    and validated under a wide range of vapour pressure deficits and during the development
    of drought stress, possibly after including Ψ(soil) as an extra input variable
    to the model. The small-scale setup with the potted apple tree illustrates the
    first successful test of the methodology. For real practical applications, it
    seems likely that several plants will have to be monitored simultaneously and
    irrigation scheduled based on the average response of these plants. However, further
    research is needed to assess the number of required plants, which will certainly
    be influenced by the variability within the crop needing irrigation, but probably
    also by sensor costs and other economical factors. Other further challenges are
    to examine commercial-sized trees, the validity of the model across the season,
    given that the relationship between Ψ(stem) and maximum daily stem shrinkage changes,
    and the effect of crop load, since crop load directly affects maximum daily stem
    shrinkage. These assessments were, however, beyond the scope of the present paper.
    Conclusions This paper has described a new precision irrigation scheduling system
    that takes the irrigation needs (when and how much) of the individual plant into
    account. In contrast to previous studies using plant-based stress sensing as the
    basis for irrigation scheduling, plant-based measurements were fed into a mathematical
    flow and storage model in order to continuously predict Ψ(stem). The method was
    successfully validated with direct measurements of Ψ(stem) and was able to capture
    the diurnal fluctuations in Ψ(stem) with high temporal resolution. This paper
    has also highlighted the importance of performing a comprehensive model analysis.
    It is obvious that a proper model description is necessary, but even more important,
    and still often ignored, is identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
    An identifiability analysis, for instance, is a prerequisite for the selection
    of the parameter subset that can be unambiguously estimated during model calibration
    from the available measurements. In our application, the identifiability analysis
    also highlighted the need for an initial model calibration. Furthermore, it has
    been discussed that the plant-based irrigation approach requires the definition
    of a critical reference value, beyond which irrigation is necessary. A method
    to determine reference values has been proposed, but further research is required
    to obtain information on the variability of these values as environmental conditions
    or plant age change. The test of the proposed methodology in a pilot-scale setup
    with a young potted apple tree showed an accurate performance under non-stressed
    conditions, but suggested that the model should be adapted with measurements of
    Ψ(soil) as an extra input to deal with stressed conditions. It is our belief that
    external pressures for enhanced irrigation systems, with a greater relevance to
    plant functioning, are likely to provide a real impetus for this new generation
    of irrigation strategies which use plant-based measurements and mathematical models,
    especially in the intensive horticultural, protected cropping, sector. References

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are

    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    \ thus, improving \nirrigation efficiency is decisive to sustain the food demand\

    \ \n \nAccording to FAO [1], nearly 40% of the world’s food is produced by irrigated\
    \ agriculture, which \ncovers about 250 million hectares (corresponding to 17%\
    \ of the total arable land) and is the major user \nof fresh water, accounting\
    \ for 70% (on average and up to 90% in many countries) of worldwide water \nwithdrawn\
    \ for human use. In Italy, irrigation accounts for about 50% of total water use\
    \ and irrigated \nagriculture covers about 27% of usable farmland [2]. \nConsequently,\
    \ improving irrigation water use efficiency (i.e., the ratio between applied water\
    \ and \ncrop yield) is decisive to satisfy the increased world demand for food\
    \ and other agricultural products. \nThis objective may be accomplished by cultivating\
    \ more water-efficient crops (as developed by means \nof conventional or recombinant\
    \ DNA-based breeding) and/or through the application of efficient \nirrigation\
    \ technology. Despite the efforts made in recent years, irrigation efficiency\
    \ (i.e., the amount of \nwater stored in the crop root zone compared to the amount\
    \ of applied water) is still unsatisfactory (less \nthan 40%) [1] and its improvement\
    \ is a key goal for the future.  \nIrrigation efficiency depends on the type of\
    \ irrigation used (for instance, surface irrigation wastes \nmuch more water than\
    \ pressurized overhead or drip irrigation) and on irrigation scheduling, which\
    \ is \nthe method used to determine the amount of water to be applied to a crop\
    \ and the timing for \napplication. Since it determines the crop’s water use and\
    \ influences its yield, irrigation scheduling has \na remarkable effect on water\
    \ use efficiency. \n Irrigation scheduling is crucial in intensive agriculture,\
    \ since under-irrigation generally results in \nreduced crop yield and quality.\
    \ On the other hand, over-irrigation increases the nutrient requirements \nof\
    \ the crop and its vulnerability to diseases, the energy costs for water pumping,\
    \ water loss and \nenvironmental pollution due to the leaching of nutrients applied\
    \ to the crop with conventional \nfertilization or fertigation (the technique\
    \ of supplying fertilizers dissolved in the irrigation water). \nThompson et al.\
    \ [3] reported that the inadequate management of drip irrigation, which in many\
    \ \noperations is still based on grower’s experience, is one of the reasons for\
    \ nitrate leaching in \ngreenhouse tomato production in Almeria, Spain (at present,\
    \ the largest greenhouse area in the world). \nThe goal of an efficient irrigation\
    \ program is to supply the crop with enough water while \nminimizing water waste\
    \ due to deep percolation and runoff. Different approaches to irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ have been developed, each having both advantages and disadvantages [4]. Innovative\
    \ \nmethods based on the direct monitoring of plant water relations have been\
    \ also proposed for irrigation \nscheduling [4]. Although some companies have\
    \ designed irrigation control devices exploiting micro-\nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n\
    \ \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2811\nmeasurements of stem diameter,\
    \ leaf thickness or stem sap flow, plant-based irrigation management is \nstill\
    \ in the research or development state and is scarcely employed in commercial\
    \ operations [4]. \nThe most widespread irrigation scheduling method is based\
    \ on the determination of soil-water \nbalance, which implies the estimation of\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (ETC). Generally, ETC is calculated \ncombining the\
    \ measurements of potential (or reference) evapotranspiration (ET0) through \n\
    meteorological stations with crop coefficients [5]. The latter need regular updating\
    \ by the farmer for \neach crop type and growing stage. One rather new approach\
    \ is to obtain crop coefficients with satellite \nbased radiation images, rather\
    \ than by using time-costly manual field observations. Recently, D’Urso \net al.\
    \ [6] developed such a system within the framework of two European projects: Demeter\
    \ \n(www.demeter-EC.net) and Pleiades (www.pleiades.es). Access to the satellite\
    \ data has become much \neasier and faster due to recent development with web-based\
    \ access and due to improvements of sensor \nspatial resolution and accuracy.\
    \ D’Urso et al. [6] report that satellite remote sensing is a mature \ntechnique,\
    \ suited to be transferred to practical application for on farm, down to the plot,\
    \  \nirrigation management.  \nThe other approach to irrigation scheduling entails\
    \ the use of root zone sensor (RZS) to obtain soil \nmoisture status and to replenish\
    \ the water in growing medium to a preset level. In principle, this \nmethod by-passes\
    \ the need to calculate ETC and works for any crop, as long as the set-points\
    \ for the \nirrigation controller are correctly chosen. So far, applications of\
    \ RZS for irrigation management have \nbeen less common than those of the water\
    \ balance method, but novel types of RZS, which are based on \nthe measurement\
    \ of soil dielectric properties, have opened new possibilities for irrigation\
    \ scheduling \nand nowadays, after the doubts originated from the first attempts\
    \ with gypsum blocks, the irrigation \nindustry worldwide has recognized that\
    \ RZS’ are valuable tools for modern smart water application \ntechnology in intensive\
    \ agriculture. \nIn this review, the main features of RZS’ (for both soil moisture\
    \ and salinity) designed to be \nconnected to irrigation controller for commercial\
    \ cultivations are identified and discussed. The paper is \nbased on classical\
    \ and more recent literature on soil moisture sensing technology and its application\
    \ to \nirrigation scheduling.  \nThe findings, also unpublished, of our recent\
    \ experimental works conducted in the framework of \nnational or international\
    \ projects (see Acknowledgements) have been considered. These works concern \n\
    mostly the outdoor cultivation of pot ornamentals, which is an important horticultural\
    \ sector in Italy.  \nThe main area for this kind of cultivation is located in\
    \ Tuscany, around the town of Pistoia, \ndefinitely the most important centre\
    \ in Europe for landscaping ornamentals [7]. In this area, nearly \n1,400 ha,\
    \ of approx. 4,500 ha of nurseries, are used for growing pot ornamentals, with\
    \ an estimated \nyearly consumption of irrigation water (mostly, low salinity\
    \ groundwater) of more than 10,000,000 \nm3/year [8]. The low cost of water has\
    \ not led to a more efficient approach to water management. On \nthe other hand,\
    \ current legislation on water resources and the competition for water among agriculture,\
    \ \nurban population and industries will affect the future development of “green\
    \ industry” in this area, \nstimulating the search for more efficient solutions.\
    \ Therefore, the design of a sustainable irrigation \nmanagement system is one\
    \ of the goals of RTD activities conducted by both public and private \nterritorial\
    \ entities (regional extension office, growers associations etc.) \nThe paper\
    \ is agriculture-oriented and then it considers only those sensors that can be\
    \ implemented \nin irrigation controllers, such as traditional water-filled tensiometers\
    \ and the more recent dielectric \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n   \n \n \n2812\nsensors. Expensive and sophisticated RZS’ currently used\
    \ by soil and plant scientists, such as neutron \nprobes [9], are not addressed.\
    \ The paper also discusses how these sensors may be integrated into \nwireless\
    \ networks for computer-controlled irrigation and employed for the application\
    \ of innovative \nirrigation strategies, such as deficit or dual-water (alternate\
    \ use of different water sources) irrigation. \n \n2. Soil Hydraulic Characteristics\
    \ \n \nApart from the direct measurement of water content by thermo-gravimetric\
    \ methods, soil moisture \nconditions can be assessed by the determination of\
    \ the matric potential (m) of pore water or the \nvolumetric water content (),\
    \ which is the volume of water in a certain volume of undisturbed soil. \nRecently,\
    \ some sensors have been developed also to measure the soil salinity (namely,\
    \ electrical \nconductivity o EC), as discussed later. \nThe term m describes\
    \ the amount of energy which must be exerted to extract water from a porous \n\
    medium such as soil or soilless substrate. Therefore, m corresponds to the suction\
    \ required for the \nwater uptake by the plant roots. Moisture tension represents\
    \ the degree of such suction and, according \nto the terminology used in crop\
    \ irrigation management, it is a positive number; the higher the number, \nthe\
    \ higher is the tension and the drier is the soil. The relationship between m\
    \ and  (also called water \nretention curve) depends on the nature of growing\
    \ media and in some cases this relationship is not \nunique being different in\
    \ drying and wetting cycle, in particular in fine-textured soils. The water \n\
    retention curve is generally determined in the laboratory following standard methods,\
    \ for instance: in \nsoil, using Richard's pressure plate apparatus [10]; in soilless\
    \ media (substrate) using De Boodt’s \nmethod [11]. An example of water retention\
    \ curve for a soilless substrate is presented in Figure 1.  \nFigure 1. Water\
    \ retention curve of a peat-pumice mixture, which is widely used for the \noutdoor\
    \ production of ornamental nursery stocks in Italy. The determination was \nconducted\
    \ in the laboratory following De Boodt’s method [11]. Seven different suctions\
    \ \nwere applied to the sample: 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 kPa. The\
    \ value ofat \nsaturation (m = 0) was estimated from the measurement of porosity\

    \ 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2813\nConventionally, the\
    \ water retention curve may allow computation of a few parameters that, along\
    \ \nwith porosity and bulk density, are used to describe the water relations of\
    \ a given soil sample. Field \ncapacity (FC) is the water content in soil after\
    \ it has been saturated (all pores are filled with water) and \nallowed to drain\
    \ freely till the downward movement of water is terminated; wilting point (WP)\
    \ is the \nminimal moisture the plant requires not to wilt. The physical definition\
    \ of FC and WP is the bulk at \nm of -33 or -1,500 kPa, respectively [12].\
    \ The limitation of these determinations is evident, since \nmany factors, also\
    \ related to the plant, affect the actual values of FC and WP. Nevertheless,\
    \ these \nparameters serve as a practical measure of soil water holding capacity,\
    \ also called available water. Soil \navailable water is defined as the amount\
    \ of water held between FC and WP. Figure 2 illustrates how \nFC, WP and available\
    \ water changes as a function of soil texture. Readily available water is the\
    \ \nfraction (generally, 50%) of available water that can be absorbed by the crop\
    \ plant. The critical m at \nwhich many crops undergo water stress are in the\
    \ order of magnitude of -100 kPa.  \nIn other-than-soil media, such as peat, perlite,\
    \ pumice and rockwool, which are largely used in \ngreenhouses and nurseries,\
    \ available water is the difference between the values determined at m of -\n\
    1 (by definition, the m at container water capacity) and -10 kPa [11,13]. Depending\
    \ on the nature of \nsubstrate, available water ranges from 0.07 to 0.35 m3 m-3\
    \ [13]; it tends to increase with the porosity \nand the bulk density of the material.\

    \ \n \n3.1. Tensiometers \n \nA tensiometer is a kind of artificial root that\
    \ measures m in the growing medium. The tensiometer \nconsists of a shaft filled\
    \ with (distilled) degassed water with a porous ceramic cup at the end and a dial\
    \ \nvacuum gauge or a pressure transducer at the top. The shaft is generally made\
    \ of plastic due its low \nheat conduction and high resistance to corrosion. The\
    \ ceramic cup has small air entry potentials in \norder to prevent de-saturation\
    \ when subjected to negative potentials. The transducer can be connected \nto\
    \ a data-logger for long-term monitoring, to a hand-held meter for spot measurements\
    \ or to an \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2814\n\
    irrigation controller. The tensiometer is buried at the desired depth in the rooting\
    \ zone with the ceramic \ntip in close contact with the soil particles. The water\
    \ in the tensiometer reaches equilibrium with the \nsurrounding soil through the\
    \ ceramic tip. When water is pulled out through the ceramic tip by drying \nsoil,\
    \ a tension is originated in the tube; when the soil is re-watered, the decrease\
    \ in water potential \ngradient causes a reverse flow of water. As the soil goes\
    \ through drying and wetting cycles as a result \nof ETC and watering (by irrigation\
    \ or rainfall), tension readings can be taken. The porosity of the \nceramic tip\
    \ influences the velocity of water flow from and into the instrument. When used\
    \ in very dry \nconditions, the ceramic must be very fine and this slows down\
    \ the tensiometer reaction to the changes \nin soil m. Obviously, the responsiveness\
    \ of tensiometers to soil moisture conditions determines the \nfield of application.\
    \ For instance, in container cultivation the irrigation lasts generally a few\
    \ minutes \ninstead of one or more hours as in soil culture; therefore, a quick\
    \ response is required, especially when \ntensiometer is used to determine both\
    \ the time and the duration of watering (see next section). \nTensiometers have\
    \ many advantages that make them a competitive instrument for measuring soil \n\
    moisture conditions [14]. They are accurate and not influenced by temperature\
    \ and soil osmotic \npotential, since the salts move freely through the ceramic\
    \ cup. Generally, tensiometers operate \nbetween 0 and 80°C. Below 0°C it is necessary\
    \ to take some precautions due to ice formation, \nalthough some tensiometers\
    \ can work even at -10 ° C (e.g., SKP 850; SDEC; the addresses of the \ncompanies\
    \ mentioned in the text are reported at the end of our review).  \nSome companies\
    \ focus on producing high grade hydraulic tensiometers with special features like\
    \ \nhigh accuracy, high speed (small versions), ability to work over a large range\
    \ of tensions and \ntemperatures (dry end, no collapse of water column), easy\
    \ use in the field (on the fly refillable), etc. \nThese tensiometers are referred\
    \ to as scientifically rated tensiometers; they have generally higher \nprices\
    \ and are not commonly used by growers, but rather by soil and plant scientists.\
    \ \nOn the Italian market, where to our knowledge no manufacturing company exists,\
    \ the price of \ntensiometers ranges between € 150 – 300 and can reach as much\
    \ as € 500, depending on the \ndimensions of the ceramic cup and shaft. Some tensiometers\
    \ have small dimensions, allowing their \nutilisation in small pots. For example,\
    \ Delta-T Devices Ltd. and Skye Instruments Ltd. produce, the \nSWT5 with a 7-cm\
    \ shaft and the SKTM 650 with a 10-cm shaft, respectively. \nHowever, tensiometers\
    \ have also some disadvantages. They are quite fragile and must be operated \n\
    carefully in order to avoid the formation of air bubbles in the shaft, which may\
    \ result in temperature-\ndependent errors in reading. Moreover, they must be\
    \ protected from frost and need regular \nmaintenance, for instance to refill\
    \ the water in the tube and to avoid the contamination by algae. \nSuitable hand-held\
    \ vacuum pumps are generally supplied by tensiometer manufacturers to recharge\
    \ \ntensiometers in situ. \nWhen tensiometers are used in pot culture, some precautions\
    \ are necessary in order to assure a good \ncontact between the porous tip and\
    \ the substrate, and to achieve a correct sensor positioning taking \ninto account\
    \ root distribution and the place of nozzle(s) in case of drip irrigation.  \n\
    The main drawback of tensiometers, however, is the cavitation as the soil gets\
    \ dry. The suction \nmust not exceed the air entry value of the ceramic. The use\
    \ of tensiometers may be difficult in soilless \nsubstrates [15], since their\
    \ high porosity (> 80% against roughly 50% in soils) may result in a poor \ncontact\
    \ between the substrate and the ceramic tip. The typical operating range of water-filled\
    \ \ntensiometers is between 0 and -85 kPa, with an accuracy of 0.1 – 1.0 kPa [14].\
    \  \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2815\nHigh capacity\
    \ tensiometers have been developed in which the level of measurable suction is\
    \ limited \nonly to the air entry potential of the porous ceramic filter and the\
    \ tensile strength of water [e.g., 16-18]. \nThese instruments can work down to\
    \ m as low as -2 MPa; however, their application has been limited \nby the lack\
    \ of commercially-available devices and by the technical expertise needed for\
    \ their correct \nuse. \nThe porous-matrix sensor follows another approach to\
    \ the measurement of m [e.g., 19,20]. This \nsensor uses porous ceramic with\
    \ known water retention properties (pF-curve), which readily changes \nits degree\
    \ of saturation to maintain equilibrium with the soil water. Soil m is determined\
    \ indirectly \nfrom the measurements of the water content of the ceramic, for\
    \ instance by means of dielectric sensor \n(see next section). Such sensors are\
    \ commercially-available (e.g., equitensiometer; Delta-T Devices \nLtd.). They\
    \ can work in frozen and dry soils with m as low as -500 kPa. Moreover, they\
    \ do not need \nmaintenance for refilling or degassing likewise water-filled tensiometer.\
    \ \nRecently, in the FLOWAID project Whalley and colleagues have designed a new\
    \ dielectric \ntensiometer that works over a much wider range of m. A number\
    \ of prototypes of this sensor have \nbeen tested both in the lab and in a greenhouse\
    \ cucumber crop [21]. Good results have been achieved \nwith these sensor prototypes\
    \ that are able to measure soil m over the nominal range from -3 kPa to  \n-250\
    \ kPa. These sensors might be commercially available in the next months. \nA particular\
    \ example of granular matric sensor is 229-L, which is manufactured by Campbell\
    \ \nScientific. In this sensor the moisture content in the ceramic is measured\
    \ by the heat dissipation \nmethod. The sensor has a heating element and a thermocouple\
    \ encased in the ceramic. The heating \nelement warms up the ceramic and the thermocouple\
    \ measures the temperature rise. The magnitude of \nthe temperature rise varies\
    \ according to the amount of water in the porous ceramic matrix. Each sensor \n\
    must be calibrated according to soil type. This sensor requires a data-logger\
    \ to control the current \nexcitation module, to read the thermocouple outputs\
    \ and to compute soil m (from -10 to -2,500 kPa). \n \n3.2. Electrical resistance\
    \ sensors \n \nThese sensors consist of a porous material in which electrodes\
    \ are embedded to measure electrical \nresistance. When placed in the soil, the\
    \ sensor tends to reach an equilibrium with soil water and the \nelectrical resistance\
    \ reading can converted to a calibrated reading of m: the drier the soil, the\
    \ greater \nthe electrical resistance. Compared to tensiometers, the main advantage\
    \ of electrical resistance sensors \nis their much wider measuring range [22].\
    \ \nThe elements are covered with a synthetic membrane that protects the device\
    \ from corrosion. The \nchalk element prevents the salinity influence on the measurements.\
    \ Gypsum blocks are the oldest and \nsimplest electrical resistance sensors [23].\
    \ They are inexpensive and maintenance-free, but less \nresistant and long-lived\
    \ than other more advanced sensors. The gypsum material dissolves with time \n\
    and therefore the sensor must be replaced every year. Moreover, their response\
    \ to the change in soil \nmoisture is slow, especially in soils close to FC.\
    \ Generally, they work well in fine textured soil over a \nm range from -30 to\
    \ -1,500 kPa approximately, while their use in coarse soil is quite difficult.\
    \  \nWatermark (Irrometer Company, Inc.) is an example of electrical resistance\
    \ sensor [24]. The pore \nsize of its matrix is larger than in gypsum blocks;\
    \ this improves its sensitivity in wet soil and makes it \npossible to use this\
    \ sensor in coarse soils and in soil moisture conditions close to FC. Other advantages\
    \ \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2816\nof this\
    \ sensor are the accuracy and the durability, albeit small calibration shifts\
    \ may occur with time. \nHowever, the readings are affected by soil salinity due\
    \ to fertilizers or irrigation water, although the \nsensors are normally supplied\
    \ with built-in compensation for common salinity levels in the fields. \nRecently,\
    \ in the FLOWAID project we tested Watermark sensors in container plants with\
    \ poor results \nand we concluded that such a sensor is not suitable for monitoring\
    \ the water status of soilless \nsubstrates (usually close to saturation) and\
    \ for controlling irrigation in pot culture. \n \n3.3. Dielectric sensors \n \n\
    In dielectric sensors an alternating electric field is induced into the surrounding\
    \ media. By \nmeasuring voltages and currents induced by this field in the measuring\
    \ rods, the total complex \nelectrical impedance is obtained for the media. This\
    \ impedance relates to the complex permittivity, \nwhich can be converted into\x1F\
    \ soil  and bulk EC, on the premises of known media calibration. The \nsize and\
    \ shape of the electric field depends largely upon the shape and size of the used\
    \ electrodes for \nsensors. Furthermore, the penetration depth of the electric\
    \ field is limited and decays rapidly the \nfurther away you get from the electrodes,\
    \ as a reciprocal of the distance.  \nWith this technique, only an average of\
    \ the soil moisture in the measuring volume can be obtained. \nIn non-homogeneous\
    \ media or water content distributions one needs to take into account that the\
    \ water \ncloser to the electrodes contributes more to the average value. Especially\
    \ in growing media like \nrockwool (widely used for fruit vegetables grown in\
    \ greenhouses), where there is a large vertical \ngradient in , it is needed\
    \ to calibrate the dielectric sensors for the specific placement in the media\
    \ \n(vertical, horizontal, pin directions). For the 3-electrode version of the\
    \ WET sensor (Delta-T Devices \nLtd.; pin length 70 mm and distance of 2 × 16\
    \ mm), a measuring volume of about 220 cm3 was found \nwhen using a 99% electric\
    \ field influence reaching out to about 2 cm from the electrodes [25]. Some \n\
    sensors like Theta-probe (Delta-T Devices Ltd.) mimic a co-axial electrode design\
    \ by having a single \npin in the middle and three surrounding electrically connected\
    \ outer pins. Their sensing volume is \nsmaller and the readings are less susceptible\
    \ for disturbances or variations in  outside the pins. The \nsmaller measuring\
    \ volume for dielectric sensors might be a problem in non-heterogeneous soils.\
    \ Here, \none wants to obtain an average reading over a large volume, to get a\
    \ more representative reading with \nonly a single sensor. Several sensor concepts\
    \ try to enlarge their volume by making larger pin concept, \nfor instance AquaFlex\
    \ (Streat Instruments Ltd).  \nThere are different types of dielectric sensors\
    \ depending on the output signal used for estimating , \nbased on Time Domain\
    \ Reflectometry (TDR), Frequency Domain (FD) (Reflectometry and \nCapacitance),\
    \ Time Domain Transmission (TDT), Amplitude Domain Reflectometry (ADR) and Phase\
    \ \nTransmission sensors. All these sensors differ in terms of use and maintenance,\
    \ calibration \nrequirements, accuracy and price [26]. While TDR uses a pulsed\
    \ excitation wave, FD uses a fixed \nfrequency sine wave to measure the soil impedance.\
    \ The precision and the accuracy of TDR and FD \nsensors depend on the wave form\
    \ interpretation methods used in software [27]. Most of them are based \non the\
    \ relationship between  and dielectric constant (permittivity) of soil according\
    \ to the Topp’s \nequation [28]. The latter can be valid for the soils with low\
    \ clay content and a bulk density between 1.3 \nand 1.5 kg L-1 [29]. For other\
    \ kinds of soil special calibration is generally required [30]. \nSensors 2009,\
    \ 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2817\nFor many years TDR has\
    \ been the only principle used to measure soil . Expensive equipment is \nnecessary\
    \ for this kind of measurement; therefore, TDR technology is considered less suitable\
    \ for \nirrigation control in commercial crops, although very recently some authors\
    \ [31] reported on the \napplication of TDR sensor for irrigation scheduling in\
    \ nursery and greenhouse industry. \nFD-sensors for soil moisture (e.g., Theta-probe,\
    \ Delta-T Devices Ltd.) came onto the market more \nrecently. The main advantage\
    \ of FD sensors is the immediate and accurate reading, thus they are quite \n\
    suitable for automated irrigation control. However, there are some drawbacks.\
    \ For instance, they are \naffected by soil salinity, which attenuates the signal.\
    \ There is also general consensus that FD sensors \nmust be calibrated more frequently\
    \ than TDR sensors. Using a frequency of at least 1 GHz can \nminimize this problem\
    \ [32]. Soil porosity and temperature may also influence sensor readings, \nespecially\
    \ when frequencies lower than 20 MHz are used [23]. In the soil top layer, wide\
    \ temperature \nfluctuations occur during the day and the growing season, therefore\
    \ the measurement of temperature \nmust be incorporated in the sensor in order\
    \ to allow on-line correction. Likewise any other RZS, \ndielectric sensors must\
    \ be placed in strict contact with soil, since air gaps may result in erroneous\
    \ \nmeasurements. \nIn a series of laboratory or greenhouse experiments, we have\
    \ evaluated a few dielectric sensors such \nas Theta Probe ML2X and SM200 (both\
    \ from Delta-T Devices Ltd.). Generally, these sensors consist \nof two or more\
    \ electrodes separated by a plastic dielectric and positioned inside a cylinder;\
    \ a plastic \naccess tube covers all these elements. Obviously, the design may\
    \ change according to the specific \napplication. The measuring volume depends\
    \ on the distance between the two conductors and on their \nlength. In common\
    \ soils, Theta Probe is characterized by a 5% accuracy using the supplied calibration,\
    \ \nbut it is possible to achieve 1% accuracy after calibration to a specific\
    \ soil. This sensor seems quite \nsuitable for small-volume pots and containers\
    \ such as plug trays, which are largely used in greenhouse \nand nursery crops.\
    \ It can work up at temperature as high as 70 °C, although the accuracy decreased\
    \ \nabove 40 °C, always considering a calibration to a specific soil. \nSome experiments\
    \ were carried out on sandy soils and coconut fibre to verify the applicability\
    \ of \nTheta Probe ML2X in some growing media widely used in ornamental crops\
    \ [32]. The repeatability of \nmeasurements was good, both on all tested sandy\
    \ soils tested and on coconut fibre as well. About the \nsalinity effects on data\
    \ acquisition, in a 0.7 – 0.4% dS m-1 range, the salinity of the nutritive solution\
    \ \non coconut fibre substrate affected sensor reading with an error of  3 –\
    \ 4%. However, this error was \nunimportant and the use of Theta Probe ML2x to\
    \ control irrigation of plants grown in coconut fibres \ndid not affect plant\
    \ growth. Farina and Bacci [32] also observed that the temperature did not influence\
    \ \nthe repeatability of sensor readings. Theta Probe revealed some limitations\
    \ in presence of lack of \nhomogeneity in soil characteristics or when an incorrect\
    \ installation occurs. In fact, it’s strongly \nrecommended to insert sensors\
    \ into the soil without torsions that could lead to a poor contact between \n\
    sensor rods and soil particles. \nSM200 sensor, which is more recent than Theta\
    \ Probe, is suitable for many types of soil and \nsubstrates. Moreover, it is\
    \ barely affected by soil salinity and can be used at extreme temperatures, \n\
    since the operating range is between -20 and +60 °C. Measuring accuracy is 0.3%\
    \ for  from 0 to \n0.50 m3 m-3; as a function of temperature, the accuracy is\
    \ 0.07% at 20 °C and 0.13% in the 20 – 60 \n°C range. \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n\
    \ \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2818\nIn the recent past, a new generation\
    \ of dielectric sensors has been developed to measure both  and \nthe salinity\
    \ (namely, EC) of growing media, thus providing the possibility to control the\
    \ fertilisation as \nwell, for example by adjusting the concentration of the fertigation\
    \ water. Currently there are two \nsensors on the market: the WET (Delta-T Devices\
    \ Ltd.) and the 5TE (Decagon Devices Inc.). \nThe WET is a frequency domain dielectric\
    \ sensor that was originally designed and produced by \nIMAG-DLO Wageningen (The\
    \ Netherlands) [33] and is now manufactured and sold by Delta T-\nDevices Ltd.\
    \ at a cost of € 600 – 900. It is a 3-pin sensor, with the main advantage that\
    \ it measures \nwater content, EC and temperature in an all-in-one sensor. The\
    \ temperature readings are used to \ncorrect the  and EC variations with temperature.\
    \ The sensor has a high repeatability once inserted into \na growing medium and\
    \ left untouched (1%). However, to obtain good absolute readings, the sensor \n\
    needs a specific calibration for the type of growing medium. In its simple form,\
    \ one may use the \nTopp’s curve [28], which was made for TDR measurement at 150\
    \ MHz. Since the WET works at 20 \nMHz, it is much more susceptible to soil texture\
    \ and the manufacturer advises to use their standard \ncurves for sand, clay,\
    \ mineral soils etc., or to use a customer-defined calibration curve. The WET\
    \ is \nused for the agricultural market especially for irrigation and fertigation\
    \ control, mostly in greenhouses \nhorticulture. In this market, and as a derivative\
    \ of the original WET, it is sold by Grodan B.V. under \nthe name of WCM. WCM\
    \ can be used to control the root zone. Stradiot [34] even reports that by \n\
    maintaining differences between day and night moisture  rockwool slabs it is possible\
    \ to steer plants \ntowards vegetative or generative growth. \nThe WET was originally\
    \ designed to be used in soil, where normally EC is lower then 2 dS m-1. In \n\
    horticultural growing media, however, EC may be as high as 10 dS m-1. For this\
    \ reason, Grodan has \nmodified the original design and calibrates their sensors\
    \ up to 10 dS m-1, and Delta-T Devices Ltd. \nsupplies extended calibration curves\
    \ up to 5 dS m-1. In highly-saline soils, the accuracy of the standard \nWET is\
    \ not warranted; Bouksila [35], for instance, advises to use a soil specific calibration\
    \ here as \nwell. \nThe WET measures bulk EC, which is the total EC of the growing\
    \ media containing water, nutrients \nand air. However, generally growers are\
    \ not interested in bulk EC, but rather in pore water EC (ECpw), \nwhich is the\
    \ EC in the water extracted from the growing media, for instance by using suction\
    \ cup or by \nperforming a 1 : 2 water extract [36]. \nHilhorst [37] developed\
    \ a derivative of the WET, which has an easy-to-handle design for taking \nrapid\
    \ and multiple readings in container plants. It has a single insertion pin containing\
    \ both electrodes \nin the tip, and measures ECpw directly by using a special\
    \ model. Delta-T Devices Ltd. brought this \nprobe onto the market (Sigma-Probe),\
    \ but due to mechanical problems, and especially the limited \nrange over which\
    \ the ECpw model was valid, it was taken out of the market. Since then, several\
    \ \nresearches reported about modifications of the Hilhorst-model of ECpw to make\
    \ it possible to use the \nWET for direct measurement of ECpw [e.g., 38,39]. \n\
    In Italy, especially in container grown crops, mixtures of several materials such\
    \ as peat, perlite and \npumice (of volcanic origin) are being used as growing\
    \ media. Regalado et al. [40] reported about \npotential problems with the calibration\
    \ of the WET sensor in volcanic soils, due to the biased \ndetermination of .\
    \ Therefore, they proposed to use an empirical calibration for the water content\
    \ \nbased upon soil bulk density, and an estimate of the sensor’s effective frequency.\
    \ Recently, Incrocci et \nal. [39] conducted a study on the calibration of the\
    \ WET using different types of growing media \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2819\n(perlite, pumice, peat and mixtures of these\
    \ materials). They concluded that: i)  calibration was \nfaintly dependent on\
    \ the type of substrate and only slightly affected by the salinity of irrigation\
    \ water; \nii) at least in the peat-pumice mixture, the linear regression between\
    \ bulk EC and ECpw was markedly \naffected by , the slope decreasing with increasing.\
    \ An equation differing from the one published by \nHilhorst [37] was proposed\
    \ to estimate ECpw from the WET readings of permittivity, bulk EC and \ntemperature.\
    \ \nThe 5TE sensor is a low-power sensor that measures soil , temperature and\
    \ bulk EC. It is very new \non the market (it appeared in 2007) and costs about\
    \ half the price of the standard WET, due to its \nsimpler housing design, based\
    \ upon a moulded and combined electrode-printed circuit board design. It \nhas\
    \ an RS232 output, which makes it necessary to use an external micro-computer\
    \ to handle the data, \nand makes it less suitable to connect it to standard data\
    \ loggers. The 5TE outputs just three \nsimple values for permittivity, EC and\
    \ temperature, which makes interfacing quiet simple. The WET-\nsensor has a similar\
    \ serial interface, but decoding its data requires a more complex algorithm. \n\
    The 5TE uses 3.6 – 15 VDC at 10 mA during 150 ms measurement. Its operating temperature\
    \ range \nis between -40 and 50 °C and it has small dimensions.  values are obtained\
    \ by using the FD \ntechnology at about 70 MHz (based upon the previous ECH2O-probe),\
    \ and by utilizing a higher \nfrequency than the WET. Moreover, the 5TE has minimal\
    \ salinity and textural effects. It has a \nresolution of 0.08% from 0 to 0.50\
    \ m3 m-3  and an accuracy (when using a medium specific \ncalibration) of ±\
    \ 1 – 2% in any porous medium with EC < 10 dS m-1. EC is obtained using a separate\
    \ \nlow-frequency EC technique based upon the EC-5 probe, and two stainless steel\
    \ screws which makes \nthe sensor more robust. The operating range is 0 – 23 dS\
    \ m-1 (bulk EC), with a resolution of 0.01 dS m-\n1 from 0 to 7 dS m-1, and 0.05\
    \ dS m-1 from 7 to 23 dS/m. Accuracy is ±10% for 0 – 7 dS m-1; user \ncalibration\
    \ is needed above 7 dS m-1. For a number of mineral soils, a single calibration\
    \ curve seems \nsuitable. The probe uncertainty increases with increasing , and\
    \ at higher EC values the probe signal is \nattenuated. Bogena et al. [41] tested\
    \ the previous EC-5 probe and concluded that temperature and EC \neffects on the\
    \ sensor reading should be corrected, using appropriate correction functions.\
    \ However, \nthey, as well as Kizito et al. [42], report that the family of ECH2O\
    \ sensors (EC-5 and ECH2O-TE) is \nsuited for large RZS networks because of their\
    \ low-cost and limited needs for calibration. \n \n4. Irrigation Controllers \n\
    \ \nMost of the off-the-shelf sensors are equipped only with manual or digital\
    \ readers, able to make \nmany elaborations but without any device to automatically\
    \ activation the irrigation process. However, \nall sensors can be integrated\
    \ in a dedicated system for automatic irrigation. \nThe simplest irrigation controller\
    \ based on RZS is represented by a switching tensiometer. There \nare two main\
    \ systems available commercially. The first consists in an electronic switch that\
    \ can be \nmounted on the vacuum gauge dial of the tensiometer and set to start\
    \ irrigation at pre-set values of soil \ntension. This switch normally operates\
    \ with AC current flow, but it’s possible to order direct current \n(DC) systems.\
    \ The vacuum gauge is equipped with a magnet and a magnetic pick-up switch. When\
    \ the \npre-set soil tension is reached, the switch closes and activates the irrigation\
    \ pump, which distributes a \npre-fixed amount of water. The second type of irrigation\
    \ controller uses a pressure transducer instead \nof a vacuum gauge. The pressure\
    \ transducer measures any variation in soil tension and modifies the \nSensors\
    \ 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2820\nelectric current\
    \ flow accordingly; the reading is continuous. More advanced irrigation controllers\
    \ are, \nfor instance, the GP1 irrigation system manufactured by Delta-T Devices\
    \ Ltd. and the prototype \ndeveloped by Bacci et al. [43]. \nWith GP1, Delta-T\
    \ Devices Ltd. also allows the possibility of upgrading an existing controller\
    \ \n(central controller, residential or commercial timer) by adding intelligence\
    \ to it. GP1 optimizes \nwatering using both simple and complex irrigation algorithm\
    \ based on multiple parameters, including \nsoil moisture and weather data, allowing\
    \ multiple irrigation ‘start-and-stop’ conditions. \nThe prototype developed by\
    \ Bacci et al. [43] is based on a programmable data-logger (Tattletale 5F, \n\
    Onset Computer Corporation), to which up to eight tensiometers and other sensors\
    \ (e.g., thermometer, \nhygrometer, anemometer, net radiometer etc.) can be connected.\
    \ SKTM 650 (Skye Instruments Ltd.) \ntensiometers are used in consideration of\
    \ their low price, accuracy and small dimensions. Obviously, \nother RZS’ could\
    \ be employed. The current version of this device can control four electro-valves.\
    \ The \nbuilt-in software allows the setting of m threshold to active irrigation\
    \ and the management of the \nirrigation cycle (time, dose, etc.). Each tensiometer\
    \ can be managed independently or the irrigation \nactivation can be driven by\
    \ the average reading of two or more tensiometers. The software implements \n\
    an algorithm to calculate ET0 according to CIMIS equation [44]. Hourly ET0 values\
    \ are used to check \nthe irrigation method based on m measurements according\
    \ to an integrated system described in Bacci \net al. [43]. The new version of\
    \ the system under development will be provided of a 32 BIT CPU with: \neight\
    \ analogic channels for the acquisition of different parameters (micrometeorological\
    \ data, soil \nwater status etc.); eight I/O digital counters for water meters\
    \ measuring the volumes of both irrigation \nand drainage water; electro-valves\
    \ control. System expansion will be assured by RS-485 port that \nallows the connection\
    \ of S-bus modules of two types: analogical (signal range 0 5V; 0 20 mA) and\
    \ \ndigital (relays control). The S-bus interface allows the management of actuators\
    \ and sensory by means \nof an only bus to four wires: two wires to power supply\
    \ and two wires to digital signal (informative \ncontent). The bus connects the\
    \ different modules in cascade, eliminating the problems associated to \nwiring\
    \ and the interference on the sensor signal. \n \n4.1. Sensor positioning \n \n\
    For the growers, a complete irrigation control system must be cost effective and\
    \ user-friendly. The \nsensors used for monitoring soil water content must be\
    \ inexpensive and the minimum number of \nsensors needed for a given irrigation\
    \ plot must be clearly defined. Moreover, the sensor must be easily \nremoved\
    \ and reinstalled, as in many farms (for instance, in greenhouses and nurseries)\
    \ there are \nseveral crops over the year. Knowing where and how many sensors\
    \ are positioned in the crop is \ntherefore crucial. \nA single RZS may be not\
    \ enough due to possible malfunctioning and, more importantly, because it \nmonitors\
    \ only a limited volume (sensor cup has a small sphere of action) and area of\
    \ the cultivation. \nLarge variability in the root zone moisture may occur as\
    \ results of the heterogeneity in both \nsoil/substrate characteristics and plant\
    \ water relations. Also under relatively uniform conditions as \nthose occurring\
    \ in greenhouses and nurseries, there is large variability in the ETC of individual\
    \ plants, \nand this may result in important differences in the soil dehydration\
    \ rate among different zones in the \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n   \n \n \n2821\nirrigated area. For instance, in greenhouses the plants\
    \ close to lateral windows and/or to heating \nsystems tend to transpire much\
    \ more, compared to plants growing in other locations. \nIn an open-air nursery\
    \ at CESPEVI in Pistoia (Italy), Bacci et al. [45] determined the readings of\
    \ 12 \nidentical tensiometers each placed in different pots filled with a peat-pumice\
    \ (1:1, v:v) mix. The pots \nwere located within 0.5 m each from other. The variability\
    \ ranged between 17% for container water \ncapacity and 21% for m -7.5 kPa (the\
    \ irrigation set-point fixed for the experiment). Thus, more RZS’ \nare needed\
    \ in the irrigation area in order to obtain significant mean values of soil water\
    \ status (also by \nappropriate statistical treatment of data) and to overcome\
    \ the potential problems due to sensor \nbreakdown. \nSensor position inside the\
    \ growing medium is another important issue. In field crops, it is generally \n\
    recommended that RZS’ be installed in pairs, one at one-third and the other at\
    \ two-thirds of the rooting \ndepth. In pot plants, the root system has a propensity\
    \ to develop in the bottom half of the container \nwith very few roots in the\
    \ top substrate. Moreover, irrigation frequency is very high (up to several \n\
    times a day) due to the limited water buffer capacity of the pot as a whole. Under\
    \ these conditions, in-\nbetween successive irrigation events there are minimal\
    \ variations of the overall  which remains close \nto FC However, there is\
    \ a large vertical gradient in : at the bottom, the substrate remains nearly\
    \ \nsaturated and shows minimal variations in , whereas the top layer desiccates\
    \ rapidly after irrigation \ndue to the gravitational water flow, thus showing\
    \ wide oscillations in moisture. Therefore, RZS’ must \nbe placed in an intermediate\
    \ position. In plants cultivated in pots with a volume ranging from \napproximately\
    \ 1.5 to 9.0 L (pot diameter of 12 or 18 cm, respectively), Bacci and colleagues\
    \ [46,47] \nfound that the best position is at one-third of the pot height from\
    \ the top and at 3 – 4 cm from the pot \nedge. It was also found that, when drip\
    \ irrigation is used, the sensor should be inserted in the substrate \nat a 90°\
    \ angle towards the nozzle. \n \n5. Irrigation Strategies Based on RZS  \n \n\
    Many research papers have documented that the schedule of irrigation by means\
    \ of RZS may \nsignificantly reduce the water use of many field and greenhouse\
    \ crops (cultivated in both soil or \nsoilless media) without any important effects\
    \ on crop productivity. A few examples are those \npublished very recently by\
    \ Zotarelli et al. (field tomato) [48], Tuzel at al. (greenhouse cucumber) [21]\
    \ \nand Pardossi et al. (outdoor pot ornamentals) [8]. \nWhen RZS’ are applied\
    \ to schedule irrigation, the controller uses the data from the sensing point(s)\
    \ \nin the root zone to determine the moment and duration of watering. The operating\
    \ principle is that, \nwhenever a pre-set threshold (‘start’ value) of  or m\
    \ is reached, the valves of the irrigation pipelines \nare opened till the ‘stop’\
    \ value (generally, close to FC) is reached. In addition to ‘start’ and ‘stop’\
    \ \nthresholds, RZS-based irrigation controllers generally require other inputs\
    \ from the user, such as \nminimum and maximum duration of watering, and maximum\
    \ elapsed time without irrigation in \nconsideration of possible sensor failure.\
    \ Several devices (e.g., GP1, Delta-T Devices Ltd.) are \ncommercially available\
    \ to provide a ‘start-and-stop’ irrigation control based on two or more RZS’ \n\
    buried in and underneath the root-zone. This set of sensors can monitor the movement\
    \ of the water into \nthe deeper layers and minimize percolation losses. \nSensors\
    \ 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2822\nThe  or m ‘start’\
    \ value depends on crop species and developmental stage, soil characteristics\
    \ and \nenvironmental conditions as well. For m, the typical range is between\
    \ -20 and -70 kPa in soil \n(depending on soil texture) or between -4 and -10\
    \ kPa in soilless substrates [47]. By determining the \ndivergence in leaf water\
    \ potential between well-watered and un-watered plants, Thompson et al. [49] \n\
    identified the m threshold for pepper, melon and tomato grown under the typical\
    \ greenhouse \nconditions of south-eastern coast of Spain: they were -58 kPa for\
    \ pepper, -35 kPa for melon and -38 or \n-58 kPa for tomato grown, respectively,\
    \ in spring or in winter. Therefore, optimal ‘start’ m value may \ndecreased\
    \ under lower ET conditions, at least in some crop species. \n \n5.1. Deficit\
    \ irrigation \n \nRZS may be valuable tool for the implementation of regulated\
    \ deficit irrigation, which aims to \ncontrol the vegetative vigour of crop plants\
    \ and improve produce quality [50]. For instance, regulated \ndeficit irrigation\
    \ is largely used for wine grapes in regions where this crop is regularly irrigated,\
    \ such \nas California and Australia. In red grape varieties, a moderate water\
    \ stress imposed a few weeks after \nfruit set and maintained midway through berry\
    \ formation may enhance the maturity of berries and \nimprove the quality of wine.\
    \ For best results, it is reported that the average soil m should be kept at\
    \ -\n150 to -200 kPa in sandy soil, around -250 kPa in loamy soil and at -300\
    \ to -400 kPa in clay soil [51]. \nTherefore, a successful application of deficit\
    \ irrigation needs the determination of soil water status \nand, in consideration\
    \ of the range of m previously reported, tensiometer are of little value and\
    \ \ndielectric or granular matrix sensor must be used. \nAn example of deficit\
    \ irrigation regulated by RZS is the work conducted very recently by Tuzel et\
    \ \nal. [21]. In a greenhouse cucumber crop at Izmir (Turkey), they used GP1 controllers\
    \ with WET \nsensors buried at 20-cm depth to control full irrigation or two deficit\
    \ irrigation regimes, as compared to \ngrower’s practice (experience-based scheduling).\
    \ Water was applied when  reached 0.25, 0.22 and \n0.18 m3 m-3, respectively,\
    \ in Full, Deficit 1 and Deficit 2 irrigation treatments, which corresponded to\
    \ \na depletion of available water in the root zone of 20, 40 and 60%, respectively.\
    \ It was found that RZS-\nbased irrigation resulted in no noticeable percolation\
    \ loss or over-irrigation in contrast to the \ntraditional farm practice. Moreover,\
    \ deficit irrigation increased crop water use efficiency by 40 – 42% \nand 27\
    \ – 28% compared to grower’s schedule and full irrigation, respectively. \n \n\
    5.2. Zero-runoff irrigation of container crops \n \nThe use of RZS seems very\
    \ promising in the outdoor cultivation of pot ornamentals. These crops \nare generally\
    \ over-irrigated for a series of reasons, such as poor irrigation scheduling (typically\
    \ based \non growers’ experience and the use of simple timers) and the plant sensitivity\
    \ to salinity, which \ninevitably increases the leaching fraction, which is the\
    \ fraction of applied water that is drained out \nfrom the pot bottom drained\
    \ water. A leaching fraction of 25 – 30% is generally necessary to prevent \n\
    the salinity build-up in pot plants, especially when fertigation and/or saline\
    \ water are used by the \ngrowers. Moreover, in many nurseries, at least in the\
    \ area of Pistoia, there is the practice to place \ndifferent plant species in\
    \ the same cultivation plot, which results in the tendency to regulate irrigation\
    \ \non the basis of the most water demanding crop. \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n\
    \   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2823\nIn a work conducted recently at CESPEVI\
    \ under the typical growing conditions of commercial \nnurseries (in particular,\
    \ growing different plant species in the same plot), Pardossi et al. [8] compared\
    \ \ntimer and tensiometer control of fertigation of pot ornamentals. In the latter\
    \ treatment, the irrigation \nwas controlled by means of tensiometer placed in\
    \ one pot hosting a plant (the sentinel) of Prunus \nlaurocerasus, the species\
    \ with the average ETC among the ones under investigation; the others were \n\
    Forsythia intermedia, Photinia x fraseri, and Viburnum tinus. \nCompared to timers,\
    \ the use of tensiometers decreased the water application by 23% and the \nleaching\
    \ of nutrients with drainage water by 31%, thus alleviating the contamination\
    \ (with nitrates, for \ninstance) of ground and surface water. No differences\
    \ between the two scheduling methods were \nobserved in terms of plant growth\
    \ and market value, as assessed at the end of the growing season. The \nreduction\
    \ of water application allowed by RZS resulted from a lower frequency of irrigation\
    \ compared \nto timer-based control, with minimal differences between the two\
    \ methods in terms of leaching \nfraction. \nVery similar results were found in\
    \ another experiment carried out at CESPEVI by Bacci et al. [43] \nwith container\
    \ cultivation of Hypericum hidcote. They observed that, compared to timer-based\
    \ \nirrigation scheduling, the tensiometer maintained a more favourable substrate\
    \ water status to plant \ngrowth in periods of peak ETC, as suggested by Figure\
    \ 3 where the data of m recorded during three \nfollowing days in July 2004 are\
    \ shown. In timer treatment, m decreased down to approximately -25 \nkPa, while\
    \ in tensiometer-controlled culture m remained below -10 kPa in reasons of best\
    \ water \ndistribution during the day, notwithstanding the irrigation was permitted\
    \ only in four preset time \nwindows, according to the local growers’ practice.\
    \ In soilless substrates growth reductions can occur at \nm as low as -16 kPa\
    \ [e.g., 52,53]. \nFigure 3. Changes in the substrate m in pots with Hypericum\

    \ improvement of irrigation efficiency in container crops may be attained by means\
    \ of ‘start-\nand-stop’ control system. Such a system should maintain m between\
    \ -8 to -10 kPa and -2 to -3.0 kPa, \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ – 035 and 0.45 – 0.55 m3 m-3, depending on the \nnature of growing medium. In\
    \ this range of soil m, the pot water content remains lower than FC and \nthe\
    \ loss of water by drainage is minimized. This system, known as ‘zero-runoff’\
    \ irrigation, may be \nachieved also by the a priori determination of the water\
    \ dose needed to increase substrate  from the \n‘start’ value to the value close\
    \ to water capacity. Obviously, such a dose depends on both pot volume \nand the\
    \ hydraulic properties of the growing media. \nFollowing this approach and using\
    \ greenhouse-grown pot geranium as plant model, in 2006 we \nconducted a trial\
    \ at the University of Pisa to compare two scheduling methods (timer vs. tensiometer)\
    \ \nin open drip irrigation system (L. Bacci and L. Incrocci, unpublished). Rooted\
    \ cuttings of geranium \n(Pelargonium peltatum) were transplanted in pots with\
    \ volume of 1.5 L and height of 13 cm, filled a \npeat-perlite mixture; plant\
    \ density was approximately 8 plant m-2. Every day at a fixed time (08:00 \na.m.)\
    \ or whenever the tensiometer (SKTM 650) reading reached the threshold value (-6\
    \ kPa), a pre-\nestablished water dose was applied to each pot by means of self-compensating\
    \ drippers (discharge rate \nof 2 L h-1). In timer treatment, the water dose ranged\
    \ between 1.2 to 1.8 L m-2 according to the growth \nstage and the climate inside\
    \ the greenhouse, that is the dose tended to increase during the cultivation;\
    \ \nactually, in timer treatment we followed the growers’ practice. Conversely,\
    \ in tensiometer-based \nirrigation, a fixed water volume of 1.8 L m-2 was established\
    \ preliminarily in order to restore the full \nwater container capacity with a\
    \ leaching fraction not higher than 5%. This quantity was divided in \nthree doses,\
    \ four minutes apart. No differences between the two methods were observed regarding\
    \ crop \nETC, growth and commercial value; however, at the end of cultivation\
    \ in tensiometer treatment water \nrunoff was less than 1.0 L m-2 (approximately\
    \ 2% of total applied water) against 14.3 L m-2 (23% of \napplied water) in the\
    \ one scheduling method. \nNevertheless, the application of zero-runoff irrigation\
    \ in pot cultivation has some difficulties. \nFirstly, it requires the use of\
    \ raw water with low salinity; otherwise there is a progressive salinity \nbuild-up\
    \ in the root zone, which results in plant growth reduction. Moreover, it is necessary\
    \ to install \npressure-compensating nozzles with uniform and low discharge rate,\
    \ in order to synchronize the \nsubstrate moistening and the response of RZS.\
    \ Too fast irrigation may lead to over-watering before \nRZS senses the ‘stop’\
    \ conditions in the measuring volume (generally, a small fraction of total \n\
    container volume). Finally, the sentinel pot(s) does/do not provide a perfect\
    \ representation of water \nneeds of all plants in the plot, therefore extra water\
    \ is required to ensure that the driest pots in the \nirrigated area (because\
    \ of higher ETC and/or lower discharge rate than expected) will receive the \n\
    necessary dose. As matter of fact, real zero-runoff irrigation in container culture\
    \ can be achieved only \nthrough the recovery of drainage water (closed system)\
    \ [8]; in free-drain (open) culture the goal is to \nreduce leaching fraction\
    \ as much as possible, say, below 10 – 15%. \n \n5.3. Fertigation and dual water\
    \ irrigation \n \nThe availability of sensors (WET and 5TE) that are capable of\
    \ also monitoring the soil salinity has \nopened new possibilities for the automatic\
    \ control of fertigation and/or the application of a dual-water \nirrigation scheme.\
    \ In the FLOWAID project, in cooperation with Spagnol Greenhouse Technologies\
    \ \nwe developed a prototype of fertigation device, which is able to change the\
    \ nutrient content (thus, EC) \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n   \n \n \n2825\nof the fertigation water as well as the source of raw water\
    \ based on the measurements of the ECpw of \nthe growing medium (peat-pumice mixture)\
    \ by means of WET sensors. \nThe prototype was tested at CESPEVI in the spring\
    \ and summer of 2008 in an experiment with pot \nornamental plants (the same used\
    \ in the trial described in paragraph 5.2), where we simulated the \navailability\
    \ of saline water (EC = 1.50 dS m-1) (L. Incrocci et al., unpublished). Saline\
    \ water might be \nthe kind supplied, for instance, by an urban wastewater treatment\
    \ plant. A project is underway in \nPistoia district for an irrigation network\
    \ using the treated wastewater from the city.  \nFigure 4. Changes in the salinity\
    \ (EC) of the pore water (ECpw;, thin line) in the growing \nmedium (peat-pumice\
    \ mixture) and of the nutrient solution (thick line) fed to pot \nornamentals\
    \ grown at CESPEVI (Pistoia) in the spring-summer of 2008. Two irrigation \nregimes\
    \ differing for scheduling method and the source of raw water were compared: :\
    \ 1) \ntimer control with nutrient solution (EC = 0.80 dS m-1) prepared using\
    \ low-salinity \ngroundwater (EC = 0.50 dS m-1); 2) WET scheduling and two sources\
    \ of water \n(groundwater or saline water with EC = 1.50 dS m-1) to prepare the\
    \ nutrient solution with a \nmaximum EC of 1.80 dS m-1. In the latter, the nutrient\
    \ solution EC was modulated by \nchanging the rate of fertiliser addition and\
    \ the water source in order to maintain the ECpw \nbelow 2.50 dS m-1. In the lower\
    \ graph, the bars close to the abscissa indicate the source of \nirrigation water:\

    \ the growing season the prototype used saline water, fresh water or both (at\
    \ \nvariable ratio), as shown in Figure 4. The irrigation regime did not influence\
    \ plant growth. However, \ncompared to the timer, the WET-based scheduling reduced\
    \ the seasonal water consumption by 35% \n(499 vs 325 L m-2), which was provided\
    \ by saline water by 45%; therefore, in the WET treatment the \nconsumption of\
    \ groundwater was 36% of the one recorded in the timer treatment. \n \n5.4. Integrated\
    \ scheduling method \n \nIrrigation timing and water dosage are the key aspects\
    \ of watering scheduling. Available equipment \nand specially soil moisture monitoring\
    \ devices, provide all the information required for irrigation \nmanagement, but\
    \ frequently lack in representativeness and reliability. To solve this problem,\
    \ ET \ncomputing and soil moisture monitoring methods should be integrated to\
    \ improve automatic irrigation \nsystem performances in field and in pots [54,55]\
    \ and to guarantee system functioning in case of sensor \ndamaging [56]. Unfortunately,\
    \ the application of climate-based methods to pot plants requires a \ndifferent\
    \ approach to crop coefficient computing [e.g., 43,57]. \nNorrie et al. [58] developed\
    \ an automatic irrigation system that integrated both electronic \ntensiometers\
    \ and weather station to estimated ETC with Penman-Monteith equation [5]. This\
    \ system \nwas tested in a greenhouse soilless culture (peat bag) of tomato. The\
    \ information about ETC was used \nto define the ‘start’ tension threshold as\
    \ well as the concentration (EC) of fertigation water: during \nperiods of intense\
    \ ETC the irrigation was more frequent (i.e., the trigger set-point was less negative)\
    \ \nand the EC was reduced with respect to periods with low ETC. \nMore recently,\
    \ Bacci et al. [43] suggested the use of tensiometer readings for the estimation\
    \ of crop \ncoefficient in potted plants using the CIMIS equation [44] for the\
    \ assessment of ET0. In this way, after \na short period of calibration for different\
    \ ornamental plants grown in containers, the system can work \nautonomously, controlling\
    \ the functioning of tensiometer by means of an indirect estimation of ETC. \n\
    \ \n6. ICT Technology for Irrigation Management \n \n6.1. Decision support system\
    \ \n \nDue to soil spatial variability, many sensors are needed in each irrigation\
    \ plot or for every group of \nsprinklers or drippers in the field, thus resulting\
    \ in high investment and maintenance costs, especially \nwhen wired sensors are\
    \ being used. Gathering real-time, fine-grained data is critical for success,\
    \ but it \nis not possible with current wired data-loggers which are both expensive\
    \ and not able to react to \nsignificant events (e.g., to increase sensing rate\
    \ during a rain storm). Nowadays wireless \ncommunication is a simple and low-cost\
    \ technology thanks to the wide diffusion of cell phones, ISM, \nGSM, WI-FI devices\
    \ and SMS bi-directional delivery, satellites and the Internet [59]. Moreover,\
    \ it \nenables to communicate quickly and store a great amount of information\
    \ helpful in water budgeting \nand irrigation scheduling. \nThe combination of\
    \ the new technology with data processing algorithms and models could be used\
    \ \nto develop decision support system (DSS) with positive effects for a sustainable\
    \ and efficient use of \nnatural resources in agricultural production and enabling\
    \ the decision maker to optimise production \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2827\nand profit through cost reduction. An example\
    \ of DSS is the FLOW-AID system [60]. This system \nconsists of an array of irrigation\
    \ controllers distributed over the farm zones to be irrigated (Figure 5). \nThe\
    \ controllers are connected via a wireless communication link to a local computer,\
    \ which retrieves \nregularly the data from RZS’ and weather station, and updates\
    \ the irrigation scheduling programs \nrunning autonomously in the controllers.\
    \ A DSS running on the local computer and partly on a remote \ncomputer (connected\
    \ via the Internet) assists the grower in the optimization of the scheduler programs\
    \ \nfor the irrigation controllers on a long-term as well as on a short-term basis.\
    \ For example, on a long \nterm the DSS provides the grower with an optimized\
    \ crop planting plan, a set of irrigation scheduling \ntasks and an estimate of\
    \ annual water use per each irrigation plot. On a short term, and based on actual\
    \ \ncrop status, weather and, possibly the weather forecast, the DSS irrigation\
    \ scheduler module predicts \ncrop water demand and suggests the optimal scheduling\
    \ strategy for each plot, including the source of \nwater if different types of\
    \ water are available (well, reservoir, recycled water, irrigation network etc.).\
    \ \nThe selected irrigation tasks, including parameter settings, are then downloaded\
    \ into the remote \nirrigation controllers. The irrigation scheduler is run on\
    \ a day-to-day basis (or hour-to hour, for \ninstance in container cultivation)\
    \ and, if needed, the individual controllers are reprogrammed. Each \nirrigation\
    \ plot has an individual controller node, and local or remote sensors are added\
    \ to it as needed \nby the application, either via hard-wire or a wireless link.\
    \ A typical node has the tasks to monitor soil \nwater status and other data (for\
    \ instance, soil and air temperature), and to open and close multiple \nvalves.\
    \ Once programmed by the irrigation scheduler, the controller keeps on running\
    \ its tasks \nautonomously, until it is re-programmed or stopped by the local\
    \ computer. This makes the irrigation of \nindividual plots fairly safe as it\
    \ does not depend on real-time communication with a remote computer. \nFigure\

    \ sensor networks \n \nWireless sensor networks are a new technology that promises\
    \ fine grain monitoring in time and \nspace, and at a lower cost, than is currently\
    \ possible [60,61]. Wireless sensor networks for irrigation \nmanagement are presently\
    \ offered by several companies (e.g., Crossbow Technologies, Inc.; Netafim \n\
    Sensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2828\nLtd.; Delta-T\
    \ Devices Ltd.; Decagon Devices, Inc.). However, these systems are still quite\
    \ expensive \nand have high-energy requirements. According to several authors\
    \ [e.g., 62,63], at the current stage of \ndevelopment wireless sensor networks\
    \ are not reliable and affordable enough for wide commercial \napplication, even\
    \ if very recently we [60] and other authors [64,65] have presented a new low-cost\
    \ \nmulti-hop wireless sensor network monitoring real-time substrate moisture,\
    \ temperature and EC with \ngood results in the control of irrigation and nutrient\
    \ applications. \nAccording to some tests proposed by Cardell-Oliver et al. [66],\
    \ wireless sensor networks have great \npotential to provide dynamic, real-time\
    \ data about monitored variables of a landscape enabling \nscientists to measure\
    \ properties that have not previously been observable. However, to ensure effective\
    \ \ndata gathering by sensor networks for monitoring remote outdoor environments,\
    \ the following \nproblems remain: reactivity, the ability of the network to react\
    \ to its environment and provide only \nrelevant data to users; robustness, the\
    \ ability of network nodes to function correctly in harsh outdoor \nenvironments;\
    \ network lifetime, maximizing the length of time the network is able to deliver\
    \ data \nbefore batteries are exhausted. \nIn the FLOWAID project, Balendonck\
    \ et al. [60] experimented in container grown ornamentals \nwith a self-made low-cost\
    \ wireless sensor network (hybrid mesh network design) based upon the T-\nnode\
    \ system from SOWNET Technologies B.V. combined with an SM200 (Delta-T Devices\
    \ Ltd.) \nsensor. The T-Nodes are the ones originally developed by TNO Defence,\
    \ Security and Safety (The \nNetherlands) for wireless sensor networks. They combine\
    \ a microcontroller for local processing, a \nradio for digital communications\
    \ and I/O abilities to interface with sensors, actuators and external \nsystems.\
    \ They use an 868 MHz FSK transceiver with ranges up to 120 meters in free space\
    \ and 40 \nmeter indoors. They have power consumption (at 3V) of 18 mA (TX) and\
    \ 13 mA (RX), and 20 μA in \nsleep mode; moreover, they have a self-organizing\
    \ ultra low power multi-hop protocol and an ultra-\ncompact design. Six sensor\
    \ nodes and three repeaters were built and evaluated during five months in \n\
    spring-summer 2007 in semi-commercial nursery operational environment at CESPEVI.\
    \ This work \ncontinued during summer 2008 with an improved design: a new antenna\
    \ design for higher signal \nstrength; housing with a double wall; a construction\
    \ for protection of the electronics against high \ntemperatures. The software\
    \ in the firmware of the wireless nodes was changed to optimize power use. \n\
    In the current configuration, such a system costs about € 700 per node, including\
    \ an SM200 sensor \n(about € 250). Functional tests showed that a maximum range\
    \ of about 100 meters between node and \nrepeater is feasible under line-of-sight\
    \ conditions. Long term experiments at CESPEVI showed that a \nrange of 60 m can\
    \ be obtained. However, some short and not-so-short lasting node and sensor failures\
    \ \noccurred either due to non-optimal mechanical construction of the housing,\
    \ condensation, and \nunforeseen external events (theft). Even if in the second\
    \ year there was much progress with the \ncommunication abilities of the SOWNET\
    \ system compared to the previous year, the performance is \nstill not as reliable\
    \ as needed. \nRecently, the Crossbow EKO Wireless Sensor network has become available\
    \ (Crossbow \nTechnologies, Inc.), which operates in a true mesh-network topology,\
    \ is solar powered and enables a \nlong maintenance free operation. In addition,\
    \ it has an open sensor interface to be able to integrate new \ntypes of sensors.\
    \ Each EKO wireless node supports up to four sensors (soil moisture and temperature;\
    \ \nair temperature and humidity). Sensors are plugged into the unit without the\
    \ necessity to connect wires \nto terminal blocks or change jumper configurations.\
    \ A single EKO system can support up to 35 nodes \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n  \
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2829\nand 140 sensing points. The management\
    \ of the network of EKO nodes is based on a 2.4 GHz \nradio/processor module.\
    \ The system worked more or less flawlessly during the whole long-term \nexperiment\
    \ at CESPEVI in 2008. A reliable operating range of more than 200 m in-between\
    \ two \nindividual sensor nodes was obtained. The sensor data were made accessible\
    \ on-line via the Internet, \nand the web-based software tool worked fine as well\
    \ as the solar cell based power supply. Very \ninfrequently a node needed to be\
    \ restarted; there have been no major system failures. \nBased upon these results,\
    \ Balendonck and Hemming concluded (unpublished data) that this system \nis currently\
    \ the best commercially available alternative to work with. However, in the current\
    \ \nconfiguration a system like this costs about € 600 per node, including a Watermark\
    \ sensor (about € \n90). In the summer 2009 we plan to conduct an experiment with\
    \ Crossbow EKO technology coupled to \nthe 5TE sensor for , EC and T. The approximate\
    \ total cost per node for this configuration is € 800 – \n900, which is still\
    \ too high for it to become a widespread commercial success for high density wireless\
    \ \nsensor networks, such those required by the nurseries in Pistoia area with\
    \ hundreds of irrigation plots. \nUntil now, the communication among RZS’, controller\
    \ and irrigation valves has been assured by \nhydraulic or electric systems. The\
    \ first one, through some pulses, and using a unidirectional \ncommunication,\
    \ activated the on/off operation of the valves. Electric communication foresees\
    \ the \nusage of wires instead of tubes and the activation of the valves takes\
    \ place by the usage of solenoids. \nWith growing field size and by having more\
    \ irrigated crops, in the near future there will also be a big \nneed to be able\
    \ to control remotely valves by using a wireless system. Coates et al. [64] report\
    \ on \nsuccessful field experiments with prototypes of this equipment. Their latest\
    \ technology is based upon \nthe 900 MHz low-power wireless module (Crossbow Technologies,\
    \ Inc.) [61]. \nAlthough the use of wireless systems to convey data from a RZS\
    \ towards a central computer is far \nmore widespread, recently wireless valve\
    \ controllers appeared upon the market (f.i. Hunter Industries \nInc.; FreeWire,\
    \ Wireless Irrigation Controller, Green Wireless System, Inc.; CYCLIK, Rain Bird\
    \ \nCorporation), and find their way, for instance into irrigation applications\
    \ for agriculture and golf \ncourse management. \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nOn the\
    \ market there is a wide range of RZS’ that may be applied for farm level irrigation\
    \ \nmanagement and their selection is not simple, since several issues must been\
    \ taken into consideration. \nA selection method has been suggested by Muňoz-Carpena\
    \ [26]. It computes a final sensor value based \non an array of questions regarding\
    \ its attributes: measuring range, accuracy, repeatability, \nmethodology for\
    \ data communication and handling, maintenance, safety and, obviously, price.\
    \ \nFrom the viewpoint of measured quantity, two classes of RZS’ can be identified.\
    \ Hydraulic \ntensiometers have a higher resolution in dryer media and their readings\
    \ are less sensitive to the media \ntype (no medium-specific calibration is needed).\
    \ However, they require more maintenance and, in very \ndry soils, they fail.\
    \ Low-cost dielectric tensiometer without this drawback may be available in the\
    \ near \nfuture. Dielectric sensors for  have a better resolution at higher water\
    \ contents, in the  range of  \n0.15 – 0.40 m3 m-3 (or even higher in artificial\
    \ growing media with high porosity), and they do not \nneed much maintenance.\
    \ However, often they require a soil specific calibration and are susceptible\
    \ to \nsoil heterogeneity; therefore, they perform better in very homogeneous\
    \ media like sand or media like \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n   \n \n \n2830\nrockwool. In general, dielectric sensors have a high repeatability\
    \ (good for irrigation, which re-wets \nthe soil), but the absolute accuracy is\
    \ not very high (due to calibration errors and soil heterogeneity). \nBased on\
    \ the results of our experiments conducted on horticultural crops over many years,\
    \ both \ntypes of RZS’ seem to perform well when appropriately integrated with\
    \ irrigation controllers. \nHowever, it is undeniable that, for such a field of\
    \ RZS application, accuracy is less important than \nrepeatability, low-maintenance\
    \ and easy use, and that dielectric sensors (including the dielectric \ntensiometer,\
    \ when available) are more grower-friendly than water filled tensiometer. \nUndoubtedly,\
    \ the development of a number of technologies, including those involving soil\
    \ moisture \nsensing and wireless data communication, has allowed the design and\
    \ marketing of innovative \nirrigation controllers that may play a pivotal role\
    \ in saving water and improving the economical and \nenvironmental sustainability\
    \ of intensive cropping systems. In the near future, the implementation of \n\
    wireless managing with information coming from GIS, interpretation of aerial photos\
    \ and satellite \nimages and topographic data will further improve the water management\
    \ at farm level. \nNonetheless, in many farms, also in countries with an advanced\
    \ agriculture like Italy and in high-\ntech production sectors such as greenhouse\
    \ and nursery industry, irrigation management still depends \non growers’ experience\
    \ for the assessment of crop water requirements and the time of irrigation. In\
    \ \ngeneral, the use of RZS for irrigation scheduling in commercial cultivations\
    \ is very sporadic in Italy \nand only very few examples exist in the sectors\
    \ of grapevine, fruit crop and processing tomato \ncultivation. In the area of\
    \ Pistoia, to our knowledge only a couple of greenhouse growers make use of \n\
    RZS to control (manually, in one case) the irrigation in soil-grown ornamental\
    \ crop. On the other hand, \nour recent and current research and demonstration\
    \ activities carried out in Tuscany significantly \nreduced the original scepticism\
    \ (especially, from the growers) on the application of RZS for efficient \nirrigation\
    \ management of container ornamental plants. As a matter of fact, many growers\
    \ are interested \nin such technology and are somewhat waiting for devices marketed\
    \ at more affordable costs \nTherefore, the main obstacles to the application\
    \ of RZS technology at farm level seem to be the \noverall costs of such technology\
    \ and the lack of effective policies for the dissemination and transfer of \n\
    smart water application technology to commercial operations, including grower\
    \ training. The progress \nin the field of electronics and computer science suggests\
    \ a further reduction of prices and a more and \nmore significant integration\
    \ of advanced technologies inside the intensive agricultural sector. \nMoreover,\
    \ ICT will assure a simplification of system functioning and an increase of the\
    \ system \nefficiency, but with a wider use of external resources. The increase\
    \ in the price of water as such and in \nthe severity of environmental legislation\
    \ concerning the exploitation and protection of water resources \nalso will contribute\
    \ to the adoption of smart water application technology. \n \nAcknowledgements\

    2380. PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Fertilized home lawns represent a potential source
    of NO3-N contamination to groundwater and surface waters. The waterborne losses
    of inorganic N from Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) turf subjected to three
    levels of N fertilization (0, 97, and 244 kg N ha−1 yr−1 as urea and methylene
    urea) and two irrigation regimes (scheduled by tensiometer and overwatering with
    3.75 cm of water per week in addition to rainfall) were measured. The site was
    located on a Merrimac sandy loam (sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Dystrochrept). Soil-water
    percolate was collected by suction plate lysimeters placed below the root zone.
    Surface runoff was quantified with orifice flow splitters. Soilwater percolate
    flux comprised >93% of the total water and inorganic-N discharged from all treatments.
    Mean annual flow weighted concentrations of inorganic N in soil-water percolate
    were below the U.S. drinking water standard on all treatments and ranged from
    0.36 mg L−1 on the overwatered, unfertilized, control treatment to 4.02 mg L−1
    on the overwatered, high N treatment. Annual losses ranged from 32 kg ha−1 on
    the overwatered high N rate treatment to 2 kg ha−1 on the scheduled irrigation,
    unfertilized, control treatment. Overwatering in conjunction with fertilization
    generated significantly higher annual flow weighted concentrations and mass loss
    than the unfertilized controls. Nitrogen loss and concentrations from the scheduled
    irrigation treatments were not significantly different from the controls. Citing

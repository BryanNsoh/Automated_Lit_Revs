    concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and
    its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix

    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Footnotes Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies
    have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and
    the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago.
    Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart
    home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have
    also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by
    a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in
    a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content
    to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However,
    the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure
    to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such
    cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are
    widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on
    security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi
    layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses
    the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical
    environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios
    and highlights open research challenges and future directions. A Roadmap of Cybersecurity

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\
    Table 1. IoT architecture: Layers.\nLayers Proposed\nCharacteristics\n3\nPerception,\
    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\
    \ IoT protocols.\nLayer\nProtocols\nSession/Application\nMQTT, CoAP, AMQT, HTTP,\
    \ SOAP, ...\nNetwork\n6LowPAN, RPL, CORPL, IPSec, TCP/UDP, DTLS\nPerception/Things\n\
    WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, ZigBee, LoraWan, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE, ...\n\
    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\

    \ state)\n3.2. Integration: Architecture Development\nIn the previous phase objects\
    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\

    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\
    \ method Figure (Figure 7) shows agricultural subsystems and model\ndeployed on\
    \ distributed nodes.\nFigure 7. Greenhouse design. Fog and edge nodes relations\
    \ on agriculture subsystems.\nIntelligent irrigation control is installed in an\
    \ experimental greenhouse based on tomato\nhydroponic cultivation (Table 4). Following\

    \ Communication and Context\nIrrigation process, soil parameters, environmental\
    \ conditions inside and outside the greenhouse\nand energy consumption deﬁne objects\
    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\
    \ for\neach object/thing, where GH1 is the location ID of greenhouse.\nAll objects\
    \ are interoperable using MQTT protocol. Publisher and subscriber communication\n\
    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\
    \ embedded devices requirements are shown in Table 6.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ and Testing\nIn facilities already automated, edge nodes are interleaved between\
    \ the installed controllers\nand actual sensors and actuators. Some new sensors\
    \ are installed to complete services designed\n(energy meter). In current facilities\
    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\

    only by a time schedule. Now, it takes into account data sensors to decide if\

    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

    \ agricultural activities in the world, which has\nbeen increasing over time.\
    \ Choosing an optimal irrigation management plan depends on having\navailable\
    \ data in the monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers data from several\
    \ sources;\nhowever, the data are not guaranteed to be free of discrepant values\
    \ (i.e., outliers), which can\ndamage the precision of irrigation management.\
    \ Furthermore, data from different sources must ﬁt\ninto the same temporal window\
    \ required for irrigation management and the data preprocessing\nmust be dynamic\
    \ and automatic to beneﬁt users of the irrigation management plan.\nIn this\n\
    paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart irrigation,\
    \ such as data\nmonitoring, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization, storage, and\
    \ irrigation management enriched\nby the prediction of soil moisture. Outlier\
    \ removal techniques allow for more precise irrigation\nmanagement. For ﬁelds\
    \ without soil moisture sensors, the prediction model estimates the matric\npotential\
    \ using weather, crop, and irrigation information. We apply the predicted matric\
    \ potential\napproach to the Van Genutchen model to determine the moisture used\
    \ in an irrigation management\nscheme. We can save, on average, between 56.4%\
    \ and 90% of the irrigation water needed by applying\nthe Zscore, MZscore and\
    \ Chauvenet outlier removal techniques to the predicted data.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ smart agriculture; soil moisture prediction\n1. Introduction\nAgricultural activities\
    \ presently use 70% of the withdrawn freshwater in the world [1]. Therefore,\n\
    it is of fundamental importance that we apply irrigation management, especially\
    \ in semiarid regions\nwith a scarcity of rainfall. Irrigation management is a\
    \ part of precision agriculture, in which the correct\namount of water artiﬁcially\
    \ delivered to a ﬁeld to satisfy the crop needs and the real production of the\n\
    users is analyzed [2].\nThe irrigation must supply the crop water needs at different\
    \ developmental stages in a given\nlocal. Irrigation management is used to detect\
    \ when to irrigate, the amount of water needed, and the\nirrigation frequency,\
    \ based on the monitoring of crop evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions.\n\
    Crop evapotranspiration measures the water consumption by crops, according to\
    \ the developmental\nSensors 2020, 20, 190; doi:10.3390/s20010190\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n2 of 25\nstage of the crop and the weather conditions [3].\
    \ The soil moisture impacts the amount of irrigation\nwater given to the crop,\
    \ as irrigation management takes into account the level of water retention in\
    \ the\nsoil. Therefore, precision agriculture can reduce water consumption in\
    \ irrigation by considering the\ngroundwater available to the crop [2].\nThe choice\
    \ of the best irrigation management plan depends on the data available from the\n\
    monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers and processes data for irrigation\
    \ management\nfrom several sources using computer science and information technology\
    \ [4]. Users can provide\nthe features of different types of crop, soil, and irrigation\
    \ system, as well as the readings of analog\ntensiometers. Tensiometers are soil\
    \ sensors that detect the matric potential, which are used to estimate\nthe moisture\
    \ at different depths and monitoring points in a ﬁeld. Automatic weather stations\
    \ [5] can\nprovide public data through the Internet. Moreover, the ﬁeld may have\
    \ sensors and actuators which\ncan interact with each other as objects of the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) in order to provide services\ntransparently to the\
    \ users [6]. Such services are related to irrigation management for monitoring\n\
    (i.e., water, soil, and air) and prediction (weather and soil conditions).\nHowever,\
    \ data are not free of discrepant values (i.e., outliers), which can negatively\
    \ affect the\nprecision of irrigation management. Furthermore, data from different\
    \ sources must ﬁt into the\nsame temporal window required for the irrigation management\
    \ and the data preprocessing must be\ndynamic and automatic for researchers, engineers,\
    \ and owners or farmers to beneﬁt from the irrigation\nmanagement plan. Data fusion\
    \ is required to improve the quality of soil data in the case where several\n\
    sources provide the same type of data (e.g., moisture) from the ﬁeld [7]. Data\
    \ fusion also informs the\ndecision whether to start irrigation or not in irrigation\
    \ management that makes use of other types of\ndata (such as weather or crop data).\n\
    In this paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart\
    \ irrigation,\nsuch as data monitoring and control, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization,\
    \ storage, and irrigation\nmanagement enriched by the prediction of soil moisture.\
    \ The Smart&Green services are modular\ncomponents which facilitate the reuse\
    \ and customization of code, which are challenges/limitations to\napplying IoT\
    \ in the smart agriculture context [8]. Our framework allows users to set the\
    \ data sources:\nThe nearest weather station, the moisture sensors (analog or\
    \ digital), the type of crop, and the features\nof the irrigation system in the\
    \ monitored ﬁeld. Therefore, Smart&Green also contributes to the solution\nof\
    \ another challenge in applying IoT for the purpose of smart agriculture: The\
    \ integration of the actual\ninfrastructure of the users (i.e., devices, machines,\
    \ and software) [9].\nSmart&Green recommends the best irrigation management plan,\
    \ according to the conﬁguration\nof the monitored ﬁeld. The framework also synchronizes\
    \ weather and soil data, as well as the crop\nstage for the chosen irrigation\
    \ management plan. The Fusion service allows for the deﬁnition of outlier\nremoval\
    \ criteria for the weather and soil data. The fusion service also applies the\
    \ outlier removal\ntechniques Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD before data aggregation,\nin order to obtain general information about the\
    \ soil conditions of a ﬁeld. Our results show that it\nmakes irrigation management\
    \ more precise, therefore saving water.\nFor ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ the prediction module estimates the soil moisture to\nmake the amount of water\
    \ irrigated more precise. In this work, we propose a computational model to\n\
    predict the matric potential based on weather data available at public stations\
    \ [5], crop information,\nand the amount of irrigation water used. As another\
    \ contribution, we provide to the scientiﬁc\ncommunity a public data set containing\
    \ the matric potential and irrigation data for cashew cultivation\nin an experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. The matric potential is the critical variable in measuring the soil moisture.\n\
    The computational model reduces the cost of equipment and energy, as the model\
    \ allows farms\nto estimate the moisture without soil sensors for the same soil\
    \ type. We evaluate the performance\nof a set of popular machine learning techniques\
    \ which have been widely applied to solve regression\nproblems. We measure the\
    \ quality of the models without feature selection using the RMSE (Root Mean\n\
    Squared Error) and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as metrics. Our results show\
    \ that the combination\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n3 of 25\nof predicted data and\
    \ the outlier removal techniques can save an average between 56.4% and 90% of\n\
    irrigation water, estimated by water balance management.\nThe rest of the paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, a literary review of IoT platforms for\n\
    Smart Agriculture is presented. Section 3 describes the structure and services\
    \ of the Smart&Green\nframework. Section 4 relates the materials and method of\
    \ the implementation of Smart&Green,\nespecially for the soil moisture prediction\
    \ evaluation. The results are given in Section 5, and we\ndiscuss our contributions\
    \ in Section 6. Appendix A gives details about irrigation management using\nSmart&Green,\
    \ and we formalize the problem of soil moisture prediction in Appendix B.\n2.\
    \ Related Work\nWe carried out a systematic literature review to ﬁnd the works\
    \ which have answered the following\nresearch questions:\n1.\nWhat software exists\
    \ for agricultural management that automates the process of gathering,\npreprocessing,\
    \ fusing, and synchronizing the data used in irrigation management?\n2.\nDoes\
    \ the software implement the well-known irrigation management approaches of matric\n\
    potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3))?\n3.\nDoes the software\
    \ forecast the soil moisture?\n4.\nCan users conﬁgure the software using information\
    \ about their crops, irrigation system, soil\nsensors, and weather stations close\
    \ to the monitored ﬁeld?\nMost of the discovered papers have partially answered\
    \ the research questions above. To our best\nknowledge, there have been almost\
    \ no Internet of Things (IoT) platforms introduced that provide the\nservices\
    \ required for smart irrigation, such as the gathering, preprocessing, synchronization,\
    \ and fusion\nof data; the planning and execution of irrigation management; or\
    \ soil moisture prediction.\nSeveral studies have only addressed the gathering\
    \ and visualization of weather and soil data\n(Section 2.1). Some works focused\
    \ on data preprocessing by applying outlier detection algorithms\n(Section 2.2).\
    \ Some approaches used speciﬁc methods to decide when to irrigate, whereas others\
    \ have\nimplemented water balance and matric potential (Section 2.3). Soil moisture\
    \ prediction using machine\nlearning techniques applied to crop data, satellite\
    \ images, and irrigation management information\nhas been investigated (Section\
    \ 2.4). In addition, IoT platforms have been studied, which should be\nﬂexible\
    \ enough to allow users to conﬁgure them for different monitoring cases in smart\
    \ agriculture\n(Section 2.5).\n2.1. Data Gathering\nIn general, most of the sensor\
    \ nodes used to monitor soil data (such as temperature, humidity,\nand matric\
    \ potential) and weather data (such as temperature and relative humidity) are\
    \ operated\nusing open, low-cost hardware platforms such as the Arduino [10–14]\
    \ or Raspberry Pi [15–17].\nZigbee [11,17–19], LoRa [16], Wiﬁ [20], Bluetooth\
    \ [14], GSM [12], and GPRS [21] are the predominant\nwireless technologies used.\n\
    Our proposal allows users choose between the CoAP [22] and MQTT [23] protocols\
    \ for sending\ndata to Smart&Green framework storage and later irrigation management.\
    \ For devices that we can not\nturn into a sensor node, such as analog tensiometers,\
    \ our framework has a mobile application with\nwhich users can gather data manually.\
    \ The framework also allows users to choose, as a weather data\nsource, the Brazilian\
    \ automatic weather station nearest to the monitored ﬁeld, from which data can\
    \ be\ngathered via HTTP.\n2.2. Data Preprocessing\nOther approaches have processed\
    \ soil data to detect outliers [24,25] and treat data using noise\nﬁltering techniques\
    \ [26]. One system applied an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) to the soil moisture\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n4 of 25\ndata before the execution of irrigation management,\
    \ in order to avoid the actuators inappropriately\nstarting the irrigation [27].\n\
    The pattern recognition of water consumption by a crop radicular system, presented\
    \ in [28],\nis an outlier detection technique based on a time-series analysis\
    \ of soil moisture gathered at several\ndepths before, during, and after irrigation.\
    \ This technique allows for the identiﬁcation of sensors with\npoor operation,\
    \ which indicates the need for calibration or change.\nOur proposed framework\
    \ allows users to deﬁne criteria for outlier removal for each type of\nweather\
    \ and soil data used in irrigation management. Our framework also gives the option\
    \ to execute\nsuch algorithms as Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD (Extreme Studentized\nDeviation) to remove outliers and fuse soil moisture\
    \ data, in the case when a ﬁeld has several soil\nsensors monitoring at different\
    \ depths.\n2.3. Irrigation Management\nOther works have automatically started\
    \ irrigation by implementing algorithms for analyzing the\ndata gathered by a\
    \ wireless sensor node. In one study, an algorithm based on decision trees used\
    \ the\nsoil temperature and moisture to determine the irrigation time and the\
    \ needed amount of water [29].\nCrisp rules (IF-THEN) were used to compare threshold\
    \ values with the soil moisture gathered by\nsensors, in order to decide whether\
    \ to turn on the sprinklers of an irrigation system, in [30,31].\nDecision support\
    \ platforms for the execution of traditional irrigation management, such as\n\
    the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3)), have been\
    \ introduced.\nThese systems allow agronomists and farm owners to manage Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) components\nfor ﬁeld monitoring. The matric potential management\
    \ uses soil data gathered by sensor nodes and\nimages captured by unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles to correctly estimate the irrigation water need [32].\nWeb systems\
    \ have been used for the planning and execution of irrigation management. Beyond\
    \ the\nvisualization of soil moisture and weather data gathered by wireless sensor\
    \ nodes, these systems\nuse crisp rules for data analysis and, when it is necessary,\
    \ the systems send messages to their users\nin order to notify about irrigation\
    \ times [33] or activate the irrigation system automatically [34,35].\nIn other\
    \ approaches, the system takes the rainfall forecast (available on the Internet)\
    \ into account when\ndeciding whether to activate the irrigation system [36].\
    \ A wireless sensor network can also plan and\nexecute irrigation management [37].\
    \ In this case, the sensor nodes gather and analyze soil moisture\ndata and turn\
    \ the irrigation system on until the moisture achieves the ﬁeld capacity.\nA SCADA\
    \ (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system can automatically carry out\
    \ the data\ngathering, planning, and execution of the water balance management\
    \ (see Equations (A3) and (A4)).\nThe soil sensor nodes are also actuators, which\
    \ control the irrigation and send data continually to\na management system. The\
    \ system receives data from a weather station on the farm to estimate the\nreference\
    \ evapotranspiration ETo. The system also utilizes the curve of the crop coefﬁcient\
    \ kc, choosing\nits value according to the current developmental stage of the\
    \ crop [38].\nThe water balance and matric potential approaches often must take\
    \ data synchronization into\naccount. Therefore, some applications have synchronized\
    \ the data of previously registered crops,\nas well as soil and weather data,\
    \ to precisely determine the irrigation water need for the current\ndevelopmental\
    \ stage of the crop [39–42].\nThe existing systems described in this section are\
    \ not ﬂexible enough to allow users to set the\nfeatures of a monitored ﬁeld,\
    \ such as the type of crop, the type and number of soil sensors, and irrigation\n\
    system parameters used. The systems usually work with a predeﬁned conﬁguration\
    \ and infrastructure.\nTherefore, code reuse is impracticable for the irrigation\
    \ management of agricultural ﬁelds which do not\nﬁt to the existing system conﬁguration.\
    \ Our proposal allows users to register relevant information for\nirrigation management:\
    \ Different types of crops, soil features, irrigation systems, data sources (weather\n\
    or soil), and outlier removal criteria. In this work, the framework plans the\
    \ irrigation management\nusing the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)) approaches.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n5 of 25\nFurthermore,\
    \ none of the systems could forecast the moisture levels in ﬁelds without soil\
    \ sensors.\nOur proposal implements computational models to predict soil moisture\
    \ based on weather data, crop\ninformation, and irrigation water need (IWN) (see\
    \ Appendix B). In this work, we include the predicted\ndata in the water balance\
    \ management, obtaining between 56.4% and 90% of IWN savings over six\nmonths\
    \ (Section 5.3).\n2.4. Soil Moisture Prediction\nIn [43], the Linear Regression,\
    \ Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting with\nRegression Tree (GBRT)\
    \ machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to weather and soil sensor\ndata\
    \ (moisture and drought stress) to predict the best irrigation plan for a jojoba\
    \ crop. The GBRT\nmodel outperformed the others and, so, the decision support\
    \ service incorporated it as a module of\nthe system. A model based on support\
    \ vector regression (SVR) and k-means ML techniques which\nused weather data and\
    \ forecasts, as well the soil data (temperature and moisture), to forecast the\
    \ soil\nmoisture has also been investigated [44].\nIn [45], an integrated system\
    \ to monitor drought in northern China using satellite images (NOAA,\nMODIS, and\
    \ FY3A), weather stations, and soil data has been discussed. The drought forecasting\n\
    used the matric potential at the depth of the crop root, the water balance model,\
    \ depletion indices,\nand measurements of crop stress to estimate the soil moisture\
    \ and the water quantity needed for\nan extended period.\nIn this work, we apply\
    \ weather data, crop information, and the amount of irrigation water used\nin\
    \ a computational model, in order to estimate the daily matric potential of the\
    \ most superﬁcial soil\nlayer (Appendix B), which signals when the crop needs\
    \ irrigation [2]. We apply the predicted value in\nthe Van Genutchen model (Equation\
    \ (A1)) to obtain the soil moisture used in irrigation management\n(Equations\
    \ (A2) and (A3)) for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (i.e., Field 1 of Figure\
    \ A1).\nWe present two different approaches: Local and global prediction models.\
    \ In the local method,\nwe create a prediction model for each monitoring point\
    \ in an experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2). In the\nglobal approach, we create a\
    \ single model which can be generalized to any monitoring point. We have\nevaluated\
    \ the performance of a set of popular ML techniques which have been widely applied\n\
    to solve regression problems: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5\
    \ Model Trees and\nRules [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], RepTree, and\
    \ GBRT [51,52]. Our results show that\nGBRT outperforms the other evaluated techniques\
    \ in both approaches.\n2.5. IoT Platforms for Smart Agriculture\nSWAMP (Smart\
    \ Water Management Platform), introduced in [53], is one of the related methods\n\
    which is most similar to our proposal. SWAMP has components to allow for the implementation\
    \ of\ndifferent IoT applications for irrigation management, based on the crop\
    \ and soil moisture approaches.\nUsers can customize the services for the gathering\
    \ (MQTT or LoRa), processing, and synchronization\nof data with different types\
    \ of crops, weather, and country. Therefore, different ﬁeld conﬁgurations\ncan\
    \ reuse these services for data analysis and storage, highlighting the excellent\
    \ ﬂexibility of SWAMP.\nHowever, their techniques for the processing and the fusion\
    \ of data have not been detailed, and no\napplication or service for the prediction\
    \ of soil moisture has been provided.\nThe Agro-IoT framework, introduced in [54],\
    \ is also related to our proposal, which provides\nusers real-time data gathering,\
    \ aggregation (fusion), and analysis in the context of smart farming.\nAgro-IoT\
    \ reuses several components to implement IoT applications, according to the needs\
    \ of the\nmonitored ﬁeld. Agro-IoT provides similar services to our proposed method;\
    \ that is, it also provides\nthe management of devices (i.e., registration of\
    \ sensors and actuators) and event detection through\ndata analysis. However,\
    \ it does not contain modules for data synchronization and outlier removal or\n\
    soil moisture prediction.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n6 of 25\n3. Proposal\nIn this\
    \ paper, we propose Smart&Green: An Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the\
    \ smart\nagriculture domain. A framework consists of “a speciﬁc implementation\
    \ of a skeleton of infrastructure used\nfor the conception of a work” [55]. Work\
    \ is any activity performed by users or software. In this proposal,\nthe work\
    \ consists of the planning of irrigation management (Appendix A). In ﬁelds where\
    \ there are\nno soil moisture sensors, a computational model can estimate the\
    \ soil moisture for the same soil type\nusing weather, crop, and irrigation data.\
    \ Agronomists, researchers, and farmers conduct irrigation\nmanagement through\
    \ software which uses Smart&Green. Figure 1 presents the conceptual architecture\n\
    of Smart&Green, divided into four layers: Application, Services, Communication,\
    \ and Physical.\nFigure 1. Conceptual architecture of the Smart&Green IoT Framework\
    \ for Smart Agriculture.\nIn software engineering, a framework can also be “a\
    \ mini architecture that can be reused and that\nprovides behavior and a generic\
    \ structure for a family of software abstractions in a context that speciﬁes the\n\
    collaboration and use of them into a given domain” [56]. Therefore, given the\
    \ smart agriculture domain and\nthe context of smart irrigation, the Smart&Green\
    \ framework speciﬁes the structure of a set of concrete\nand abstract classes\
    \ to implement modules for the gathering, storage, synchronization, and fusion\
    \ of\ndata, as well as mathematical models (Appendix A) which describe irrigation\
    \ management. Irrigation\nmanagement determines the behaviors of the classes and\
    \ modules. As a mini architecture, the proposed\nframework can be reused with\
    \ different smart agriculture software with the generic functionalities of\nirrigation\
    \ management.\n3.1. Application Layer\nThe application layer provides facilities\
    \ for the automatization of irrigation management\n(Appendix A) and soil moisture\
    \ prediction. Through this layer, users of an agriculture management\nsystem can\
    \ insert information about the farm infrastructure: The types of crops and irrigation\
    \ system\nto each monitored ﬁeld, the monitored soil layers, and the weather stations\
    \ closest to the farm.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n7 of 25\n3.1.1. Irrigation Management\
    \ Automatization\nThe Matric Potential and Water Balance modules implement well-known\
    \ irrigation management\nmethods (Appendix A). These modules use information registered\
    \ by users as well as that from\nweather and soil data sources. Smart&Green selects\
    \ the best irrigation management based on the data\navailable. The principal functions\
    \ of the Register Module are as follows:\n1.\nUser register: Smart&Green framework\
    \ allows two types of users: Specialist and regular. Specialist\nusers can provide\
    \ agronomic information, such as different types of crops, soil, and irrigation\n\
    system features. They can also register outlier removal criteria for weather and\
    \ soil data and\nchoose algorithms for the fusion service. Regular users can register\
    \ farms and ﬁelds.\n2.\nFarm Register: Users provide information about the farm,\
    \ such as address and geographical\nco-ordinates (i.e., latitude and altitude)\
    \ for the Smart&Green framework, and select the weather\nstation closest to the\
    \ farm.\n3.\nCrop register: A specialist user can create types of crops using\
    \ information such as a description,\nthe curve of the crop coefﬁcient, and the\
    \ critical moisture condition.\n4.\nSystem Irrigation Register: A specialist user\
    \ inserts the type of irrigation systems, such as\n“micro-sprinkler”.\n5.\nWeather\
    \ Station Register: Smart&Green automatically selects the weather station closest\
    \ to the farm\nusing the geographical co-ordinates. Users can conﬁrm this or choose\
    \ another one.\n6.\nSoil Sensor Register: The user can insert the types of soil\
    \ sensors used. Smart&Green already has\nanalog and digital tensiometers.\n7.\n\
    Field Register: Users set the ﬁeld conﬁguration features (Figure A1), such as\
    \ the type of crop,\nirrigation system, soil, and if there are soil monitoring\
    \ points. The developmental stage of the crop\nrepresents the number of days since\
    \ the initial cultivation. Effective precipitation (mm/h) and\nefﬁciency of the\
    \ irrigation system are necessary for irrigation management, in order to compute\n\
    the irrigation time. In the case of monitoring points, users can register the\
    \ type of soil moisture\nsensor (analog or digital) and the depth z monitored\
    \ for each monitoring point in the ﬁeld.\n8.\nField Communication register: In\
    \ the case where the monitored ﬁelds have sensor nodes that\nautomatically gather\
    \ soil data, users can deﬁne the type of communication to send the data to the\n\
    framework. Users set the IP address and speciﬁc conﬁguration (CoAP or MQTT).\n\
    9.\nOutlier Removal Criteria Register: Specialist users can create a threshold\
    \ for minimum and\nmaximum values of each type of weather and soil moisture data\
    \ used in irrigation management.\nThe Smart&Green framework suggests an irrigation\
    \ management plan, according to the data of\na registered ﬁeld. For ﬁelds without\
    \ soil moisture sensors (Field 1 of Figure A1), Smart&Green indicates\nthe water\
    \ balance without soil moisture data (i.e., without the term ∆A in Equation (A3))\
    \ or the water\nbalance with the soil moisture data created by the soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 3.1.2).\nFor ﬁelds with soil moisture sensors (see\
    \ Fields 2 and 3 of Figure A1), the framework calculates the\nmatric potential\
    \ (Equation (A2)) or water balance using the soil moisture data.\n3.1.2. Soil\
    \ Moisture Prediction\nIn this work, we address a large ﬁeld (over 7500 m2) to\
    \ produce one type of crop on a large scale,\nin which the soil is monitored by\
    \ a hundred tensiometers (i.e., soil moisture sensors) at three different\ndepths.\
    \ To investigate this scenario, we present the local and global approaches, which\
    \ can be used to\nlearn a prediction function ˆf (Appendix B).\nThe local approach\
    \ creates a different prediction function ˆfi for each tensiometer at the superﬁcial\n\
    soil layer of the ﬁeld. For this, it uses the observations recorded by a tensiometer\
    \ bi and a weather\nstation ms, as well the water amount wi given to the crop\
    \ and the crop coefﬁcient kc related to the\ncurrent life stage of the crop. The\
    \ local approach deﬁnes the prediction ˆf in terms of n different\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 190\n8 of 25\nfunctions ˆfi for local predictions. However, if a ﬁeld has\
    \ a large number of tensiometers, a large\nnumber of distinctive prediction models\
    \ must be trained.\nThe global approach creates only one prediction function ˆfi\
    \ using the information from all\ntensiometers. Therefore, the global prediction\
    \ model might not ﬁt some individual tensiometers.\nThe Smart&Green framework\
    \ implements the prediction model as a modular service (Figure 2)\nto complement\
    \ the irrigation management of ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (e.g., ﬁeld\
    \ 1 in\nFigure A1). The framework automatically retrieves and stores the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms\npublished on the Internet by weather stations. We deﬁned Mms in\
    \ Appendix B.\nFigure 2. Smart&Green Module for soil moisture prediction.\nThe\
    \ framework daily preprocesses the Mms data to remove possible outliers. The module\
    \ of soil\nmoisture prediction estimates the matric potential ψp of a ﬁeld, based\
    \ on (M′\nms, W, kc) (Appendix B).\nThe irrigation management module computes\
    \ the current soil moisture θc by applying ψp on the Van\nGenutchen [57] model,\
    \ following Equation (A1). Then, the obtained θc is applied to Equation (A2)\n\
    or (A3) to calculate the irrigation water need (IWN).\nIn the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) context, the framework sends the IWN value to an actuator to\nstart the\
    \ irrigation system. The irrigation system stops when the ﬁeld receives the amount\
    \ of water\nspeciﬁed by the IWN. Although this present work does not handle an\
    \ automatic irrigation system,\nthis issue is a concern for the full implementation\
    \ of an IoT system for smart farms.\n3.2. Service Layer\nThe Service layer supports\
    \ the Application layer by storing data provided by Smart&Green users\nand synchronizing\
    \ crop, weather station, and soil data when required by any irrigation management\n\
    module. The Service layer also carries out fusion tasks for data of soil moisture\
    \ sensors (e.g., ﬁelds 2\nand 3 of Figure A1) or the soil moisture prediction.\n\
    The Storage service provides centralized data persistence for the monitoring of\
    \ weather, crop,\nand soil data in the ﬁelds. The Synchronization service selects\
    \ the crop coefﬁcient kc which is\nappropriate to the current development stage\
    \ of the crop and retrieves the weather data Mms for\nthe period needed for irrigation\
    \ management. The service also requests the Communication layer for\nnew data\
    \ from the Internet, if needed.\nIn the case of soil data, the Synchronization\
    \ service selects data from all monitoring points\nBTc in the ﬁeld, taking into\
    \ account the period of irrigation management. If there are no data\navailable,\
    \ the service requests new data from the user (ﬁeld 2 of Figure A1) or the Communication\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n9 of 25\nlayer (Field 3 of Figure A1). Finally, the Synchronization\
    \ service makes the data set composed of\n{kc,current, Mms,period, BTc,period}\
    \ available.\nThe Irrigation Management Modules use the Fusion service if there\
    \ is a ﬁeld with monitoring\npoints, each with one or more soil moisture sensors\
    \ (e.g., tensiometers) at different depths z (e.g.,\nﬁelds 2 and 3 of Figure A1).\
    \ The Fusion service can also treat data created in soil moisture prediction\n\
    when irrigation management is required for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors.\
    \ Data fusion consists\nof processing the data to detect and remove outliers (DRO)\
    \ and submitting data to a co-operative\nfunction (CF), according to a multilevel\
    \ data fusion architecture [58].\nDRO tasks apply criteria and algorithms deﬁned\
    \ by specialist users to immediately detect and\nremove outliers. The Register\
    \ module of the Application layer allows for the creation of threshold\nvalues\
    \ for soil data. DRO algorithms are speciﬁc to the soil layer monitored. According\
    \ to [58],\nthe Z-score is more efﬁcient for data series at the most superﬁcial\
    \ soil layer (e.g., z = 15 cm). In contrast,\nthe Generalized ESD (Extreme Studentized\
    \ Deviate) algorithm works well with data at depth of\nz = 45 cm. The Smart&Green\
    \ framework has implementations of the Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed\nZ-Score, and\
    \ Generalized ESD algorithms.\nA co-operative function (CF) [59] aggregates one\
    \ type of data gathered at different monitoring\npoints of a ﬁeld. Smart&Green\
    \ uses the mean function as the CF to aggregate soil moisture data at the\nsame\
    \ depth. For example, Field 2 of Figure A1 has six monitoring points at two depths.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe framework calculates the mean of each set of six samples gathered\
    \ at a given depth z. After fusion,\nthe data are ready for irrigation management\
    \ at the Application layer, which decides whether irrigation\nshould be started.\n\
    3.3. Communication Layer\nThe Communication Layer has a set of software to gather\
    \ weather and soil data through network\nprotocols. This includes a weather client,\
    \ four soil clients, three soil servers, and a gateway (see\nFigure 3). The weather\
    \ client consists of an HTTP client which downloads weather station data from\n\
    the Internet and stores them. Smart&Green offers an API to gather data from Brazilian\
    \ automatic\nweather stations [5].\nFigure 3. Interaction between the Communication\
    \ Layer and the Physical and Services Layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n10 of 25\n\
    The soil client gathers the matric potential data ψm if the ﬁeld has tensiometers\
    \ installed. If the\ntensiometers are analog, users have to manually collect the\
    \ ψm data, using a mobile application that\nsends it to the framework via HTTP.\
    \ If the tensiometers are digital, they are integrated into sensor\nnodes that\
    \ send the data to a gateway near the ﬁeld. The gateway hosts CoAP and MQTT clients,\n\
    which forward the ψm data to the servers of the framework.\n4. Materials and Method\n\
    In this section, we list the principal software components used in the implementation\
    \ of our\nproposed framework (Section 4.1). We describe what we use for soil moisture\
    \ prediction, in terms of\n(1) the weather, crop, and soil moisture information;\
    \ (2) the criteria for outlier detection and removal;\nand (3) the tested machine\
    \ learning techniques (see Section 4.2).\n4.1. Smart & Green Framework Implementation\n\
    We implemented the Smart&Green framework using the Python 3 Language. In the Application\n\
    layer (Section 3.1), irrigation management by the water balance module uses PyETo\
    \ [60] to calculate the\nreference evapotranspiration for a crop, with reference\
    \ to the Penman-Monteith Model [61]. The crop\nevapotranspiration measures the\
    \ water consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage\nof the crop\
    \ and weather conditions [3]. The Service Layer uses the MySQL database [62] to\
    \ support the\nStorage service. The PyAstronomy library [63] provides the implementation\
    \ of the Generalized ESD\n(Extreme Studentized Deviate) algorithm for the Fusion\
    \ Service.\nThe aiocoap package [64] supports the implementation of the CoAP client\
    \ and server of the\nCommunication layer (Section 3.3). The MQTT client uses the\
    \ Eclipse Paho MQTT client library [65],\nand we used Mosquito as the MQTT server\
    \ [66]. Our API for the acquisition of weather data operates\nby scraping the\
    \ web page of the automatic Brazilian weather stations [5] using the libraries\
    \ requests [67]\nand beautifulsoup4 [68], as well the frameworks Django [69] and\
    \ Django rest [70]. We implemented\nthe mobile application for soil moisture gathering\
    \ from ﬁelds with analog tensiometers (e.g., ﬁeld 2 of\nFigure A1) in the Javascript\
    \ language through the Firebase platform [71], React Native framework [72],\n\
    Realm [73], and React Native Firebase [74] libraries.\nWe also provide a web interface\
    \ for the\nSmart&Green Framework developed using Django [69]. Smart&Green was\
    \ run on a machine with\n2 GB of RAM, 20 GB of hard disk storage, and the Ubuntu\
    \ 18.04LTS OS.\nFor farm ﬁelds with sensor nodes, such as ﬁeld 3 of Figure A1,\
    \ we used an Arduino Pro Mini and\nthree Irrometer Watermark 200SS [75] digital\
    \ tensiometers to implement a sensor node which gathers\nsoil moisture data at\
    \ 15, 45, and 75 cm. The watermark measures the soil water tension (i.e., matric\n\
    potential), which ranges from 0 to 200 CBar/KPa. The sensor nodes use four AA\
    \ alkaline batteries of\n1.5 v as the power source. We modify the Arduino removing\
    \ the voltage controller and LEDs to the\nnode has a longer operating life. Sensor\
    \ nodes send soil data through an nRF24L01 with an external\nanthem and power\
    \ ampliﬁer. The nRF24L01 is a single-chip radio transceiver for the 2.4–2.5 GHz\
    \ ISM\nband. After data transmission, the sensor node hibernates for an hour to\
    \ save power [58]. We used\na Raspberry Pi 3 with the Raspbian OS as the gateway\
    \ to receive soil moisture data and send them by\nthe CoAP or MQTT client to storage.\n\
    4.2. Soil Moisture Prediction\n4.2.1. Raw Data Set\nWe obtained a data set of\
    \ soil moisture from an experimental cashew ﬁeld with other tropical\nraw materials\
    \ in the city of Paraibapa, Brazil [76]. The ﬁeld had approximately 250 cashew\
    \ trees with\nnine monitoring spots. Each spot had three tensiometers that allowed\
    \ manual reading of the matric\npotential at depths of 15, 45, and 75 cm. Figure\
    \ 4 shows the details of the analog tensiometers (soil\nmoisture sensors), which\
    \ provided the data set from 2016, 2017, and 2018, with 234, 245, and 138 daily\n\
    samples, respectively. It is worth mentioning that, in 2016, the ﬁeld had salvation\
    \ irrigation in which\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n11 of 25\nwe gave 5 liters of water\
    \ for each bud whenever the installed tensiometer at a depth of 15 cm read\na\
    \ matric potential of 60 kPa. Salvation irrigation prevents plants from dying.\n\
    (a) Tensiometers at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths near a\ncashew bud.\n(b) Cashew buds.\n\
    Figure 4. Details of the Experimental Field.\nThe meteorological data set was\
    \ obtained from a Brazilian national weather station at Itapipoca\ncity, Ceara\
    \ (altitude 102 m; latitude 03◦29′ S; longitude 39◦35′ W). However, we decide\
    \ to use the\npluviometer sensor data of the ﬁeld, as the rainfall sensor of the\
    \ weather station had missing values\nover an extended period. Table 1 presents\
    \ the acronyms, the description of the variables, and the\nmeasurement data units\
    \ used in our prediction problem. We release the aggregated data set to the\n\
    scientiﬁc community to ensure the reproducibility of our results and promote research\
    \ developments\nin this ﬁeld (see Supplementary Materials).\nTable 1. Raw dataset\

    We also analyzed the soil particle composition of the experimental ﬁeld. The soil\
    \ has a medium\nsandy texture in the layer from 0 to 30 cm (805 g kg−1 of sand,\
    \ 76 g kg−1 of clay and 119 g kg−1 of silt)\nand the medium texture in the other\
    \ layers, presenting the characteristics of a red-yellow Argisol [77].\nThe maximum\
    \ organic matter content was 6.4 g dm−3; the pH varied from 5.6 to 6.3 between\
    \ the\nlayers; the capacity of cations exchange, from 31.3 to 64.8, and the sum\
    \ of maximum bases was 62% in\nthe most superﬁcial layer.\n4.2.2. Outlier Detection\
    \ and Removal\nFirst, the instances that presented Tmax, Tmin < 20, Tmax, Tmin\
    \ > 39, RHmax, RHmin < 20, and Ri >\n250 were removed, as these feature ranges\
    \ are uncommon in the city of Paraibapa. After that, the mean\nµ and the standard\
    \ deviation σ were computed for the variables P, Rn, and U2 for each month.\n\
    Afterward, we ﬁltered out data instances with anomalies; that is, the instances\
    \ with distance to µ\ngreater or equal than 3 × σ were removed, as performed in\
    \ [78].\n4.2.3. Machine Learning Methods\nWe decided to build the prediction model\
    \ using algorithms which have been widely applied to\nsolve regression problems:\
    \ Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5 Model Trees and Rules\n(M5P)\
    \ [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], and RepTree. Weka [79] provided all\
    \ of these.\nAnother widely used algorithm is the Gradient Boosting Regression\
    \ Tree (GBRT) [51,52] method and\nits implementation XGBoost [80].\nLinear regression\
    \ is a linear model of the relationship between a scalar response (in this work,\n\
    the matric potential ψm) and one or more explanatory variables (see Table 1).\
    \ The linear model consists\nof linear predictor functions which use the data\
    \ to estimate the unknown parameters [46]. Decision\nstump models a one-level\
    \ decision tree. The tree has one root (an internal node) which connects the\n\
    leaves (terminal nodes). The model uses the value of one single feature to make\
    \ predictions [47].\nM5P produces a tree with a multilinear regression model for\
    \ each node. A greedy algorithm\nremoves the insigniﬁcant features in the model\
    \ ﬁtted to each node. Then, the terminal node computes\nnew predicted values,\
    \ considering the predicted values of other intermediate nodes between the\nterminal\
    \ node and the root node [48,49].\nRandom Tree (RT) uses if-then conditions for\
    \ answering questions in a sequential order to achieve\na speciﬁc result. The\
    \ depth of the tree consists of the number of questions needed to reach a prediction\n\
    value. Random Forest (RF) is a collection of decision trees that can use a random\
    \ subset of the features.\nTherefore, the number of trees impacts the number of\
    \ features used and limits the number of errors\ndue to bias or variance [50].\n\
    RepTree is a fast decision tree algorithm in Weka which uses information gain/variance\
    \ to build\na regression tree. Reduced-error pruning takes into account the method\
    \ backﬁtting [79]. GBRT is a\npredictive model based on a weak learner, a loss\
    \ function, and an additive model. The weak learner is\na decision tree that can\
    \ be modiﬁed to achieve better results. The additive model adds weak learners\n\
    to correct for the residual errors of all previous trees. The loss function consists\
    \ of the mean squared\nerror for regression problems [51,52].\nWe set some hyperparameters\
    \ required by RT, RF, RepTree, and GBRT with the default values\nof Weka [79]\
    \ and XGboost [80]. We set the maximum tree depth (max_depth) to 3 for GBRT and\
    \ to\nwithout restriction for the RT, RF, and RepTree methods. The number of trees\
    \ (n_estimators) was\n100 for all methods. Finally, GBRT required a third hyperparameter,\
    \ the learning rate (learning_rate),\nwhich we set to 0.1.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 190\n13 of 25\nThe training and test sets included, respectively, 80% and 20%\
    \ of the data from each soil moisture\nsensor at a depth of 15 cm. Overall, for\
    \ each possible combination, we generated a model and\npicked the model which\
    \ gave the lowest MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square\nError)—metrics\
    \ which have been widely used to measure the quality of a prediction model (see\n\
    Equations (A6) and (A7) in Appendix B).\n5. Results\nFirst, we employed the outlier\
    \ removal techniques of Fusion Service (Section 3.2) on the real\nsoil moisture\
    \ data in order to analyze the inﬂuence of these techniques on irrigation management\n\
    (Section 3.1.1) in the Smart&Green framework (Section 5.1). Then, we analyzed\
    \ the MAE and RMSE of\nthe machine learning techniques tested with the local and\
    \ global approaches (Section 3.1.2) proposed\nfor the Smart&Green soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 5.2). Finally, we applied the soil moisture\ndata\
    \ created by the best prediction models for irrigation management to analyze the\
    \ water savings\n(Section 5.3).\n5.1. Impact of Outlier Removal Techniques on\
    \ Real Moisture Data by Irrigation Management\nFrom the raw data set (Section\
    \ 4.2), we selected data from from April to October/2017, since\nthere was no\
    \ salvation irrigation in the experimental ﬁeld, which could affect the irrigation\
    \ water need\n(IWN) estimated by water balance and matric potential management.\
    \ Then, we set Fusion Service\n(Section 3.2) to use an outlier removal technique\
    \ to process the matric potential ψc provided by the nine\ntensiometers (soil\
    \ moisture sensors) at 15 cm of depth in the experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2).\
    \ Second,\nthe Fusion Service aggregated ψc data using the co-operative function\
    \ mean. After this, the modules\nof water balance and potential matric (Section\
    \ 3.1) applied the aggregated ψc to Van Genutchen\nModel (Equation (A1)) to estimate\
    \ the current soil moisture θc at the crop root zone (z = 30 cm) and\ncompute\
    \ IWN.\nWater balance management (Equation (A3)) can depend only on the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ ETc\n(Equation (A4)) and rainfall R to estimate the IWN of a crop. Therefore,\
    \ we can only use weather data\nand the crop coefﬁcient (Table 1) to plan water\
    \ balance for n days. However, the IWN estimation is\nmore precise when we can\
    \ incorporate the current soil moisture data θcz since the water storage in\n\
    the crop root zone can contribute to the crop water supply. We set water balance\
    \ to estimates IWN\nevery three days (n = 3) over six months (26 samples of n\
    \ intervals), and the results in Table 3 indicate\nthat the use of θcz saved an\
    \ average of 90.4% of the IWN estimated, as compared to that using only\nweather\
    \ and crop data.\nTable 3.\nPercentage of water saved over six months by irrigation\

    \ crop development, since these outlier removal techniques decreased\nthis result\
    \ to 89.3%. Zscore and MZscore data treatment led to an increment of the moisture\
    \ θc values\n(Figure 5a), and, consequently, a reduction of the term ∆A of water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)). GESD and\nChauvenet did not affect the moisture θc\
    \ data enough (Figure 5b), as well as IWN saving (Table 3).\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ Moisture Data used in Water Balance—the points outside of the dashed lines are\
    \ the\ncurrent moisture data θcz modiﬁed by an outlier removal technique.\nThe\
    \ matric potential approach depends exclusively on the soil moisture data (Equation\
    \ (A2)),\nand we planned this irrigation management to estimate the daily IWN\
    \ over six months (121 samples of\ndays) using the current moisture θc data at\
    \ the shallowest crop root zone (e.g., z = 30 cm). In the matric\npotential approach,\
    \ irrigation occurs only when θc is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition\n\
    θcr, which is the ideal moisture for irrigation and signals when the crop productivity\
    \ is starting to\ndecline. Table 3 presents the IWN saving of matric potential\
    \ management that used an outlier removal\ntechnique when compared to the one\
    \ that did not use them. Figure 6 shows that there were several\ndays where θc\
    \ was equal to θcr (day 1 to 13). However, all outlier remotion techniques treated\
    \ various\noutliers that reduced the current moisture (e.g., 14th and 15th; 18th\
    \ and 19th; 26th days), improving\nthe water savings, on average, by 4.3% to 20.7%\
    \ (Table 3). Zscore and MZscore (Figure 6a) contributed\nmore to the tradeoff\
    \ between IWN saving and healthy crop development because they increased the\n\
    current moisture θc above the critical condition θcr in more days(e.g., the 40th\
    \ to 43th; 64th; 104th days)\nthan GESD and Chauvenet (Figure 6b).\n(a) Zscore\

    \ Models for Soil Moisture Prediction\nThe main goal of this analysis is to evaluate\
    \ and establish the best machine learning (ML)\ntechnique among those tested for\
    \ each approach (local and global prediction models). In this context,\nwe considered\
    \ analog soil sensors (tensiometers) distributed throughout a large ﬁeld (Figure\
    \ 4).\nWe compared the following ML techniques: Linear Regression, Decision Stump,\
    \ M5P, Random Tree,\nRandom Forest, RepTree, and Gradient Boosting. Through the\
    \ metrics MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\nand RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), we evaluated\
    \ the local and global approaches for the estimation\nof the matric potential\
    \ ψm—the primary variable for soil moisture prediction (Appendix B). Finally,\n\
    we used the 99% conﬁdence intervals to determine the best-performing model.\n\
    Table 4 presents the MAE and RMSE retrieved by the local approach for each prediction\
    \ algorithm.\nThe results of the local approach are the mean of the MAE and RMSE\
    \ achieved by the nine models\nbuilt for each monitoring point of the experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. Considering all the analyzed errors, Gradient\nBoosting outperformed all\
    \ the other techniques, followed by Random Forest. Both approaches\npresented\
    \ acceptable errors, according to a specialist agronomic engineer.\nTable 4. Evaluation\

    \ approach for each algorithm. Again,\nthe Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved\
    \ the best results, compared to all other evaluated models.\nIt can be noticed\
    \ that the MAE and RSME of the Gradient Boosting model did not vary as much as\
    \ the\nother evaluated models; this means the global model generalizes well for\
    \ any data from any sensor in\nthe ﬁeld. The Local Gradient Boosting approach\
    \ outperformed the global one. However, even though\nthe global model error had\
    \ an average MAE error increase of 58.9% and average RMSE error increase\nof 45.7%,\
    \ the errors were still acceptable, according to the specialist agronomic engineer.\n\
    We also analyzed the relevance of the features of Table 1, in the context of the\
    \ local and global\napproaches. We employed Gradient Boosting as, according to\
    \ the results of this section, it has proved\nto be the best ML technique for\
    \ our purposes. XGboost [80] estimates the relevance of each feature by\ncounting\
    \ the number of times it is used in a split node of any decision tree in the Gradient\
    \ Boosting\nforest. Figure 7 presents the results. The more an attribute is used\
    \ in a decision tree, the higher its\nrelative importance is. The most-used variables\

    \ of Predicted Data of Soil Moisture\nWe used the local and global models based\
    \ on Gradient Boosting to predict the matric potential\nψm for a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors over six months. The local approach estimated daily ψp\n\
    at a depth of 15 cm, as the ﬁeld had nine monitoring points. Therefore, we could\
    \ apply the outlier\nremoval techniques to treat this data set of nine daily values.\
    \ The global approach estimated one daily\nvalue for the ψp at a depth of 15 cm\
    \ in the ﬁeld. In this case, there was no need for preprocessing the\ndata using\
    \ the outlier removal techniques. We use ψp to compute predicted soil moisture\
    \ data for the\ncrop root zone (z = 30 cm) through the Van Genutchen Model (Equation\
    \ (A1)).\nFor water balance (Equation (A3)), executed every three days (n = 3)\
    \ for six months (26 samples\nof n), we compared the beneﬁts of our computational\
    \ models by analyzing how much they saved,\nin terms of the irrigation water need\
    \ (IWN) estimated using only weather and crop data. Table 6 shows\nthat the use\
    \ of global approach data saved an average of 56.4% and that the local approach\
    \ without\ndata preprocessing saved 100% of the IWN on average.\nThe Zscore and\
    \ MZscore methods tended to treat outliers by removing values that decreased the\n\
    current moisture θc (Figure 8a). Therefore, they reduced the result of the local\
    \ predicted data by 90%\nand 75.6%, respectively, for water balance. The employment\
    \ of Chauvenet for the local approach data\nalso saved 90% of IWN on average since\
    \ it almost achieved the performance of Zscore (Figure 8b).\nThe use of GESD did\
    \ not affect the local approach predicted data (Figure 8b), such that it had almost\n\
    the same water savings as when no outlier removal technique was employed (Table\
    \ 6). We consider\nthe global approach and local approach using Zscore, MZscore\
    \ and Chauvenet techniques optimized\nthe tradeoff between IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development, and they did not outweigh the IWN\nsavings of water balance\
    \ that used real soil moisture θc (Table 3).\nTable 6. Percentage of water saved\

    For the matric potential (Equation (A2)) executed daily, irrigation occurs when\
    \ the current\nmoisture θc is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition\

    Smart Agriculture presently lacks an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for the\
    \ gathering,\npreprocessing, and storage of data used in irrigation management,\
    \ which also allows for the reuse of\ncode to different sets of crops, soil, irrigation\
    \ system, and weather data sources. In this paper, we have\nproposed the Smart&Green\
    \ IoT framework which executes an irrigation management plan using the\nwater\
    \ balance and potential matric approaches according to the crop, as well as irrigation\
    \ system\ninformation provided by users and the weather and soil moisture data\
    \ available close to the monitored\nﬁelds. Smart&Green can be used to preprocess\
    \ soil moisture data with outlier removal criteria and\ntechniques of Zscore,\
    \ MZscore, GESD, and Chauvenet to provide a more precise irrigation water need\n\
    (IWN) in irrigation management.\nFor large ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ we have considered the problem of predicting the\nsoil moisture by analyzing\
    \ the weather data, crop coefﬁcients, and amount of irrigation water. We have\n\
    formally introduced the problem of soil prediction and designed a methodology\
    \ which uses training\nmodels according to two different approaches: Local and\
    \ global. These approaches determine the\nimplementation of prediction models\
    \ based on supervised machine learning techniques.\nThe local approach trains\
    \ a model for each soil sensor in the ﬁeld, achieving high performance.\nHowever,\
    \ this approach can lead to a high cost of data management if there are a large\
    \ number of\nsensors, as it requires the training and maintainence of a large\
    \ number of distinctive prediction models.\nOn the other hand, the global approach\
    \ trains a single prediction model over the observations of all\nthe sensors.\
    \ Our results show that gradient boosting with regression trees (GBRT) outperformed\
    \ the\nother evaluated techniques in both approaches. The local approach had the\
    \ best results with gradient\nboost, although the results using the global prediction\
    \ model were also acceptable.\nFurthermore, we have designed a module to support\
    \ irrigation management with our prediction\nmodels, based on GBRT. We evaluated\
    \ irrigation management using the water balance and matric\npotential approaches\
    \ with real and predicted data of soil moisture, as well as the impact of preprocessing\n\
    data with outlier removal techniques. The real data was part of a data set collected\
    \ from an experimental\nfield for research in the city of Paraipaba, Brazil, in\

    The use of real soil moisture data from the data set in the water balance approach\
    \ saved as\nmuch as 90.4% of the IWN obtained for the water balance when using\
    \ only weather and crop data.\nZscore and MZscore applied to the real moisture\
    \ data saved 89.3% of IWN, optimizing the tradeoff\nbetween IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development. For the matric potential approach, Zscore and\nMZscore obtained\
    \ (on average) 20.7% and 14.1% of the IWN savings obtained by matric potential\n\
    without the use of any outlier removal technique. Considerating a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors,\nwe obtained a reduction between 56.4% and 90% of the\
    \ water balance IWN based on only weather\nand crop data, when we use our global\
    \ and local approaches to predict the soil moisture data. Zscore,\nMZscore, and\
    \ Chauvenet preprocess the predicted data to optimize the tradeoff without outweighing\n\
    the performance of water balance using real moisture data. We do not recommend\
    \ the use of predicted\ndata in the matric potential approach, as the computational\
    \ models (with errors) outperform mostly\nthe same approach using real data in\
    \ terms of water savings, according to our results.\nSupplementary Materials:\

    \ some examples of conﬁgurations composed of a crop, soil, weather,\nand an irrigation\
    \ system. The house is next to the entrance of the farm and has a connection to\n\
    the Internet. The house also hosts devices that connect sensor nodes in the ﬁeld\
    \ to the Internet.\nAutomatic weather stations make weather data available on\
    \ the Internet.\nIn this work, we address ﬁelds with one type of crop whose soil\
    \ has analog (Field 2) or digital\ntensiometers (Field 3) monitoring the moisture\
    \ at more than one depth z. Tensiometers installed\nat different points b of the\
    \ ﬁeld gather readings of the matric potential ψm. Mathematical models\nuse ψm\
    \ to measure the soil moisture θ as the level of water retention in the type of\
    \ soil. We use the\nVan Genuchten Model [57] to express θ as the volume of water\
    \ by the volume of soil (cm3/cm3),\nas Equation (A1) shows:\nθ(ψm) = θr +\nθs\
    \ − θr\n[1 + (α × |ψm|)n]1− 1\nn\n,\n(A1)\nwhere θr is the residual water content,\
    \ θs is the saturated water content, α is related to the inverse of\nthe air entry\
    \ suction, and n is a measure of the pore-size distribution in the soil (e.g.,\
    \ Table 2 has these\nVan Genutchen constants for the experimental ﬁeld soil).\n\
    The management of matric potential estimates the irrigation water need (IWN) for\
    \ a ﬁeld with\nsoil sensors (e.g., Field 3 of Figure A1) taking into account the\
    \ soil moisture at the monitored depths zi,\nas Equation (A2) shows:\nIWN = (θ\
    \ f c,z1 − θcr,z1) × z1 + (θ f c,z2 − θc,z2) × z2 + (θ f c,z3 − θc,z3) × z3\n\
    E f\n,\n(A2)\nwhere:\n•\nzi represent the thickness of soil along the proﬁle (monitored\
    \ depth);\n•\nθ f c represents the ﬁeld capacity at a depth z after the drainage\
    \ of water excess, which is a constant\nobtained by a laboratory soil analysis;\n\
    •\nθcr is the ideal moisture for irrigation, signaling when the crop productivity\
    \ starts to decline;\n•\nθc is the current soil moisture. In matric potential\
    \ management, we initialize the irrigation by\nθc,z1 ≤ θcr; and\n•\nE f is the\
    \ efﬁciency of the irrigation system used in the ﬁeld.\nWater balance management\
    \ computes the IWN for an interval of n days, comparing the inputs and\noutputs\
    \ of water in the soil by using the daily crop evapotranspiration ETc, the rainfall\
    \ R, and ∆A =\n(θ f c − θc)z which represents the soil moisture at the crop root\
    \ zone z through Equation (A3).\nIWN = ∑n\ni=1(ETc,i − Ri) − ∆A\nE f\n.\n(A3)\n\
    The value Ef is the efficiency of the irrigation system placed in the field. The\
    \ crop evapotranspiration\nETc represents the water consumption by a type of crop\
    \ at its current life development stage, which is\ngiven by:\nETc = ETo × kc.\n\
    (A4)\nThe Penman-Monteith model [61] estimates the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo using weather\ndata. Each type of crop, without hydrological restriction,\
    \ has a speciﬁc coefﬁcient curve in which the\ncrop coefﬁcient kc varies from\
    \ 0 to 1.5 with the number days since the planting of the crop.\nSensors 2020,\

    \ Problem of Soil Moisture Prediction\nLet B = {b1, . . . , bn} be the set of\
    \ tensiometers monitoring the soil moisture of a ﬁeld at n different\npoints.\
    \ A tensiometer bj gathers the sample (ψj,15, ψj,45, ψj,75), which consists of\
    \ the matric potential\nψ readings at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths, respectively,\
    \ at a point j. Let W = {w1, . . . , wn} be the set of\nwater amount given to\
    \ the crop at n different points by an irrigation system. Irrigation management\n\
    calculates W using the Equations (A2) and (A3), for example.\nThe weather data\
    \ are required, as the climatic conditions affect a crop’s need for soil water\
    \ and\nrainfall can increase the soil moisture. Therefore, we assume that there\
    \ is a weather station ms close to the\nfield which provides the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms = {Tmin, Tmax, RHmin, RHmax, Rn,U2, P, Ri}, where:\n•\nTmin and\
    \ Tmax are the minimum and maximum air temperature, respectively;\n•\nRHmin and\
    \ RHmax are the minimum and maximum relative humidity, respectively;\n•\nRn is\
    \ the net radiation;\n•\nU2 is the wind speed;\n•\nP is the atmospheric pressure;\
    \ and\n•\nRi is the rainfall.\nWithin a daily time interval, there are several\
    \ observations about the weather and ﬁeld. We denote\nby O the collection of observations,\
    \ which consists of (t, B, Mms, W, kc), recorded within a time t over\na day.\
    \ The irrigation scheduling methods presented in Appendix A decide to start precise\
    \ irrigation\nwhen the current moisture θc,z1 is low at the superﬁcial layer of\
    \ soil (z1 = 15 cm). Therefore, the matric\npotential ψi,15 is analyzed daily\
    \ to achieve θc,z1 using the Van Genutchen model (Equation (A1)). In this\nwork,\
    \ we wish to monitor the level of soil moisture without soil sensors (i.e., tensiometers).\n\
    Let y(i, Mms, wi, kc) be a function that, given the monitoring point i, the meteorological\
    \ variables\nMms, the irrigation water amount wi at the point i, and the crop\
    \ coefﬁcient kc returns ψi,15 (the matric\npotential at a depth of 15 cm). Then,\
    \ y(i, Mms, wi, kc) = ψi,15. We deﬁne the problem of soil moisture\nprediction\
    \ as the problem of ﬁnding an accurate function f for predicting y(i, Mms, wi,\
    \ kc), given all\nthe observations recorded in O.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n21 of\
    \ 25\nDeﬁnition A1. The problem of soil moisture prediction requires ﬁnding a\
    \ predictive function ˆf over the class\nof all possible predictive functions\
    \ H, such that\nˆf = argmin∆( f ),\n(A5)\nwhere f ∈ H and ∆ is a loss function\
    \ assessing the quality of a candidate predictive function f over the\nobservations\
    \ in O. In this work, we use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute\
    \ Error\n(MAE) loss functions, deﬁned as:\n∆RMSE( f ) =\nv\nu\nu\nt 1\n|O′|\n\
    ∑\n(i,Mms,wi,kc)∈O′\n( f (i, Mms, wi, kc) − y(i, Mms, wi, kc))2, and\n(A6)\n∆MAE(\
    \ f ) =\n1\n|O′|\n∑\n(i,Mms,wi,kc)∈O′\n| f (i, Mms, wi, kc) − y(i, Mms, wi, kc)|,\n\
    (A7)\nwhere O’ is the set of observations used to assess the quality of the prediction\
    \ and f (i, Mms, wi, kc) is the estimate\nreturned by function f for y(i, Mms,\
    \ wi, kc). The smaller the value yielded by the above loss functions, the better\n\
    the predictive performance of f.\nWe employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to\
    \ address the problem of soil moisture prediction.\nMore speciﬁcally, we aim at\
    \ learning, from the observations in O, some function ˆf that minimizes the\n\
    error measured by ∆. We train the prediction models on a data set containing examples\
    \ built from\npast sensor observations (see Section 4.2). The ML techniques for\
    \ regression tasks used in this work\nare: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump\

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: The advancement
    of technologies over years has poised Internet of Things (IoT) to scoop out untapped
    information and communication technology opportunities. It is anticipated that
    IoT will handle the gigantic network of billions of devices to deliver plenty
    of smart services to the users. Undoubtedly, this will make our life more resourceful
    but at the cost of high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Consequently,
    there is a high demand for green communication to reduce energy consumption, which
    requires optimal resource availability and controlled power levels. In contrast
    to this, IoT devices are constrained in terms of resources-memory, power, and
    computation. Low power wide area (LPWA) technology is a response to the need for
    efficient utilization of power resource, as it evinces characteristics such as
    the capability to proffer low power connectivity to a huge number of devices spread
    over wide geographical areas at low cost. Various LPWA technologies, such as LoRa
    and SigFox, exist in the market, offering a proficient solution to the users.
    However, in order to abstain the need of new infrastructure (like base station)
    that is required for proprietary technologies, a new cellular-based licensed technology,
    narrowband IoT (NBIoT), is introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. This technology presents
    a good candidature to handle LPWA market because of its characteristics like enhanced
    indoor coverage, low power consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection
    support towards NBIoT. This survey presents a profound view of IoT and NBIoT,
    subsuming their technical features, resource allocation, and energy-efficiency
    techniques and applications. The challenges that hinder the NBIoT path to success
    are also identified and discussed. In this paper, two novel energy-efficient techniques
    “zonal thermal pattern analysis” and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring
    system have been proposed towards green IoT. Topic: Towards Service-Centric Internet

    I. Introduction 5G is on the purview where IoT will seize the stage spotlight,
    as IoT devices would form a notable segment of the 5G network. The radical evolution
    of the current Internet into a network of interconnected objects harvest information
    from the environment and interact with the physical world. The mammoth interest
    of connecting sensors, actuators, meters cars, appliances, and so on with internet,
    results in the Internet of Things [1], [2]. According to IEA-4E (Electronic device
    and network annex), the number of network connected devices will be 50 billion
    by 2020 [3]. Thus enterprises ushers into the modern era of automation to evidently
    change our daily lives by providing solution related to multiple sectors of health,
    agriculture, retail, vehicular, industry, power grid, underwater, buildings, homes,
    environment, transportation, smart home [4]. By 2024 itself, it is expected that
    the IoT industry will generate a revenue of USD4.3 billion [5] and it’s expected
    to grow over years. However, deployment of gigantic IoT ecosystem brings in various
    challenges to handle such as cost-efficient robust and flexible connectivity,
    interoperability of heterogeneous hardware, diverse security mechanism [6], and
    long battery life. However, the major deployment obstruction is due to constrained
    resources availability for IoT devices i.e. limited energy, limited computation,
    and limited processing capabilities [7]. Most importantly the flavor of IoT gets
    bitter, especially due to limited energy as this leads to unanticipated human
    intervention. Hence the burning issue of efficient utilization of energy is getting
    anomalous traction from academics and industry. In literature, various techniques
    have been proposed to tackle this critical issue such as energy harvesting, sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, etc. Ju and Zhang [8] suggested
    the technique of predictive analysis with energy harvesting to obsolete the battery
    from IoT device. Na et al. [9] suggested a technique to charge the device wirelessly
    using RF. Further, a power-aware connectivity using Spanning tree algorithm is
    suggested by Karthikeya et al. [10]. Shafiee et al. [11] designed a circuit to
    manage the power of the device where a source of energy is ambient. Another crucial
    challenge is to handle the diverse requirement of wide range of IoT applications.
    Today there are two evident classes of IoT applications: Critical IoT and Massive
    IoT. Critical IoT applications such as autonomous driving or remote surgery require
    very low latency with ultra-high reliability. Massive IoT (M-IoT) applications
    like smart building, logistics, tracking and fleet management, smart agriculture,
    etc. require low cost device with reduced complexity that consumes low power,
    wide coverage including uncovered areas and performance flexibility to handle
    multiple application with different latency and throughput requirement. According
    to current statics, low data rate (<100kbps) applications i.e. M-IoT, are expected
    to form 60% of IoT connections in 2020 in comparison to medium and high data rate
    applications [12]. Hence most of the traffic will originate from cost-effective
    low-bit-rate services that will serve the connected world. Since massive communication
    between various low power IoT devices is different from H2H (Human-to-Human) in
    terms of delay sensitivity and traffic pattern, thus could not be supported by
    cellular technologies adequately. As they are designed for the different category
    of terminal that operates at a high data rate and consumes high power their device
    complexity is also high and thereby their cost, though it will aid in deployment
    of IoT. Apart from this, technologies such as Wi-Fi, BLE, ZigBee, etc., offer
    short range communications though consume less power. However, if deployed repeatedly
    will increase the cost. Hence not a cost effective solution for applications with
    wide coverage range requirements like M-IoT. Thus a technology is required that
    could support massive connection at reduced cost with low power consumption &
    provide enhanced coverage [13]. LPWAN technologies are one that could support
    this emerging market as it allows low power device to communicate at low data
    rate over wide area with radius of several kilometers. LPWA proffers abilities
    like Indoor penetration: as it uses Sub-1GHz band, the signal propagates more
    reliably with less power consumption as compared to 2.4GHz signal. Low power consumption
    is achieved at a cost of low data rate and latency on the higher end in seconds
    or minutes. This ability is achieved by using Duty cycling, by using star topology
    (usually), by allowing devices to directly connect to BS (thereby bifurcating
    the need of gateway & relays also) or by reducing burden on the device side(by
    using Fog or edge Computing). Further for Low cost, CAPEX (capital expenditure)
    & OPEX (operational expenditure) is reduced by reducing the complexity of hardware,
    implanting less no of BS (LPWA BS) etc. Massive connections, QoS are two abilities
    where still improvement is required. Standard bodies like ETSI, 3GPP, IEEE, IETF
    are actively working on LPWA technologies. A range of applications such as precision
    monitoring, Smart City, Home Automation, Industrial Asset monitoring, Logistics,
    Wildlife Monitoring, Smart meter, is being catered by LPWA technologies. As the
    LPWA market is expected to rule the market in coming years, hence competition
    among LPWA technologies becoming severe. Recently to improve the foundation of
    IoT through cellular networks, and tussle with existing proprietary LPWA technologies
    (LoRa, SigFox, RPMA, etc.), 3GPP has introduced three technologies in Rel-13 namely
    eMTC (enhanced Machine Type Communication), NB-IoT, EC-GSM (enhanced coverage
    GSM). These cellular technologies will operate in licensed spectrum and will reuse
    the existing LTE infrastructure. Among available connecting technologies, NBIoT
    specifically tailored for emerging M-IoT market is one of the promising massive
    LPWA technology for data perception and acquisition for low data rate applications.
    NBIoT could handle massive connections with low power consumption and provide
    wide area coverage with deep indoor penetration and nomadic mobility [14]–[16].
    Most outstandingly it offers reliable service by using licensed bands and avoid
    congestion problems. NB-IoT reduced the hardware complexity by 90% compared in
    comparison of LTE Cat-1. Moreover, NBIoT can coexist with existing GSM and LTE
    network, hence reduce deployment cost also. Beside this new RAT (Radio Access
    Technology) reduced the signaling required for the transmission of data in the
    conventional system. Altogether NB-IoT can reduce the cost and energy consumption,
    which are the chief limitations of cellular network technology for IoT devices.
    The present communication contributes toward the Next generation Green-NBIoT and
    delivers a comprehensive enriched study of NBIoT. This extensive survey elaborates
    resource allocation and energy efficiency techniques. Along with this a detailed
    comparative analysis of IoT connecting technology with NBIoT is also presented.
    Further, two novel application specific energy efficient approaches are also proposed
    namely “Zonal Thermal pattern Analysis” (ZTPA) and “Energy Efficiency Adaptive
    Health Monitoring System” (E2AHMS). Along with this real time hardware implementation
    of Health application is given to support the proposed energy efficient approach.
    This paper would be beneficial for researchers to get an insight view of NBIoT
    and their respective challenges. A. Market Trends Toward NBIoT IoT market growth
    has accelerated across all verticals in Q1 2018. Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
    is seen as one of the enablers for IoT. IoT Analytics in their report quoted that
    LPWA connections will have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 81% during
    2018–2025 [17]. According to Machina in comparison of other LPWAN the share of
    NBIoT alone would be 48% by 2025 (Fig. 1) [18]. According to another statics,
    suggest by IHC the number of NBIoT connections by 2021 will be 141.7 million [19].
    Thereby NBIoT module revenue worldwide might touch the figure of USD 824 million
    by 2020 itself. Out of all NBIoT connections 88% of NBIoT connections will be
    established in Asia itself [20]. Some of the key NBIoT players are Huawei (China),
    Intel (U.S), Ericsson (Sweden), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Qualcomm (U.S), Vodafone
    (U.K). The growth of NB-IoT standard has increased pressure on proprietary technologies
    especially for LoRaWan and the fact of no of chips shipped in 2017: 2% of SigFox,
    4 % of LTE-M, LoRaWan 58%, LTE-Cat M1 4%, NBIoT 29%, Other 7% [18], are forestalling
    the market drift is building toward NBIoT. FIGURE 1. LPWA technology share by
    2025, machina, 2017 [18]. Show All B. Research Motivation As per literature survey
    and research availability in the area of IoT, a lot of work has been done to deliver
    services like smart health, smart agriculture, smart vehicle, etc. In the current
    scenario, IoT has become the first choice of industry, research and academia.
    However, there exist big gap similar to WSN i.e. energy optimization, energy efficient
    network which acts as a big stumbling block for IoT network. This becomes even
    more challenging as IoT devices have limited resource availability. This motivated
    us to study resource allocation techniques in detail. Furthermore, implementation
    of IoT on a massive scale would inflate carbon emissions in one way or the other.
    Hence to envision the green communication energy efficiency techniques will play
    an important role. Apart from this to cater the new specificities of IoT (i.e.
    low cost devices, wide coverage, long battery life, massive connection support)
    in cost effective way, NBIoT (3GPP standardized LPWA technology) presents good
    candidature. In this paper with an effort toward green IoT, two energy efficiency
    techniques using NBIoT are also proposed related to two specific area Health &
    Agriculture which directly or indirectly impact the human being. C. Contribution
    This review paper contributes toward next generation green communication and in
    support of that two novel energy efficient techniques namely “ZTPA” & “E2AHMS”.
    This review paper will be beneficial for researchers, who want to get a profound
    view of NBIoT. Whilst discussing the recent background of NBIoT, significant challenges
    and open issues related to the real time implementation of NBIoT are identified
    and discussed. In this manuscript, a detailed study related to resource allocation,
    and energy efficiency techniques for both IoT and NBIoT is done. Our main contributions
    can be summarized as follow: The Layered Architecture of IoT is presented to specify
    How IoT works. In addition to this a detailed comparative analysis of NBIoT with
    other low power IoT communication technologies is discussed. To provide an insight
    view of NB-IoT, its background research, architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels, connection process (cell acquisition, random access process, data transfer),
    modes of operation, power consumption using NBIoT, and its applications are discussed
    in detail. The paucity of the resource is not a new challenge for the communication
    network. However, it quite challenging for IoT being so massively interconnected.
    Thus a detailed analysis of resource allocation techniques is discussed related
    to IoT and NBIoT The open issues related NBIoT implementation are then conferred
    The real time implementation of IoT will inflate the CO2 levels in environment
    in different ways which can be controlled by many ways one of it is efficient
    utilization of energy resource. Therefore a literature survey of an energy efficient
    techniques used for IoT are deliberated and role of deep learning in the context
    of power consumption is also discussed. The open issues relate to NBIoT are then
    conferred. Thereafter, Green communication based energy efficient techniques are
    proposed for Smart Agriculture and Smart Health. In addition to this, hardware
    implementation is given to support the proposed energy efficient Smart Health
    technique. The list of ongoing IoT projects is presented to provide the researchers
    and readers the knowledge of current applications being developed. In addition
    to this, a list of simulation tools used is also presented in the appendix section.
    D. Organization This paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses
    the basic layered architecture of IoT and specifies the layer on which NBIoT operates.
    Hereafter comparison of NBIoT with other IoT connecting technologies is discussed
    in section III. Thereafter, NBIoT introduction, background research, standardization
    history from Rel-8 to Rel-15, subsequently architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels and signals used, connection process, modes of operation, power consumption
    using NBIoT, applications of NBIoT, are described in subsections IV-A, IV-B, IV-C,
    IV-D, IV-E, IV-F, IV-G, IV-H, IV-I respectively. Further section V provides a
    comprehensive survey of efficient resource allocation techniques used for NBIoT
    & IoT. Thereafter an overview of energy consumption in a sensor node during different
    phases is presented in section VI. Other than this, a detailed survey of energy
    efficiency techniques for green communication are discussed in detail in section
    VI-A and then the impact of usage of deep learning on power consumption is discussed
    in section-VI-B. Then the open issues related to NBIoT are discussed in section
    VII. Finally, the proposed green communication based energy efficient technique
    for agriculture is discussed in section VIII-A, and for health monitoring is discussed
    in VIII-B. In support of the proposed health technique a real time hardware implementation
    is described in section VIII-C subsuming system model (VIII-C-i), hardware requirement
    (VIII-C-ii), interface (VIII-C-iii), and performance analysis (VIII-C-iv). SECTION
    II. Internet of Things Communication and sensing ability has evolved gradually
    due to advancement in technology. The evolution of IoT (Fig. 2) started with RFID
    (radio frequency identification), which is the first technology to realize the
    machine to machine concept. RFID detects and ascertains the tagged entity wirelessly,
    by the data it transmits. Recently RFID is used in numerous IoT applications such
    as gestural detection [21], patient RFID tracking system [22], and smart restaurant.
    RFID could not sense the critical environment parameters, this stems in the requirement
    of sensing technologies. Hereafter, several technical fields including embedded
    computing, hardware miniaturization, Wireless networking aids in augmentation
    of real-world things capability, to sense, think, process and act, thus making
    things smart. Usually, these smart things have low computation capability thus
    clouds are used to offload the computational task which in turn reduce the energy
    consumption. Today the integration of. RFID, WSN, MCC (mobile cloud computing)
    and advancement in technology generated the umbrella term IoT. This concept is
    significantly revolutionizing the technical and business world, as it can offers
    anytime, anywhere, and anything service. The term IoT was first coined by Kevin
    Aston in 1999 also known as “cyber-physical systems (CPS)” [24]. In this paradigm,
    object/things around us are connected to the internet using Wireless technologies
    like Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc. Many definitions of IoT have been proposed in the
    literature. According to IERC, IoT is “A dynamic global infrastructure with self-configuring
    capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocol where
    physical and virtual things have identities, physical attributes, virtual personalities,
    and use intelligent interface and seamlessly integrated into information network”
    [25]. IoT network, comprised of billions of devices is highly heterogeneous. Its
    essence of heterogeneity can be visualized by the fact that devices from different
    vendors would run with diverse platforms even if they’re doing the same task as
    a result will generate radically different ontologies. Thus for IoT to speak a
    common language a unified standardized IoT architecture is required to ensure
    interoperability and security. Many architectural layouts have been proposed for
    IoT but no one has converged to a standardized architecture. Some of the well-known
    IoT architecture such as RAMI 4.0, IIRA, IoT- ARM, P2413, Arrowhead Framework,
    WSO2, Microsoft Azure, Internet-of-everything reference Model, Intel IoT Platform
    Reference Architecture are available. Among variously available architecture this
    paper presents a five-layer architecture (Fig. 3): comprised of Perception Layer,
    network layer, Service management Layer, Application Layer, Business layer [1].
    Perception Layer: This layer is composed of sensor/actuators. Here sensors are
    clustered according to their unique abilities such as body sensors, environmental
    sensors, vehicle parking sensors, home appliance sensors etc. Typically these
    sensors at the perception layer generate electronic signals triggered from physical
    event/condition aggregated at gateways using LAN/PAN technologies like Wi-Fi,
    Ethernet, UWB, ZigBee, BLE, Infrared, etc. FIGURE 2. Roadmap of IoT [2]. Show
    All FIGURE 3. Layered architecture of IoT [23]. Show All Network Layer: This layer
    is responsible to send the PL information to the Internet via one of the communication
    networks such as LAN (WIFI, Ethernet), WAN (3G, LTE, LTE-A, 5G) or satellite network.
    Service Management Layer (SML): On SML services are paired based on addresses
    and it also processes the data received. These services are OSS (Operational Support
    System) which include device modeling, Performance management, Data management
    (periodic/Aperiodic sensed data) etc. (e.g. Nokia OSS which help in generating
    new revenues by handling high capacity.), BSS (Billing Support System) this provide
    billing report, and Security Services. Application Layer: Here application layer
    is classified based on the availability of network, required coverage, heterogeneity,
    etc. Using protocols like MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained
    Application Protocol) this layer provides the requested service to the user. Business
    Layer: This layer is responsible to analyze data received from the Application
    layer by building the business model, flowcharts, graphs, etc. thereby enable
    to support decision-making processes. Thus IoT flow can be defined as first identification
    (to provide clear identification to each device), then sensing gather data from
    the physical environment), thereafter communication, then integration of service
    and finally extraction of knowledge. The new IoT specificities like low power
    and Wide Range, Low deployment and Operational Costs, Long Battery life (10mA
    RX current, 100nA sleep current), Low bitrates, are different from conventional
    networks in many aspects and brings in many challenges. Beside this massive connectivity
    will further aggravate the problem. However, a solution is appearing on the horizon:
    is 3GPP, NB-IoT which can cater these requirements in an effective manner. As
    IoT has a diverse and wide range of IoT requirement, hence one solution won’t
    fit for all. Therefore in the next section a detail comparative analysis of NBIoT
    and other IoT related technologies is discussed. SECTION III. Comparison of NBIot
    With Other IoT Connecting Technologies A myriad of IoT connectivity solutions
    is available to support a wide range of IoT application with miscellaneous requirements.
    Therefore to select an optimal technology for an application various factors such
    as power consumption, security issues, deployment cost, communication range, data
    rate, throughput, latency are required to be considered [26], [27]. A comparison
    of IoT connecting solutions on pre-specified factor is given in Table 1. Connecting
    Technologies of IoT can be coarsely classified into two categories based on their
    range i.e. short and long range. Wireless technologies such as BLE, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Z-wave, WIMAX, 6LOWPAN, etc. offer short range can be used for applications like
    smart home, factory or supermarket. Whereas, LPWAN technologies such as LoRa,
    SigFox, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IOT, etc. offer long range. Other than the pre-specified
    competing technologies RPMA, Telensa, WAVIoT and Dash 7 are few other competing
    technologies contributing to IoT connectivity [28]. TABLE 1 Comparison of IoT
    Connecting Technologies Among wireless technologies, Wi-Fi uses radio waves for
    communication and operates in either 2.4GHz or 5GHz band. The existing Wi-Fi standards
    802.11 a/b/g/n/ac has constraints in both range and energy efficiency, thus can’t
    be considered apposite for applications with low power consumption requisite.
    Thus IEEE has introduced two new protocols 802.11ah and 802.11ax that can support
    thousands of devices with low power consumption. These two are considered to be
    the biggest move of IEEE towards the massive IoT market. The Wi-Fi standard 802.11ah–HaLow
    provide a range of 1km and can easily penetrate barriers/obstacles at data rate
    ranging from 150kbps to 40Mbps. The 802.11ax solution will provide four time’s
    increased capacity and data rate and improved efficiency. These new solutions
    have great potential to capture the M2M market. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is
    another Wireless standard that offers much needed characteristic required for
    most of IoT applications i.e. consumes low power, low cost, but within a short
    range. BLE allows both connectionless and connection-oriented communication. It
    fragments the data into small packets then transmit them over the radio interface.
    This enables BLE to support data services with large packets. It is used in applications
    like wearables, for locating things, etc. Further ZigBee is a simple and low cost
    Wireless option that consumes low power. It is based on IEEE 802 std. and could
    support ~ 65000 nodes/network. Its range can be extended by using repeaters in
    the mesh topology, but this will increase the deployment cost [29]. ZigBee 3.0
    is the new solution introduces, it ensures device interoperability, it is reliable
    robust and above all it is green. Z-Wave is another pioneer for short range communication,
    especially for home-automation industry. As it provides a reliable method to wirelessly
    control multiple home appliances using low-power. Z-Wave operates in the sub-gigahertz
    frequency range, around 900MHz. It can support up to approximately 232 nodes/network.
    The Frequently Listening receiver Slave (FLiRs) enable low latency communication
    by employing unique beaming technology so that device can transit from sleep to
    fully awake modes in one second. Hence suitable for short range IoT application.
    Z-Wave 700 Series, could offer a range of 300 feet, hence can connect gadgets
    placed outside the home and far off into the yard, too [30]. Despite offering
    low power consumption and low cost, Wireless technologies limits in supporting
    long distance communication. Hence offers limited mobility and deployment possibilities
    for the device. Moreover, to extend the range, repeaters are required to be deployed
    densely, thus extortionately expensive. Whereas, LPWA technologies offer mass
    deployment, long range, long battery life, and require low bandwidth. Hence LPWA
    fills a cavity in the landscape of Wireless technologies. LPWAN technologies can
    be categorized into two categories Licensed and Unlicensed. Long Range (LoRa),
    SigFox, RPMA, N-Wave and Dash 7 are unlicensed, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M are licensed
    technologies [31], [32]. LoRa is developed by Semtech, to deploy its network it
    is required to get a NetID issued from LoRa Alliance. It uses an Adaptive Data
    Rate (ADR) scheme which helps in extending the battery lifetime. It is based on
    Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation technique, which sustains the same low power
    characteristics as FSK modulation yet considerably increases the communication
    range. LoRa-WAN being asynchronous let devices to remain in sleep mode for a long
    time period as desired by the application. Another advantage of LoRa is its BS
    provide wide coverage. However, as LoRa operates in unlicensed spectrum thus could
    not provide QoS and neither it could support dense network as it employs MAC based
    ALOHA protocol [33]. SigFox is another technology that operates in unlicensed
    sub 1GHz band. It operates on cloud based approach and uses ALOHA like LoRa but
    with a restriction on the maximum number of messages, a device could send. The
    prime advantage of SigFox is it doesn’t spend energy on sensing medium thus saves
    energy. SigFox requires the user to purchase subscription. In order to provide
    long range communication it uses Ultra-Narrow-band modulation and transfers each
    message 100 Hz wide with a data rate of 100/600 bps depending on the region. Ingenu
    is another LPWAN technology offers high throughput, high scalability, and use
    patented Random Phase Multiple Access scheme. RPMA helps in improving SNR by minimizing
    the overlapping between signals transmitted. It is slightly more complex as it
    uses TDMA based MAC protocol to efficiently allocate the radio resource [34].
    Another LPWAN technology WEIGHTLESS-P, uses cognitive radio and TV white-spaces,
    such that devices utilize the bands as an opportunistic user without causing interference
    to the primary user. It supports two way communication thereby acknowledges all
    transmissions, further in order to maintain QoS and to assure reliability Automatic
    retransmission request (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) is used [36].
    Taking about existing cellular technology LTE could not provide solutions for
    M-IoT applications i.e. Low power consumption, low data rates, and wider coverage
    at low cost. Thus 3GPP proposed a licensed LTE-M / eMTC, in Rel-12 to cater the
    requirements of machine type communication which has been optimized in Rel-13.
    It leverages the existing LTE network and follows narrowband operation for reception
    and transmission and provides extended coverage. To reduce power consumption it
    used PSM (power saving mode) and edRx mode [37]. NBIoT (Narrow Band IoT), is another
    licensed technology introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. NB-IoT in comparison to other
    technologies offer mMTC required features at low cost like (i) provide coverage
    in challenging positions like underground or basements; (ii) improved power saving
    mechanisms to enhance the battery life; (iii) network procedures are simplified
    to reduce the UE complexity. Apart from this to support small data transfer it
    has optimized CIoT User Plane and Control Plane Another technology EC-GSM is also
    proposed by 3GPP which is an extension of existing GSM technology. Suitable for
    many applications, but it overburdens the device and network [38]. Conclusion:
    For M-IoT applications, individually all LPWAN technologies are prompt in one
    way or the other for wide range solutions but picking a clear winner is critical.
    LoRa, SigFox being proprietary technology has an established market and giving
    a tough fight to 3GPP NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT and others also. However proprietary technologies
    operate in Unauthorized/Unlicensed Spectrum that suffers from Duty Cycle constraint.
    Thus affects the transmission time and also bears high interference as spectrum
    is shared between multiple technologies. Whereas, NBIoT operate in licensed spectrum
    and can support massive connections, operates at low data rates (but better than
    LoRa), offer wide coverage with deep indoor penetration, perform well in dense
    area, consumes less power in comparison to LoRa, & SigFox, offers very good link
    budgets and good scalability, provide QoS Apart from this just require a software
    update to LTE or existing RAN infrastructure. Thus ready to immediate role out
    in the market. This is essential for reducing deployment cost and time [39], [40].
    Hence this ascertains that NBIoT has the ability to capture the IoT-LPWAN market
    specifically in comparison to other LPWAN Technologies SECTION IV. NBIoT: Narrow
    Band Internet of Things NB-IoT is the latest technology that is identified and
    standardized in a little time span, in the response of customer requirement and
    pressure to tussle with non-3GPP proprietary technologies. NBIoT can efficiently
    support the market of the M-IoT application. This an independent radio interface,
    tightly connected with LTE, which also shows up in its integration in the current
    LTE specifications [12], [13], [41], [42]. It can address the needs of mMTC (massive
    Machine Type Communication) by following features (Fig. 4): FIGURE 4. NBIoT features.
    Show All NBIoT can support massive connections (more than 52K/channel): as in
    MTC communication model user, transfer small data at low frequency and are insensitive
    to latency so multiple users can camp on one cell. Further, NBIoT supports two
    schemes multi-tone and single-tone transmission. This offers flexibility to schedule
    12 subcarriers with sub spacing of 15 kHz or 48 subcarriers with sub spacing of
    3.75 kHz with single tone scheduling. Hence eNodeB could support large no of users
    in parallel. NBIoT uses a bandwidth of 180 KHz and operates in HD-FDD: In NBIoT,
    UL/DL bandwidth is restricted to 180 kHz. Hence less complex transceiver is used.
    Further, the device operates in Half Duplex mode, thus can’t receive and transmit
    simultaneously. This further decrease device cost, as no duplexer will be required.
    NBIoT design objective is to provide prolonged battery life: For long battery
    life, power Consumption is reduced by using eDRX (extended discontinuous reception)
    and PSM (power saving modes) features. In extended discontinuous reception, the
    UE monitors the paging channel periodically. Whereas in PSM, the device remains
    in receiving state. NBIoT provides extend coverage range of 20dB as compare to
    GPRS (especially deep indoor penetration): To provide the wide coverage the transport
    block can be transmitted multiple times i.e. 128 times in UL and 2048 in DL. Hence
    improves Signal to noise-interference ratio (SINR) and enable proper decoding
    of the signal. To determine the number of repetitions for coverage extensions,
    three classes are defined CE level 0, CE level 1 and CE level 2. For each of these
    class, the number of repetitions is regulated separately. Beside this soft retransmission
    the network bandwidth is also reduced. Hence based on two features 20 dB coverage
    enhancement is achieved where ~7dB is achieved from network bandwidth reduction
    and ~13 dB from allowed repeated transmissions. NBIoT offers operating mode flexibility:
    In order to coexist with LTE and 2G, three deployment modes are available standalone,
    in-band and standalone. NBIoT doesn’t support higher modulation scheme than QPSK,
    thus keep device complexity low and thereby cost. Moreover, to keep the PAPR (peak
    to average power ratio) low in UL, π /2-BPSK, π /4- QPSK is used. NBIoT supports
    Low-Data-Rate applications, which obsolete the requirement for high-capacity flash
    memory hence reduce the chip area and thereby the cost of devices. NBIoT operates
    in Licensed Band and can provide telecommunication level of security. NBIoT achieved
    signaling optimization: In addition to existing RRC, NBIoT uses DONAS (data over
    non access stratum) and RRC (radio resource control) suspend/resume for signaling
    optimization. Where DONAS enable the user to transmit data without activating
    a user plane and support sporadic data transmissions also. The RRC suspend/resume
    is a user plane optimization procedure that introduced an efficient way to disable
    and restore the user plane. Further, NB-IoT is designed for sporadic and small
    messages transmission among the device and the network. It is presumed that the
    device can exchange small messages via one cell, therefore obsolete the requirement
    of handoffs. However, if required then it needs to first go in idle state and
    then restart the cell selection process. Besides this, it doesn’t support other
    EUTRA functions like Inter-RAT-mobility, handover, dual connectivity, CQI (Channel
    Quality Indicator) reporting. A. Background of NBIoT NBIoT is in the initial state
    of deployment, still, there is room for optimization. The miscellaneous work carried
    out in the context of NBIoT optimization is discussed in this section. Song et
    al. [43] proposed an indoor localization algorithm for NB-IoT system using Channel
    state information (CSI) fingerprinting. The proposed algorithm will estimate the
    position with less complexity by observing the similarity between two CSI values
    and then convert the similar value to a relative value. To improve estimation
    of position, triangular centroid algorithm and K nearest neighbor is used. As
    a result, the position error was reduced in comparison to existing techniques.
    Further, to enable a node, in an idle state to transmit the data. Lin et al. [44]
    proposed an efficient SDT (Smallest Data Transmission) technique to increase the
    number of the supportable device. In this eNB will broadcast the maximum SDT size
    in SIB (system information block), and also a group of SDT ids with it. Thereafter,
    UE will check the SDT value and determine whether to use this technique or not.
    If suitable then send the RA response. Successively, eNB will acknowledge by sending
    RA response comprised of uplink resource grant. UE on successful reception will
    send the PDU and starts the timer. Upon receiving the response within time, UE
    compares its id with group ids. As a result, authors found that more devices could
    be supported in comparison of conventional control plane solutions, whilst using
    limited uplink resources. However massive connection results in the high probability
    of collision thus Kim et al. [45] proposed an enhanced Access- Reservation-Protocol
    (EARP) with a partial preamble transmission mechanism. The proposed protocol although
    reduced the collision probability but at the cost of abdication of the detection
    ability. Authors found that EARP would results in effective resource utilization
    in reference to system load. When the load will be less then it will reduces the
    probability of misdetection. On the other hand, when a heavy load would be there,
    the collision probability gets reduced although the detection probability get
    deteriorates. Further Zhang et al. [46] done an analysis of interference caused
    by the NBIoT user equipment to that of LTE users. Authors considered only in-band
    and guard band for analysis and proposed an algorithm for removal of ISI or channel
    equalization. On the basis of observation, the authors stated that LTE-UE performance
    degrades due to the different sampling rate of NBIoT user. In addition to this,
    the level of interference depends upon specifically two important factors. First
    due to attenuation of power and second is due to guard band. A critical observation
    about bit error rate is made for an LTE device i.e. its BER will improve as guard-band
    bandwidth increases although for IoT devices BER remains unaffected. Liu et al.
    [47] taking the same issue of interference between NBIoT and LTE devices have
    proposed a framework based on Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) and two algorithms
    for recovery of signals. Authors observed that by canceling the interfering NB-IoT
    signal, LTE device could operate more effectively. Further, Lin et al. [48] proposed
    a single tone design for NPRACH (narrowband physical random access channel) and
    this work was integrated into 3GPP Rel-13. To reduce the overhead due to cyclic
    prefix (CP) N-samples are repeated n times and then collectively CP corresponding
    to these samples is added, as a result, the length of CP got reduced. After this
    single carrier hopping is used where within symbols fixed hopping is used and
    among different symbol groups, pseudo-random hopping is applied. Further, the
    time of arrival (ToA) & carrier frequency offset (CFO) is jointly estimated to
    determine the midsection and false alarm. As a result, the authors observed that
    using the proposed design the probability of detection increased up to 99% and
    the probability of false-alarm reduced immensely below 0.1%. Further, Yang et
    al. [49] suggested using effective bandwidth (EB) to collectively handle all the
    components of LPWAN i.e. battery life, coverage, Tx (transmission) bandwidth,
    spectral efficiency. According to the suggested, concept if Tx bandwidth would
    be greater than EB, this would ultimately reduce the system capacity. On the other
    hand, if Tx would be less than EB, this would entail more Tx time. However, the
    journey of optimization doesn’t end here. There are various open issues that are
    still required to be addressed to envisage NBIoT success. Some of them are discussed
    in section VII. B. History of Standardization Before standardization, of NBIoT.
    It was proposed in two formats. NBIoT-OFDMA and NBIoT-M2M in 2014. Where QUALCOMM
    offered NBIoT-OFDMA & Huawei and Vodafone collectively offered NBIoT-M2M. These
    two formats were clubbed together to form NB-CIoT (NB cellular IoT), which require
    a new chipset and has no backward compatibility with previous LTE Rel (8-12).
    Further, another format NBIoT-LTE was proposed in 2015 which is fully compatible
    with existing LTE specifications. Then finally in 2016, 3GPP after agreeing on
    two proposals gave standardized technology NBIoT. This technology has evolved
    over years of improvement. In this section, the roadmap of standardization (from
    Rel-8 to 15) is discussed to determine the improvement made (in these Rel) to
    support MTC. Well standardization of LTE started in 2005 when 3GPP started depth
    research for MTC on CN. In 2009, Rel-8 was standardization [50] and brought in
    the feature like peak DL data rate of 300Mbps with an ability to operate in paired
    and unpaired frequency band. Thus have spectral flexibility with bandwidth ranging
    from 1.4 to 20 MHz A new IP based network was introduced i.e. LTE, was a significant
    step toward the IMT-A. In addition to this, to cater the need of multiple users,
    multiple antenna scenario came in to picture since the first Rel of 3GPP [51].
    However the basic requirement of low cost device and power issues left unattended.
    Thereafter Rel-9 standardized in 2010 in which LTE evolved to LTE-Advance and
    introduced additional features such as public warning system (PWS), location Identification
    service, SON (Self Organizing Network) feature to improve the network configuration,
    added new spectrum bands. Further in 2011 Rel-10 (also known as LTE-Advanced)
    was launched to extensively improve the throughput of the LTE system. For evaluation
    of Rel-10, it was submitted to ITU-R in 2010. In Rel-10, to enhance the bandwidth
    and bitrate, Carrier Aggregation was used for both TDD & FDD [52] and to reduce
    the interference, eICIC (enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination) was added,
    where ABS (Almost Blank Subframes) is used to confine the data to the specific
    layer of the cell. Other features like eMIMO, etc. were also introduced. Further,
    Rel-11 [53] got frozen in 2013. An important feature CoMP (Co-ordinated Multi
    Point operation) was announced to facilitate the scheduling of multiple carriers.
    EPDCCH (Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel) was added to increase DLC
    (downlink-Capacity). Furthermore, Rel-12 [54], [55] got standardized in 2015.
    In this NAICS (Network Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression) was
    added to manage interference. To achieve QoE, naïve UE categories were introduced
    with 50% reduced cost in comparison to Rel-8, cat-1 devices. In support of machine
    type communication, PSM (power saving mode) was also introduced to conserve energy.
    Finally in Rel 13 [56], [57] to further cater the need of Machine to machine type
    communication, a new feature added to existing Rel-8-12: SCPTM (single cell point
    to multi-point), indoor-positioning, reduced latency, Dual connectivity and enhanced
    CA. LAA (licensed assisted access) was also introduced to allow operators to offload
    traffic to the femtocell, devoid of WLAN Two naïve category of devices were introduced
    in Rel 13 Cat-M1 (eMTC) and Cat-NB1 (NBIoT). Where the system bandwidth was confined
    to 1.4 MHz and coverage range was enhanced by 15 dB for Cat-M1 devices. Altogether
    reduced the device complexity and cost enabled operators to reach terminal devices
    in poor coverage range like in basements. For assurance of long battery life eDRX
    (extended Discontinuous Reception) feature was introduced that monitors the DL
    signals for only a short span of time otherwise keep the device in the sleep state.
    For the further evolution of LTE to support mMTC Rel-14 is also standardized with
    more technologies and improvement in existing features such as Additional Broadcast
    services, enhanced positioning, reduced latency, and massive multi antenna system.
    Currently, Rel-15 is under standardization process and expected to get standardize
    by September 2018 [56]. The expected features of Rel-15 are also enlisted in Table
    2. TABLE 2 Standardization History Toward NBIoT [12] C. NBIoT Network Architecture
    The architecture of NBIoT is shown in Fig. 5, NBIoT has simplified the EPC architecture
    to support the small data transmissions required for M-IoT applications in the
    form of User Plane and the Control Plane EPC optimization. FIGURE 5. NBIoT architecture
    [58]. Show All Here NB-IoT device or user equipment communicates with the eNodeB
    thereafter eNodeB connects with the IoT evolved packet core (EPC). This is comprised
    of entities: the Serving GW, the Packet Data Network GW, the Mobility management
    plane entity, the Home Subscriber server. After this eNodeB transfers the NAS
    (non-access stratum, a signaling message) to EPC using s1-lite (an optimized version
    of S1-Control-Plane and support efficient data handling). Basically, NAS is a
    protocol that transfers the non-radio signal between the user equipment and MME,
    which carries data for session and mobility management. Further to continue the
    processing EPC looks for stratum and then pass it to IoT platform. IoT platform
    forwards the data to application servers in supported form. This data is then
    processed by the Application server [58]. There are two ways in which data could
    be transmitted between NBIoT device and application server i.e. IP based and Non-IP
    based. However, Non-IP based is more endorsed since it reduces the overhead of
    user equipment and transmission is also more secure as only one target IP is supported.
    D. NBIoT Frame Structure Downlink: The frame structure of NBIoT DL is identical
    to LTE. In Time domain a radio frame is comprised of 10 Subframes, each having
    length of 1ms and each subframe consists of 2 slots with a time slot of seven
    OFDM symbols (Fig. 6 A) Here each OFDM symbol with in a frame is denoted by a
    number in the range 0 to 13. Further, the number of these radio frames is referred
    as the system frame number (SFN) which ranges from 0 to 1023. Once the SFN counter
    reaches the value of 1023, the counter is reset to 0 and thereafter the hyper
    SFN counter is increased. The hyper SFN ranges between 0 and 1023. Within each
    radio frame, the sub frames are labeled as 0 to 9 and the slots as 0 to 19. In
    Frequency domain, one physical resource block consists of 12 consecutive subcarriers
    with a spacing of 15 kHz [40]. FIGURE 6. Frame structure of NBIoT [59]. Show All
    Uplink: The UL resource grid has two subcarrier spacing options i.e.15 kHz and
    3.75 kHz. In time domain: with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz each slot has a
    duration of.5ms, the number of subcarriers will be 12 which is similar to the
    time domain. However, for the 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing, total number of subcarriers
    in the frequency domain is 4 times i.e. 12*4=48 subcarriers. The slot duration
    will be of 2ms [40]. E. Physical Channels and Signals 1) Uplink Channels and Signals
    Since NBIoT enabled UE’s operates in extreme coverage areas and have limited power
    to operate. Pertaining to this, to reduce the power consumption and complexity
    UE is no longer asked to report a channel, thus their functionality reduced to
    send acknowledgment and No- acknowledgment. Apart from this the need of control
    channel is also obsoleted and only two UL channels are supported namely NPRACH,
    NPUSCH. a: NPRACH: Narrowband Physical Random-Access Channel NPRACH refers to
    the time frequency resource which occupies contiguous set of subcarriers either
    12, 24, 36 or 48 and used to transmit random access preambles. This preamble consist
    of four symbol groups, each group comprised of one Cycle Prefix (CP) and 5 symbols
    [48]. These preambles are repeated with a periodicity from 0.04 s to 2.56 s. The
    eNB uses the random access preamble sent by a user terminal to estimate the uplink
    timing. To start the random access process the preamble is transmitted with a
    duration of 5.6ms or 6.4ms. Further in order to support different cell size two
    CP lengths are specified in NPRACH, 66.67 μs and 266.7 μs . Where 66.67 μs is
    used for cells with radii not more than 8 km and 266.7 μs is used for cell with
    radii range of 8 – 35 km. Each symbol is modulated on a 3.75 kHz tone, which hops
    from one tone to another within twelve contiguous subcarriers. Further for efficient
    estimation of TOA (Time of Arrival) and to achieve improved synchronization between
    UE and eNB, frequency hopping is used. For this two layer hopping pattern is defined
    i.e. inner hopping & output hopping. In order to provide wide TOA range, inner
    hopping is used with fixed (for simplicity) and small values. However, an output
    hopping layer accounts to improve the accuracy of TOA estimation. Furthermore
    to alleviate cell interference between neighboring cells, the pseudo random hopping
    pattern is also used which has been inherited from the LTE PUSCH hopping. Finally
    to support coverage extension of +20dB GPRS, the preamble of four symbol groups
    can be repeated up to 128 times [59]. b: NPUSCH: Narrowband Physical Uplink Shared
    Channel The NPUSCH supports single tone transmission with either 3.75 kHz or 15
    kHz and multitone bandwidth using 15 kHz subcarrier spacing. The NPUSCH has two
    formats. Format 1 carries the actual data in the uplink with maximum transmission
    block size of 1000 bits. Format1 facilitate multitone transmission with 3,6,12
    tones. Other than this to decrease the PAPR (Peak to Average Power ratio the modulation
    scheme π /2-BPSK or π /4-QPSK is used for single-tone and QPSK is used for multi-tone
    for NPUSCH Format 1. Furthermore, Format 2 carries control information, supports
    single-tone transmission only and carries 1-bit UCI that corresponds to hybrid
    automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback for NB-PDSCH transmission block. Table
    3 describes the format 1 and format 2. Typically the NPUSCH is designed to provide
    long battery life, massive capacity and extended coverage [14], [59]. TABLE 3
    NPUSCH Format [59] c: DMRS: Demodulation Reference Signal In LTE, DMRS is used
    to obtain channel response for PUSCH. Similar to enable eNB to estimate the UL
    channel, the NBIoT-UE transmits a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) which is
    multiplexed with the NPUSCH symbols. Thereby depending on Format of NPUSCH (ie.
    Format 1or Format 2), (Fig. 7) 1or 3 symbols per SC-FDMA slot are utilized to
    transmit the DMRS. With 15 kHz subcarrier spacing DMRS is allocated to symbol
    #3 of every 7 symbols and for 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing. DMRS is allocated to
    5th symbol of every 7 symbols for data transmission [40]. FIGURE 7. DMRS allocation
    in 15 kHz &3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing [60]. Show All 2) Downlink Channels and
    Signals The NBIoT physical downlink channels are QPSK modulated. The downlink
    designs of NB-IoT MAC and PHY are analogous to the LTE. However, NB-IoT has fewer
    downlink physical channels as compared to LTE. For example, NBIoT doesn’t use
    PMCH (Physical Multicast Channel) as it doesn’t support multimedia broadcast/multicast
    services (till Rel-13) [61], [62]. a: DL Synchronization Signals The downlink
    synchronization signals allow a device to synchronize to NBIoT cell. However,
    the detection of these signals is a challenging task. As when a device with low-power
    oscillator wakes up after a long period of deep sleep, the time base will not
    have a valid reference then, and the frequency base perhaps off by as ~20 ppm.
    Hence a large offset may exist between the device and the network time and frequency,
    which will seriously harm the acquisition performance. The frequency offset is
    due to factors such as temperature, crystal aging, etc. Out of all “temperature”
    is the crucial factor that majorly affects the accuracy, and hence required to
    be compensated in real time. Depending on the quality of the crystal the offset
    ranges from ±5 ppm to ±100 ppm [63], [64]. Hence to detect with large frequency
    offset NBIoT new Synchronization signals NPSS (Narrowband Primary Synchronization
    Signal) is designed which is transmitted in Subframe 5 of duration 1 ms with a
    sequence pattern periodicity of 10 ms and subcarrier spaced at 15 kHz. The hierarchical
    sequence of NPSS is generated using (1) [65] P k (l)=Q(k) e −jπul(l+1)/ 11 , (1)
    View Source Where Q(k)= {1, 1, 1, 1,−1,−1, 1, 1,−1, 1} is the modulation sequence,
    1≤l≤11 (length), 3≤k≤14 (OFDM symbols) and u=5 is the root sequence. Its detection
    is a demanding computational operation from UE perspective. This detection may
    account for at least 24% of the power consumption. However, to keep the device
    complexity low, devices are required to search for only one NPSS as all the cells
    use the same NPSS in NB-IoT network. In contrast to this LTE network uses three
    PSSs. Although, in order to get one copy of NPSS, 19,200 samples need to be captured
    with a sub-frame of the length of 10 ms, with 1.92 MHz sampling rate. Hereafter
    to ascertain the cell identity out of 504 cell-ids available and to acquire additional
    information about the frame structure NSSS (Narrowband Secondary Synchronization
    Signal) is used. It is transmitted in subframe 9 with a subframe periodicity of
    20ms. Hence NSSS sequences are transmitted four times in 80-ms repetition interval
    are differentiated by the phase shift. It uses the last 11 OFDM symbols that consist
    of 132 resource elements overall. Unlike legacy LTE, cell ID is enclosed in the
    secondary sequence without including the primary sequence. NSSS, ZC 131 (Zadoff-Chu
    sequence) is constructed to indicate cell-ids [65] R(m)= b q (n) e −j2π θ f m
    e −j π μm ′ ( m ′ +1) 131 (2) View Source Where AbbreviationExpansion m = 0,1,…..,131

    ID 126 ⌋ , is cell specific parameter θ f = 31 132 ( n f / 2)mod4 , the cyclic
    shift, here n f is SFN, b q , binary scrambling sequence of 128-bits which is
    obtained based on length-128 WalsheHadamard. Hereafter NSSS is mapped to in radio
    frames having n f mod2=0 . b: Physical Channels i) NBPBCH: Narrow-Band Physical
    Broadcast Channel NB-PBCH reside in subframe 0 in every radio frame and carries
    the MIB (Master Information Block). It provide information about system bandwidth,
    SFN (system Frame Number), No of antenna ports. NB-PBCH, MIB consists of 8 independently
    decodable blocks of each of 80 ms duration. Where each block is repeated 8 times
    consecutively to manage with extreme coverage conditions. Hence MIB remains unchanged
    for the time span of 640 ms (Fig. 9). The NB-IOT determines the number of cell
    antenna ports whilst demodulating MIB information. Other than this MIB also provide
    information about operation mode. NB-PBCH reuses the functionalities from legacy
    LTE PBCH such as CRC generation and attachment, Tail biting convolutional encoding,
    Rate matching, Scrambling, Modulation, Layer mapping. FIGURE 8. NPSS & NSSS subframe
    [61]. Show All FIGURE 9. Mapping of NBPBCH [59]. Show All ii) NPDCCH: Narrowband
    Physical Downlink Control Channel The NPDCCH is used to carry DCI (Downlink Control
    Information). Basically, a device needs to monitor NPDCCH to obtain three types
    of information mentioned below. NBIoT has own control channel different from LTE-MTC
    system, although some features have been inherited. Typically NPDCCH is apt for
    transporting scheduling information. Moreover, as NBIoT supports only HDD mode
    thus transmission of NPDCCH is packet based [63]. Besides this to keep the power
    consumption low on UE side, the payload size of DCI (downlink control information)
    is kept up to 23 bits for UL grant or DL assignment for NPDCCH. Hence three new
    DCI formats have been defined as Format N0, Format N1, and Format N2. The usage
    of these formats is specified in Table 4. Further, NPDCCH consists of Narrowband
    control channel elements (NCCEs) where resource elements are mapped. A subframe
    has two NCCEs, analogous to the upper six and lower six subcarriers and for NCCE
    mapping (Fig. 10). TABLE 4 DCI Formats [14], [61] FIGURE 10. NPDCCH subframe structure
    [62]. Show All iii) Narrowband Physical Downlink Shared Channel (NPDSCH) The NPDSCH
    is the core data bearing channel used for transmission of unicast data, broadcast
    information such as SI (System Information) messages. It segments the data packet
    received from higher layer into transmission blocks and transmits one at a time.
    The resource mapping is done in an almost similar manner as NPDCCH beside two
    differences. One, that NPDSCH carry only one TB (maximum TB size is limited to
    680 bits) though NPDCCH can multiplex resources in a subframe to transmit two
    DCI messages. Secondly, if the subframe transmits the SIB1-NB then starting OFDM
    symbol in an NPDCCH subframe will be different from NPDSCH subframe in the in-band
    mode. The NPDSCH TB is processed as follows. Firstly, the CRC of 24-bit is evaluated
    and then attached to the TB. Then TB is encoded via the tail biting convolutional
    coding encoder and rate-matched owing to code-word length deduced collectively
    from the number of NPDSCH sub-frames assigned to the TB and on the basis of the
    number of REs per subframe. Accordingly, the coding rate is determined by size
    of TB and the number of NPDSCH Subframes allotted to the TB combination. Henceforward
    before mapping the encoded TB bits to QPSK symbols, the bits are scrambled i.e.
    the subframe is repeated min (NREP, 4) times before the mapping of the code word
    continues. For each repetition, the scrambling code differs. The maximum no of
    repetitions allowed are 2048 to achieve the SNR of −12.6dB. The repeated Subframes
    allow a device to decode the code word before the transmission completes [64].
    F. NBIoT Connection Process 1) Cell Selection Process A device can be in idle
    or connected mode while looking for the cell to camp on. If the device wakes up
    from a deep sleep then it obtains the information about most recently used (MRU)
    cells using cell selection protocols. In case none of the cell is found suitable
    or if device is powered on for the first time, it is required to perform a full
    frequency scan to find a new cell to camp on. The fundamental purpose of cell
    selection is to identify and synchronize to a suitable NB-IoT cell. In this context,
    the first foremost step is to time synchronize and then obtain a CFO estimated
    value. In order to achieve NPSS synchronization, its autocorrelation properties
    must be exploited. Hence when device achieves the time synchronization, then using
    next frames it determines the CFO. For device located in extreme coverage conditions,
    large number of NPSS frames are required to be detected. Once the symbol time
    is determined and the CFO is compensated for in-band or guard-band, still, an
    additional raster offset will exist up to 7.5 kHz. Consequently, this raster offset
    drifts the symbol time either in the forward or backward direction due to overcompensation
    or under compensation of the carrier frequency respectively. As a result, there
    is severe degradation in the performance of NPBCH detection, which may introduce
    latency greater than the length of CP (Cyclic Prefix) and subsequently leading
    to loss of orthogonality of OFDM symbol lost in the downlink. Hence to improve
    the detection performance device complexity must be increased so that it may do
    hypothesis testing of set of raster offset. Once the NPSS synchronization is achieved
    the device has the knowledge of subframe #9, however, a device has information,
    whether the radio frame is odd or even numbered. As NBIoT has 504 Cell-ids, thus
    NSSS detection algorithm will form 4032 hypothesis in total. Thereafter correlating
    the received signal corresponding to each hypothesis with NSSS waveform allow
    a device to detect the Cell-id. Hereafter device has Cell-id and also has information
    about the placement of NRS. Now the NBPCH is demodulated to obtain MIB-NB for
    this the device needs to form eight hypotheses hence also referred as blind decoding.
    The MIB-NB contains 34 bits and is transmitted over 64 radio frames. The foremost
    information acquired from MIB are a) Operation mode indicated by 7 bits i.e. stand-alone,
    in-band, guard-band. b) Information about SIB1 scheduling indicated by 4 bits.
    c) SI value tag indicated by 5 bits d) Access barring (AB) information enabled
    or not is indicated by 1 bit. e) System Timing: 4 MSBs of the SFN and 2 LSBs of
    the H-SFN. f) 11 spare bits used for future extensions. In addition to this, the
    transport block size and the number of repetitions is also indicated in the MIB.
    Hence acquiring the MIB-NB, a device can locate and decode SIB1-NB. An SIB1-NB
    carries 8 MSBs of the H-SFN, tracking area, a 28-bit long cell-id, and scheduling
    information regarding other SIB to unambiguously ascertain a cell within a PLMN.
    The SIB1-NB transmitted in subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames.
    Beside this, it is transmitted at a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 2560
    ms (256 Radio Frames). To determine the first frame for transmission of SIB1,
    cell-id is used. Hereafter acquiring SIB1-NB, the device achieves the complete
    synchronization. If any change occurs it will be indicated either by paging or
    by changing the tag values. In a manner, the device has accomplished time and
    frequency synchronization with errors that will not significantly degrade the
    performance in successive transmissions and receptions during connected or idle
    mode operations [65], [66]. Fig. 11 (a) describes the cell acquisition process.
    FIGURE 11. (a) Cell acquisition process [66]. (b) Random access procedure [69].
    (c) Connection Establishment [70]. (d) Data transmission [73]. Show All 2) Random
    Access Procedure Random Access procedure is initiated by the MAC layer itself
    or by its sublayer RRC. Before initialization of this process, UE has information
    about the available set of PRACH resources. The principles to select PRACH resource
    is based on received signal received power (RSRP) measurement that specify the
    enhanced coverage level supported by the Serving Cell. A device uses two threshold
    values supported by serving cell to determine the NPRACH configuration. Besides
    this, the RSRP thresholds are used by the network to analyze the maximum coupling
    loss corresponding to different coverage levels. In NBIoT the eNB can support
    max 3 number of NPRACH repetitions out of {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64}. Hereafter
    acquiring the CE level information UE instructs the physical layer to transmit
    a preamble while specifying the number of repetitions required for transmission
    per preamble, preamble index and preamble received target power. For CE level
    0, the preamble received target power (PRTP) is set to PRTP-10 * log10 (number-of-Repetition-Per-Preamble-Attempt)
    whereas for other CE levels PRTP is set to the UE maximum output power [67], [68].
    In NPRACH, RA preamble is transmitted to determine the transmission time of the
    device to eNodeB. On each symbol group of RA preamble frequency hopping is applied
    so that individual group is transmitted on a different subcarrier. Hereafter transmitting
    the preamble, RA-RNTI (Random Access-Radio Network Temporary Identifier) is computed
    using RA-RNTI = 1+floor (SFN_id/4), here SFN_id is the index of the first radio
    frame, then it looks for RAR (Random Access Response) message indicated in DCI
    format N1 scrambled with RA-RNTI transmitted in PDCCH. Nevertheless, if RAR (random
    Access Response) is not received then UE retransmits the preamble. As stated above
    number of retransmissions depend on CE level. However, if the number of attempt
    saturates an associated failure is reported to RRC. Now eNB on receiving the preamble
    sequence transmits the RAR message also referred as Msg 2, to UE which provide
    information about TA (Timing Advance), scheduling information about radio resource
    that device can use to transmit the request for connection, C-RNTI (Cell radius
    Network Temporary identification) as shown in Fig. 11 (b) [69] Now UE transmits
    Msg 3 to eNB on NPUSCH including its identity, C-RNTI MAC CE, submitted from the
    upper layer and start the contention resolution process. In addition to this data,
    the volume parameter is sent to indicate the amount of data present in UE buffer.
    All together will facilitate the BS to take power allocation and scheduling decision
    for subsequent UL transmission. 3) Connection Establishment UE indicates that
    it wants to connect to the network by sending RRC-Connection-Request. In addition
    to the establishment cause, the UE also indicates its capability to support multi-tone
    traffic and multi carrier support. The eNB on receiving connection request, send
    RRC-Connection-Setup message Thereafter UE acknowledges by sending the Connection-setup-
    -complete message and send NAS attach request. The PDN-CONNECTIVITY-REQUEST message
    is piggy-backed in NAS ATTACH REQUEST [70], [71]. The PDN connection is novel
    capability introduced in 3GPP Rel-13 that allow UE to remain attached without
    PDN connection that support CIoT optimization. In this UE is not required to establish
    a PDN connection as part of attach procedure. Moreover UE and MME can release
    the connection without releasing EPS connection. Hence enables large number of
    devices to keep their connection inactive for long duration and seldom transmit
    data over it [72]. Hereafter the EPS authentication process is initiated. After
    that to activate the default EPS bearer CONTEXT REQUEST message is piggybacked
    in NAS: ATTACH ACCEPT. The follow of above discussed steps are discussed in Fig.
    11(c). 4) Small Data Transfer In Rel-13, 3GPP added an ability to send data over
    control Plane. As NBIoT require to transmit the small data sporadically, hence
    to send it in optimized way CIoT EPS optimizations are used which include Control
    Plane and User Plane optimization. In Control Plane optimization, UE sends the
    data packets encapsulated in NAS (Non Access Stratum) to convey non radio signal
    to MME for a service request. In NAS message RAI (Release Assistance Information)
    field indicate the MME that any further UL/DL transmissions are expected. In case
    no further transmission is expected than MME immediately triggers the S1 Release
    procedure. Hence enable MME to reduce the device DRX waiting period during which
    it waits for additional transmission. Besides this, if the size of the data transferred
    via Control Plane exceeds then UE/MME triggers the establishment of User Plane
    bearer between eNB and SGW. User Plane CIoT EPS optimization is an alternative
    procedure which is suitable for short as well as large data transaction. However,
    it requires first to establish RRC connection and create Access Stratum and radio
    bearer between the network and UE. Once the RRC connection is established two
    control procedures Connection suspend and Resume are used [74] G. Modes of Operation
    of NBIoT NBIoT carrier can be deployed in three modes standalone, in-band, and
    guard band. Standalone Operation: In this mode, a separate spectrum is either
    reserved for radio access technology like GSM/UMTS or a dedicated spectrum is
    used for deployment of NBIoT carrier. However, this will escalate the implementation
    cost as software and hardware upgradation will be required for spectrum reframing.
    In Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier is deployed within LTE carrier.
    Sharing of resource block would definitely result in the more efficient use of
    spectrum which in turn will increase the capacity. The LTE bands not utilized
    to carry system information block −1 are used for inband deployment of NBIoT.
    In single tone transmission mode in uplink, there will be interference between
    NB-IoT and LTE (3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing). Although this interference could
    be minimized by scheduling users with similar SNR requirements in NB-IoT and nearby
    LTE PRBs. It’s also a cost effective way as no hardware modifications are required.
    In Guard Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier will be located within guard
    band of LTE carrier to avoid interference. This mode delivers better downlink
    throughput in comparison to in band as more downlink resource is available [75].
    NB-IoT deployment modes offer high flexibility as carrier deployed in one mode
    can continue working via either of the other modes if spectrum migrates to LTE.
    Fig. 12 describes the scenario of different modes. FIGURE 12. Modes of operation
    of NBIoT [75]. Show All H. Low Power Consumption Using NBIoT Saving power of the
    battery powered device is a crucial factor for the realization of LPWAN applications.
    Two main features Power saving mode (introduced in Rel-12) and Extended Discontinuous
    reception RX (introduced in Rel-13) are used to extend the battery life of device
    up to ten or more years (Fig. 13(A) shows the PSM and Fig. 13(B) eDRX mode) [76].
    FIGURE 13. PSM and eDRX modes to save power, [Source: https://www.rohde-schwarz.comRohde&Schwarz].
    Show All A device in PSM goes into deep sleep mode and could not receive any signal.
    Although whilst this mode device can’t be reached but remain registered with the
    network. Thereby PSM eradicates the need for re-establishment of a connection
    when the device wakes up. Hence will not only result in saving power but also
    help in avoiding network congestion (due to different wake-up time). Thus it is
    suitable for application that requires sporadic transmission (e.g. Once a day).
    A device can switch to PSM, proposing two timers T3324 (active timer) and T3412
    (extended timer) and it is attached to TAU. (The maximum time a device could remain
    in the active state is 186 minutes (~T3324) & max sleeping time for a device would
    be 413 days defined by T3412.) However, it’s up to the network to accept the proposed
    timer values or not. Despite this, there is one challenge of using PSM is non
    reachability of device for a long period that needs to be taken care of by opting
    an optimal value to get a good balance between responsiveness and time for the
    device to stay in PSM. Another main feature is eDRX to save power, this in comparison
    to PSM supports DL accessibility significantly. eDRX reduces the periodicity of
    a device to switch in receiving mode and extends the sleep cycle more in idle
    mode than in connected mode. Currently, in LTE, DRX can extend up to 10.24 s whereas
    using eDRX it can be extended for minutes and hours. Thus for synchronization
    between network and device a new clock H-SFN (Hyper System Frame Number) is used.
    A power saving of 43% can be achieved using eDRX with small paging transmission
    window. As power consumption after PTW during deep sleep mode would be extremely
    low. Hence longer the eDRX more would be power saving. In addition to this other
    feature like reduced complexity and reduced overhead of channel measurement also
    reduce the power consumption, hence extends battery life [77]. I. Applications
    of NBIoT The cost effectiveness of NBIoT-network (due to the implementation of
    new software on an existing LTE infrastructure) has inspired several market analyst
    organizations to predict the revenue in the future. NBIoT being a promising technology,
    could support a wide range of applications with increased efficiency. Some of
    the important applications sectors of NBIoT with notable market perspective are
    utility-meter, industry automation, smart logistics, smart cities, waste management,
    environmental monitoring, agriculture and in personal sector like wearables, pet
    tracking, kids monitoring, white goods monitoring (Fig. 14) which provide convenience
    to remotely access of water, gas, electricity, and heat readings even when they
    are located in weak coverage areas like basements. Currently, a Germany based
    company, ista-International GmBH in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom is proving
    a solution for smart buildings by providing smart utility services using NBIoT
    [26]. Other companies such as Eco Mobile from Zagreb, Croatia in collaboration
    with Deutsche Telekom are providing IoT solutions for waste management using NBIoT.
    Here the sensors are used to measure the level of the trash bin and thereafter
    the sensed data using NBIoT sent to cloud, to determine the optimal route. Hence
    reduce logistic cost. Another important application of NBIoT is smart parking.
    Here occupancy [55]. Prime use case/application of NBIoT is utility meters information
    is collected and hence provide the availability of parking space throughout the
    city. Hamburg will be first to offer using this service of IoT using NBIoT. Huawei
    with China Unicom collaboratively launched smart parking in China also in 2017.
    Apart from this NBIoT can also monitor the environment effectively [16]. For example,
    XMM7115, FIGURE 14. Applications of NBIoT. Show All NBIoT-intel chip is used for
    environmental monitoring. Currently, in Greece Patras, NBIoT based monitoring
    service is being offered by Deutsche Telekom to effectively measure environment
    pollution, noise and air quality to take necessary actions. Automation and digitization
    is the need of the hour and list of possible application are endless. The technical
    view of current IoT applications related to four particular sectors Health monitoring,
    Social monitoring, Agriculture monitoring and defense that are ruling the market
    are given in Table 5. TABLE 5 Different Applications of IoT SECTION V. Efficient
    Resource Allocation Techniques Due to massive connections, IoT system will be
    extremely dense thus the use of efficient resource allocation techniques is of
    vital importance. As incompetent resource allocation will drastically degrade
    the performance of IoT systems. Moreover, there are miscellaneous factors that
    further aids in increasing the complicacy of efficient resource allocation such
    as limited network bandwidth, limited device computation power, diverse user requirement,
    heterogeneous device configurations. Broadly these resource allocation techniques
    can be classified into the following categories: Power allocation, Spectrum allocation,
    Computing & Storage resources allocation in the cloud and Scheduling based (Fig.
    15). Other than this all techniques that assure the reduction in latency and packet
    error are categorized under QoS resource allocation techniques. As per now, few
    resource allocation schemes (RAS) have been proposed for NBIoT system. Immense
    research is required to be carried out for the practical implication of NBIoT
    as the IoT devices have limited resources. In this section, a review of resource
    allocation schemes for NBIoT and IoT system is presented. FIGURE 15. Resource
    allocation in IoT [107]. Show All A. NBIoT Resource Allocation Techniques Yu et
    al. [108] proposed a UL link adaptation scheme with consideration of repletion
    factor to address two important aspects of throughput and reliability. This scheme
    worked in two loops inner and outer. The inner one modifies the repletion factor
    to improve block error ratio whereas outer concentrate on the selection of modulation
    and coding scheme level In addition to this outer loop also decides the repetition
    factor accounting acknowledgment or no acknowledgment packets. As a result, the
    authors observed that the proposed technique can save 46% more resource allocation
    and active time in comparison of straightforward techniques. However, they have
    not considered the effect of inter-channel interference during evaluation. In
    order to handle massive connection effectively in NBIoT multi PRB design is used.
    Where most of UE’s use Anchor-PRB (that satisfy the channel raster condition)
    to get paging and system information block. This leads to overloading of anchor-PRB.
    Hence the overloading of narrowband resource leads to underutilization of resources
    and increase power consumption. To overcome this issue Liu et al. [109] suggested
    a resource allocation technique to balance the paging load by using non-Anchor
    PRB. In the proposed technique existing user will use the Anchor PRB and the new
    NBIoT user will make use of non-Anchor PRB for paging in idle mode. As a result,
    it was observed that resource utilization improved by 30% and power consumption
    was reduced by 80%. Malik et al. [110] proposed an interference aware RAS that
    accounts for the repetition number & time offset. The linear modulation scheme
    is used in NBIoT (QPSK), therefore spectral efficiency is low. Firstly they evaluated
    the max attainable data rate for downlink is 89.2 kbps and 92kbps for uplink (theoretically).
    In addition to this, the authors analyzed the performance of cooperative scheme
    in comparison of non-cooperative and optimal scheme. They found that cooperative
    scheme can reduce the energy consumption by 17% and can improve the data rate
    up to 8%. B. IoT Based Resource Allocation Techniques Liu and Ansari [111] proposed
    a green approach by developing an overlay based architecture that uses relay BS
    powered by solar energy. These relay BS stores the harvested energy in two batteries
    and each one is used in alternatively when one exhaust. Thus omits the grid based
    energy utilization and cuts cost for transmission of power also. Here in this
    approach, the SD (source destination) pairs are classified into two groups based
    on CSI. Where one is direct D2D which doesn’t use relay for transmission and another
    one that uses relay BS for transmission of information. However, while allocating
    bandwidth direct D2D pair is given more preference in comparison to relay based
    D2D transmissions. As a result, authors observed that as the number of SD pair
    increases with D2D communication very less bandwidth left for relay based pairs
    which deteriorates their performance. In addition to this due to large no of direct
    D2D pairs green energy will exhaust quickly and to balance the leftover/residual
    energy the relay BSs with enough left over green energy will transmit their electricity
    via electric transmission lines to the relay BSs which run out of green energy.
    Hence proposed architecture maximizes the green energy utilization and further
    saves the on-grid energy. Further, Kotagi et al. [112] proposed a breathing technique
    to reduce the BS energy consumption by assigning the Tx(Transmission) power efficiently.
    Firstly the SINR of the user is compared with pre-specified SINR threshold value
    and if found greater Tx Power has modified accordingly. Thereupon resource is
    allocated, according to breathing pattern i.e. IoT devices are arranged in increasing
    (inhaling)/decreasing (exhaling) order on the basis required Tx Power and then
    mapped to resource block. In addition to this if available resources are less
    as compare to required, the user/device with a heavy request and highest Tx power
    was blocked. Apart from this transmission power is reduced if SINR of device is
    greater than the threshold value, which in turn improves the co-channel interference.
    Authors found that overall energy consumption of BS reduced and throughput is
    improved using the proposed approach. Further Samie et al. [113] enlighten the
    issue of underutilization of bandwidth of gateway. As IoT device have limited
    computation capability thus it is offloaded to the edge nodes i.e. gateway. However,
    due to limited bandwidth and diverse offloading levels, gateway bandwidth resource
    remain underutilized. Hence authors developed an algorithm that allocates or take
    away bandwidth from a device depending on its battery level. As a result, they
    found that battery life extended by 1.5 hour max and bandwidth utilization improved
    by 40%. Ejaz and Ibnkahla [114] proposed a framework for C-5GN. In the proposed
    framework, multiband sensing approach is used such that sensing is done in shared
    mode where each node is required to sense equal and reduced number of channels,
    thus reduced energy consumption. Although it is assured that all channels get
    processed once at least by a node. Apart from this, a game based CLRS (Cross Layer
    Reconfiguration) scheme is used to satisfy the diverse QoS requirement (latency,
    data rate, etc.) for each node. Hence, authors observed that the proposed technique
    reduced energy consumed during spectrum sensing and QoS is offered economically.
    Pang et al. [115] proposed a complete contention resolution approach based on
    the principle of context-aware and dynamic allocation of resource (CADRA). Overload
    scenario is first detected by analyzing the no of nonempty preambles. If detected,
    CADRA is called. This works in two phases firstly it determines the estimated
    number of RACH attempts by observing the preambles received successfully and empty
    preambles. After that in the second phase resource allocation is done. As a result,
    authors observed that throughput increased with moderate packet delay. Jang et
    al. [116] proposed Non orthogonal resource allocation collaborated with spatial
    group resource allocation scheme (SGRA). SGRA divides the cell into spatial groups.
    After dividing the cell region, it detects the preambles transmitted from the
    user in a certain spatial group by zadoff-chu sequence (which is shifted by spatial
    group number). Once the preambles utilized by a spatial group was determined using
    the ordered time delay metric, subgroups were formed. Authors found that using
    the proposed approach the probability of success of random access has increased
    a lot. Further, Morvari and Ghasemi [117] proposed a resource allocation scheme
    that works in two stage by efficacious use of resource available in UL. During
    the first phase, users are required to pass the access class bearing test. If
    a user manages to pass only then permitted to select the preamble (PA) and use
    physical uplink shared channel opportunity else has to select the special PA.
    Finally, in the second stage the secondary users are allowed to take access class
    bearing test again if passed allowed to request for UL shared channel. Hence it
    is inferred that the number of request that can be handled with proposed technique
    whilst dropping the wastage that occurs due to the collision of PA’s. Another
    extended RA scheme with spatial group resource allocation is proposed in [118].
    This scheme reuses the allocated preamble if the distance between the two nodes
    belonging to a different spatial group is greater than pre-specified minimum distance.
    In addition to this, access delay is also reduced. The proposed approach will
    utilize the unused bandwidth. Beside this collision probability is also tapered
    by using distinct UL resources for transmission. As interference is also a prevalent
    challenge for IoT device communication. Taking into consideration Iqbal et al.
    [119] proposed a constraint specific approach to improve the performance of IoT
    networks For solving the RA problem authors have used backtracking search algorithm
    named Soft-GORA.Where firstly channel is selected with minimum cost for tentative
    allocation to link, at the top in the ordered list and then checked against hard
    constraint. If it couldn’t satisfy the constraint, the allocated channel is removed
    and the next best option is opted. As a result, authors relaxing few constraints
    observed that throughput has improved and delay is reduced. Li et al. [120] proposed
    an architecture using edge computing further, they proposed a scheme to jointly
    control admission of new packet and allocation of resource together with power
    control. For this, the resource management controller at fog node uses three information
    i.e. service, state of the queue, CSI. Using the proposed schemes authors found
    that tradeoff is achieved between throughput and delay. Zhang et al. [121] proposed
    a joint optimize framework for the selection and allocation of resource among
    fog nodes (FN), data service subscribers (DSS) & data service operators.(DSO)
    They have developed a stakelberg game algorithm, here DSO provides the computing
    resources (CR) to DSS and if they require more CRB’s(Computing Resource Block)
    DSS competes for them. For this, another matching game algorithm is developed.
    As a result it was found that the system achieves high performance and optimally
    utilizes their resources. Further, cognitive 5G network (C-5GN) is expected to
    play a vital role in IoT success, Angelakis et al. [122] developed two algorithms
    RAND-INT and Average-cost allocation, to optimally allocate resources for services.
    These algorithms reduced the total cost of resource utilization and activation
    of interface. Where RAND-INT algorithm normalizes the demands to get an order
    in which resource is to be allocated. Henceforth the heaviest demand is served
    first by comparing the utilization cost of interfaces, thereby other demands are
    served either by splitting or by not splitting among two or more interfaces. Whereas
    the second algorithm assigns, the resource by averaging the total cost incurred.
    Authors have studied the impact of the activation cost on the services’ splits
    and distribution among the interfaces. As a result, they found that for random
    service with high demand, interface total cost increases linearly with respect
    to the number of services. Hence above discussed technique proves that resource
    technique can enhance communication, connectivity and collaboration of IoT devices.
    The chief objective of resource allocation technique is to minimize the power
    consumption per node, BER, Delay and maximize the throughput and network utilization.
    The above discussed techniques are summarized in Table 6. TABLE 6 Efficient Resource
    Allocation Techniques for IoT SECTION VI. Energy Consumption in Lifecycle of IoT
    Devices Sensing device act as the backbone for IoT applications. Different sensors
    are deployed massively to develop a ubiquitous sensed environment, to offer diverse
    monitoring and control services. Indeed to avoid service interruptions of critical
    applications sensing device must operate permissibly for a long time. However,
    as most of the IoT devices are powered by constrained energy source hence device
    lifetime longevity is a critical issue. Therefore the device must be monitored
    precisely for optimal utilization. In this context, the trend of energy consumption
    during different states of the sensor is studied in [123]. There are five modes
    among which sensor switches- Mode I: Wake up from Sleep mode, Mode II: After Sleep
    mode. Mode III: Sensing, Mode IV: Processing, Mode V: Transmission. Hussain [123]
    studied different case studies to see the trend of energy consumption during different
    modes. As a conclusion of various trends (Fig. 16), it was found that during Processing-Phase
    energy consumption was least whereas, for Sensing Phase, node consumes the highest
    power as compare to Transmission Phase. However, energy consumption during Transmission
    phase depends on the application. For example, consider the applications like
    Humidity/thermal measurement the power consumption during the wake-up and in getting
    ready for sensing phase is more as compare to other applications like temperature
    sensing which require less power for the same. Duty Cycle is the other metric
    that affects the energy consumption in the sensor node. As the duty cycle increases,
    energy consumption increases consequently lifetime of the node decreases. There
    are various factors that affect the lifetime of an IoT device such as duty cycle,
    the amount of data to be communicated, processing time other factors like aging,
    self-discharge and temperature [124]. Hence various energy efficiency techniques
    have been proposed in the literature to improve the lifetime of an IoT device
    and hence network lifetime. In the next section the recently proposed energy efficiency
    techniques are discussed in detail. FIGURE 16. Energy consumption during the lifecycle
    of IoT device [123]. Show All A. Energy Efficient Techniques for Green Communication
    The energy budget affects the sensor node processing time, quality of measurement
    and amount of data it can transmit, thus energy efficiency techniques can a play
    crucial role to improve QoE. Rault et al. [125] classified the energy efficiency
    techniques classified into five categories of radio optimization, data reduction,
    sleep/wakeup schemes, energy efficient routing and battery repletion. Where radio
    optimization techniques would optimize modulation schemes, transmission power,
    and antenna direction on the other hand data reduction reduces the data transmitted.
    Furthermore Sleep/Wake-up adaptively switches the node to sleep or active mode
    to save energy. Other two techniques, energy efficient routing, and battery repletion
    works on routing efficiency and ways of harvesting energy or finding ways to charge
    battery automation, respectively. (Fig. 17, discusses briefly the impact of different
    techniques). In this section, the existing literature on energy efficiency techniques
    is discussed. FIGURE 17. Classification of energy efficiency techniques for IoT.
    Show All 1) Sleep/Wakeup Techniques Khodr et al. [126] enlighten that though the
    duty cycling technique could reduce power consumption but this will reduce network
    reactivity. Thus authors proposed a design of sensor based RF wake up technology.
    This design approach wakes the sensor only when the address decoder detects that
    whether a received signal address is of IoT device or not. Thereby omits the fake
    call wakeups hence reduced energy consumption. Perles et al. [127] did a case
    study on cultural heritage and proposed an architecture to improve the lifespan
    of sensor life up to 20 years using unlicensed LPWAN technologies LoRa &SigFox.
    In order to keep the energy consumption low, the proposed architecture wakes up
    the microcontroller whenever a new packet arrives. Apart from this, it uses a
    cluster management system, Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) which can deploy
    and un-deploy nodes as per demand i.e. nodes will be deployed if load increases
    and un-deployed if they are idle. 2) Cognitive Radio Techniques Further, Qureshi
    et al. [128] discussed cognitive radio approach where unlicensed users opportunistically
    access the unused spectrum holes that are not used by the licensed user. Hence
    to achieve good throughput, uninterrupted connectivity, and Reliable communication,
    for both licensed and unlicensed user the concept of the backup data channel (BDC)
    was introduced. Where if licensed user return than unlicensed user resumes its
    communication using BDC. Hence communication time between SUs for task completion
    will be reduced and thereby the energy consumption of CRAN’s will reduce and throughput
    will increase. Furthermore, Li et al. [129] proposed a 5G based framework where
    the central control unit act as both cloud and central data processor takes the
    sensed data from the physical world. In addition to this authors, fractionated
    the resource allocation into two sub problems of power and channel allotment in
    industrial Cyber physical IoT. These sub-problems are solved separately. For individual
    channel allotment, the energy efficiency is achieved using game theory and Dinkelbach’s
    algorithm. After this, the Hungarian method was used for channel allocation. Authors
    analyzed that IHM-VD could perform outstandingly. 3) Routing Techniques Further
    Yi et al. [130] proposed a topology control algorithm in which nodes discover
    their neighbors asymmetrically. For time synchronization multiple of two is taken
    as reference point. Authors observed that energy consumption got abridged due
    to curtailment in wakeup calls required to discover the neighboring node. Further,
    the utmost drawback of continuous sensing (i.e. nonselective monitoring) is unfiltered
    data that results in significant energy consumption of sensors. Basnayaka and
    Haas [131] proposed a physical layer modulation scheme RNM (random number modulation)
    that operates in two modes energy efficient and low latency. To switch between
    modes the constellation order and random bit generated by random generator were
    considered. Proposed approach compromise latency for energy efficiency, as the
    user was allowed to transmit the data block only when it matches with random sequence
    generated by a random number generator otherwise the user could not transmit the
    data. Shen et al. [132] proposed a clustering based protocol EECRP for IoT assisted
    by WSN to enhance the performance of the network. Firstly a cluster head is opted
    by comparing the energy of each node with pre-specified energy (threshold value)
    after this taking the distance from the centroid (energy based) of the network
    to the node is considered. This leads to uniform energy consumption in the network.
    After this for optimal result, the max distance value is broadcasted by BS to
    all the nodes, in order to avoid long distance communication. As a result, it
    has been found that overall energy consumption of the network is reduced in comparison
    to proprietary protocols. In extension to this, Tian et al. [133] have discussed,
    when to use network coding concept to reduce the energy consumption. Authors have
    proposed a network coding and power control based routing (NCPCR) protocol. Using
    this protocol intermediate node drops the duplicate packets and keep the relevant
    information in its buffer. Source node selects the path with the minimum distance
    to transmit the data packets. As a result the energy consumption is reduced as
    no of packets to be retransmitted is reduced and moreover, it opts for the shortest
    path also and in addition to this, it can handle scalability. 4) Data Reduction
    Technique Perera et al. [134] proposed a platform C-MOSDEN that performs sensing
    tasks collaboratively and in a selective manner i.e. adaptive sensing to reduce
    energy consumption. As sensing would require less computational efforts to drive
    knowledge from data generated. In addition to this, the storage cost will also
    be reduced. 5) Battery Repletion Technique Nan et al. [135] enlighten that offloading
    the traffic at fog layer or edge layer has led to increased carbon footprints,
    thus they have proposed an online algorithm LOTEC (Lyapunov optimization on time
    and energy cost). The proposed technique suggested using green power source i.e.
    solar energy and grid power as a standby power source. The discussed energy efficiency
    techniques are summarized in tabular form in Table 7. In this paper, two novel
    application based energy efficient approaches are proposed. For smart agriculture
    and Smart Healthcare. Where “ZTPA” -a hybrid approach, centered on two techniques
    “Sleep/wake up” and “Energy efficient routing” is proposed. E2AHMS is proposed
    for smart healthcare, which is a radio based approach. These two approaches with
    their proposed mathematical approach are discussed in detail in section VIII.
    TABLE 7 Energy Effeciency Techniques for IoT SECTION VII. Open Issues Ascertaining
    the vision of the NBIoT is not a tranquil task, owing to multiple challenges that
    are required to be addressed Although NBIoT offers significant features for LPWA
    applications, yet a number of critical issues remain unattended that seeks traction
    from the research community. The technical issues and challenges related to energy
    are discussed in this section. A. Non-Uniformity in Resources Allocation In the
    current scenario, resources are allocated on the basis of total available power,
    coverage range, and demanded applications. Due to non-uniformity in the requirement
    of resources, a non-uniformity in power consumption persists. This is a critical
    challenge that seeks redressal as there are no studies/algorithms/techniques available
    for uniform resource allocation in NBIoT. A unified platform is required for resource
    allocation so that applications can be handled adaptively in real time scenarios.
    B. Difficulty in Achieving the Desired Throughput The prime advantage of NBIoT
    enabled device is to make use of low power to operate. Therefore the power of
    the signal transmitted will be low. Beside this due to channel losses, fading
    & interference (Intra/Inter) SINR will drop drastically. Hence it would be quite
    difficult to achieve the desired throughput in all condition. Thus proper channel
    modeling, optimized algorithms/techniques required to be designed/developed to
    achieve desired throughput C. Inter-Channel Interference The allocation of frequency
    in in-band or standalone mode will not be synchronous among all the cells in the
    network. This results in interference among neighboring cells. Interference within
    the same cell also exists due to the deployment of small cells in the macro cell.
    These result in a fall in the SNR. This is a decisive challenge, especially for
    critical applications like acute healthcare applications, where noise could tamper
    biological readings. This may lead to the wrong detection and thereby wrong medication.
    Thus an efficient scheme is required to be developed to reduce interference and
    provide QoS to the users. D. Spectral Efficiency To achieve extended coverage,
    the concept of multiple repetitions is utilized. Undoubtedly this would improve
    the Tx Reliability but will lead to loss of spectral efficiency. Thus an efficient
    resource allocation scheme is required which could optimally decide the repetition
    factor. Furthermore, to maintain high channel capacity- device consumes more power,
    consequently reducing its lifetime. This open issue needs to be addressed because
    it would adversely affect the battery lifetime E. Latency Different types of latency
    can occur during NBIoT communication: a) UL/DL latency, b) synchronization latency,
    c) the latency associated with resource allocation, d) latency associated with
    packet synchronization. Though NBIoT applications are delay tolerant, yet latency
    needs to be kept below 10s, especially for real time applications such as health
    monitoring. Thus the theoretical computational model must be framed to improve
    the latency analysis. F. Synchronization With the Access Point Consider a scenario
    where utility meters are positioned close to each other. When all devices would
    send information to the cluster head, synchronization will be difficult for the
    access point as there would be interference between devices within its range.
    Besides this, other factors like the priority of a device, its residual power
    availability and channel conditions will also affect the synchronization process,
    raising its complexity. Hence this open issue needs to be addressed by providing
    techniques/algorithms for synchronization. G. Security The issue of security is
    very critical for NBIoT. As low power devices have limited resources, they are
    more vulnerable to security attacks. By exploiting the data integrity or tracking
    the traffic pattern, passive or active attack can befall at the perception layer.
    Besides, other security attacks such as the injection of false data by an intruder,
    transmission of interference signals, etc. can also occur. Thus continuous efforts
    must be put in by industry, academicians, and researchers to maintain the faith
    of users in using the services provided by the NBIoT application. H. Carbon Footprint
    Inflation The massive connectivity among millions of devices would generate an
    enormous amount of data. In order to draw an inference from the collected information,
    servers need to manage data through extensive computations. This will overburden
    the servers, resulting in rising in energy and subsequently raising carbon emissions.
    In addition, the factors such as manufacturing of billions of IoT devices, shipments
    of these devices, excess use of radio access network, etc. will also elevate the
    carbon footprint. Fig. 18 demonstrates the percentage of carbon emissions due
    to various such activities [136]. Collaboratively, these will have an adverse
    impact on pollution levels. Hence, the need for a generic architecture arises
    to achieve Green IoT, whilst assuring better QoS to all the users. FIGURE 18.
    Carbon footprint due to various activities. Show All I. E-Waste Management As
    technology improves, people started procuring additional electronic equipment’s
    like PDA’s, desktop computers, smart phones, and gadgets, though might not be
    required. The complex structure of these e-waste/WEEE (waste electrical and electronic
    equipment) makes it difficult to destroy. The condition will become even more
    severe in coming future when millions of sensors and battery operated IoT devices
    will have to be destroyed and replaced with new ones, either due to reformation
    in technology or lifetime expiry. Many countries like Japan, Taiwan, and U.S etc.
    are working on this hot burning issue since 2001. However, together with this
    research efforts are needed for the development of the green disposable electronic
    device. J. Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) Overhead In C-RAN the virtual centralized
    BBU (Base Band Unit) is used to reduce the OPEX, generated heat, and latency.
    Hence, instead of having BBU at each cell site with remote Radio head, they are
    repositioned in centralized manner in BBU home. In IoT, the users would be monitoring
    & controlling multiple devices remotely, this would overburden the existing network
    especially between the RRH and BBU Pool. Moreover, the different types of data
    i.e. real, non-real, social, sensitive, medical/health data, agriculture related
    data, etc. would collectively create an extensive overhead for CRAN. Pertaining
    to this, a huge number of processing units would be required to process the enormous
    IoT data. This, in turn, generates massive power requirement. Hence “prioritization
    of data” could be one of the solutions to deal with this open issue. K. Interface
    With Next Generation Like 5G Network The journey of IoT from virtual ideology
    to real time implementation has many milestones to achieve and one of those is
    interoperability among IoT devices. As we know that 5G operates on the very high
    frequency range like millimeter waves frequency, ranging from 28 to 32 GHz, whilst
    IoT devices operate at 2.2 GHz. Thus it’s a big challenge for the researchers
    to interface IoT with 5G Other than this, the high operating frequency in 5G networks
    escalates power consumption levels to achieve the data rate of the order of Gbps.
    In contrast to this IoT devices are highly power constrained thus operate at low
    power levels. This requires technological developments. Including this various
    other challenges such as [137] Cooperation among millions of devices, Heterogeneous
    subnet, Anonymous device configuration and Conflicts among semantics of devices
    exist. All these will collectively urge for research efforts before 5G specifications
    are standardized. L. MIMO/Massive MIMO Undoubtedly, Multiple Input Multiple Output
    (MIMO) technique provide a high data rate with high Reliability. In MIMO BS is
    acquainted with multiple antennas to improve the spectral & energy efficiency.
    Although, MIMO is an enabler for 5G, yet, it is difficult to employ MIMO in IoT.
    It is because, in the multi antenna scenario, information transmissions from the
    sensor nodes will require more processing during the synchronization phase. This
    results in more power consumption at the sensor end. Since the sensor nodes have
    limited battery capacity, adaptability of IoT devices in a MIMO environment is
    an open challenge that needs to be addressed. M. Channel State Information Collection
    Overhead The channel state assessment overhead intensifies linearly with a number
    of users. If the number of users grows beyond the threshold value then channel
    block could no longer support the assessment overhead within the narrow coherence
    time, especially for IoT applications. Moreover, the inaccurate channel estimation
    results in unreliable transmission. This uncertainty is due to the staleness of
    information after a certain time gap, due to the collision of pilot signals in
    UL. Pertaining to this, contention and interference would aggravate. As a result,
    more retransmissions are required which upraise the power consumption of IoT devices.
    Moreover, multiple verifications will contribute to more power consumption. SECTION
    VIII. Proposed Architecture Towards Green Communication Using NBIoT The world
    population is expected to grow up to 8.025 billion by 2030. Consequently, this
    growth will inflate the global food demand. Thus meeting the demands of the immense
    population will be a tough task. The varying climatic conditions, scarcity of
    water, etc. shall further aggravate the circumstances In addition to this, enhanced
    health assistance will also be required for projected population, which will be
    quite difficult to handle using existing infrastructure and services. Thus integration
    of IoT with Agriculture & Health sector can ensure a resourceful and healthy life
    for an individual. Despite, all this revolution that IoT is capable to bring in,
    the biggest stumbling block of its success is to provide energy efficient solution.
    As most of the IoT devices are constrained in term of energy. Hence this paper
    is proposing energy efficiency techniques for two prime applications: Smart Agriculture:
    Zonal Thermal Pattern Analysis and Smart Health: Energy Efficiency Adaptive Health
    Monitoring System.NBIoT is used for both the application as it offers favorable
    features like extended coverage with deep indoor penetration, long battery life,
    supports high density, require the low-cost device, and provide end to end security.
    Moreover, it would not require the deployment of new infrastructure as compared
    to proprietary technologies LoRa and SigFox, hence would offer a cost effective
    solution. A. Proposed Technique for Smart Agriculture: ZTPA 1) Case Study 1: Energy
    Efficient Agriculture Monitoring, Irrigation System for Green Communication The
    growing population and climate vagaries are forestalling that in future decades
    water resources would reduce eminently, especially for agriculture. Since agriculture
    practices require an ample amount of water, effective utilization of water is
    an obvious issue to be addressed. This section investigates an energy efficient
    technique for productive utilization of water. It has been put forth to overcome
    the disadvantages of conventional irrigation systems like wastage of water (due
    to percolation, evaporation), abbreviated crop yield. To economize the use of
    water in agriculture, IoT with Deep Learning could play a significant role. In
    the proposed scenario, soil moisture sensors are deployed in the farm field under
    consideration. Thereafter data aggregated from multiple sensors will be passed
    on to the BS using NBIoT and then to the NBIoT cloud. At the cloud, data (moisture)
    will be processed using Deep Learning and subsequently, the farm field will be
    adaptively divided into zones based on moisture level, as shown in Fig. 19 (for
    one iteration which is subjected to change in other iterations). Hereafter depending
    on the moisture levels i.e. moderate moisture level, high moisture level and least
    moisture level, zones will be irrigated. To accomplish this, the water pump is
    attached with smart NBIoT enabled water control device. This device would transmit
    the water in desired quantity and for the desired time in the zones. This scenario
    could be well understood by Fig. 19 where zone Z2 with dark pink color has the
    highest moisture, Z1 has the least moisture and Z3 has moderate moisture level.
    As Z2 has good moisture level so no water would be transmitted in that zone. Hence,
    sensor nodes in Z2 will enter idle state followed by the sleep state for a long
    period of time by exploiting eDRX in NBIoT. This will save water along with energy.
    In addition to this UL traffic will also be reduced, thereby reducing the congestion
    impact also. FIGURE 19. Proposed architecture for energy efficient precision agriculture
    using NBIoT–toward green communication. Show All There is another aspect to be
    considered while designing this scenario i.e. land orientation. Hence this use
    case study is divided into two sub problems: a: Uniform Land Surface When land
    has uniform orientation like in the plain area, there will be no water logging
    problem. Therefore, farm/agriculture land can be irrigated by classifying the
    moisture data as discussed previously. Thus watering of the field by the proposed
    pioneered way could avoid the wastage of water. Also in the plain area, the orientation
    of land is more or less uniform, thus the pattern of power consumption would not
    be much diverse. This can be depicted by thermal pattern analysis using drones
    and satellite captured thermal images. b: Non-Uniform Land Surface Another case
    is when agriculture land has non-uniform orientation like in hilly areas, which
    leads to the uneven power consumption of devices. As in some case, eNB will allocate
    the resource to the sensor via NBIoT using direct path whereas in some cases using
    an indirect path. In our proposed approach we have not only considered direct/indirect
    resource allocation but in addition to this, the overlap condition will also be
    considered, where one region overlaps with another region. As shown in Fig. 20
    regions R1 and R2, describes the overlap region. Here the sensor S3, S5, S9, S21,
    S14 suffers from Inter-Interference. FIGURE 20. Proposed architecture for energy
    efficient precision agriculture using NBIoT based on thermal pattern analysis
    (TPA). Show All Hence the power consumption pattern will be diverse for node present
    in this region and node present outside of this region which in turn would affect
    the network lifetime. In addition to this SNR will also get influenced by interference
    within inter-interference region. 2) Mathematical Analysis for Energy Efficient
    Smart Agriculture Sensor nodes SN 1 , SN 2 , SN 3 ,……., SN n are deployed in the
    field and as per proposed model, it is assumed CH of disjoint sets of sensors
    (CH1, CH2, and CH3) will communicate with the processing unit (PU). Further, this
    PU would communicate with BS. Assume that using NBIoT technology k PRB’s (physical
    resource blocks) are required. As the signal propagates from SN i to NBIoT node
    path loss (PL) will occur. PL will depend on the position of sensor. If the sensor
    is placed under the soil or underground, then soil would absorb the signal and
    hence leads to path loss which can be evaluated as follows P ∗ C = P real C −j(
    P dipolarloss + σ 2πf P D ) (3) View Source Here P ∗ C specifies the complex-permittivity
    (cp), P real C denotes the real part of cp, P dipolarloss is due to Relaxation
    and P D specifies the relative dielectric-permittivity [138], [139]. The permittivity
    of soil can be affected importantly by parameters like water content, frequency
    of signal, soil composition and soil conductivity. Hence it is difficult to measure
    the soil permittivity accurately. Path loss can be calculated using equation (4)
    where T p is Transmission power, T g Transmission gain, R g receiver gain, PL
    fs is path loss due to free space propagation of signal and PL M is path loss
    due to medium, α is path loss between NBIoT node and eNB.1 PL= T p + T g + R g
    + PL fs − PL M +α (4) View Source Further path loss due to medium can be evaluated
    as follows [139] PL M = WD s + TL s (5) View Source Where WD s is path loss due
    to difference in wavelength of signal in soil in comparison of free space and
    TL s is transmission loss. If the sensor is placed above the surface (of ground),
    then plants would act as scatterers and thereby the path loss can be evaluated
    using equation (6) PL(d)=PL( d 0 )+10mlog( d d 0 )+ OH T i +α (6) View Source
    Here OH T i represent the obstacle height at time iε {1, 2, 3}, where i=1 specifies
    the phase, when seeds are just sawn, so no plant would be there at that time so
    no obstacle. Likewise for i=2 , specifies that plant has started budding up so
    it will have certain height. Similarly for i=3 specifies, plant has fully grown
    to its full height. Thus corresponding to height of plant, obstacle path loss
    parameter would increase. Here d 0 specifies the reference distance between sensing
    node and NBIoT node (Refer Fig. 20.). Here α specifies the path loss between NBIoT
    node and eNB. Hence the SINR of the sensing node can be expressed as SINR= S T
    G k N+ I T (7) View Source Where N is thermal noise, I T total interference, S
    T represents the transmitted signal power and G k is the channel gain between
    sensor node k and NBIoT node. We then express the total interference as I T =
    I interzone + I intrazone + I Soilreflectivity (8) View Source Interference that
    occurs within zone, between zones and also due to soil reflectivity. Further channel
    capacity (C) can be evaluated based on Shannon theorem as follows C= Blog 2 (1+
    S k G k N+ I T ) (9) View Source Based on these above formulations we conclude
    that capacity of a sensor deployed in the agricultural area will be adversely
    affected by the interference generated by the adjacent sensor nodes, scatterers,
    etc. a: Energy Consumption Evaluation For electing cluster head out of n sensor
    node for each disjoint set of sensing nodes. Each node power level is to be determined
    and one with highest power level is selected. Power level get deteriorates due
    to energy dissipation. Hence we first evaluate the total energy consumed due to
    various factors for each node (The energy model used here is given [140].) E C
    Total =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching
    (10) View Source Where energy consumption during sensing could be evaluated using
    equation (11) EC Sensing = EC Sample ∗n (11) View Source Here EC Sample specifies
    the energy consumption during sampling of each sample, n represents the no of
    samples. Similarly, energy consumption during transmission ( EC Transmission )
    depends on supply voltage S v , current I and time T required for transmission
    EC Transmission = S v ∗I∗T (12) View Source Energy consumed during switching from
    active to sleep state [141] EC Switching = T Swt ∗( PC Active + PC Sleep )/2 (13)
    View Source Hence total energy consumption can be evaluated (using eq. 10) and
    using Relation E= P*T, power levels can be evaluated for each node, where T will
    include time for switching, sleeping, active, sensing, and processing. Hence CH
    can be selected for by comparing the power of all the nodes. Here another aspect
    must also be included that is if the node has acted as CH earlier also then. Hence
    we evaluate the energy consumption when node act as CH, ( EC CH ) . This will
    depend on length of message L MSG and energy consumed by transmitter if sending
    the message to processing point (PP) or energy consumed when receiver receives
    data by PP [142]. EC CH = L MSG ∗ EC TX/RX ∗ D PP (14) View Source Hence total
    energy consumption equation if node acted as CH could be rewritten as E C Total
    =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching + EC
    CH (15) View Source Finally energy efficiency EE can be evaluated as ratio of
    total energy consumed ,EC TOTAL and energy of sensor at time of deployment ,E
    TOTAL EE= EC TOTAL / E TOTAL (16) View Source Hence using the proposed approach
    energy efficiency can be improved as EC TOTAL will be reduced by exploiting the
    eDRX of sensing nodes. B. Proposed Technique for Smart Health: E2AHMS 1) Case
    Study: Energy Efficient Health Monitoring System for Green Communication IoT provides
    a big platform to solve medical issues, in real time scenario. Integration of
    IoT with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is gaining much of the momentum and
    currently being used for health monitoring of soldiers at battlefields, patients
    in hospitals, elderly people who could not visit hospitals very often, etc. The
    performance of WBAN (i.e. reliability, delay, power efficiency) chiefly depends
    on the physical and medium access control layer. Moreover, as most of the IoT-BAN
    devices are battery operated, thus power optimization will greatly impact their
    lifetime and performance. In this context, this paper is proposing a novel approach
    namely “Energy Efficient Adaptive Health Monitoring System” E2AHMS. This approach
    will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively distributing the transmission
    power required to monitor the patient. In our proposed Health Monitoring system
    three prospective conditions have been considered Stable, Mono-Stable, Relatively
    mobile (Fig. 21). FIGURE 21. Proposed health monitoring system using NBIoT–toward
    green communication. Show All Case B.1: Stable: When a patient lying on the bed
    i.e. stationary condition Case B.2: Mono-Stable: When a patient is sitting or
    standing. Case B.3: Relatively mobile: When a patient will be moving either by
    walking or using a wheelchair. Our proposed approach E2AHMS can not only be used
    for patients who require continuous monitoring, but also for health monitoring
    of person who are fit but wants to keep track of their health to prevent themselves
    from severe disease. As in both the cases, network life time will play a vital
    role, which can be increased or improved by using proposed optimized energy efficient
    algorithm. E2AHMS will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively using
    the transmission , power required during different postural mobility (considered
    before). To understand this it is required to first understand the difference
    in energy requirement during different cases under consideration. CASE B.1 (STABLE):
    While sleeping it is very likely that the sensors will have LOS communication.
    Hence, Body Area Network will be in stable state. Thus power required for transmission
    would be least and hence energy required. As path loss would be minimum between
    sensing nodes and NBIoT coordinator node. Thus energy consumed during sleeping
    state E c_s_st i can be given by summation of energy consumption due to factors
    such as: due to switching from one state to another (On, Off, sleep, idle, Active,
    idle) E st_tr i , due to circuit of sensing device E Crkt i , energy consumption
    due to processing of signals E Proc i , energy consumption due to transmission
    of signal E Trans i , due to acting as relay/connecting node for other sensors
    E connecting_node i and due to various delays (queuing, propagation, transmission)
    E Delays i . E c_s_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i (17) View Source CASE B.2 (MONO-STABLE STATE): In this case the
    patient could be in a sitting posture or moving his arms or having food. Hence
    LOS would not be there between sensing nodes. It is very likely that obstacles
    might interfere with the path of signal transmission thus shadowing would lead
    to multipath loss and hence energy consumption will be more during this posture.
    Energy consumption during mono-stable state E c_ms_st i , can be evaluated by
    equation (18) E c_ms_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i + E obst i (18) View Source Here E obst i specifies the energy
    consumed due to obstacles/shadowing/multipath effect. CASE B.3 (RELATIVELY MOBILE):
    In this state, the patient will be walking or moving with the help of wheel chair
    or might be doing some routine activities. Therefore it is more likely that NLOS
    transmission will occur due to various reasons such as obstacles in the surrounding,
    links between sensors would change rapidly due to body movement, etc. Hence more
    loss of information and thereby more energy consumption. Energy consumption during
    mobile state could be given by equation 19. E c_m_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i
    + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connectin_node i + E Delays i +n. E obst i + E relink
    i (19) View Source Here E relink i denotes the energy consumed due to Relinking
    between sensor nodes and gateway. Thus, it is clear from the above discussion
    that due to multipath effect and different channel conditions, different postural
    movement leads to different energy consumption. Therefore in proposed technique
    E2AHMS, depending on postural movement level transmission power will be used adaptively
    which can be determined using graph theory. Whereas conventionally data was transmitted
    with equal power without considering LOS communication is possible or not and
    also channel conditions are good or not. Hence our proposed approach will be an
    energy efficient approach for Health monitoring application. This proposed approach
    is also supported by mathematical formulation. 2) Mathematical Formulation Multiple
    sensors are positioned on the human body I={i1,i2,i3….,in} (20) View Source Here
    each sensor has a coordinate point i1=( x 1 , y 1 ) i2=( x 2 , y 2 ) (21.1) (21.2)
    View Source Path Loss Analysis As the signal propagates through WBAN this gets
    attenuated due to multiple factors such as reflection, diffraction, refraction,
    fading, etc. To analyze path loss in on-body WBAN, IEEE P802.15, 2009 [143] has
    given a path loss model. Using the same as a reference, path loss can be evaluated
    during different postural mobility. Case B.1 (Stable/Sleeping State): PL dB =
    PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 + S dB (22) View Source Here d 0 is reference the distance
    from NBIoT coordinator. S dB , is shadowing factor added to it due to movement
    of body parts. However, in the sleeping state, it would be negligible. Case B.2
    (Mono-Stable/Sitting State): During this state, signal could fade due to various
    obstacle such as table while having food/medicine, legs under the chair or below
    the table. Moreover due to the movement of body parts effect of shadowing would
    be high. Hence path loss would be more in comparison to the sleeping state. PL
    dB = PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +( S dB + F 1 + F 2 ) (23) View Source Here F 1
    + F 2 , is addition PL due to factors such as obstacles, interference, surroundings
    Case B.3 (Mobile State): During this state person would be moving from one place
    to another thus link with access point could change very quickly (From one floor
    to another, one room to another, walking, etc.). The signal would attenuate n
    times more in relative mobile state than Sitting/Mono-Stable state. PL dB = PL
    d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +n( S dB + F 1 + F 2 + F 3 ) (24) View Source Here F 3
    specifies an additional factor of multipath propagation of signal. As PL is difference
    of transmitted power and received power PL= P Tx − P RX (25) View Source Thus
    received power during different case studies can be evaluated as follows: Case
    B.1: P S_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL S_ST dB (26.1) View Source Case B.2: P MS_ST Rx
    (dB)= P Tx − PL MS_ST dB (26.2) View Source Case B.3: P M_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL
    M_ST dB (26.3) View Source In the conventional system, same transmission power
    is used for all the cases whether required or not, but in the proposed technique
    E2AHMS transmission power would be used adaptively depending on postural mobility.
    Hence power will be used in an optimized way. SNR can be evaluated for different
    considered case studies using received power SNR cas e i = RecivedSignal_power
    P cas e i Rx Noise_Power (27) View Source Thereby channel capacity ( C cas e i
    ) for considered cases {i=B.1, B.2, B.3} using Shannon theorem could be evaluated
    for considered case studies as C cas e i =B(1+ SNR cas e i ) (28) View Source
    Hence Energy efficiency can be evaluated using equation EE cas e i = Channe l
    cas e i P cas e i Tx ∗100% (29) View Source It is clear from the above equation
    the high mobility would result in more energy consumption. Hence using the proposed
    technique power will be saved and thereby could enhance the battery lifetime.
    Thus an energy efficient solution. Using the same theme of the proposed approach
    real time hardware implementation is done which is discussed in next section.
    C. Real Time Hardware Implementation for Proposed Work 1) Hardware System Model
    Fig. 22 gives an overview of proposed approach real time implementation. Here
    two axis accelerometer sensors and a pulse sensor is used for real time analysis.
    To determine the patient postural mobility accelerometer sensors are placed on
    his right hand and right leg. Apart from this a pulse sensor is used to measure
    the pulse rate of the patient. Further, in order to send the health information
    to eNB in energy efficient way. Our proposed approach will differentiate between
    different postural (Fig. 22 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)) using edge computing. Such
    that energy is utilized in an efficiently way by using an optimal amount of transmission
    power of device as suggested in proposed approach to transmit information to eNB.
    Hereafter the health information is forwarded to the centralized cloud and then
    to application server and finally to doctor, who tracks the record of patient,
    to avoid unwanted situation. Finally, doctor would prescribe some medicine if
    required otherwise the message will be sent to user that he is fine. FIGURE 22.
    Real time health monitoring system model. Show All 2) Hardware Requirement 3)
    Interface 4) Implementation The first step is to setup the connections of all
    the desired sensors with Arduino Uno. Thereafter the Arduino Uno is connected
    to development system that has integrated development environment (IDE) with USB.
    Once the setup is done the code developed for considered case (stable, mono stable
    and walking) is uploaded to Arduino Uno. Hereafter the data is collected related
    to different postural mobility of person and processed by comparing against the
    threshold value to determine the postural mobility level. Fig. 24, shows the plot
    of variation in amplitude due to movement of hand and leg (specifically) in developed
    code. Once the movement is determined thereafter the health information like pulse
    rate, etc. is sent via NBIoT with required transmitted power to eNB. Hereafter
    the health information is processed and corresponding actions are than advised
    to the patients. FIGURE 23. Interface of real time health monitoring setup. Show
    All FIGURE 24. Screenshot of plot with arduino IDE. Show All 5) Performance Analysis
    As per our proposed architecture, we have done the performance analysis on the
    basis of a real-time hardware implementation for healthcare monitoring system
    with all possible case studies. We have deployed sensors on body parts of patients
    to fetch the information regarding postural mobility as shown in Fig 22. (a),
    (b), (c), (d), (e). All the data regarding different postural movements saved
    in the database, which is then processed and compared at the same time. The postural
    movement is observed for 500 sec from 926sec to 1426 sec (Fig 25 describes the
    variation of amplitude due to different postural movement.) FIGURE 25. A Plot
    of variation in amplitude vs Time corresponding to Hand and foot movement during
    different postural mobility, to differentiate between transmission-power to be
    used (Here blue and Red depicts hand movement whereas Green and orange depicts
    the leg movement). Show All Approximately for 94 sec the person has kept his body
    in sleeping condition as shown in Fig. 22 (a),(b), it has been observed that during
    this period, a variation of the different sensor output is low and smooth, output
    amplitude is far below as compared to a threshold value. Hereafter the person
    changed his posture to sitting posture Fig. 22(c) and maintained it for 80 sec.
    For this posture, it was observed that variation is high in comparison to sleeping
    posture, but get stable after a certain time. Hereafter person changed his posture
    from sitting to standing (Fig. 22(d), (e)) and did some movement of hand and leg.
    It can be easily seen that variation is high and fluctuating, some irregular spikes
    appeared in the process. On the basis of performance analysis, we have observed
    that power optimization in all these case studies is very important and because
    this real time analysis aligns with our proposed approach E2AHMS. Hence power
    can be optimized with fair resource allocation to achieve the better quality of
    service is possible through our proposed approach. Conclusion IoT is reforming
    technical industry. This reformation will aid in struggling with global challenges
    that are budding due to depletion of natural resources, inflated food demand,
    scarcity of water, etc. Where on one hand IoT is giving hope for resourceful life
    but on other hand, it will play a crucial role in inflating carbon footprint.
    Hence solutions must be given to reduce carbon emission. In this study recent
    work related to energy efficiency techniques has been surveyed and discussed.
    In contribution toward green-IoT, two novel energy efficient approaches have been
    proposed - ZTPA for smart agriculture and E2AHMS for smart healthcare using NBIoT.
    NBIoT is a new licensed radio technology that guarantees to provide a cost effective,
    reliable, and low power solution. It can coexist with the existing LTE cellular
    networks therefore no new infrastructure is required to be setup from scratch,
    hence installation cost is low. This paper provides a detailed technical view
    of NBIoT and its state-of-the-art. To spur advance research and speed up the extensive
    use of the NBIoT systems the research challenges and open issues of NBIoT are
    also discussed. Appendix A list of current research projects based on IoT is presented

    \ (WSNs) represent one of the most promising technologies for\nprecision farming.\
    \ Over the next few years, a signiﬁcant increase in the use of such systems\n\
    on commercial farms is expected. WSNs present a number of problems, regarding\
    \ scalability,\ninteroperability, communications, connectivity with databases\
    \ and data processing. Different Internet\nof Things middleware is appearing to\
    \ overcome these challenges. This paper checks whether one\nof these middleware,\
    \ FIWARE, is suitable for the development of agricultural applications. To the\n\
    authors’ knowledge, there are no works that show how to use FIWARE in precision\
    \ agriculture\nand study its appropriateness, its scalability and its efﬁciency\
    \ for this kind of applications. To do\nthis, a testbed has been designed and\
    \ implemented to simulate different deployments and load\nconditions. The testbed\
    \ is a typical FIWARE application, complete, yet simple and comprehensible\nenough\
    \ to show the main features and components of FIWARE, as well as the complexity\
    \ of using\nthis technology. Although the testbed has been deployed in a laboratory\
    \ environment, its design is\nbased on the analysis of an Internet of Things use\
    \ case scenario in the domain of precision agriculture.\nKeywords: precision agriculture;\
    \ wireless sensor networks; Internet of Things; FIWARE\n1. Introduction\nThe purpose\
    \ of precision agriculture (PA) is to increase farm productivity by capturing\
    \ and\ninterpreting data concerning the climate, weather, terrain, water quality\
    \ and crop status. In recent\nyears, farmers have begun using information systems\
    \ to improve crop management and increase\nproductivity. These systems include\
    \ sensors for monitoring the crops and for tracing the products\nfrom crops to\
    \ shelves. As a result, agriculture is becoming a data-intensive industry. In\
    \ this sense,\nprecision agriculture poses many of the same problems as the other\
    \ areas where IoT is being developed\n(industry 4.0, logistics, smart grids, smart\
    \ cities, etc.), as well as others of its own domain, such as\nthose described\
    \ in [1,2]: (1) organization and operation of the farm, (2) traceability of products,\n\
    (3) environmental requirements, (4) decision support to increase farm performance,\
    \ (5) synchronization\nbetween sensors and agricultural machinery, (6) the automation\
    \ of agricultural tasks, etc.\nThe biggest challenge for PA is capturing enough\
    \ high-quality data to make the right decisions.\nIn open spaces, most of the\
    \ data comes from aerial photographs taken by satellites and aircraft and\nfrom\
    \ sensors and cameras mounted on agricultural machinery and, in recent times,\
    \ even drones are\nbeing used. Precision agriculture calls for a wide array of\
    \ technologies to capture data, contextualise\nthem in time and space, statistically\
    \ characterise them, save and merge them and ﬁnally analyse them\nfor decision-making\
    \ purposes. In this scenario, data processing is often based on statistical techniques\n\
    and artiﬁcial vision where no particular attention is paid to latency.\nSensors\

    \ 2016, 16, 1979\n2 of 22\nThe authors’ research group has quite a lot of experience\
    \ in wireless sensor networks [3], one\nof the essential components of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) [4]. In the agricultural sector we have\nworked on improving\
    \ crop and irrigation systems owing to their importance in the semiarid region\
    \ of\nMurcia (Spain). Reference [5] presents a novel design for a wireless sensor\
    \ node designed for precision\nhorticulture applications allowing for the use\
    \ of precision agriculture instruments. This sensor was\nintegrated into the network\
    \ of experimental sensors of an ecological horticulture undertaking in the\nRegion\
    \ of Murcia [6], validated in real operating conditions [7] and compared with\
    \ other studies [8].\nCurrently, in situ wireless sensor networks (WSN) are not\
    \ widespread due to the high price of\nthe sensors and the problem of powering\
    \ them in places where there are no electrical lines. In the\nabsence of external\
    \ power sources from which sensor can harvest energy, sensor activity (capturing\
    \ and\ntransmitting data) must be kept to a minimum However, these limitations\
    \ may change signiﬁcantly in\ncoming years thanks to advances in the design of\
    \ power systems and batteries and price reductions\nresulting from the mass production\
    \ of miniaturised sensors. It is therefore possible to imagine a\nscenario in\
    \ which many sensors measure parameters related to soil (moisture and nutrient\
    \ levels),\nwater (salinity) and plants (water stress) are deployed. Capturing,\
    \ transmitting, storing and processing\nthis volume of information collected by\
    \ the WSN presents a number of challenges, especially regarding\nintegration technologies,\
    \ communications, databases and computing. Fortunately there are a number\nof\
    \ middleware platforms capable of doing most of the work although only some of\
    \ these are geared\nfor the IoT. One such middleware technology is called FIWARE\
    \ [9] whose architecture is still being\nimplemented and whose development is\
    \ being closely monitored by the authors’ research group [10].\nFIWARE is the\
    \ technology promoted by the European Commission to make possible the IoT in the\n\
    context of the Future Internet [11] in collaboration with the information and\
    \ communication technology\nindustry. FIWARE is a powerful and complex technology,\
    \ but to the authors’ knowledge, there are not\nworks that show how to use this\
    \ technology in precision agriculture and study its appropriateness,\nits scalability\
    \ and its efﬁciency for this kind of applications.\nThe aims of this paper are\
    \ to provide such comprehensible use case, and to check whether\nFIWARE can be\
    \ scaled to the same extent as agricultural applications. The answers are important\n\
    because the selection of a particular platform implies a long-term commitment.\
    \ We have created a\ntestbed to achieve this goal.\nThe rest of this paper is\
    \ structured as follows: Section 2 presents the state of the art. Section 3\n\
    provides an overview of the FIWARE platform. The testbed design featured in Section\
    \ 4 is derived\nfrom an IoT use case scenario that applies the FIWARE concepts\
    \ and components discussed in Section 3.\nSection 4 also describes the test plan\
    \ designed to assess the FIWARE platform. Section 5 shows the\nresults obtained.\
    \ Lastly, Section 6 contains the conclusions drawn from the results and future\
    \ work\nrelated to this research.\n2. State of the Art\nThe Internet of Things\
    \ is the vision of a set of technologies, systems and design principles for\n\
    connecting things, based on the physical environment, via the Internet. As machine\
    \ to machine\ncommunication is increasing, a new category of applications is emerging\
    \ that demands evolutionary\nchanges in network infrastructure. The original Internet\
    \ architecture was not conceived to support\ncommunications between billions of\
    \ devices such as sensors with very limited computational resources.\nThat is\
    \ why we must embark upon the path towards the Future Internet [11] through research\
    \ and the\ndevelopment of intelligent algorithms, new network paradigms and new\
    \ services. Along this path we\nwill need to overcome major hurdles [12,13] such\
    \ as those posed by the things themselves (devices),\ncommunications between things,\
    \ between things and the global Internet and the management,\nidentiﬁcation and\
    \ modelling of a massive number of changing and virtually unlimited things.\n\
    Sensors 2016, 16, 1979\n3 of 22\n2.1. Devices\nIn the future there will be an\
    \ even greater deal of heterogeneity in devices connected to the\nIoT, both intelligent\
    \ as well as inert (e.g., simply labelled as Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation, RFID).\n\
    Moreover, the vast majority of smart devices lack the computing resources needed\
    \ to implement\nthe IP protocol stack and this situation will continue in the\
    \ future for many of the devices used in\nIoT applications [14]. This is the case\
    \ of WSNs which consist of devices designed to be deployed in\nlarge numbers and\
    \ multiple environments, including remote regions. For these reasons, maximising\n\
    lifetime, power consumption and cost of deployment are some of the challenges\
    \ that these networks\npresent. Speciﬁcally, energy is the scarcest resource of\
    \ WSN nodes and is a decisive factor in the useful\nlife of the network. Thus,\
    \ energy supply for devices integrated in WSN will increasingly depend on\ndifferent\
    \ energy harvesting technologies (solar, thermal, wind, etc.) and on new battery\
    \ miniaturization\nand ultra capacitor technologies [15–17]. As these technologies\
    \ mature, WSN will be applicable in\na wide range of scenarios that require long-life\
    \ batteries. Regarding cost, according to an IDTechEx\nforecast [18], the average\
    \ price per node will drop from $9 per piece in 2011 to $5 per piece in 2021.\n\
    Communications merit a separate section.\n2.2. Communications\nThe challenge of\
    \ heterogeneity is also present in communications. The basic infrastructure of\
    \ the\nIoT is supported by wired and wireless technologies. The biggest challenges\
    \ are found in wireless\ntechnologies which are classiﬁed as:\n•\nShort range\
    \ (including Personal Area Networks (PAN), Local Area Networks (LAN) and wireless\n\
    Metropolitan Area Networks(MAN)) mesh networks, RFID, Wi-Fi, etc;\n•\nLong range\
    \ (via cellular networks, wireless Wide Area Networks (WAN) and pseudo-long-range):\n\
    Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), combination of Worldwide Interoperability\
    \ for\nMicrowave Access and Code division multiple access (WiMax CDMA), Wideband\
    \ Code Division\nMultiple Access (WCDMA) and other networks, and satellite communication.\n\
    Another challenge is the unknown and dynamic topology of WSN due to the variable\
    \ number of\ndevices connected at any given time. WSN typically use short-range\
    \ wireless mesh networks as their\nfundamental communication technique (Zigbee\
    \ [19], 6LowPAN [20], etc.). This being a low power,\nlow range radio system,\
    \ in current WSN nodes the IEEE 802.15.4 [21] standard is most commonly used.\n\
    Connections on the edge of the network are low-ﬁdelity, low speed and data is\
    \ often lost. In the case\nof global Internet communications, some devices serve\
    \ as gateways, implement the IP protocol stack\nand use long-range cellular networks.\
    \ Most devices use the above-mentioned energy optimisation\nprotocols (non-IP)\
    \ (e.g., Zigbee) and only communicate within their local network.\nFrom these\
    \ characteristics, it follows that the data needs of the Internet of Things are\
    \ completely\ndifferent from the current Internet. In the IoT, most communications\
    \ will be brief asymmetrical\nmachine to machine exchanges with many more data\
    \ ﬂowing in one direction (i.e., from the sensor to\nthe server) than the other.\
    \ In most cases, the loss of individual messages is tolerable. Lastly and most\n\
    importantly, traditional peer-to-peer IP exchanges block much of the potential\
    \ wealth of the Internet\nof Things. Large data streams will be ﬂowing, many of\
    \ which will be unknown and unplanned.\nOnly a publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ is capable of taking advantage of this knowledge by discovering\ninteresting\
    \ relationships and data ﬂows. And only a publish/subscribe network can scale\
    \ to the\nenormous size of the Internet of Things [14].\n2.3. Management and Identiﬁcation\
    \ of Devices\nIdentifying things presents a particular challenge. Today devices\
    \ can be identiﬁed through\ndifferent maps (e.g., Unique Identiﬁer, UID, or level\
    \ of communication identiﬁers such as, Medium\nAccess Control, MAC, and IP addresses).\
    \ In order to ﬁnd information and services related to things,\nSensors 2016, 16,\
    \ 1979\n4 of 22\nit is necessary to have a resolution infrastructure which links\
    \ identiﬁers of things to other devices on\nthe network. Probably the clearest\
    \ example of such infrastructure is the so called Object Name Service\n(ONS) in\
    \ the Electronic Product Code (EPC) global network [22].\n2.4. Sensor Modelling.\
    \ The Semantic Web\nBeyond identifying things, different applications must be\
    \ able to access and use the information\ncoming from things. This goal is difﬁcult\
    \ to achieve due to the heterogeneity of data representation\nformats. There are\
    \ a number of initiatives and standardisation bodies in the ﬁeld of WSN. IEEE\
    \ 1451 [23]\nis a set of smart transducer interface standards. The Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium Sensor Web\nEnablement (OGC SWE) [24] has created three different\
    \ sensor modelling standards and observations:\nSensor Model Language (SensorML),\
    \ Transducer Markup Language (TransducerML) and Observations\n& Measurements (O&M).\
    \ Standardization of OGC SWE is a revolutionary approach to the operation of\n\
    Web-enabled sensors. The aim of SWE is to create web-based sensor networks (Web\
    \ of Things, WoT)\nmaking all sensors and sensor data repositories discoverable,\
    \ accessible and, where applicable, controllable\nthrough the World Wide Web.\n\
    Another obstacle standing in the way to interoperability is the lack of interconnection\
    \ standards\nbetween wireless networks (e.g., between Bluetooth and Zigbee).To\
    \ meet that challenge, the OGC and\nthe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] have\
    \ been conducting research and doing standardisation\nwork following a data-centric\
    \ approach [26]. The term Semantic Web refers to W3C’s vision of the Web\nof linked\
    \ data. Semantic Web technologies allow developers to create data stores on the\
    \ Web, build\nvocabularies, and write rules for handling data. The Semantic Sensor\
    \ Web (SSW) [27] is an approach\nin which semantic metadata is registered along\
    \ with sensor data to provide context awareness [28].\nSpeciﬁcally, OGC SWE-based\
    \ spatial, temporal and thematic metadata is registered.\n2.5. Architecture\n\
    The multiplicity of solutions to address each of the challenges posed provides\
    \ an indication of the\ncurrent landscape of standardisation. Currently, the main\
    \ IoT architectures are:\n•\nThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute\
    \ M2M Technical Committee [29].\n•\nInternational Telecommunication Union—Telecommunication\
    \ sector view [30].\n•\nInternet Engineering Task Force architecture fragments\
    \ [31].\n•\nOpen Geospatial Consortium architecture [31].\n•\nInternet of Things-Architecture\
    \ (IoT-A) [32].\nThe IoT-A differs from the rest in that it creates a reference\
    \ architecture consisting of a horizontal\nARM (Architectural Reference Model)\
    \ enabling the design of any IoT application. IoT-A and FIWARE\nare both European\
    \ initiatives. Though they are in many aspects independent to each other, FIWARE\n\
    usually follows the model deﬁned by the IoT-A. Despite these efforts, there is\
    \ still no architecture for\nIoT systems, nor is there a widely recognised universal\
    \ set of standards.\n2.6. The Need for Middleware and Open Interfaces\nMiddleware\
    \ is the cornerstone of any IoT system as it is crucial for efﬁcient machine to\
    \ machine\ncommunication insofar as it masks the heterogeneity of devices, communications\
    \ and networks.\nMiddleware provides a set of enablers such as standardised Application\
    \ Programming Interfaces (API),\nprotocols and infrastructure services to support\
    \ the swift and accurate development of services and\ndistributed applications\
    \ of Future Internet services.\nIn light of their importance, many research projects\
    \ have focused on IoT middleware, the latter\nbeing studied, compared and classiﬁed\
    \ by different authors [33,34]. In most cases, WSN middleware is\nimplemented\
    \ as middleware embedded in the node. A list of WSN middleware, software/OS and\n\
    WSN programming languages is available at [35]. Each middleware solution focuses\
    \ on different\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n5 of 22\nchallenges posed by IoT such\
    \ as data volume management, device management, interoperability,\ncontext awareness\
    \ and many more. A middleware solution that addresses all the challenges posed\
    \ by\nIoT has yet to be designed.\nThe current trend in middleware development\
    \ is the use of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)\nservices oriented approach\
    \ and the implementation of Web standards (SOAP and RESTful) [35,36].\nBy extending\
    \ the Web paradigm to devices, the latter can become a natural component in the\n\
    construction of any IoT application and facilitate the integration of device services\
    \ into any business\nsystem that is based on SOA. IoT applications can thus become\
    \ independent of technology and\nprogramming language. This will help drive the\
    \ IoT applications development market, Open APIs\nbeing a key component in its\
    \ establishment.\nWSO2 [37], PubNub [38] and FIWARE [39] are clear examples of\
    \ this new type of platform.\nSpeciﬁcally, FIWARE applies the concepts of the\
    \ SENSEI project [40] and of IoT-A architecture [41].\nReference [1] describes\
    \ the evolution of Farm Management Systems from monolithic systems to open\nsystems\
    \ capable to operate over the Internet. This paper shows a broad range of possible\
    \ scenarios\nin the precision farming domain, where FIWARE technology can be applied,\
    \ and it also offers a\ngeneral description of FIWARE technology. However, it\
    \ does not describe in detail how to use the\nFIWARE components to develop precision\
    \ farming applications, or the performance and scalability\nof the resulting applications.\
    \ Reference [42] complements and expands the contents of reference [1].\nThis\
    \ paper shows a deployment of the FIWARE technology that represents a concrete\
    \ example of the\nuse of FIWARE in precision agriculture: a greenhouse. This paper\
    \ presents the system components at a\nvery high level of abstraction without\
    \ entering into the details of application development. In addition,\nthis paper\
    \ is mainly focused in the cloud aspects of the farm management systems.\n2.7.\
    \ Cloud Computing and IoT\nThe cloud computing paradigm is one of the most positive\
    \ aspects of ICT development for the IoT\ninsofar as it allows independent and\
    \ virtualized execution environments to host multiple applications\nin an isolated\
    \ fashion on the same hardware platform, typically in large data centres. Additionally,\n\
    cloud computing has the advantage of providing interconnection to different businesses\
    \ if they are\nrunning on the same platform.\nCloud computing is also a key enabler\
    \ when moving from a product-centred to a services-centred\napproach due to its\
    \ elasticity that allows companies a “pay-as-you-grow” offer.\nClosely related\
    \ to the issue of data centres, intelligence software and data processing will\
    \ play\nan increasingly important role in IoT solutions. A popular concept today\
    \ is Big Data which refers to\nthe growing number and size of data sets available\
    \ to businesses and individuals for compilation\nand analysis. New paradigms have\
    \ emerged in the ﬁeld of Big Data. MapReduce [43] is one that has\ngenerated high\
    \ expectations in scenarios where latency is not a critical requirement. Naturally,\
    \ these\ntechnologies are therefore key IoT enablers allowing the aggregation\
    \ and collection of massive sets\nof data that devices and sensors are able to\
    \ produce. The IoT is unique compared to other Big Data\napplications such as\
    \ social network analysis because, as described above, communication between\n\
    machines is different from communication between humans.\n3. FIWARE\n3.1. Description\n\
    The FIWARE project is being developed as part of the Future Internet Public Private\
    \ Partnership\nprogramme [44] launched by the European Commission in collaboration\
    \ with the information and\ncommunication technology industry.\nFIWARE is designed\
    \ to be the core of the Future Internet covering all application domains.\nTherefore,\
    \ FIWARE architecture is very extensive and is broken down into seven completely\
    \ open\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n6 of 22\ntechnical chapters [45] based on components\
    \ known as Generic Enablers [46] which offer reusable and\nconﬁgurable functions\
    \ across multiple application domains.\nThis section reviews those aspects of\
    \ FIWARE that facilitate the understanding of this\nwork. We will begin by introducing\
    \ concepts related to modelling and information management.\nSubsequently, an\
    \ overview of FIWARE’s IoT architecture will be given.\n3.2. FIWARE NGSI Context\
    \ Management\nFIWARE speciﬁcation is based on the Open Mobile Alliance Next Generation\
    \ Service Interfaces\n(OMA NGSI) Context Management [47] standard to manage and\
    \ exchange information.\n3.2.1. Context Information Model\nAll information handled\
    \ by applications is modelled through the deﬁnition of a Context\nInformation\
    \ Model composed of contextual elements which we will refer to as entities. Entities\
    \ may\nrefer to physical objects (i.e., sensors or actuators), to hardware and\
    \ software (i.e., an IoT programme)\nand to high level abstractions that model\
    \ things and group both physical objects and resources.\nEntities are represented\
    \ by the generic data structures shown in Figure 1. Entities are uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ by an Entity Id/ Entity Type pair.\nEntities have attributes, characterised\
    \ by a triplet\n(<name_attribute, type, value>). And each attribute can have optional\
    \ semantic data (metadata)\nalso characterised by triplets <name_metadata, type,\
    \ value>. The values of the attributes become\nthe system’s contextual information.\
    \ A fundamental concept is that entities are not linked to a\nspeciﬁc representation\
    \ formalism. For example, they can be represented as an XML document\n(SensorML,\
    \ ContextML, etc.) or as entries in a NoSQL database (MongoDB). An important advantage\n\
    of this conceptual model is its compatibility with IoT formats (SensorML) while\
    \ also allowing\nadditional extensions.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979  \n6 of 22 \n\
    3.2. FIWARE NGSI Context Management \nFIWARE specification is based on the Open\
    \ Mobile Alliance Next Generation Service Interfaces \n(OMA NGSI) Context Management\
    \ [47] standard to manage and exchange information. \n3.2.1. Context Information\
    \ Model \nAll information handled by applications is modelled through the definition\
    \ of a Context \nInformation Model composed of contextual elements which we will\
    \ refer to as entities. Entities may \nrefer to physical objects (i.e., sensors\
    \ or actuators), to hardware and software (i.e., an IoT programme) \nand to high\
    \ level abstractions that model things and group both physical objects and resources.\
    \ \nEntities are represented by the generic data structures shown in Figure 1.\
    \ Entities are uniquely \nidentified by an Entity Id/ Entity Type pair. Entities\
    \ have attributes, characterised by a triplet \n(<name_attribute, type, value>).\
    \ And each attribute can have optional semantic data (metadata) also \ncharacterised\
    \ by triplets <name_metadata, type, value>. The values of the attributes become\
    \ the \nsystem's contextual information. A fundamental concept is that entities\
    \ are not linked to a specific \nrepresentation formalism. For example, they can\
    \ be represented as an XML document (SensorML, \nContextML, etc.) or as entries\
    \ in a NoSQL database (MongoDB). An important advantage of  \nthis conceptual\
    \ model is its compatibility with IoT formats (SensorML) while also allowing \n\
    additional extensions. \n \nFigure 1. Context element conceptual diagram. \n3.2.2.\
    \ Events \nIn FIWARE-based IoT systems, events refer to something that has happened\
    \ in the system. \nChanges in contextual information, (update of already existing\
    \ entities and the creation of new \nones), are considered events. FIWARE is an\
    \ event-driven architecture and Generic Enablers are \ndefined taking this fact\
    \ into account [48]. \n3.2.3. FIWARE NGSI API \nThe OMA NGSI-9 and NGSI-10 interfaces\
    \ are HTTP RESTful APIs [45]. The FIWARE versions \nof these APIs allow mediation\
    \ between a large number of services. The NGSI-9 interface helps makes \nthe contextual\
    \ information produced by an entity accessible to other entities. In so doing\
    \ it provides \ntwo operations (among others): registerContext to register the\
    \ entities that publish their data and \ndiscoverContextAvailability to discover\
    \ them. The NGSI-10 API enables the contextual information \nexchange itself.\
    \ To do that it offers, among others, updateContext operations to update contextual\
    \ \ninformation and subscribeContext to create subscriptions to contextual information.\
    \ \n3.2.4. FIWARE NGSI Associations \nThings are a special type of entity. Things\
    \ are abstractions of the real world and often pool \nresources according to their\
    \ location and attribute type. \nAn association [49] is an ordered pair between\
    \ a device/resource-level entity and a thing-level \nentity. Its purpose is to\
    \ enable a transition from device/resource-level data to thing-level data and\
    \ \nvice versa. Thus, associations describe relationships between these two levels\
    \ of abstraction. \n \n \nContext Element\n• EntityId\n• EntityType\nContext Element\

    In FIWARE-based IoT systems, events refer to something that has happened in the\
    \ system.\nChanges in contextual information, (update of already existing entities\
    \ and the creation of new\nones), are considered events. FIWARE is an event-driven\
    \ architecture and Generic Enablers are deﬁned\ntaking this fact into account\

    \ abstractions of the real world and often pool resources\naccording to their\
    \ location and attribute type.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n7 of 22\nAn association\
    \ [49] is an ordered pair between a device/resource-level entity and a thing-level\n\
    entity. Its purpose is to enable a transition from device/resource-level data\
    \ to thing-level data and vice\nversa. Thus, associations describe relationships\
    \ between these two levels of abstraction.\n3.2.5. Attribute Domains\nAn attribute\
    \ domain is a set of closely related context attributes. Each attribute has a\
    \ name and\nbelongs to a single domain. Domains in an NGSI operation are very\
    \ useful because the attributes in\nthat domain are always requested, provided,\
    \ updated or stored at the same time. This implies that the\ncreation and updating\
    \ of data within a domain are atomic and that context data associated with their\n\
    attributes are always consistent.\n3.3. IoT Architecture\nFIWARE IoT architecture\

    \ 2. From a physical standpoint, the IoT\nServices Enablement chapter deﬁnes three\
    \ domains: (1) IoT Device and Resource, (2) IoT Gateway and\n(3) the IoT Backend,\
    \ which are brieﬂy described below.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979  \n7 of 22 \n \n3.2.5.\

    \ of the Generic Enablers of \nthe IoT Services Enablement [50] and Data/Context\
    \ Management [51] chapters. This is a flexible \narchitecture able to address\
    \ the challenges discussed in Section 2. From a physical standpoint, the \nIoT\
    \ Services Enablement chapter defines three domains: (1) IoT Device and Resource,\
    \ (2) IoT \nGateway and (3) the IoT Backend, which are briefly described below.\
    \ \n \nFigure 2. FIWARE IoT architecture. \n3.3.1. IoT Device and Resource \n\
    A device is a hardware component that measures properties of its environment or\
    \ acts on that \nenvironment. Therefore, sensors and actuators are devices. On\
    \ the other hand, IoT resources are \ncomputational elements (software) that allow\
    \ devices to carry out detection or operational tasks. \nGenerally, IoT resources\
    \ are hosted on the device. There are two types of devices for FIWARE \ndepending\
    \ on whether or not they use FIWARE NGSI middleware. Devices that are not equipped\
    \ \nwith FIWARE NGSI middleware do not have the capacity to accommodate the computational\
    \ \nresources required to provide NGSI services. \n3.3.2. IoT Gateway \nGateways\
    \ concentrate information from end devices and channel it to consumers. This is\
    \ \nhardware generally found near the end devices (sensors/actuators). Gateways\
    \ also provide \ncomputational resources for devices within their area of influence.\
    \ Just as with devices, a distinction \nmust be drawn between two types of gateways\
    \ depending on whether or not they host FIWARE \nmiddleware. The gateways that\
    \ do not host FIWARE can be integrated into the system by \nFigure 2. FIWARE IoT\
    \ architecture.\n3.3.1. IoT Device and Resource\nA device is a hardware component\
    \ that measures properties of its environment or acts on that\nenvironment. Therefore,\
    \ sensors and actuators are devices. On the other hand, IoT resources are\ncomputational\
    \ elements (software) that allow devices to carry out detection or operational\
    \ tasks.\nGenerally, IoT resources are hosted on the device. There are two types\
    \ of devices for FIWARE\ndepending on whether or not they use FIWARE NGSI middleware.\
    \ Devices that are not equipped with\nFIWARE NGSI middleware do not have the capacity\
    \ to accommodate the computational resources\nrequired to provide NGSI services.\n\
    3.3.2. IoT Gateway\nGateways concentrate information from end devices and channel\
    \ it to consumers. This is hardware\ngenerally found near the end devices (sensors/actuators).\
    \ Gateways also provide computational\nresources for devices within their area\
    \ of inﬂuence. Just as with devices, a distinction must be\nSensors 2016, 16,\
    \ 1979\n8 of 22\ndrawn between two types of gateways depending on whether or not\
    \ they host FIWARE middleware.\nThe gateways that do not host FIWARE can be integrated\
    \ into the system by connecting to FIWARE\ngateways. FIWARE gateways host two\
    \ GEs: Protocol Adapter and Data Handling [46,50]. The Protocol\nAdapter abstracts\
    \ the communication protocols used by devices (e.g., Zigbee, CoAP [2,35]) by\n\
    translating them to the FIWARE NGSI protocol. Data Handling is the ﬁrst stage\
    \ of intelligence\nintended to process data in real time. To do this, it collects\
    \ information from the Protocol Adapter that\ncompile raw data from the sensors,\
    \ transforming them into relevant events and then propagating them\nto the IoT\
    \ Backend.\n3.3.3. IoT Backend\nThis is a cloud environment that hosts one or\
    \ more of the following Generic Enablers:\nIoT Discovery, IoT Broker and Backend\
    \ Device Management [46,50].\nIoT Discovery allows\ndevice/resource discovery\
    \ after registration/announcement of its availability (analogy: “yellow\npages”).\
    \ It also stores associations between devices/resources and the things of an IoT\
    \ system. The IoT\nBroker interacts with the Publish/Subscribe Context Broker\
    \ GE (Figure 2) and the Data Handling\nGE inferring the status of the things from\
    \ devices/resources or vice versa through communication\nwith IoT Discovery. Lastly,\
    \ Backend Device Management allows for management of context entities\nassociated\
    \ with devices and provides several communication protocol translators (IoT agents)\
    \ such as\nUltralight 2.0 over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Message Queuing\
    \ Telemetry Transport (MQTT)\nor OMA LWM2M/IETF Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), among others. The IoT Backend\ncommunicates with end devices using standard\
    \ protocols (MQTT [2,35], CoAP, etc.) or through the\nFIWARE NGSI protocol, connecting\
    \ either through IoT gateway(s) and/or direct interfaces. From a\nmore abstract\
    \ point of view, beyond physical entities and computation resources, the Data/Context\n\
    Management chapter deﬁnes the following Generic Enablers:\n3.3.4. Publish/Subscribe\
    \ Context Broker GE\nThe mission of this GE is to achieve the total decoupling\
    \ of producers and consumers of context\ninformation. To do this it implements\
    \ the Publish/Subscribe [52] design pattern. Context producers\n(devices, resources\
    \ and things) publish their data in this GE without needing to know who the\n\
    consumers of such data are. For their part, consumers of context data do not need\
    \ to know who\nproduced it. In other words, they are simply interested in the\
    \ event itself, not who generated it. As a\nresult, the Publish/Subscribe Context\
    \ Broker GE [46,51] (Context Broker hereafter) is an excellent\nbridge allowing\
    \ external applications to manage events related to the Internet of things in\
    \ a very simple\nway by concealing all the complexity of data compilation. To\
    \ achieve this, the Context Broker uses the\nstandard interfaces NGSI-9 and NGSI-10\
    \ which enable the recovery of said information from context\nproducers (i.e.,\
    \ IoT Backend or NGSI device) to consumers of context (i.e., Big Data Analysis\
    \ GE).\n3.3.5. Big Data Analysis GE (Cosmos)\nThe goal of this Generic Enabler\
    \ [51] is to deploy the means with which to analyse batch data\nin order to reveal\
    \ new information. In this type of processing, batch data is stored in advance\
    \ and\nlatency is not extremely important when they are processed. We would note\
    \ that today the batch\nprocessing block has been developed to a large extent\
    \ in Cosmos [46] (reference implementation of\nBig Data Analysis). This block\
    \ integrates the Hadoop [53] ecosystem that includes the MapReduce\nparadigm.\
    \ Also, Cygnus-NGSI [54] is part of the Big Data Analysis GE ecosystem (Cosmos).\
    \ This is\na connector designed to provide persistent storage of context information\
    \ from the Context Broker\nin external repositories. In other words, the Context\
    \ Broker only stores the last value referring to the\nattributes of each context\
    \ entity. Therefore, if an IoT application requires access to historical context\n\
    information, persistence in some other storage is required, value for value, using\
    \ Cygnus-NGSI.\nInternally, Cygnus-NGSI is based on Apache Flume [55], a technology\
    \ that addresses the design\nand implementation of collection agents and data\
    \ persistence. In fact, Cygnus-NGSI is a Flume agent\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n\
    9 of 22\nessentially consisting of a source, a channel and a sink. SmartPort is\
    \ a platform that covers a demanding\nneed for big data analysis based on FIWARE\
    \ [56].\n4. Testbed\nThe purpose of the testbed is to measure the performance\
    \ of the FIWARE platform. For practical\nreasons, it has been deployed in a laboratory\
    \ environment. However, an IoT use case scenario has\nbeen conceived and subsequently\
    \ analysed to identify the design requirements for the desired testbed.\n4.1.\
    \ IoT Use Case Scenario\nWe are assuming a distributed scenario in the ﬁeld of\
    \ precision agriculture/viticulture (i.e., crops\nin several different regions\
    \ or countries). Hypothetically, this is a complex IoT scenario as it involves\n\
    managing a large number of resources associated with sensors and actuators. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the sensors\ndetect data relating to the environment (e.g., air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, solar radiation and\nprecipitation) and the state of the\
    \ vineyards (e.g., water and nutrients). The actuators are installed\nin crop\
    \ irrigation systems. The system has to be scalable: if the number of sensors\
    \ and actuators\nis increased, only computational resources would need to be increased\
    \ without implying greater\ncomplexity or system redesign. To address this challenge\
    \ of scalability, the implementation of the Farm\nManagement System (FMS) illustrated\
    \ in Figure 3 is planned.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979  \n9 of 22 \n \n4. Testbed \n\

    \ \nWe are assuming a distributed scenario in the field of precision agriculture/viticulture\
    \ (i.e., \ncrops in several different regions or countries). Hypothetically, this\
    \ is a complex IoT scenario as it \ninvolves managing a large number of resources\
    \ associated with sensors and actuators. Specifically, \nthe sensors detect data\
    \ relating to the environment (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity, solar\
    \ \nradiation and precipitation) and the state of the vineyards (e.g., water and\
    \ nutrients). The actuators \nare installed in crop irrigation systems. The system\
    \ has to be scalable: if the number of sensors and \nactuators is increased, only\
    \ computational resources would need to be increased without implying \ngreater\
    \ complexity or system redesign. To address this challenge of scalability, the\
    \ implementation \nof the Farm Management System (FMS) illustrated in Figure 3\
    \ is planned. \n \nFigure 3. FMS envisioned based on FIWARE IoT architecture (lower\
    \ part drawings are from [57]). \nFigure 3. FMS envisioned based on FIWARE IoT\
    \ architecture (lower part drawings are from [57]).\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n\
    10 of 22\nThe FMS that has been designed takes advantage of the new features offered\
    \ by the Future Internet\nby relying on the IoT FIWARE architecture (see Section\
    \ 3.3). Vineyards are divided into management\nzones, each with a Zigbee wireless\
    \ sensor network (WSN). The IoT Gateways of these networks host\ncharacteristics\
    \ of Protocol Adapter and Data Handling GEs. These gateways are located in the\
    \ vicinity\nof the devices. The IoT Gateways connect to a speciﬁc FILAB account\
    \ [58] (FIWARE testbed), which\nhosts instances of IoT Broker, IoT Discovery and\
    \ Context Broker GEs. Our application, FMS, is also\nhosted in this instance.\
    \ The functions performed by these components are explained below.\nRegistration\
    \ of IoT Devices and Resources\n1.\nWhen starting the system, the Protocol Adapter\
    \ automatically detects the IoT resources\nassociated with the devices, sensors\
    \ or actuators in its management zone.\n2.\nFor each resource detected, the Protocol\
    \ Adapter sends a registerContext request to Data Handling.\n3.\nWhen the Data\
    \ Handling register receives the registerContext request, it creates an entity\
    \ in its\nlocal database modelling the resource, and sends a registerContext request\
    \ to IoT Discovery. IoT\nDiscovery bundles information on resources from different\
    \ management zones.\nHigh-Level Modelling of Things\n4.\nWe now turn our attention\
    \ to the opposite end of Figure 3, the application of FMS and the\nContext Broker\
    \ component. The FMS application implements a RESTful HTTP client that can\ninvoke\
    \ Context Broker services. The updateContext service of the Context Broker is\
    \ invoked both\nto create new entities that model things and to update the status\
    \ of existing entities. Two types\nof entities are thus created: the resources\
    \ that are detected automatically (steps 1 and 2) and\nthe things which are deﬁned\
    \ explicitly from the application. In FIWARE, resources and things\nrepresent\
    \ different levels of abstraction, as also shown in Figure 2. Things tend to pool\
    \ resources\naccording to their location and type of attributes. The Context Broker\
    \ can access information\nfrom the resources through a component not yet presented:\
    \ the IoT Broker.\n5.\nMapping between resources and things is achieved in IoT\
    \ Discovery which records associations\nbetween entities that model things and\
    \ those that model system resources.\nSubscription to the Information Generated\
    \ by the Entities\n6.\nOnce entities have been deﬁned, whether these be resources\
    \ or things, any application can\nsubscribe to the information that these entities\
    \ generate by invoking the subscribeContext\noperation from the Context Broker.\
    \ In our case the FMS application creates entities and\nsubscribes to them, and\
    \ Cosmos, which is a storage system for FIWARE Big Data, have also\nbeen subscribed\
    \ to them. The Cosmos connection is not direct but rather through another\nFIWARE\
    \ component, the injector Cygnus-NGSI. Note that there is a chain of subscriptions\n\
    and brokers (Data Handling, IoT Broker and Context Broker). The most important\
    \ is the\nContext Broker which makes things and resources accessible to applications\
    \ and is the reference\nimplementation for the system’s other brokers. The Context\
    \ Broker subscribes to the context\ninformation of the IoT Broker which mediates\
    \ between the Context Broker and different Data\nHandling associated with different\
    \ areas or management zones of the crop ﬁeld. The IoT\nBroker uses the discoverContextAvailability\
    \ service of IoT Discovery in order to discover the\nresources associated with\
    \ the things with which the Context Broker works. For our case study,\nall subscriptions\
    \ are onChange: only events are generated and therefore notiﬁcations are sent\
    \ to\nsubscribers when changes occur in entity attributes.\nInformation Notiﬁcation\n\
    7.\nCrop data is acquired by IoT devices and resources that transmit this information\
    \ to the\nIoT Gateway where they are received by the Protocol Adapter. In Figure\
    \ 3 devices use the\nIEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee protocol but could use others (CoAP\
    \ or RFID [35]). In fact, Protocol\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n11 of 22\nAdapters\
    \ hide communication protocols with physical devices from the rest of the components.\n\
    The Protocol Adapter transmits the information received to Data Handling through\
    \ an\nupdateContext. Data Handling then notiﬁes (notifyContext) the IoT Broker\
    \ which, in turn, notiﬁes\nthe Context Broker which, in turn, passes it on to\
    \ its subscribers, in our case the FMS and\nCygnus-NGSI application.\n8.\nThe\
    \ case of the IoT Broker is special because it must interact with the IoT Discovery\
    \ component\nto translate notiﬁcations at resource level to the corresponding\
    \ notiﬁcations at thing level sent to\nthe Context Broker. The Cygnus-NGSI injector\
    \ is another special case which is explained below.\n9.\nFinally, the FMS application\
    \ implements two Web services from the information it is supplied\nby the Context\
    \ Broker and Cosmos. In the ﬁrst service, information is published in real time\n\
    as are specialised reports on the environment and status of vineyards (e.g., pest\
    \ prediction)\nthus facilitating the taking of decision concerning irrigation,\
    \ fertilisation and pest control. The\nsecond Web service is a human machine interface\
    \ (HMI) enabling the remote activation of the\ncontrol elements installed in crop\
    \ irrigation systems. In this case, information travels in the\nopposite direction,\
    \ the ﬁrst step being the sending of control commands to the Context Broker.\n\
    In short, the FMS is context aware: the information gathered from the sensors\
    \ is acquired, modelled\nand compiled for processing following analysis and knowledge\
    \ extraction. This knowledge facilitates\ndecision-making and the consequent sending\
    \ of activation commands to the actuators. This is possible\nthanks to the orchestration\
    \ of IoT services provided by FIWARE allowing resources associated with\ndevices\
    \ to become searchable, accessible and usable thus maximising their interaction\
    \ with the application\nof FMS. Thus, in the architecture (Figure 3) the Context\
    \ Broker interoperates with the IoT broker and\nthe IoT Data Handling that implement\
    \ Publish/Subscribe components with characteristics similar to\nthe former. Thus,\
    \ a network of brokers is created that allows uncoupled interaction between services\n\
    that produce and consume contextual information. This is an example of the federation\
    \ concept\nadopted by FIWARE from the IoT-A architecture (see Section 2.5).\n\
    This scenario could be more complex if the physical devices used communication\
    \ protocols\nnot supported by the Protocol Adapter (e.g., MQTT). In this case\
    \ the deployment of a Backend\nDevice Management instance (GE labelled with a\
    \ star in Figure 3) would be needed to address\nthis interoperability. It can\
    \ therefore be concluded that the Context Broker handles all the system’s\ncontextual\
    \ information, mediating between the elements that produce that information (IoT\
    \ Broker,\nBackend Device Management and implementation of the FMS) and the elements\
    \ that consume it (IoT\nBroker, Backend Device Management, implementation of the\
    \ FMS and Cosmos through Cygnus-NGSI).\nHence, the Context Broker is the backbone\
    \ of the system’s data ﬂow. The Context Broker plays a\ndecisive role in any context\
    \ aware system based on FIWARE technologies. That is why a testbed has\nbeen designed\
    \ to assess its performance.\n4.2. Design\nThe following requirements had to be\
    \ met in the design phase of the testbed:\n•\nInitially oriented towards FIWARE\
    \ but adaptable for use with other platforms thus enabling\ncomparative studies.\n\
    •\nOriented towards measurement of performance and data storage capacity but extendible\
    \ to\ninclude other properties.\n•\nEstablishment of data generation parameters:\
    \ number of IoT nodes, data frequency generation\nand payload.\n•\nEstablishment\
    \ of test parameters in FILAB: number and characteristics of virtual machines\
    \ (VMs)\ndeployed, number and characteristics of Generic Enablers instantiated\
    \ and parameters of the\nCygnus-NGSI injector.\n•\nTest settings and autostart\
    \ against FIWARE instances.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n12 of 22\nThe testbed designed\
    \ (Figure 4) takes the most important elements of the case study shown\nin Figure\
    \ 3 into account, including (1) a context generating application, (2) instances\
    \ of reference\nimplementations of the Context Broker (Orion) and Big Data Analysis\
    \ (Cosmos), (3) a client application\n(Hive) that acts as the FMS application\
    \ and (4) the Cygnus-NGSI injector.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979  \n12 of 22 \n \n\
    \ \nFigure 4. A testbed to evaluate the performance of the FIWARE platform. \n\
    The context generator application follows the client/server architecture and runs\
    \ on 13 \nmachines located in one of the laboratories of the research group (Electronics\
    \ Engineering and \nSystems Division, DSIE) of the Universidad Politécnica de\
    \ Cartagena. This application simulates the \ngeneration of context information\
    \ from an IoT node network by implementing RESTful (NGSI) \nclients. One design\
    \ criterion is that each IoT node simulates a producer of context that can refer\
    \ to an \nintermediate node (e.g., IoT Broker) or a final NGSI node (see Figure\
    \ 2) that can integrate multiple \nsensors. In these cases, requests to the Context\
    \ Broker are transmitted directly to update the context \ncorresponding to entities\
    \ that can be modelled on future IoT systems, posing the challenge of \nscalability\
    \ discussed in the previous section. \nThe Http source of the Cygnus-NSGI injector\
    \ is responsible for receiving events from the \nContext Broker, transforming\
    \ them into Flume events [55] and injecting them into the channel. The \nCygnus\
    \ sink (Orion HDFS Sink) extracts the Flume events from the channel and uses the\
    \ API \nWebHDFS/HttpFS [53] to achieve persistence of the context information\
    \ contained in the body of the \nFlume events in the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ [53] set up in Cosmos, creating a historical view of \nsuch data. Also, the\
    \ application of FMS implements a Hive client [53] for the execution of MapReduce\
    \ \ntasks associated with new generation mining and analysis techniques (reasoning\
    \ models) that \nprocess historical context information stored in Cosmos. The\
    \ resulting perceptions are extracted \nthrough HiveQL language. \n4.3. Experimentation\
    \ Environment \nThere is a community account in FILAB’s Spain2 cloud infrastructure\
    \ enabling the  \ndeployment of a virtual machine (VM) hosting an instance of\
    \ Orion Context Broker (version 1.2.1), \nversion 3.0.12 of a MongoDB database\
    \ and version 0.13.0 of the Cygnus-NGSI injector. The VM has \nthe following characteristics:\
    \ 4 VCPU, 8 GB of RAM and 80 GB disk. This more than meets the \nhardware requirements\
    \ of Orion and Cygnus-NGSI. An account was created in the global instance \nof\
    \ Cosmos whose initial quota of 5 GB of storage is expandable. DSIE laboratory\

    \ Premium operating system, Luna Eclipse development \nenvironment SR2 (4.4.2)\

    \ point of view, FIWARE recommendations were taken into account to \nrefine the\
    \ following testbed components: (1) MongoDB; (2) Orion and (3) Cygnus-NGSI. The\
    \ most \nimportant aspects of configuration are as follows: \nFigure 4. A testbed\
    \ to evaluate the performance of the FIWARE platform.\nThe context generator application\
    \ follows the client/server architecture and runs on 13 machines\nlocated in one\
    \ of the laboratories of the research group (Electronics Engineering and Systems\
    \ Division,\nDSIE) of the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena. This application\
    \ simulates the generation of context\ninformation from an IoT node network by\
    \ implementing RESTful (NGSI) clients. One design criterion\nis that each IoT\
    \ node simulates a producer of context that can refer to an intermediate node\
    \ (e.g., IoT\nBroker) or a ﬁnal NGSI node (see Figure 2) that can integrate multiple\
    \ sensors. In these cases, requests\nto the Context Broker are transmitted directly\
    \ to update the context corresponding to entities that can be\nmodelled on future\
    \ IoT systems, posing the challenge of scalability discussed in the previous section.\n\
    The Http source of the Cygnus-NSGI injector is responsible for receiving events\
    \ from the Context\nBroker, transforming them into Flume events [55] and injecting\
    \ them into the channel. The Cygnus sink\n(Orion HDFS Sink) extracts the Flume\
    \ events from the channel and uses the API WebHDFS/HttpFS [53]\nto achieve persistence\
    \ of the context information contained in the body of the Flume events in the\n\
    Hadoop Distributed File System [53] set up in Cosmos, creating a historical view\
    \ of such data. Also, the\napplication of FMS implements a Hive client [53] for\
    \ the execution of MapReduce tasks associated with\nnew generation mining and\
    \ analysis techniques (reasoning models) that process historical context\ninformation\
    \ stored in Cosmos. The resulting perceptions are extracted through HiveQL language.\n\
    4.3. Experimentation Environment\nThere is a community account in FILAB’s Spain2\
    \ cloud infrastructure enabling the deployment\nof a virtual machine (VM) hosting\
    \ an instance of Orion Context Broker (version 1.2.1), version 3.0.12\nof a MongoDB\
    \ database and version 0.13.0 of the Cygnus-NGSI injector. The VM has the following\n\
    characteristics: 4 VCPU, 8 GB of RAM and 80 GB disk. This more than meets the\
    \ hardware requirements\nof Orion and Cygnus-NGSI. An account was created in the\
    \ global instance of Cosmos whose initial\nquota of 5 GB of storage is expandable.\
    \ DSIE laboratory machines have the same characteristics:\n•\nHardware: HP Compaq\

    \ Premium operating system, Luna Eclipse development environment\nSR2 (4.4.2)\
    \ and context generator application.\n4.4. Conﬁguration\nFrom a performance point\
    \ of view, FIWARE recommendations were taken into account to reﬁne\nthe following\
    \ testbed components: (1) MongoDB; (2) Orion and (3) Cygnus-NGSI. The most important\n\
    aspects of conﬁguration are as follows:\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n13 of 22\nFirst,\
    \ we used version 3.0.12 of MongoDB, recommended for intensive update scenarios.\n\
    In addition, the adjustments limiting use to deployed VM resources were checked\
    \ and Transparent\nHuge Pages were disabled (THP) [59].\nSecond, Orion parameters\
    \ were adjusted for scenarios with high update/notiﬁcation rates\n(-reqPoolSize,\
    \ -dbPoolSize and -notiﬁcationModethreadPool:q:n) [59]. These parameters were\
    \ adjusted for\neach test.\nThird, Cygnus-NGSI components were adjusted to increase\
    \ performance and avoid potential\nbottlenecks in order to properly assess Orion.\
    \ To achieve this we opted for an HTTP source where the\nOrionRestHandler was\
    \ conﬁgured to convert NGSI events from Orion into Flume events. Concerning\n\
    channel design, we chose Memory Channel because of its performance when implemented\
    \ directly in\nmemory. This type of channel is ideal for ﬂows that require increased\
    \ performance and are willing to\nlose data in the case of Flume agent errors.\
    \ Finally, we chose an Orion HDFS Sink whose performance\ncould be enhanced by\
    \ using the batching mechanism to reduce the number of writes in the HDFS\nstorage\
    \ conﬁgured in Cosmos. This mechanism is conﬁgured in each simulation through\
    \ batch size\nand batch_timeout parameters [60].\n4.5. Context Generation Methods\n\
    In each test, the application developed offers users a choice between two ways\
    \ of generating\nNGSI trafﬁc. The ﬁrst method (blocking method) simulates intermediate\
    \ IoT node NGSI trafﬁc\ngeneration. Its implementation is supported by the java.net\
    \ API and its functionality is based on the\nHttpURLConnection class. This class\
    \ only allows blocking connections. Thus, in each simulation the\nsame number\
    \ of persistent HTTP connections as simulated IoT nodes are opened.\nThe second\
    \ method (non-blocking method) simulates ﬁnal IoT node NGSI trafﬁc generation.\n\
    Its implementation is focused on mechanisms that allow concurrent trafﬁc generation\
    \ [61]. In this case,\nthe SocketChannel class of the java.nio API was used to\
    \ create non-blocking connections. Therefore,\nin each simulation the same number\
    \ of connections as NGSI requests generated are opened.\nAnother implementation\
    \ detail to keep in mind is that each NGSI client (blocking or not) simulates\n\
    the behaviour of a virtual IoT node in a separate thread.\n4.6. Startup and Operation\n\
    Initially, Orion is started as a system service. Then, the context generating\
    \ application is started\nexecuting 1 master process and up to 12 slave processes.\
    \ The master process launches a graphic\nuser interface (GUI) that automates the\
    \ conﬁguration and startup of the test. Test parameters are\nintroduced in the\
    \ GUI, i.e., number of IoT nodes, frequency of NGSI trafﬁc generation and payload\n\
    that determines the attribute domain of the virtual IoT system entities. The master\
    \ process also sends\nupdateContext requests to Orion to create entities. After\
    \ starting Cygnus-NGSI, also implement onchange\ntype subscribeContext request\
    \ sender and the generation and broadcast transmission of a stream of test\nparameters\
    \ through the network.\nEach slave process decodes the steam, synchronizes with\
    \ the master process and executes one\nof the context generation methods in a\
    \ certain number of NGSI clients. As a result, M virtual IoT\nnodes send context\
    \ information to Orion through the TCP/1026 port. When an attribute of an Orion\n\
    database entity is updated, an event is generated and a notiﬁcation is sent to\
    \ Cygnus-NGSI through the\nTCP/5050 port.\nFinally, the Cygnus-NGSI injector handles\
    \ information persistence in Cosmos through the\nTCP/14000 port. At the conclusion\
    \ of the simulation, the master process compiles all the measurements\nfrom the\
    \ slave processes and performs additional operations to obtain performance statistics\
    \ for the\nexperiment. These statistics are presented to the user through the\
    \ GUI and stored in a text ﬁle formatted\nfor uploading to the RStudio development\
    \ environment. The Hive client allows queries of historical\ninformation stored\
    \ in Cosmos through the TCP/10000 port.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n14 of 22\n4.7.\
    \ Test Plan\nConsidering the payload of the updateContext requests sent to Orion,\
    \ four types of tests were\nrun (1 kB, 10 kB, 100 kB and 1 MB). Each of these\
    \ tests is divided into two categories depending\non the context generation method\
    \ used (blocking or non-blocking). The ﬁrst category includes\nperformance tests\
    \ employing the blocking method to measure throughput parameters (expressed\n\
    in requests per second or kilobytes per second) and round-trip time (in milliseconds).\
    \ The second\ncategory includes performance tests employing the non-blocking method\
    \ to measure the throughput\nparameter (expressed in requests per second or kilobytes\
    \ per second). 20 simulations were launched\nper category on different days and\
    \ in different time slots. The test plan, therefore, involves more than\n400 simulations.\
    \ The following section shows the representative results of each type of test.\n\
    The following procedure was followed in the tests. The IoT nodes are modelled\
    \ by threads\nassociated with processes. In the initial simulations, we started\
    \ with 12 single-threaded processes,\neach executed on a different machine. When\
    \ the number of IoT nodes exceeds 12, new threads are\nstarted in the processes.\
    \ To simplify testing, multiples of the number of processes started for the tests\n\
    are simulated, generally 12, in order to equitably distribute the simulation load\
    \ among the processes.\nIn certain cases, to reﬁne the results, we worked with\
    \ fewer machines and therefore fewer processes\n(always one process per machine).\
    \ That is why the graphs show measurements with a number of\nnodes that is not\
    \ a multiple of 12. A simulation concludes when each virtual IoT node has tried\
    \ to send\n200 requests to the Orion Context Broker. The throughput and round-trip\
    \ time values of the simulation\nare calculated from the average of the 200 measurements\
    \ obtained.\n5. Results\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the Orion Context\
    \ Broker, throughput and latency were\nplotted graphically depending on the degree\
    \ of concurrency simulated in each type of test. To study\nthe behaviour of the\
    \ Orion RESTful server numerous simulations were made. The realization of these\n\
    simulations was a very time-demanding task due to network latency. The results\
    \ obtained are not\nexact. They do, however, offer a realistic view of the performance\
    \ of this Generic Enabler under different\ndeployments and load conditions.\n\
    Figure 5 illustrates the results obtained when using the blocking method to generate\
    \ the context\nrequests for each payload established in the test plan (1 kB, 10\
    \ kB, 100 kB and 1 MB). A new message is\nsent as soon as the previous one has\
    \ been completely delivered. Figure 5a–c illustrates throughput\n(Th) measured\
    \ in terms of kilobytes per second (kB/s) or requests served per second (req/s)\
    \ and\nlatency expressed as Round-Trip Time (RTT) measured in milliseconds (ms)\
    \ versus number of NGSI\nclients, which can be sensors (edge devices in general)\
    \ or intermediate nodes. Simulations results\nwill be interpreted differently\
    \ depending on whether the active entities are sensors or intermediate\nnodes.\
    \ For now, results are presented and later they will be discussed. Three ranges\
    \ of interest can be\ndistinguished in these graphs as shown in Tables 1–3. Tables\
    \ are included to show clearly the points\nof interest without overloading the\
    \ ﬁgures. These ranges provide information on the behaviour of\nthe Orion Context\
    \ Broker. The graphs show that Orion has an initial range (close to linear) where\n\
    throughput increases at a more or less linear rate and RTT remains constant or\
    \ linear. The second range\nof interest (increase slow/fast) corresponds to a\
    \ gradual increase in throughput up to its maximum\nvalue while RTT rises at a\
    \ swift pace. From the point of maximum throughput, system performance\ndeclines\
    \ as payload and concurrency parameters increase, resulting in the third and ﬁnal\
    \ range of\ninterest (degrading performance). In this range, the above parameters\
    \ tend to increase RTT (waiting\ntime) and decrease throughput (requests processed).\
    \ This was the expected result but it is interesting\nto see where these changes\
    \ occur, the most useful reference being the point of maximum throughput.\nSensors\

    \ ..\n[252 ..\n[28.46 ..\n[2.89 ..\nTo analyse the performance of Orion in greater\
    \ detail, we studied the maximum throughput values\nobtained in each test type.\
    \ This parameter can be evaluated from two perspectives: Data transferred\nand\
    \ requests processed. From the ﬁrst perspective (data transferred, see Figure\
    \ 5a and Table 2):\n•\nThe highest rate of data transfer was 2963 kB/s obtained\
    \ when simulating a payload of 1 MB and\n20 NGSI clients (see Table 1). RTT in\
    \ this simulation is 3200 ms (see Figure 5b).\n•\nThe second best result was 2846\
    \ kB/s obtained when simulating a payload of 100 kB and 24 NGSI\nclients. However,\
    \ RTT was 430 ms, clearly much lower than the preceding case.\n•\nThe next throughput\
    \ measurement in descending order was 2520 kB/s corresponding to the\nsimulated\
    \ payload of 10 kB and 24 NGSI clients. Although the same number of active entities\
    \ as\nin the previous case was used, RTT was lower (83 ms).\n•\nFinally, the lowest\
    \ data transfer rate (978 kB/s) was obtained with the simulation of a payload\n\
    of 1 kB and 72 NGSI clients. We should note that a much higher number of active\
    \ entities was\nneeded in comparison with the other simulations. Also, RTT (72\
    \ ms) is the lowest value of the\ncases included in this analysis.\nIn other words,\
    \ the system performs better when faced with high loads generated by few nodes.\n\
    The increase in the number of nodes causes a very sharp decrease in the volume\
    \ of data that can be\ntransferred. From the second perspective (requests served\
    \ per second, see Figure 5c and Table 3):\n•\nThe lowest rate of requests processed\
    \ was 2.89 req/s with a payload of 1 MB.\n•\nThe second worst result was 28.46\
    \ req/s at a payload of 100 kB.\n•\nThe next result (252 req/s) at a payload of\
    \ 10 kB is substantially better.\n•\nFinally, the measure of throughput obtained\
    \ (978 req/s) in the simulation of a 1 kB payload is far\nsuperior to the other\
    \ cases in the study.\nWe would note that here the behaviour is exactly the opposite\
    \ of the preceding case. The system\nperforms better in terms of the number of\
    \ requests and worse with regard to payload.\nTo check whether a greater throughput\
    \ number in terms of requests per second is possible, we ran\na test with a minimum\
    \ payload of 300 bytes. The results are similar to those in the case of a 1kB\n\
    payload. For that reason they are not shown here. No signiﬁcant improvements were\
    \ found below a\npayload of 1 kB.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1979\n17 of 22\nScenarios\
    \ that were densely populated with sensors such as the one discussed in Section\
    \ 4.1 imply\na high update rate. For this reason, a RESTful server that supports\
    \ a high degree of concurrency and\nwhich can also process a large number of applications\
    \ nearly in real time is required. The results\ndescribed show that the best choice\
    \ to get the most out of Orion in this type of scenario is a payload of\nbetween\
    \ 1 kB and 10 kB. The ﬁnal payload depends on the needs of each IoT application\
    \ (estimated\ndegree of concurrency or number of active entities, attribute domain,\
    \ etc). An interesting scenario is to\nstudy the behaviour of FIWARE faced to\
    \ blocking and non-blocking requests.\nBlocking requests are typical of intermediate\
    \ nodes, especially the connection between the Generic\nEnablers IoT Broker and\
    \ Context Broker (see Figure 3). Non-blocking requests are typical of sensors,\n\
    or IoT ﬁnal nodes, which for energy efﬁciency reasons can not be blocked waiting\
    \ for a response\nfrom the server. Normally, a sensor sends an asynchronous request\
    \ and closes the connection to save\nenergy. This simulates the behaviour of a\
    \ ﬁnal IoT node which does not maintain the connection, when\nunnecessary in order\
    \ to conserve energy.\nTo simulate NGSI trafﬁc generation from ﬁnal IoT nodes,\
    \ the non-blocking context generation\nmethod must be used so as to permit the\
    \ generation of NGSI trafﬁc in an asynchronous manner, with\nload peaks (bursts)\
    \ that exceed the capacity of the Orion server. The purpose of this test is to\
    \ measure\nmaximum throughput in terms of requests served per second or kilobytes\
    \ per second for both type of\nrequests, blocking and non-blocking. The tests\
    \ were performed with a payload of 1 kB, i.e., that which\nallowed simulation\
    \ of the highest degree of concurrency with the blocking method. Thus, blocking\n\
    and non-blocking simulations were conducted with the optimum load parameter for\
    \ the blocking case.\nThis facilitates comparisons.\nFigure 6 illustrates the\
    \ throughput in blocking and non-blocking conditions. In the case of blocking\n\
    requests, every blocking request is issued in an independent thread. In this way,\
    \ many simultaneous\nblocking requests can be simulated. In the case of non-blocking\
    \ requests, each non-blocking socket\nopens a connection to Orion every 50 ms.\
    \ As the graph indicates, Orion has an initial range in which\nthroughput increases\
    \ almost linearly up to a maximum of 133.2721 requests or kilobytes per second\
    \ at\na concurrency of 9. As from this value, Orion enters overload reducing its\
    \ throughput as concurrency\nincreases. The simulation of 30 non-blocking sockets\
    \ is a clear indication of how this state affects\nthroughput (83.4611 req/s).\n\
    Sensors 2016, 16, 1979  \n17 of 22 \n \nrequired. The results described show that\
    \ the best choice to get the most out of Orion in this type of \nscenario is a\
    \ payload of between 1 kB and 10 kB. The final payload depends on the needs of\
    \ each IoT \napplication (estimated degree of concurrency or number of active\
    \ entities, attribute domain, etc). An \ninteresting scenario is to study the\
    \ behaviour of FIWARE faced to blocking and non-blocking \nrequests. \nBlocking\
    \ requests are typical of intermediate nodes, especially the connection between\
    \ the \nGeneric Enablers IoT Broker and Context Broker (see Figure 3). Non-blocking\
    \ requests are typical of \nsensors, or IoT final nodes, which for energy efficiency\
    \ reasons can not be blocked waiting for a \nresponse from the server. Normally,\
    \ a sensor sends an asynchronous request and closes the \nconnection to save energy.\
    \ This simulates the behaviour of a final IoT node which does not maintain \n\
    the connection, when unnecessary in order to conserve energy. \nTo simulate NGSI\
    \ traffic generation from final IoT nodes, the non-blocking context generation\
    \ \nmethod must be used so as to permit the generation of NGSI traffic in an asynchronous\
    \ manner, \nwith load peaks (bursts) that exceed the capacity of the Orion server.\
    \ The purpose of this test is to \nmeasure maximum throughput in terms of requests\
    \ served per second or kilobytes per second for \nboth type of requests, blocking\
    \ and non-blocking. The tests were performed with a payload of 1 kB, \ni.e., that\
    \ which allowed simulation of the highest degree of concurrency with the blocking\
    \ method. \nThus, blocking and non-blocking simulations were conducted with the\
    \ optimum load parameter for \nthe blocking case. This facilitates comparisons.\
    \ \nFigure 6 illustrates the throughput in blocking and non-blocking conditions.\
    \ In the case of \nblocking requests, every blocking request is issued in an independent\
    \ thread. In this way, many \nsimultaneous blocking requests can be simulated.\
    \ In the case of non-blocking requests, each  \nnon-blocking socket opens a connection\
    \ to Orion every 50 ms. As the graph indicates, Orion has an \ninitial range in\
    \ which throughput increases almost linearly up to a maximum of 133.2721 requests\
    \ or \nkilobytes per second at a concurrency of 9. As from this value, Orion enters\
    \ overload reducing its \nthroughput as concurrency increases. The simulation\
    \ of 30 non-blocking sockets is a clear indication \nof how this state affects\
    \ throughput (83.4611 req/s). \n \nFigure 6. Throughput obtained using the blocking\
    \ and non-blocking methods. \nIf we compare the maximum throughput measured when\
    \ traffic is generated by means of the \ntwo testbed methods, we see that the\
    \ value obtained with the non-blocking method is significantly \nlower than that\
    \ obtained with the blocking method. We would note that in the blocking context\
    \ \ngeneration method, each NGSI client generates an updateContext request once\
    \ the previous one is \ncompleted. Clients remain in sync with the server and\
    \ the rate of requests generated never exceeds \nthe capacity of the Orion server.\

    \ and Future Work\nThis paper has shown a use case of FIWARE with enough detail\
    \ level to provide an accurate\nview of how a FIWARE application is developed.\
    \ It is a complex technology as it is designed to\nadapt to the variability of\
    \ a wide range of applications, which demand different interaction schemes.\n\
    At the same time, FIWARE assumes applications driven by events, which may show\
    \ an asynchronous\nbehaviour. All these features inevitably imply the use of many\
    \ components with interdependencies.\nThe FIWARE architecture, which deﬁnes these\
    \ dependencies, is based on common design patterns\nin the communications software,\
    \ mainly the use of a broker. The use of common design patterns\nmakes both the\
    \ understanding of FIWARE technology and its use easier for application developers.\n\
    However, in our opinion, the documentation is not well organized. Furthermore,\
    \ it does not always\noffer enough detail level to give a speciﬁc answer to an\
    \ implementation problem. The deﬁciencies in\nthe documentation involve investing\
    \ a lot of time and effort into solving relatively simple problems.\nIn this regard,\
    \ we believe that, this work, without going into coding details, provides a useful\n\
    guide to identify the components needed to develop a FIWARE application as well\
    \ as the interfaces\nused to connect them.\nRegarding the performance of the resulting\
    \ applications and based on the results obtained in\nthe testbed, it is safe to\
    \ say that the choice of payload is critical in the performance of the Orion\n\
    Context Broker. As described in Section 5, an optimal payload maximises Orion’s\
    \ performance in\nterms of throughput and latency. Furthermore, that payload allows\
    \ Orion to support a greater degree\nof concurrency.\nPrecision agriculture applications,\
    \ like many other IoT applications, are characterised by two\ntypes of situations:\
    \ (1) very frequent exchanges of small amounts of data from low capacity sensors;\n\
    (2) mass transmission of off-line data, i.e., data obtained from a drone or a\
    \ camera mounted on an\nagricultural vehicle. FIWARE performs well in both cases.\n\
    For all of the above, we conclude that the FIWARE platform meets the requirements\
    \ of today’s\nIoT applications in the sphere of precision agriculture.\nIn other\
    \ domains there are applications that require the transmission of massive volumes\
    \ of data\nin real time (streaming in real time) accompanied by the processing\
    \ of such data online as they are\ngenerated. Apart from the Orion Context Broker,\
    \ FIWARE also supports other Generic Enablers [46] as\nKurento, Complex Event\
    \ Processing (CEP) and Cosmos (Stream Processing) to implement solutions in\n\
    such scenarios. It would therefore be interesting to check the performance of\
    \ FIWARE in this type of\nscenario (case 2).\nIn the case of future IoT scenarios,\
    \ Section 4.1 provided a description of a Farm Management\nSystem (FMS) composed\
    \ of the FIWARE elements discussed in Section 3.3. The FMS addresses the\nchallenges\
    \ of scalability and interoperability that were discussed in Section 2. On the\
    \ one hand, the\nGeneric Enablers Protocol Adapter and Backend Device Management\
    \ are responsible for concealing\ncommunication protocols from the rest of the\
    \ components with physical devices (Zigbee, MQTT,\nCoAP, etc). On the other hand,\
    \ the Orion Context Broker is the most important component because it\nhandles\
    \ all the system’s contextual information, mediating between the elements that\
    \ produce such\ninformation and those that consume it. Regarding scalability,\
    \ two dimensions can be considered in the\nOrion Context Broker:\n•\nScalability\
    \ in the number of entities. In this case, the critical (scarce) resource is the\
    \ database\n(DB), pointing to the need to scale the MongoDB layer. The usual procedure\
    \ to scale MongoDB is\nthrough the use of shards described in the ofﬁcial documentation\
    \ of MongoDB.\n•\nScalability in operation requests to manage entities. In this\
    \ case, additional Orion Context Broker\ninstances can be used (each running on\
    \ a different VM), plus an additional VM ahead of them\nrunning the software load\
    \ balancer [46] to distribute the load between Orion nodes.\nSensors 2016, 16,\
    \ 1979\n19 of 22\nAs for data persistence in Cosmos through Cygnus-NGSI, in the\
    \ same way that an Orion\nprocesses farm can be created, additional Cygnus-NGSI\
    \ processes responsible for receiving Orion\nfarm notiﬁcations can be added. To\
    \ do that, it is advisable to deﬁne a mapping strategy for system\nentities. Thus,\
    \ subscriptions are established corresponding to a set A of entities that will\
    \ notify the\nCygnus-NGSI A process, another set of entities B which will notify\
    \ the Cygnus B process, etc.\nAnother important feature of Generic Enabler Data\
    \ Handling is the optimisation of trafﬁc sent\nto the IoT Backend. This functionality\
    \ helps achieve greater efﬁciency and reliability by using CEP\ntechniques. In\
    \ short, it is possible to increase system efﬁciency by injecting preprocessed\
    \ context\ninformation (more relevant for the IoT application) into the backend.\
    \ Thus the CEP, also discussed in\nthe Chapter on Data/Context Management, would\
    \ alleviate trafﬁc sent to Cygnus-NGSI.\nSummarising, it can be concluded that\
    \ the combination of: (1) optimal performance tuning of\nFIWARE components, (2)\
    \ the mechanisms provided by each component, (3) the horizontal scalability\n\
    of each instance in the cloud and (4) the vertical scalability of the platform,\
    \ makes the development of\nagricultural applications in futuristic scenarios\
    \ as described in Section 4.1 possible.\nAlthough the testbed is oriented towards\
    \ measurement of performance and data storage capacity,\nit is extendible to include\
    \ other properties. For this reason, it is possible to further the study of the\n\
    FIWARE platform (analysis of case 2 above, streaming with FIWARE) or conduct a\
    \ wide variety of\nstudies focusing on current IoT middleware. In addition, all\
    \ the software infrastructure that simulates\nthe sensors and the different ways\
    \ in which they generate the data (payload, data frequency generation,\nnumber\
    \ of processes and threads, etc.) can be easily used to test other IoT middleware.\
    \ In doing so,\nwe will be able to compare the results obtained with FIWARE with\
    \ other middleware platforms, such\nas WSO2, PubNub . . . opening up a future\
    \ avenue of research through its use with other platforms\nenabling comparative\
    \ studies.\nAcknowledgments: This work has been partially supported by the Spanish\

    \ 2030) adopted at the United Nations Conference related to\nSustainable Urban\
    \ Development (Habitat III) in the year 2016, has the goal of prompting cities\
    \ to\narchive the identiﬁed Sustainable Development Goals by the year 2030. The\
    \ Agenda 2030 states that\n“well-planned and well-managed urbanization can be\
    \ a powerful tool for sustainable development”.\nIn this context, cities can experiment\
    \ strategies of circular economy for the optimization of resources,\nwaste reduction,\
    \ reuse, and recycling [1].\nUnder the perspective of a circular economy, a city\
    \ focuses on waste management, keeps assets,\nand enables digital technology.\
    \ A study [2] identiﬁed several sectors for the implementation of a\ncircular\
    \ economy in a city. Those sectors are: built environment, energy, mobility, waste,\
    \ toilets,\nindustrial production, agri-food, citizens, and communities. Indicators\
    \ and criteria of circularity in\nbuilt environments proposed in this study [2]\
    \ are shown in Table 1.\nThe inclusion of IoT is considered an important enabler\
    \ of circular economy in a smart city.\nThe above-mentioned study [2] considers\
    \ IoT relevant to producers and designers, as they can obtain\nfeedback in real\
    \ time about products and infrastructures and keep materials in constant circulation.\n\
    On the other hand, the work about IoT discussed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\
    \ in the World\nEconomic Forum mentioned that intelligent assets can sense, communicate,\
    \ and store information by\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753; doi:10.3390/app9224753\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n2 of 39\nthemselves. Therefore,\
    \ this could lead to products that can monitor their deterioration and alert the\n\
    user, ﬁgure when they need to be repaired, and schedule their own maintenance\
    \ [3].\nTable 1. Criteria and indicators of circularity in built environments\
    \ [2].\nCriteria of Circularity\nIndicator of Circularity\nReuse of old buildings\n\
    Number of existing reused buildings\nEnergy eﬃciency\n% of energy reduction in\
    \ buildings\nGreenhouse gas emissions avoided\n% CO2 emissions avoided (tons/year)\n\
    Water consumption avoided\n% of water use reduction in buildings\nWaste avoided\
    \ in the construction\n% of waste reused\nThe smart city intends to convert its\
    \ existing infrastructure into intelligent goods that are capable\nof providing\
    \ enough information to make decisions more eﬃciently in real time. To achieve\
    \ this\ngoal, millions of sensors around the globe need an eﬃcient, long-range,\
    \ and low-energy-consuming\ntechnology. Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) solutions\
    \ like LoRa, SigFox, and NB-IoT meet\nthese requirements [4].\nThe data generated\
    \ by the components of an IoT ecosystem can contribute in two relevant ways\n\
    to a smart city model: (1) in the generation of a circular economy and (2) in\
    \ the creation of intelligence\nto improve decision-making processes by citizens\
    \ or city managers.\nThe aim of this study is the comprehension of technological\
    \ and functional aspects of IoT based\non LoRa, which could support the development\
    \ of a circular economy and help to generate smarter\nsolutions for decision-making.\
    \ LoRa has attracted the interest of researchers because it is an open\nstandard,\
    \ which contributes to the development of sustainable smart cities, since they\
    \ are linked to the\nconcepts of circular economy. Additionally, the intention\
    \ of this work is to identify the technological or\npractical barriers that have\
    \ limited the development of solutions and to ﬁnd possible future trends\nthat\
    \ could exist in the context of smart cities and IoT and how they could be exploited\
    \ by the industry\nand academy.\nThe rest of the present paper is structured as\
    \ follows. Section 2 presents the state of the art of\nsmart city, IoT, and LoRa\
    \ technology. Section 3 presents the method used for the qualitative analysis.\n\
    Section 4 presents an analysis of the results obtained from a systematic literature\
    \ review (SLR), with the\npurpose of determining the main aspects that have made\
    \ LoRa one of the most used technologies in\nthe development of smart cities applications.\
    \ Then, Section 5 discusses the strengths and weaknesses\nof LoRa-based implementations,\
    \ and ﬁnally Section 6 presents our conclusions.\n2. Background\n2.1. Dimensions\
    \ and Projections of Smart Cities\nUrbanization brings several advantages to the\
    \ society but also implies big challenges for city\nmanagers, since it increases\
    \ the demand for energy, water, sanitation, education, health services,\nand other\
    \ public services. Statistical data indicate that 4.50 billion of the world population,\
    \ which is\nclose to 68% of the global population, will live in cities by 2050\
    \ [5], and 426 million people will be over\n65 years of age by the same year [6].\
    \ Additionally, projections indicate that 80% of the global energy\nwill be consumed\
    \ in cities in 2030 [7], and about $7 trillion will be invested by 2050 in the\
    \ automobile\nsector, especially in self-driving cars [8]. In this situation,\
    \ the adoption of smart cities models to make\ncities more sustainable, competitive,\
    \ socially cohesive, and safe has become an indispensable task [9].\nSmart city\
    \ models are based on the idea of sustainable development considering people as\
    \ the\ncentral axis. They has six pillars: governance, economy, living, environment,\
    \ people, and mobility [10]\n(see Figure 1). From this perspective, city managers’\
    \ decision-making processes can be improved\nthrough the sensorization of the\
    \ diﬀerent aspects of the city such as environment, safety, traﬃc,\npollution,\
    \ and so on, for mitigating and preventing urban challenges. For example, Figure\
    \ 2 shows a\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n3 of 39\nsmart city sensor model, which\
    \ considers the sensorization of diﬀerent aspects related to industrial\nautomation,\
    \ pollution, energy, and traﬃc; the model also includes social interactions generated\
    \ by\npeople through diﬀerent social network channels and components of data analytics\
    \ using technologies\nsuch as cloud computing, big data, and high-performance\
    \ computing (HCP).\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3 of 40 \n \nFigure\

    \ Technologies for Smart Cities\nIt is known that IoT applications for smart cities\
    \ require an adequate network connectivity with\nlarge area coverage and eﬃcient\
    \ resource consumption, especially in terms of energy, since most IoT\ndevices\
    \ use battery for their operation. The low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) was\
    \ created to\nsatisfy these requirements. LPWAN is a group of technologies that\
    \ allow long range communications\nwith low power consumption, long battery life\
    \ (approximately 10 years), acceptable transmission rates,\ngood penetration characteristics,\
    \ and reduced cost of installation [12]. There are diﬀerent technologies\nthat\
    \ represents LPWAN (see Figure 3). Among these, LTE-M, EC-GSM, NB-IoT are considered\
    \ as 3rd\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, whereas SIGFOX, LoRa,\
    \ and Weightless are classiﬁed\nas non-3GPP standards. NB-IoT (narrow-band IoT)\
    \ was released in June 2016 and was developed by\nthe 3GPP consortium; it is compatible\
    \ with LTE and has a coverage range of 15 km and a transmission\nspeed of around\
    \ 150 kbps. NB-IoT is a licensed technology which has been deployed in 79 countries\n\
    with an investment of $598 billion. NB-IoT uses OFDMA modulation. On the other\
    \ hand, LoRa was\ndeveloped by Cycleo and was released in 2012 as a non-licensed\
    \ technology. It has a range of 11 km\nand a transmission speed of around of 10\
    \ kbps. LoRa networks have been implemented in 34 countries\nwith an investment\
    \ value of $241 billion. Finally, Sigfox is a non-licensed technology which was\n\
    developed in Toulouse and released in 2009. It has a coverage range of 13 km and\
    \ a transmission speed\nof 100 bps [16].\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ in 2015. \nHowever, they still reflect the significant growth of IoT implementations\
    \ for smart cities. Gartner, in \nanother study published in 2018, estimated that\
    \ IoT would grow to reach 1.1 billion devices in 2019 \nand close to 9.7 billion\

    \ that IoT applications for smart cities require an adequate network connectivity\
    \ with \nlarge area coverage and efficient resource consumption, especially in\
    \ terms of energy, since most IoT \ndevices use battery for their operation. The\

    \ LPWAN is a group of technologies that allow long range communications \nwith\
    \ low power consumption, long battery life (approximately 10 years), acceptable\
    \ transmission \nrates, good penetration characteristics, and reduced cost of\
    \ installation [12]. There are different \ntechnologies that represents LPWAN\
    \ (see Figure 3). Among these, LTE-M, EC-GSM, NB-IoT are \nconsidered as 3rd Generation\
    \ Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, whereas SIGFOX, LoRa, and \nWeightless\

    \ that it is supported by many worldwide technology leaders, it has two model\
    \ services,\ni.e., a provider network service and a private network, and the number\
    \ of messages that can be sent\nin the LPWAN infrastructure is not limited (whereas\
    \ Sigfox only allows 140 messages per day and\nper device) [19].\nOther important\
    \ characteristics of LoRa are: (1) LoRa presents robustness against multi-path\n\
    fading or Doppler eﬀect; (2) LoRa also uses a proprietary chirp spread spectrum\
    \ (CSS) modulation to\narchive distances greater than 700 km, and the CSS modulation\
    \ provides robustness against interference\nand a very low signal-to-noise ratio\
    \ (SNR) that allows the receiver to demodulate the signal; (3) LoRa is\nsuitable\
    \ for applications that require a very long battery lifetime and has a reduced\
    \ installation\ncost; (4) LoRa allows tuning several physical transmission properties,\
    \ such as bandwidth (BW),\ncentral frequency, coding rate (CR), spreading factor\
    \ (SF), and transmission power [18]; (5) LoRa uses a\nlong-range start architecture\
    \ (see Figure 4) in which gateways are used to relay messages between end\nnodes;\

    \ sensors, complementary technologies, data science, citizen interaction, LoRaWAN.\n\
    The LoRaWAN allows the delivery of the data generated by diﬀerent sensors and\
    \ IT supplements\nto the data science component. Such data, through the data analysis\
    \ process, are converted to patterns\nor anomalies, which are used by citizens\
    \ and city administrators for adequate decision-making.\nOn the other hand, sensors\
    \ allow obtaining parameter values that are relevant in each subcategory\nof the\
    \ smart city. In this sense, we identiﬁed three groups of sensors that are the\
    \ mostly used in\nIoT solution based on LoRa. The ﬁrst group of sensors is focused\
    \ on obtaining parameter values\nsuch as pH, loan, and temperature, which are\
    \ related to operating conditions of certain city domains\n(e.g., agriculture,\
    \ energy, and environment). For instance, in agriculture, the pH and temperature\
    \ values\nallow the identiﬁcation of conditions that are suitable for planting\
    \ or harvesting. In water management,\nthe pH value allows the evaluation of water\
    \ quality. The second group of sensors includes those\ndevices focused on the\
    \ measurement of gases (e.g., air pollution, oxygen, and ozone). This type of\n\
    sensors (according to our qualitative analysis) are greatly accepted especially\
    \ in the environmental\ndomain to evaluate the levels of pollution in a city.\
    \ Finally, the third group includes those sensors\nused for motion detection.\
    \ These types of sensor have had great momentum with the development of\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n13 of 39\nvaluable applications such as smart parking (sensors\
    \ are used for the detection of available parking\nspaces) and security systems\
    \ in smart home solutions.\nThe second component, which we have called “Complementary\
    \ Technologies”, considers those\ndevices used to obtain additional data for speciﬁc\
    \ applications. In this analysis, we identiﬁed three\ngroups of elements. The\
    \ ﬁrst one includes local-area coverage devices that allow the determination of\n\
    patterns of mobility of people through the use of iBeacon. The second group includes\
    \ those devices\nof personal-area coverage that allow getting values of physiological\
    \ parameters of people, such as\nbreath rate and blood pressure. In this group,\
    \ elements related to wearable devices and biomarkers are\nincluded. The third\
    \ group includes devices of wide area coverage that allow increasing the sources\
    \ of\ninformation to complement the data obtained by IoT devices. For example,\
    \ the use of drones allows a\nsystem to get geospatial images of cultivation areas\
    \ that, together with the pH and temperature values,\nwould allow determining\
    \ the cultivation conditions with more accuracy.\nThe third component, called\
    \ data science, considers the techniques used for analyzing the data\nobtained\
    \ from the other components. It includes the machine learning technologies used\
    \ for determining\npatterns of behaviors (classiﬁed as normal or abnormal). It\
    \ gives to the citizens or city managers an\nextra perspective for taking decisions.\
    \ In the case of agriculture, the detection of an anomalous behavior\ncould be\
    \ related to a possible plague that aﬀects crops. The data generated by IoT devices,\
    \ sensors,\nand IT supplementary devices are large, so it is necessary to use\
    \ cloud or fog computing platforms to\nstore and process them. Since sending all\
    \ the data to cloud platforms can be expensive or can generate\ndelays, the use\
    \ of fog computing platforms has grown, becoming more relevant in recent years.\n\
    The fourth component is focused on the accessibility of data for citizens and\
    \ city managers.\nIoT solutions must generate information for improving the decision-making\
    \ process. Therefore, it is\nimportant to deliver the appropriate information\
    \ to the concerned people using, e.g., SMSs,\nmobile applications, and web portals.\
    \ The way of presenting the information must consider aspects of\nuser experience\
    \ and accessibility.\nFigure 12 shows an example of a system. In this example,\
    \ sensors use a Local ID for identiﬁcation\nand the information gathered by sensors\
    \ are sent to the IoT gateway (GW) in ﬁxed intervals of time.\nThe IoT GW receives\
    \ the Local ID sensor and sensed values which are redirected to FaaS, Fog, or\
    \ Cloud\ncomputing infrastructures. The values sent by the sensors are stored\
    \ in local database for data analysis.\nThen, based on the result of the analysis,\
    \ control messages are sent to the actuators [18].\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, x FOR\

    \ Information from the broker can be accessed in real time by the\nuser using\
    \ PCs or mobile devices [22].\nThe following subsections describe the operation\
    \ process between the diﬀerent components of the\nIoT ecosystem in relation to\
    \ smart city subcategories.\n4.1.1. Agriculture\nIoT supports the process of data\
    \ analytics providing environmental parameters such as humidity\nand temperature\
    \ that are important for the life of plants and animals [22]. Variations in temperature\n\
    and humidity are associated with climate changes and can lead to the appearance\
    \ of pests or diseases.\nThe size and shape of the sensors used in agriculture\
    \ depend on the characteristics of the plants\nexamined. They can be expensive,\
    \ e.g., those used in large farms, and the information they provide can\nbe enhanced\
    \ by complementary data such as geo-space images [23]. The data generated by sensors\n\
    can be processed by cloud or edge computing [24]. Additionally, it is possible\
    \ to determine adverse\neﬀects on the plantation by using mathematical algorithms\
    \ as time series [25].\nThe agriculture sector faces enormous challenges due to\
    \ the need of producing food for the\nworld’s population, which will reach 9.6\
    \ billion people by 2050, according to the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization\
    \ (FAO). This means that the increase in food production must grow by 70% in the\
    \ next\nyears [26]. One alternative to address this challenge is improving the\
    \ quality and quantity of the\nagricultural production. For this, the automation\
    \ and continuous monitoring of pest and diseases\nas well as the identiﬁcation\
    \ of optimum weather and geographic ﬁeld parameters would be very\nuseful. IoT\
    \ solutions integrated with the use of drones and 3D mapping allow the collection\
    \ of\ninformation about the geography of a ﬁeld and the soil composition to plan\
    \ the plantation process [27].\nDrones monitoring the status of crops and farms\
    \ in real time facilitate the access of data coming from\ndangerous areas. In\
    \ many cases, sensor nodes are installed in the farm, and the gateway node is\
    \ carried\nby a drone to gather information from the sensors; then, the data are\
    \ sent to servers, fog or cloud\ninfrastructures, for processing.\nSmart irrigation\
    \ is another relevant application in agriculture that allows utilizing water eﬃciently\n\
    at the appropriate moment and in the right amount. The gateway node of an IoT\
    \ architecture can\nsend commands to irrigation nodes to activate or deactivate\
    \ a solenoid valve for starting or stopping\nthe irrigation process [28]. The\
    \ use of IoT solutions to determine the optimal water temperature and\nsalinity\
    \ allows taking actions for increasing the survival rate of larvae and adult crabs.\
    \ Another IoT\napplication in agriculture regards water quality monitoring. It\
    \ is based on sensors that determine water\npH, temperature, and salinity and\
    \ deliver such information to the farmer in an intuitive way [29].\nFor forestry,\
    \ it is important to ﬁnd methods for the automatic monitoring of parameters like\
    \ temperature,\nhumidity, noise, solar radiation, pressure, soil, and moisture.\
    \ Applications in forestry present major\nproblems concerning the Fresnel, zone\
    \ due to obstacles [30].\n4.1.2. Healthcare\nIoT applications in healthcare are\
    \ focused on the monitoring of physiological and environmental\naspects by the\
    \ user to determine his/her health status [31]. The ubiquitous characteristic\
    \ of IoT allows\nhealthcare solutions for the follow-up of patients, especially\
    \ those in critical conditions such as\npeople with mental disorders [32]. IoT\
    \ in healthcare also allows the development of systems that\nsupport people with\
    \ physical limitations and those who have chronic diseases [33]. In the ﬁeld of\n\
    health, the monitoring process is intended to be the least invasive for people.\
    \ To this aim, the use of\nwearables is considered [34]. The data generated by\
    \ the diﬀerent components can be processed in Fog\ncomputing [35]. The use of\
    \ Cloud computing is considered in healthcare applications for processing\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n15 of 39\nand storage, but in some cases, privacy issues\
    \ have risen, since the information managed by the systems\nis very sensible.\n\
    4.1.3. Traﬃc Control and Transportation\nIoT applications related to traﬃc control\
    \ or transportation are mainly focused on parking systems,\ntraﬃc, streetlights,\
    \ congestion monitoring, and real-time public transportation. Generally, traﬃc\
    \ in the\ncenter of a city is an important issue, not only because it increases\
    \ the time of transportation for the\ncitizens, but also because it decreases\
    \ the gross domestic product (GDP) [34]. Smart lights are used to\nimprove power\
    \ eﬃciency and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Led lights consume approximately\n\
    0.49 MWH per led lamp, but the use of IoT allows the development of automatic\
    \ dimming controls,\nimproving the power eﬃciency of these light systems by over\
    \ 85% [36]; dimming controls interact with\npassive infrared sensors that detect\
    \ the presence of people and vehicles. Magnetometers allow the\ndetection of objects\
    \ like cars, motorcycle, and transportation vehicles. On the basis of data recorded\
    \ from\nsensors at a traﬃc intersection, it is possible to design a congestion\
    \ model to calculate the operating\ntime of traﬃc lights for diﬀerent lanes [37].\
    \ Finding empty parking spaces is another important\nissue for many cities, but\
    \ the use of magnetic sensors is prone to deliver false positives. Three main\n\
    challenges in the design of parking solutions based on magnetic sensors are (i)\
    \ environmental changes;\n(ii) special characteristics of parking slots; and (iii)\
    \ time-varying factors due to geomagnetic ﬁelds or\ndwindling battery lives [38].\
    \ Some researchers indicate that alternatives to sensing technologies such\nas\
    \ RFID, ultrasonic sensors, or video–image processing require excessive overhead\
    \ for installation\nand maintenance, while solutions that involve the detection\
    \ of signals reﬂected from vehicles like\nmicrowave radars or ultrasonic sensors\
    \ increase the power consumption and are extremely susceptible\nto environment\
    \ interference. iBeacons and RFID are also used to determinate the available number\
    \ of\npark slots [39].\nInformation about buses is an aspect considered relevant\
    \ in the transportation domain because it\ndelivers data for citizens about when\
    \ a bus will arrive to a bus station. Bus information is sometimes\ndiﬃcult to\
    \ collect in a precise manner due factors like weather and congestion. One solution\
    \ of this\nissue is the usage of GPS for tracking bus location. However, it requires\
    \ expensive communication\ncharges, and the user needs a mobile network to access\
    \ such information. An cheaper alternative\ncould be LoRa [40]. A bus location\
    \ information acquired by GPS would be broadcasted to bus stations\nusing the\
    \ LoRa network. This solution would reduce communication charges [41]. Other solutions\n\
    that could be introduced using LoRa are air pollution and road surface condition\
    \ monitoring [42].\nThe use of bikes for transportation in cities is growing as\
    \ an alternative to reduce air pollution.\nIn this sense, citizens can borrow\
    \ a bike and return it to any bike station around a city. Sensors are\ninstalled\
    \ in bikes for collecting real-time information about the routes where a bike\
    \ was used.\nAdditionally, the system could tell the user where a nearby bike\
    \ station is. In contrast to traﬃc\nmodels developed for buses in which some movement\
    \ patterns are expected, bikes networks are more\nunpredictable and complex to\
    \ deﬁne, since each user will move in a diﬀerent way. The integration of\nweather\
    \ information could add new services for the user, allowing him/her to know if\
    \ the weather\nconditions are comfortable for riding a bike [43].\n4.1.4. Energy\n\
    Accuracy in electrical billing is highly needed, especially with the widespread\
    \ use of smart-home\nappliances in the daily lives. The development of automatic\
    \ meter reading (AMR) avoids the need for\na person to visit a physical location\
    \ for reading the meter and reduces the possibility of reading the\ndata wrongly\
    \ [44]. Currently, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) solutions are used in this\
    \ context,\nbut they are quite expensive and can lose SMS packets. In this situation,\
    \ the use of LoRa would allow\nthe creation of a private network including a third-party\
    \ service. To improve the electrical billing\nservice, a two-way communication\
    \ between users and providers could be implemented. This would\nallow the user\
    \ to see the energy consumption in real time.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n16 of\
    \ 39\nAnother approach related to energy is the monitoring of power plants. With\
    \ the growing of the\nworldwide population, fossil fuel consumption has been increasing\
    \ in the last years. For this reason,\nphotovoltaic (PV) power plants are considered\
    \ as an alternative solution. Since the PV plants are highly\ndependent on solar\
    \ irradiation, ambient temperature, and atmospheric conditions, IoT solutions\
    \ could\nallow monitoring these parameters in real time [45].\n4.1.5. Environment\n\
    Air pollution is the product of human activities executed daily, such as the use\
    \ of transport vehicles\nand of appliances in residential and industrial settings.\
    \ These activities can generate a big amount\nof carbon monoxide that aﬀects the\
    \ air quality. If pollution is uncontrolled, it could cause cancer,\nrespiratory\
    \ illnesses, and cardio-vascular diseases [46]. The World Health Organization\
    \ has identiﬁed\ntolerable pollution level thresholds and has deﬁned the concept\
    \ of “atmospheric pollution” [43],\nwhich refers to the presence of airborne pollutants\
    \ such as fuels, carbon, bacteria, and other microscopic\nparticles in the atmosphere.\
    \ Six pollutants, i.e., ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide\n(SO2),\
    \ carbon monoxide (CO), and two types of ﬁne particulate matters (PM10, PM2.5)\
    \ are detrimental\nto both environment and public health [46]. Table 4 shows the\
    \ relation between pollutants and diseases.\nAir quality is directly related to\
    \ people health and quality of life. Typically, people spend more than\n90% of\
    \ their time in indoor environments [47]. CO2 levels over 1000 ppm indicate a\
    \ potential air\nproblem in indoor environments. In this sense, the continuous\
    \ monitoring of CO2 concentration is\nimportant to detect any anomaly in the quality\
    \ of air.\nTable 4. Diseases due to pollutants. PM: particulate matter.\nPollutants\n\
    Health Disease\nNO2\nLung damage\nCO\nRespiratory and hearth diseases\nPM 2.5\n\
    PM10\nSO2\nAsthma\nO3\nThe use of IoT solutions in ambient assisted living (AAL)\
    \ permits the design of smart objects with\nthe capabilities of sensing the environment\
    \ and executing speciﬁc actions for their users. IoT sensors\ninstalled in the\
    \ urban environment also allows the detection of pollution concentration in real\
    \ time [48].\nWith the collected information by the aforementioned solutions in\
    \ conjunction with machine learning\nalgorithms and data analytics, it is possible\
    \ to identify and generate warnings in case of high levels of\nair pollution.\n\
    4.1.6. Waste Management\nThe increasing population density generates more garbage\
    \ every day, which increases the need for\nmore physical space for waste and the\
    \ associated costs to clean, bury, and burn it. In waste management,\nthree important\
    \ aspects to deﬁne are: (i) the collecting routes; (ii) an adequate waste classiﬁcation\n\
    system; and (iii) the management of the physical space for garbage. A waste management\
    \ system can\nconsider a compression device; when a garbage container is full,\
    \ a step motor is activated to compress\nthe garbage and save space [49]. Additionally,\
    \ with the use of a variety of sensors, such as infrared,\nultra-sonic, and methane\
    \ sensors, it is possible to generate an automatic classiﬁcation of garbage\n\
    and distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable garbage. The use of the\
    \ RFID technology also\nallows the identiﬁcation of waste to indicate the correct\
    \ garbage bin where it should be deposited.\nAn important aspect to be considered\
    \ in this work is data conﬁdentiality, since the garbage of a\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 4753\n17 of 39\nperson or family can contain sensitive information. Regarding\
    \ this issue, the authors of some studies\nconsidered the usage of secure communication\
    \ protocols such as https in their solutions [50].\nWastewater overﬂow monitoring\
    \ is another important issue for the modern city, and consists,\nfor example,\
    \ in detecting possible problems in the ﬂow of wastewater and in analyzing the\
    \ eﬀect\nof waste in sensitive areas. To control wastewater, IoT systems can uses\
    \ radar sensor platforms,\nsewer pump stations, and LoRa to cover a large portion\
    \ of a city [51]. With a single gateway, it is\npossible to collect the information\
    \ of water-waste levels of sewer pump stations and then analyze the\ndata to estimate\
    \ the pump ﬂow; this allow identifying when sewer pump stations are full, avoiding\
    \ the\noverﬂow of wastewater.\n4.2. Analysis of the Network and Transport Capabilities\n\
    4.2.1. Data Layer\nData packets in LoRa can contain up to 255 bytes. This characteristic\
    \ makes LoRa a low-speed data\ntransfer technology, which is acceptable in sensors\
    \ networks. Data frames in IoT applications can have\ndiﬀerent lengths which depend\
    \ on diﬀerent factors such as type of data, numbers of packets to be sent,\ndesign\
    \ of the application, and delay requirements. According to our quality assessment,\
    \ we identiﬁed\nIoT solutions including short packets of 8 bytes or long packets\
    \ up to 128 bytes. For example, a smart\nlight monitoring solution used 10-byte\
    \ frames for communication among lights [52], an agriculture\napplications (monitoring\
    \ of a star fruit plantation) used 5-byte-long frames [53], and a bike monitoring\n\
    solution used 12-byte-long frames to determine routes for cyclers [54]. Additionally,\
    \ a health application\nused 93-byte data frames to send health information such\
    \ as systolic/diastolic data and pulse [34].\nIn the case of water quality, information\
    \ about salinity and temperature was sent in a 17-byte data\nframe [55]. The variable\
    \ data frame length of LoRa provides greater ﬂexibility in the development of\n\
    IoT applications for smart cities.\nThe length of the data frame includes payload\
    \ and header, and this length can impact on the\ntransmission time and energy\
    \ consumption. Technical factors that can inﬂuence the data length are\nBW, SF,\
    \ and throughput. On the other hand, LoRa uses the chirp protocol. The “up-chirp”\
    \ moves\nupward in frequency, and the “down chirp” moves below the central frequency;\
    \ the central frequency\ndepends of the geographic region and is 915 MHz in the\
    \ USA (also frequencies in the range between\n902 MHz to 928 MHz), 868 MHz in\
    \ Europe (planned 433 MHz), 470 MHz in China, 923 MHz in Japan,\n915 MHz in Australia\
    \ (also frequencies between 915 MHz to 928 MHz), and 433 MHz in the rest of\n\
    Asia. LoRa uses three bandwidths: 125 KHz, 250 KHz, and 500 KHz, and SF, that\
    \ is the duration of the\nchirp, can be SF7 for the shortest time in air and SF\
    \ 12 for the longest time in air [56].\nTables 5 and 6 and Figure 13 show the\
    \ relation among data rate, frequency, throughput, and payload\nin LoRa technology.\
    \ If the selected SF is high, then throughput and payload are low. For example,\n\
    for the same bandwidth of 125 KHz, in the frequency of 868 MHz, Table 4 indicates\
    \ that if the selected\nSF is 7, the throughput is 5470 bps, and the payload is\
    \ 230 bytes. However, if the selected SF is 12,\nthen the throughput decreases\
    \ to 250 bps, and the payload is reduced to 59 bytes. Bandwidth selection\nalso\
    \ aﬀects the length of the payload. For example, in Table 6, for the same frequency\
    \ of 915 MHz and\nthe same SF of 7, if the bandwidth selected is 500 KHz, the\
    \ throughput is 21,900 bps, and the payload\nis 230 bytes; in contrast, if the\
    \ selected bandwidth is 125 KHz, the throughput decreases to 5470 bps,\nand the\
    \ payload increases to 250 bytes.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n18 of 39\nTable 5.\

    \ different parameters, such as received signal \nstrength level (RSSI), signal-to-noise\

    \ type applications, location of the \nsensors, and type of communication, i.e.,\
    \ point-to-point or central-gateway connections. These \naspects are mainly associated\
    \ with the design requirements of the application. Table 7 presents an \noverview\
    \ of the type of coverage for each subcategory of smart city applications. On\

    \ communication between a diagnostic \nFigure 13. Relation among data frame, spread\

    LoRa’s coverage can be measured on the basis of diﬀerent parameters, such as received\
    \ signal\nstrength level (RSSI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and packet delivery\
    \ ate (PDR). SNR is an indicator of\nthe link quality with respect to a radio\
    \ channel´s environmental parameters [57]. IoT applications in\nsmart city require\
    \ diﬀerent coverage areas depending on the type applications, location of the\
    \ sensors,\nand type of communication, i.e., point-to-point or central-gateway\
    \ connections. These aspects are\nmainly associated with the design requirements\
    \ of the application. Table 7 presents an overview of the\ntype of coverage for\
    \ each subcategory of smart city applications. On the basis of our quality assessment,\n\
    healthcare applications consider a ﬁxed communication between a diagnostic system\
    \ and a base station,\nbut there are also some applications, e.g., those focused\
    \ on patient follow-up, which require signal\nquality during communication when\
    \ the objects are in movement (the speed of a patient can be in\nthe ranges of\
    \ 1–3 km/h, 5–8 km/h, and 1–30 km/h) [58]. In the case of traﬃc control or transportation\n\
    applications, the monitoring of streetlight systems requires communication among\
    \ multiple nodes\nlocated within a short range. The optimal distance between streets\
    \ light is around of 35 meters [52].\nThe RSSI value can be used to determine\
    \ the location of the user in parking systems through the use of\niBeacon [40].\
    \ If the RSSI value is high, then the user is considered to be close to a parking\
    \ slot.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n19 of 39\nTable 7. Localization of sensors\

    \ cases like tracking of patients, it is necessary to communicate with objects\n\
    in movement. In this scenario, multipath fading and Doppler eﬀects are more relevant.\
    \ In traﬃc\napplications, RSSI is used for detecting parking slot occupancy. The\
    \ diﬀerence between RSSI values is\nused to know when a vehicle is arriving at\

    \ objective of the communications infrastructure is to interconnect nodes and\
    \ generate a\nway to access the data generated in diﬀerent domains of the city.\n\
    4.3.1. Sensors\nSensorization allows abstracting data from the physical world’s\
    \ to the digital world. The continuous\nmonitoring of physical variables like\
    \ temperature, humidity, and pH allow users to take decisions\nabout speciﬁc aspects\
    \ of smart city domains. Table 9 and Figure 14 present an overview of the sensors\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n20 of 39\nused in smart city subcategories, based on\
    \ our quality assessment. In the agriculture subcategory,\nsome environmental\
    \ parameters such as humidity, temperature, and luminosity must be measured\n\
    to predict climate changes [22]. This detection can be based on a single-sensor\
    \ or on a multi-sensor\nplatform collecting microclimate data [23]. Magnetic sensors\
    \ can be used in smart parking applications\nto detect empty park slots. This\
    \ type of sensors can be inﬂuenced by nearby ferrous metal objects like\nbicycles\
    \ or adjacent vehicles. The earth’s magnetic ﬁeld can also alter the data generated\
    \ by this type of\nsensors [39]. Light sensors allow the determination of the\
    \ amount of light. This is useful in plantations\nas well as in AAL or smart homes\
    \ to turn on the lights in the night. Light sensors can be aﬀected by\noutdoor\
    \ lighting conditions like clouds or stationary objects that block the sun light.\
    \ Dust sensors\nare based on the light-scattering detection technology that estimates\
    \ the concentration of particles\nthat are suspended in the air. Through the evaluation\
    \ of the amount of light that is backscattered by\nthe particles, it is possible\
    \ to determine the air quality [62]. Some aspects that are important when\nusing\
    \ sensors are (i) timestamp and (ii) sensor identiﬁcation. The timestamp between\
    \ a node and the\ngateway must be synchronized; this allows validation of the\
    \ information received by the nodes as new\nor old [25]. For sensor identiﬁcation,\
    \ a Local ID could be used. This is useful for knowing which device\nis sending\
    \ the information.\nTable 9. Types of sensors used in diﬀerent subcategories of\

    \ \nNodes must not only measure the required parameters in the different contexts\
    \ of smart cities, \nbut also need to send the data collected in real time. Depending\
    \ on the type of application in the city, \nnodes may require a set of sensors.\
    \ For instance, to measure nitrate concentration levels, the node \nneeds to manage\
    \ an array of gas sensors including CO2, NOx, and O2 sensors [70]. In some cases,\
    \ \nnodes can have different roles. For example, in eHealth, there are safe nodes\
    \ and health nodes which \ncollect environmental and physiological characteristics.\
    \ In agriculture, nodes are structured on the \nbasis of roles, i.e., as measuring\
    \ and receiving nodes [71]. The first ones collect data, the second ones \nexecute\
    \ some specific action. In projects of measurement of nitrate levels, one node\
    \ is a sensing node \nand is in charge of collecting water samples from a stream\
    \ or lake and measuring nitrate \nconcentrations [63]. \nIn order to be able to\
    \ sense a specific aspect of the city, several nodes may be required. For \ninstance,\
    \ in smart farming, to determine the presence of castors, about 36 nodes are necessary\
    \ to cover \nfour locations [72]. In some deployments, thousands of nodes can\
    \ be implemented in a LoRa network \n[73]. This is an advantage of LoRa; it can\
    \ support multiple nodes, consuming little transmission \npower and allowing the\
    \ delivery of frames with few bytes. Nodes are allowed to transmit up to14 \n\

    \ 2019, 9, 4753\n23 of 39\nIn order to be able to sense a speciﬁc aspect of the\
    \ city, several nodes may be required. For instance,\nin smart farming, to determine\
    \ the presence of castors, about 36 nodes are necessary to cover four\nlocations\
    \ [72]. In some deployments, thousands of nodes can be implemented in a LoRa network\
    \ [73].\nThis is an advantage of LoRa; it can support multiple nodes, consuming\
    \ little transmission power and\nallowing the delivery of frames with few bytes.\
    \ Nodes are allowed to transmit up to14 dBm in Europe\nand up to 22 dBm in America\
    \ [74]. For transmission, nodes use a transceiver for communication [75,76].\n\
    According to our literature review, diﬀerent modules are used for the communication\
    \ between\nnodes, for example, ESP8266, SX1272, and SX 1276. ESP8266 is an integrated\
    \ low-consumption chip\nwith 17 General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) ports that\
    \ allow incorporating LoRa transceiver modules.\nThe operating voltage of ESP8266\
    \ is in the average range between 3 and 3.6 V, and the operating current\nis 80\
    \ mA. The operating temperature range is from −40 to 125 ◦C. The main communication\
    \ buses used\nby ESP8266 are SPI, I2C, UART, and the module supports protocols\
    \ such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP.\nESP8266 uses three operation modes:\n•\nActive\
    \ mode: At its full capacity, it consumes about 170 mA.\n•\nSleep mode: A real-time\
    \ clock (RTC) is active for synchronization. In this mode, ESP8266 maintains\n\
    data connection and does not require re-establishing the connection again. In\
    \ this mode, the chip\nconsumes between 0.6 mA and 1 mA.\n•\nDeep Sleep: The RTC\
    \ is not operational. Unsaved data are lost. In this mode, the device consumes\n\
    about 20 uA.\nThe SX1272 provides ultra-long-range spread spectrum communication\
    \ and high interference\nimmunity. The operation frequency is 860–1000 MHz. It\
    \ has other characteristics such as 157 dB\nas the maximum link budget, programmable\
    \ bit rate up to 300 kbps, high sensitivity down to\n−137 dBm, modulation types\

    \ kbps, its high sensitivity is down to\n−148 dBm, and the used modulation types\

    Smart City\nIoT Applications in Smart Cities\nBuenos Aires\nBuenos Aires uses\
    \ IoT to monitor parameters such as energy consumption, water level in\nreservoirs,\
    \ and environmental conditions in 40 schools in the city. Another project is\n\
    focused on measuring the ﬂow of rivers to avoid ﬂooding in nearby towns.\nAdditionally,\
    \ Buenos Aires makes use of IoT to create a scalable lighting system to make\n\
    the city safer, more sustainable, and energy-eﬃcient and to reduce light pollution\
    \ [80,81].\nAmsterdam\nAmsterdam has developed projects that use IoT focused on\
    \ solving traﬃc-related\nproblems by installing sensors that monitor the state\
    \ of traﬃc ﬂow and parking\navailability. Such solutions have reduced the time\
    \ of searching available parking lots\nby 43% [82].\nSao Paulo\nBrazil has 400,000\
    \ connected devices and invests around 25 percent of Brazilian GDP.\nSeveral cities\
    \ in Brazil, including Sao Paulo, have promoted the development of\napplications\
    \ for the measurement of electrical energy, irrigation systems for farms,\nand\
    \ sensorization of street lighting systems [83].\nZurich\nZurich considers the\
    \ use of IoT-LoRa for projects such as (a) no bike left (to recover\nabandoned\
    \ bikes), (b) detection of power distribution grid failure, and (c) real-time\n\
    occupancy rate monitoring in public transportation [84].\nOttawa\nIn 2009, the\
    \ city of Ottawa launched a digital storefront using a sensor structure.\nIn addition,\
    \ the city works with the Centre for Excellence in Next-Generation Networks\n\
    (CENGN) to accelerate the inclusion of ICT in the city. CENGN provides an LPWAN\n\
    infrastructure (i.e., an antenna and a gateway) to develop smart health, smart\
    \ farming,\nand other applications [85,86].\nBeijing\nBeijing invests around $5\
    \ billion in IoT projects related to transportation and\nenvironmental management.\
    \ Beijing’s Palace Museum uses IoT solutions to detect the\nmovement of relics\
    \ that may be associated with a robbery. Another problem that the city\nof Beijing\
    \ seeks to solve with the use of IoT and cognitive computing is the reduction\
    \ of\nsmoke in the environment by installing several sensors to determine the\
    \ sources of\npollution [87].\nBoston\nBoston works on smart city projects related\
    \ to autonomous vehicles, intelligent parking\nlots, and interactive public art.\
    \ The city uses cameras and sensors to learn how people\nnavigate and interact\
    \ with the city streets of Boston [88].\nMexico\nMexico City seeks to strengthen\
    \ the domains of governance, public management,\nand transportation. Mexico City\
    \ tries to solve transportation and traﬃc problems by\ndetermining car ﬂow patterns\

    Smart cities promote spaces of participation for citizens and establish communication\
    \ channels\namong citizens, city administration (e.g., medical, transportation,\
    \ and energy departments), and city\nservices (e.g., parking, traﬃc management,\
    \ and welfare systems). The interaction city–citizen can\nbe improved with IoT–LoRa\
    \ solutions. This type of technology inclusion promotes new dynamics\nin the social\
    \ behavior of people. In the context of energy, citizens could ﬁnd alternatives\
    \ to reduce\ntheir energy bills. To this goal, research proposals are focused\
    \ on designing smart home solutions.\nSmart home solutions allow tracking electrical\

    \ LoRa make possible the implementation of the aforementioned three phases\nbeneﬁting\

    \ even to long\ndistances. The data are sent in real time, allowing citizens and\
    \ city managers to make eﬀective decisions\nin a timely manner.\n5.5. Challenges\
    \ of LoRa in Smart Cities\nAccording to our qualitative analysis, the inclusion\
    \ of IoT solutions based on LoRa involves two\nrelevant challenges for the industrial\
    \ and research ﬁelds:\n5.5.1. Security and Privacy\nIoT devices gather data from\
    \ critical infrastructures of the city, and such data are used in\ndecision-making\
    \ processes at the city administration level. Therefore, IoT solutions must ensure\
    \ the\nprivacy and security of the gathered data. However, the heterogeneity and\
    \ limited capacity of devices\nmake diﬃcult the implementation of security systems.\
    \ Although LoRa uses a security scheme for\ncommunication among diﬀerent entities\
    \ through of the use of security keys, most works considered in\nthis study do\
    \ not explain in detail the security aspects of their solutions. Only a few works\
    \ indicate\nthat they used the default security mechanism included in the LoRa\
    \ standard.\nIn this sense, diﬀerent topics related to IoT security such as threat\
    \ and vulnerability detection,\nmalware and intrusion detection, operating systems\
    \ security, threat models/attack strategies in IoT\necosystem and IoT forensics\
    \ are still a challenge in industrial and scientiﬁc ﬁelds.\nIoT ecosystem should\
    \ the use of security frameworks to assure and validate the security aspects.\n\
    Authentication, conﬁdentiality, and integrity should cover data, IoT devices,\
    \ and external components\nsuch as fog, cloud, or web apps.\n5.5.2. IoT Analytics\n\
    IoT systems generate large volumes of data which are processed using cloud or\
    \ fog computing\ntechnologies. Data analytics can convert such data in valuable\
    \ information that allow taking eﬀective\ndecisions. In other words, the synergy\
    \ of IoT technology and data analytics allows the generation of\nreal-time decision\
    \ support systems.\nIt is important to indicate that some research proposals included\
    \ data science approaches,\nand the most used data mining or machine learning\
    \ techniques were decision tree (50% of cases),\nneuronal networks (ANN, 35% of\
    \ cases), and time series (15% of cases).\nWe also identiﬁed a small minority\
    \ of works including decision support systems (DSS); also we\nfound that descriptive\
    \ analysis was most commonly used; only a reduced number of works considered\n\
    prescriptive analysis.\nTaking into account that decisions at the city level have\
    \ a strong impact on economic and social\naspects, prescriptive analysis and DSS\
    \ could be more adequate to get a complete visualization of smart\ncity domains.\n\
    5.6. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats Analysis of LoRa in Smart\
    \ City Applications\nLoRa has been widely used in diﬀerent smart city projects.\
    \ The selection of LoRa in diﬀerent\ncities was due to the strengths and opportunities\
    \ that this technology oﬀers. In Table 15, we present a\nStrengths, Weaknesses,\
    \ Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis of LoRa based on the literature\n\

    \ in the Smart City Initiative\nIn this subsection, we analyze the contribution\
    \ of research proposals related to IoT and LoRa to\nbuild a smart city in the\
    \ context of a circular economy according to the New Urban Agenda approach.\n\
    To carry out this analysis, three hypotheses were taken from reference [95]. These\
    \ hypotheses were\nadapted for this study and are described below.\nThe ﬁrst hypothesis\
    \ is loose integration. in other words, the proposals of IoT–LoRa are focused\n\
    on solving a speciﬁc need for a subcategory of the smart city, such as energy,\
    \ water, health, but they\nhave not considered a wider scope from the perspective\
    \ of smart city. LoRa’s proposals have been\ndeveloped independently from the\
    \ criteria or indicators of the smart city.\nThe second hypothesis is tight integration,\
    \ in other words, IoT-LoRa proposals focus on covering\na criterion or speciﬁc\
    \ indicators of the circularity of an intelligent city. The proposals were developed\n\
    in the context and following the guidelines of the smart city.\nThe third hypothesis\
    \ is about data. The IoT-Lora proposals focus on the generation of data that\n\
    can provide insights on certain criteria or indicators, based on which a decision\
    \ can be made.\nTo perform the analysis, we classiﬁed 96 studies identiﬁed in\
    \ the phase of inclusion of the PRISMA\nmethodology (see the Table 16. This methodology\
    \ was used in this study to produce a qualitative\nanalysis based on the relationship\
    \ of each study with one of the three above-mentioned hypotheses.\nWe subsequently\
    \ validated the dependence of each of the seven smart city subcategories deﬁned\
    \ in the\nsame phase of inclusion on the hypotheses with a chi square independence\
    \ test [96].\nTable 16. Classiﬁcation of papers by hypothesis.\nLoose Integration\n\

    \ table used in the chi-square test. The following results were\nobtained: Chi\
    \ 2 equaled 21.8, liberty grades (gl) equaled 12, and p-value was 0.0119. The\
    \ hypothesis\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n30 of 39\nto conﬁrm is the independency\
    \ of the application of the smart city from the grade of integration\n(loose,\
    \ tight, data). According to the results of the independency test, the alternative\
    \ hypothesis was\nselected. Thus, certain subcategories have a greater tendency\
    \ to propose solutions related to smart city\ncriteria and indicators, like the\
    \ subcategory of energy. Other subcategories have a greater tendency\nto take\
    \ advantage of the data generated to improve decision-making processes, like the\
    \ subcategory\nof agriculture.\nTable 17. Chi Square, between smart city subcategory,\

    \ the LoRa–IoT proposals focused on the environment\nsubcategory developed between\
    \ 2015 and 2019, the proposals were developed to cover a speciﬁc need\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld and were not used to enhance the strategies for building a smart city.\
    \ Rethinking those\napproaches could contribute signiﬁcantly, considering that\
    \ the environment is one of the relevant axes\nwithin circular economy proposals.\
    \ A second part of this result is that it could strengthen the use\nof data for\
    \ decision-making processes in the subcategories of the smart city. This can generate\
    \ new\nbusiness models and research projects, especially in relation to the integration\
    \ of IoT with data science.\nBased on the results obtained from a qualitative\
    \ analysis of the three hypotheses, it was possible\nto identify the relevant\
    \ aspects of the proposals of tight integration and data that contribute to the\n\
    development of a circular economy for the construction of a sustainable and smart\
    \ city. To identify\nthe relevant aspects, we used the concepts present in the\
    \ works “Circular economy strategies in\neight historic port cities: criteria\
    \ and indicators towards an evaluation framework for circular\ncities” [2], and\
    \ “The socio-economic integration of the circular economy are considered: An Integrative\n\
    Framework” [97]. Table 18 presents the four relevant aspects obtained by this\
    \ quality analysis,\ni.e., the social, economic, organizational, and material\
    \ reuse aspects and the relation with the 96 studies\nconsidered in the inclusion\
    \ phase of the PRISMA methodology of this study.\nTable 18. Impact of IoT-LoRa\

    \ (1) the analysis of the three hypotheses, (2) the contribution\nof the proposals\
    \ to the four aspects of a circular economy and to the aspects identiﬁed in the\
    \ subsections\nsocial, research, and industrial contributions, and (3) the SWOT\
    \ analysis, we present the following\npossible academic and industrial impacts\
    \ and future trends related to IoT–LoRa to build a smart\ncity based on circular\
    \ economy. Research focused on the use of LoRa and prompting the use of\nLoRa\
    \ brings problems to the generation of a circular economy that adopts smart cities\
    \ in order to\nobtain sustainability.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n31 of 39\nThe\
    \ qualitative analysis carried out of scientiﬁc proposals developed from 2015\
    \ to 2019 indicates\nthat such works were designed to cover speciﬁc needs in the\
    \ subcategories of agriculture and\nfarming, energy, environment, healthcare,\
    \ industry, traﬃc, waste management, which were deﬁned\nin the “Materials and\
    \ Methods” subsection of this study. The research proposals covered areas\nconsidered\
    \ as critical (or key factors) in a circular economy, such as energy, mobility,\
    \ environment,\nand communications, according to the “Circular economy strategies\
    \ in eight historic port cities: criteria\nand indicators towards an evaluation\
    \ framework for circular cities” [2] and “The socio-economic\nintegration of the\
    \ circular economy are considered: An Integrative Framework” [97].\nThe result\
    \ of the analysis presented in the subsection called “Research Impact Contribution”\
    \ show\nthat most of the proposals delivered solutions for the energy, environmental,\
    \ and transportation ﬁelds.\nIn those works, the “communications” feature was\
    \ just considered in an indirect way. For example,\nthese works just considered\
    \ basic features, such as the delivery of information gathered from the\ncomponents\
    \ of the IoT ecosystem to the user. LoRa-based proposals should also cover areas\
    \ that are\nconsidered critical within the approach of a circular economy. For\
    \ example, the works should consider\nthe recycling or reuse aspects on which\
    \ the circular economy is based to generate sustainability.\nLoRa-based proposals\
    \ make use of infrastructures or processes previously established in diﬀerent\n\
    ﬁelds such as health, agriculture, and energy. Based on this fact, the reuse of\
    \ the elements is focused on\nincorporating IoT elements in these infrastructures\
    \ to contribute with intelligence, as mentioned in the\nsubsection “Research Impact\
    \ Contribution”. The objective of obtaining data is to generate intelligence\n\
    for improving decision-making processes.\nLoRa is an open standard. This feature\
    \ allows IoT–LoRa solutions to adapt their technical and\nfunctional requirements\
    \ according to smart city’ needs, as mentioned in the subsection “Analysis of\n\
    the Application Layer” of this work. LoRa devices can be re-used to improve functionalities\
    \ for smart\ncity applications by just adding some libraries or conﬁgurations.\
    \ This adaptability or ﬂexibility of\nLoRa identiﬁed in the “SWOT Analysis” subsection\
    \ contributes signiﬁcantly to the idea of circular\neconomy in the smart city.\n\
    5.7.1. Future Trends of LoRa Proposals in Smart City Based on Circular Economy\n\
    On the basis of the analysis carried out using the methodology of the three hypotheses\
    \ and the\naspects of the circular economy, we identiﬁed some aspects that could\
    \ be relevant for further studies\nand that could contribute signiﬁcantly to the\
    \ generation of a circular economy.\n5.7.2. Data Integration Hypothesis\nA relevant\
    \ characteristic of previous works based on LoRa is data generation. It is covered\
    \ by LoRa\nproposals in the four layers of the Y.2060 recommendation described\
    \ in the “Materials and Methods”\nsection of this study; however, the data are\
    \ not used signiﬁcantly in decision-making processes,\nas mentioned in the “Research\
    \ Impact Contribution” section. Solutions seeking to complement\ntheir contribution\
    \ with the transformation of data into intelligence for decision-making are shown\n\
    in Figure 22.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n32 of 39\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, x FOR PEER\

    \ Opportunities \nWe classified the articles selected for this study as shown\
    \ in Table 16, in which the contributions \nof LoRa’s proposals are schematized\
    \ from the perspectives of social, economic, organizational, and \nmaterial reuse.\
    \ We can say that the proposals delivered a great contribution for the improvement\
    \ of \nparticular organizational processes of each subcategory of the smart city.\
    \ In the case of healthcare \nsolutions, there was a greater focus on the social\
    \ aspects, and most of the proposals did not consider \nthe economic and material\
    \ reuse aspects. \nThe circular economy in the smart city approaches the reuse\
    \ of resources that are limited in \nnature, such as food or water. The proper\
    \ management of these elements allows maintaining the \nsustainability approach\
    \ of the city. The proposals related to energy management considered this \nfeature,\
    \ especially those focused on renewable energy and smart grids. Aspects such as\
    \ the prediction \nof equipment maintenance or the degrading conditions of a product\
    \ could contribute to this aspect \nof reuse, since they could allow the identification\
    \ of the degrading conditions of a product and its \nsubstitution before its total\
    \ degradation. This may be of interest to the manufacturing industry, \nbecause\
    \ a completely non-damaged part can be reused to develop new components. Manufacturers\
    \ \ncan also start considering this aspect of reuse to design their products.\
    \ \nThe circular economy drives new business models and interactions in the city.\
    \ By using the data \ngenerated by IoT solutions, it is possible to generate direct\
    \ benefits for the industry and for the local \ngovernment. Manufacturers can,\
    \ based on the user usage patterns of their products, find specific \nneeds at\
    \ a given time. They can consider in this way the creation of components that\
    \ allow their reuse \nor the creation of new products from these. At the local\
    \ government level, the determination of these \npatterns allows validating a\
    \ service or understanding when it can be used by another citizen to \noptimize\
    \ resources. \nThe sale of services is a new business model that has had a remarkable\
    \ growth in recent years, \nwhich allows the reuse of existing infrastructures\
    \ of companies and local governments significantly \nimproving what is offered\
    \ to the users or citizens. This is another context that could be strongly \n\
    exploited by research and industry. Of the analyzed works, less than 1% focused\
    \ on generating \nservice sales models of LoRa IoT implementations. \n5.7.4. LoRa\

    \ all of the indicators or criteria for the circular economy of \nsmart city in\

    \ for not covering all of the indicators or criteria for the circular economy\
    \ of\nsmart city in the proposals presented from 2015 to 2019 may be the fact\
    \ that they were not developed\nwithin the context of the smart city. According\
    \ to the analysis carried out of the three hypotheses\n(loose integration, tight\
    \ integration, and data), most contributions presented a loose integration.\n\
    This indicates that although a speciﬁc need was being solved, it was not being\
    \ considered within a\nmacro-plan in the development of a sustainable city. A\
    \ possible consideration in this regard would be\nto strengthen the interaction\
    \ between the academy and local governments; also, research works should\ncontribute\
    \ to cover the proposed roadmaps for circular economy strategies for cities. Cities\
    \ indicated\nin the subsection “Smart City Strategies Using IoT LoRa” have established\
    \ a roadmap for circular\neconomy by the year 2021.\n5.7.5. Aspects to Consider\
    \ to Develop IoT Solutions that Contribute to the Development of Smart\nCity Circularity.\n\
    Tight or data integration in IoT-LoRa proposals can contribute to the circular\
    \ economy in smart\ncities. Some considerations from the study are presented below.\n\
    1. The criteria or indicators of circular economy or circularity related to the\
    \ smart city sector for\nwhich the solution is developed should be considered.\n\
    2. Identify the infrastructure of the city related to the sector that could use\
    \ the developed solution.\n3. Analyze the technological, legal, or economic barriers\
    \ that may aﬀect the development of\nthe solution.\n4. Identify the infrastructure\
    \ of the city to which it is possible to add the intelligence component\nfor improving\
    \ decision-making processes.\n5. Design the solution under the scheme of re-using,\
    \ according to the concepts of circular\neconomy, which will allow adding functionalities\
    \ to the smart city solution without having to invest in\nnew components.\n6.\
    \ Conﬁgure the technical aspects of the components of the IoT ecosystem (devices,\
    \ LoRa,\nfog, or cloud) based on the functional characteristics of the smart city\
    \ subcategory. Select the most\nappropriate aspects of SF, data rate, and throughput\
    \ for each case.\n7. Validate the security requirements that guarantee the conﬁdentiality,\
    \ integrity, and availability\nof the implemented solutions.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    The qualitative analysis carried out of scientiﬁc IoT–LoRa proposals from 2015\
    \ to 2019 indicates\nthat these works were aligned to cover speciﬁc needs in the\
    \ subcategories of agriculture, energy,\nenvironment, healthcare, industry, traﬃc,\
    \ and waste management.\nHowever, according to the\nhypotheses presented in this\
    \ work, most of the IoT solutions based on LoRa were integrated in a loose\nway.\
    \ Thus, although a speciﬁc need of a subcategory of the smart city was being solved,\
    \ it was not\nconsidered within a macro-plan for the development of a sustainable\
    \ city. Rethinking the approaches\nof LoRa–IoT proposal on the basis of circular\
    \ economy could contribute signiﬁcantly to a macro-plan\nfor the development of\
    \ a sustainable city. The circular economy drives new business models and\ninteractions\
    \ in the city. By using the data generated by IoT solutions, it is possible to\
    \ generate direct\nbeneﬁts for the industry and for local governments.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a qualitative analysis of LoRa was carried out about the development\
    \ of smart city\nsolutions related to diﬀerent aspects of the city such as transportation,\
    \ health monitoring, and pollution\nlevel measurements. For the qualitative analysis\
    \ process, a systematic literature review of papers found\nin ﬁve scientiﬁc databases\
    \ was executed, following the PRISMA methodology. Then, we analyzed\nthe relevant\
    \ aspects of LoRa guided by the IoT architecture model proposed by the ITU in\
    \ its Y.2060\nrecommendation, in order to establish the strengths, weaknesses,\
    \ opportunities, and threats (SWOT)\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4753\n34 of 39\nthat\
    \ support the selection of LoRa as the technology for the connectivity of IoT\
    \ devices in smart\ncity models.\nOn the basis of this literature review, projects\
    \ related to smart cities and LoRa were identiﬁed,\nwhich were classiﬁed in the\
    \ smart health, smart traﬃc, smart environment, smart agriculture, and smart\n\
    energy subcategories. Subsequently, we analyzed the projections of consulting\
    \ ﬁrms in relation to the\ndeployment of IoT for the next years till 2025, ﬁnding\
    \ that the type of applications that are growing are\nsimilar to the subcategories\
    \ that were identiﬁed in the literature review of this work, which allows\nus\
    \ to assume that the research projects in the academic ﬁeld are aligned with the\
    \ current social and\nbusiness needs. This coincides with the recent increase\
    \ of the number of papers.\nLoRa is an unlicensed technology that allows creating\
    \ a private network, and this is one of the\nmain advantages of this technology.\
    \ It also has other advantages such as a strong modulation scheme\nthat makes\
    \ it resistant to the Doppler eﬀect, multipath fading, scalability in terms of\
    \ number of nodes,\nadaptability to data frame length, and an end-to-end security\
    \ architecture. These strengths allow LoRa\nto be one of the most selected LPWAN’s\
    \ technologies for the development of smart cities around the\nworld. However,\
    \ some security aspects, such as response to security attacks and vulnerability\
    \ policies,\nstill need be solved.\nThe development of LoRa solutions present\
    \ an industrial impact related to the projections in\ndiﬀerent subcategories of\
    \ smart city such as energy, healthcare, and transportation; according to the\n\
    predictions of recognized consulting ﬁrms in the world, increments of approximately\
    \ 10% per year\nuntil 2025 are present in each subcategory of smart city, and\
    \ higher investments are projected in the\nfollowing years. In the academic ﬁeld,\
    \ there is a signiﬁcant increase in the development of IoT LoRa\nsolutions, which\
    \ is reﬂected by the increased number of scientiﬁc publications, from about 30\
    \ scientiﬁc\narticles in 2016 to about of 400 in 2018.\nLoRa is an open, scalable,\
    \ and ﬂexible technology that allows interoperability between ﬁve\nrelevant components\
    \ for the construction of an intelligent city that considers sensors, complementary\n\
    technologies, data science, citizen interaction, LoRaWAN, in order to obtain data\
    \ and generate visibility\non aspects related to subcategories of the smart city,\
    \ such as smart health, smart agriculture, smart\ntransportation, among others.\
    \ The visibility generated seeks to provide support for decision-making\nin an\
    \ eﬀective and timely manner.\nThe inclusion of LoRa seeks to solve ﬁve challenges\
    \ in smart cities: productivity improvement,\npredictive maintenance, energy management,\
    \ monitoring of human health, and operational eﬃciency.\nOn the basis of our qualitative\
    \ analysis, the inclusion of LoRa poses two relevant challenges:\n1. Security\
    \ and privacy in IoT environments that protect the generated data and critical\
    \ infrastructure.\n2. The inclusion of data analytics in IoT environments to take\
    \ advantage of the generation of data\nto improve decision-making processes.\n\

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\
    \ monitoring systems are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 1. Precision agriculture\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\

    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\
    \ literature.\nTable 4. Smart farming routing protocols.\nRouting Protocols\n\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\
    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    \ justiﬁes the incorporation and\nadaptation of the latest technologies. Nowadays,\
    \ managing crops is possible through Internet-based\ntechnologies. Their application\
    \ allows for the exploitation of information and the development of\nisolated\
    \ applications, which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable\
    \ predictions\nthroughout the useful life of farms. To address this problem, a\
    \ data model was deﬁned to improve\nthe management of crop plots in irrigation\
    \ communities and simultaneously monitor crop needs.\nConsequently, the objective\
    \ of this study was to create an open and interoperable platform based on\nstandard\
    \ interfaces and protocols to enable the integration of heterogeneous sources\
    \ of information,\nwhile ensuring interoperability with other third-party solutions\
    \ for exchanging and exploiting such\ninformation. Standard and open interfaces\
    \ and protocols form the basis of the platform, thereby\nunifying all information\
    \ in a single data model, which facilitates the better use and dissemination of\n\
    information. The system was fully instantiated in a real prototype in an irrigation\
    \ community; the\nsoftware improved water irrigation management for the farmers\
    \ connected to the platform.\nKeywords: IoT platform; data model; smart agriculture;\

    1. Introduction\nSociety is characterized by uncertainty and constant technological\
    \ changes. The productive sectors\nthat are more digitized tend to improve their\
    \ productivity faster than those that are less digitized.\nIrrigation farming\
    \ communities have beneﬁted for many years from the use of information and\ncommunications\
    \ technology (ICT), which allows them to improve the current agricultural development,\n\
    facilitate the fulﬁllment of daily tasks, and convert farms into efﬁcient and\
    \ sustainable production\nsystems. The use of these new technologies not only\
    \ enables the digital transformation process\ndemanded by the sector, but also\
    \ supports irrigation communities and other farming groups with tools\nfor analysis\
    \ and prediction, improving optimization.\nThe digital transformation and continuous\
    \ technological advances that are currently occurring,\ne.g., the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2], artiﬁcial intelligence, and\
    \ aerial\nimages [3] to name a few, are providing the agricultural sector with\
    \ new tools that help determine\nthe real needs of farms and improve their efﬁciency.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the use of the IoT has changed the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153; doi:10.3390/s20041153\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n2 of 20\ntraditional paradigm\
    \ regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators, making\nall\
    \ objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management and\
    \ integration of\ninformation and real knowledge into the digital world [4].\n\
    This transformation has produced\nimprovements compared to the techniques traditionally\
    \ used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in\nthe management of farms. These\
    \ advantages are mainly focused on the following:\n•\nProblem detection: The implementation\
    \ of new technologies such as satellite images, variable\napplication algorithms,\
    \ drones, high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing\nfor\
    \ the assessment of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer\
    \ use, water\nstress, changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before\
    \ they start to interfere with\ncrop performance;\n•\nProductivity improvement:\
    \ The sensorization of crops allows for the establishment of patterns of\nplanting\
    \ and fertilization depending on factors such as the type of seeds and soil conditions,\
    \ to\nimprove crop production levels;\n•\nImprovement in decision making: By analyzing\
    \ and monitoring agronomic parameters, crop water\nneeds, and precipitation forecasts,\
    \ it is possible to identify which areas of land need more water\nand schedule\
    \ irrigation to vary the volume of water applied without imposing water stress\
    \ on\nthe crop;\n•\nBehaviour analysis: As a result of continuous crop monitoring\
    \ and the analysis of the relationships\namong different elements, such as yield,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and the agricultural practices used, the\nmost beneﬁcial actions\
    \ and those that must be eliminated or modiﬁed can be identiﬁed.\nMotivated by\
    \ the digital transformation, the agricultural sector is providing its farms with\
    \ new\ndevices and services (sensors, actuators, weather information, drones,\
    \ and satellite images) that allow\nfor the optimization of the resources, to\
    \ improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact\non the environment.\
    \ For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a common integration\n\
    framework is needed that uniﬁes the entire dataset, so that new services are generated\
    \ according to\nthe needs of the sector. The data generated by the farms are crucial\
    \ and have to be part of a unique\nsemantic model that organizes and evaluates\
    \ all the data collected.\nAt the European level, an open initiative, FIWARE [6],\
    \ offers a framework using a set of standard\nand open Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface\n(NGSI), promoted\
    \ by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces\nwith\
    \ Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group for\
    \ Context\nInformation Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to deﬁne a universal set of\
    \ standards based on the contextual\nmanagement of the data. Therefore, adhering\
    \ the standards and abandoning the code and proprietary\ntechnologies can contribute\
    \ to improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world\nwhere\
    \ everything is connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability\
    \ must be\nthe cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing\
    \ to a more productive environment\nwhere information is exchanged for a greater\
    \ good. The proposed solution is a platform that allows\nfor the integration of\
    \ different suppliers’ devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and\n\
    data models based on NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information\
    \ to analyze,\nin real time, the factors associated with the production process,\
    \ the evolution of the crops, and the\noptimal use of water for irrigation. The\
    \ core features the platform are as follows:\n1.\nScalability and ﬂexibility:The\
    \ platform, instead of being locked to a single provider, is up to date\nwith\
    \ protocols, technologies, and features that vary rapidly. It is network-independent\
    \ and can be\nintegrated to work with all vital technological systems;\n2.\nInteroperable:\
    \ The platform offers a wide range of IoT agents that facilitate the connection\
    \ with\ndevices that use standardized IoT protocols, such as Lightweight Machine\
    \ to Machine (LWM2M)\nover Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), JavaScript\
    \ Object Notation (JSON), or UltraLight\n(UL) over HTTP/MQTT, with the possibility\
    \ of using parameterizing agents to integrate any\nother type of future protocols.\
    \ At the application level, the platform is open to integration with\nother third-party\
    \ platforms using both API and data model based on NGSI-LD.\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ the management of the different\nelements that are part of a farm;\n4.\nEfﬁciency\
    \ and competitiveness: The model allows precise and timely decisions to be made\
    \ in terms\nof management and agricultural processes. The ability to automatically\
    \ document the health\nstatus of the crop or natural resources provides an efﬁcient\
    \ and effective diagnosis technique\nfor managers.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is\nintroduced,\
    \ detailing the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community\n\
    of irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels\
    \ of implementation and\nthe results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion\
    \ and new proposals based in these results\nare described.\n1.1. Information Models\
    \ Applied to Agriculture\nThe data collected by all connected devices are characterized\
    \ by scalability, heterogeneity,\nand dynamism:\n•\nScalability: Millions of sensors\
    \ continuously generating large amounts of information;\n•\nHeterogeneity: There\
    \ is a wide variety of sensors;\n•\nDynamism: The high speed of generation produced\
    \ the need to generate data models that allow\nfor better use and dissemination\
    \ of the information from these devices.\nGiven the above factors, interoperability\
    \ mechanisms must be generated that allow for the\nintegration of different devices,\
    \ applications, or platforms to ﬁlter the vast amounts of information\nthat many\
    \ systems are producing [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential\
    \ resources\nthat improve the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability\
    \ of information systems to\ndevelop better applications for the agri-food sector\
    \ [9].\nToday, different data models are available; many of them were developed\
    \ by the organizations\nin charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium (OGC) data models are\nused primarily in geosciences and environmental\
    \ domains, including the SensorThings API, based on\nthe Observations and Measurements\
    \ (O&M) data model (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms\nthe numerous unconnected\
    \ IoT systems into a fully connected platform where complex tasks can\nbe performed\
    \ and synchronized. The Open Connectivity Foundation speciﬁes data models based\n\
    on vertical industries such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart\
    \ home sectors. The\nWorld Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some\
    \ vocabularies to describe real things\nbut does not focus much on the data. Other\
    \ vocabularies, such as those offered by the INSPIRE\ndirective [10], deﬁne the\
    \ rules on the interoperability of spatial data sets and their associated services;\n\
    these are mandatory.\nCurrently, some resources speed up the data modeling of\
    \ a speciﬁc location or sector. In the ﬁeld\nof agriculture, Drury et al. [11]\
    \ presented different types of tools to help us develop this task:\n•\nControlled\
    \ vocabulary (a set of preselected terms or words for a speciﬁc domain): An example\n\
    is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\
    \ United\nNations (FAO) and available in multiple languages.\n•\nMiscellaneous\
    \ ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt,\n\
    CIARD Ring, and Vest.\n•\nData exchange standards: AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and\
    \ AgroRDF; speciﬁc ontologies: SSN (for\nsensor discovery) and Cotton Ontology\
    \ (diseases and pests that affect cotton).\nThe basis of many decisions is the\
    \ uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the\ncorrect interfaces\
    \ (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and allows for\
    \ the\nuniﬁed representation of the information through next generation service\
    \ interfaces with linked data\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n4 of 20\n(NGSI-LD) [12].\
    \ This reduces the time and resources required for the management of daily tasks\
    \ and\nfor the improvement of the productivity and beneﬁts.\nA diverse range of\
    \ ontological models are available for the IoT, developed with different\nobjectives\
    \ [13,14] that describe various areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses\
    \ the results\nof projects and current EU strategies in semantic web technologies,\
    \ such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL,\nSpitﬁre, IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One\
    \ recent ontology, which is promoted by the ETSI\nSmartM2M Technical Committee,\
    \ is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology, a shared\nmodel of consensus\
    \ that facilitates the matching of existing assets in the smart appliances domain\
    \ and\nallows for the separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology\
    \ according to speciﬁc\nneeds. For the agricultural ﬁeld, the SAREF4AGRI version\
    \ [15] was created to provide services for\nanimal husbandry, intelligent irrigation,\
    \ and the integration of multiple data sources to provide support\nservices for\
    \ decision making.\nSome models are promoted by public administrations, such as\
    \ the standardized water\nmanagement model applied to irrigation model (MEGA)\
    \ [16], an initiative of the Ministry of\nAgriculture of Spain, included in the\
    \ ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The\npurpose of MEGA is to establish\
    \ a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for\ninteroperability\
    \ between different systems that coexist in the same facility and thus to efﬁciently\n\
    manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized model improves\
    \ how the irrigation\nschedules and the requirements of the control systems are\
    \ speciﬁed, establishing a clear separation\nbetween decision making and execution.\n\
    1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector\nMultiple problems exist in the\
    \ domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of\npesticides and\
    \ fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers\
    \ are\nworking to provide the best possible solutions:\n•\nImprovements in productivity:Through\
    \ the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time,\nthe farmer can apply\
    \ irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For example,\n\
    Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning to\
    \ predict diseases\nin horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer\
    \ to apply the necessary defense\nmechanisms, thus improving productivity and\
    \ reducing the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18]\npresented a low-cost sensor-equipped\
    \ platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert\nmanagement in vineyards;\n\
    •\nDetection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful\
    \ agronomic factors,\npreviously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops\
    \ using remote-sensing techniques. For\nexample, De Rango et al. [19] monitored\
    \ crops using the images provided by a drone to see if they\nhad parasites and\
    \ to decide if subsequent treatment was necessary, representing a new technique\n\
    for the coordination and control of the drone ﬂeet in precision agriculture (PA);\n\
    •\nMonitoring the behavior of plants: Through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to analyze the\nentire dataset obtained from crops to make future predictions,\
    \ the PLANTAE platform [20] is a\nsystem capable of managing the agricultural\
    \ process and simultaneously using machine-learning\ntechniques to detect possible\
    \ diseases in plants. Other works, such as that of Choudhury et al. [21],\nmonitored\
    \ the behavior of plants to avoid pests and diseases. Through the use of a mobile\n\
    applications, farmers report events that improve the models of diseases used;\n\
    •\nEfﬁcient water management: Crop water adjustments should avoid water stress.\
    \ Riquelme\net al. [22] showed how the use of cloud services involving the FIWARE\
    \ platform allows for the\nimprovement of the management of water used for irrigation\
    \ in areas with water deﬁcits. Another\nproject to be considered, also based on\
    \ FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective\nis to develop innovative\
    \ methods based on the IoT for the intelligent management of irrigation\nwater,\
    \ using the semantic characteristics provided by a context engine based on the\
    \ SPARQL\nProtocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Event Processing Architecture;\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n5 of 20\n•\nImprovement in greenhouse management: By monitoring\
    \ its different components, Zamora-\nIzquierdo et al. [24] proposed a ﬂexible\
    \ platform capable of meeting the needs of hydroponic\ncrops in a greenhouse with\
    \ complete recirculation. For this FIWARE-based deployment, Message\nQueuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) communications were used, with NGSIs being used as a\nmeans\
    \ to represent the information. Somov et al. [25] constructed a system to monitor\
    \ both the\nconditions established in a greenhouse and the behavior of plants\
    \ for the prediction of the growth\nrate of tomatoes in different environments.\n\
    IoT platforms can be considered the backbone of any industrial sector that wants\
    \ to provide its\nactivity with a smart component. These platforms collect and\
    \ store data in a distributed database for\nthe ﬁltering, analysis, calculation,\
    \ decision making, management, translation, and visualization of data\nin new\
    \ services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms for the integration\
    \ of IoT services\nand their characteristics can be found, such as that provided\
    \ by Silva et al. [26], although a results\ncomparison is difﬁcult because of\
    \ the lack of standardization.\n2. Proposed System\nThis article proposes an open\
    \ and interoperable platform for irrigation community management.\nThe platform,\
    \ based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration\
    \ of\nheterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other\
    \ third-party solutions for\nexchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally,\
    \ this platform exploits the stored information\nto analyze, in real time, the\
    \ factors associated with the production process, the evolution of crops, and\n\
    the optimal use of water for irrigation.\n2.1. Proposed Data Model\nAs a result\
    \ of the lack of the compatibility necessary to manage the large amount of data\
    \ generated\nby the agricultural sector, agricultural managers must be provided\
    \ with standardized information\nmodels that permit farmers to make the best possible\
    \ decisions, allowing them to take advantage of\nthe available data and knowledge.\
    \ Therefore, a data model is proposed here that ﬁts the functional\nrequirements\
    \ of the users.\nThe proposed data model is based on interviews with farmers,\
    \ responsible technicians, and farm\nmanagers about the useful and necessary information\
    \ that should be managed on a farm. The existing\nmodels are too specialized;\
    \ although they cover the information that needs to be managed, their\nimplementation\
    \ is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop a new model that would meet\n\
    the needs of our users.\nConceptually, the model presented is based on the proposed\
    \ by FIWARE harmonized data\nmodels [27], speciﬁcally, the AgriFood model that\
    \ includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers allowing them\nto characterize\
    \ the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops, and control the soil and water\
    \ quality\nand the associated atmospheric conditions. This ﬁrst version of the\
    \ model focuses on the efﬁcient\nmanagement of the crop plots and all the included\
    \ elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in\nFigure 1.\nThe proposed data\
    \ model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot\n\
    entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation\
    \ entity. The plot is\ncharacterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely\
    \ deﬁned:\n•\nDevices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide\
    \ information to the plot and are\nclassiﬁed based on the parameters studied:\
    \ AgriDSoil, those that obtain soil values (soil moisture\nprobes, temperature\
    \ and soil dissolution); AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop\n\
    (leaf/trunk diameter, stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere,\
    \ which are\nthe devices that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature,\
    \ humidity, radiation, and wind\nspeed). These data are used to optimize agricultural\
    \ decisions;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n6 of 20\n•\nWater, represented by AgriWater,\
    \ indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect\nirrigation.\
    \ AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points of the\
    \ water\ndistribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary\
    \ for fertilization and\nirrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity\
    \ of nutrients carried by the water;\n•\nSoil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates\
    \ the type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more\ndetailed by indicating\
    \ the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers\n\
    (horizons) that deﬁne the ground;\n•\nCultivation, represented by AgriCrop, deﬁnes\
    \ the crop and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the\nplot is associated. The\
    \ crop is determined by the different phenological phases that determine its\n\
    growth; AgriPhenology provides the crop coefﬁcients and their duration over time.\
    \ The phenology\nis determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone,\
    \ AgriZone since the zone inﬂuences\nthe optimal climatic conditions for the development\
    \ of the crops.\nAnother feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management,\
    \ represented by the AgriScene\nentity, including images or scenes from any satellite\
    \ or drone; these scenes are composed of bands,\nAgriBand, of different wavelengths.\
    \ In turn, these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct,\nafter processing,\
    \ such as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation\
    \ or\nwater, useful for detecting problems in the ﬁelds.\nFigure 1. Speciﬁc data\
    \ model for agricultural plot management.\nThe main feature of the IoT-based interoperability\
    \ mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging\ninformation homogeneously in different\
    \ systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this\ncontinuous exchange\
    \ of information is the use of data models. To acquire more signiﬁcant value,\
    \ the\nspeciﬁc vocabulary of the sector must be uniﬁed, which is deﬁned by the\
    \ set of attributes that compose\nthe entities and their relationships [28]. As\
    \ NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or\nontologies, we added\
    \ a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information\n\
    models is considered beneﬁcial to allow for the integration of any device or characteristic\
    \ element of\nthe study sector.\nIn Section 3.2, an instantiation of this model\
    \ is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the\nuse of NGSI-LD concerning\
    \ NGSI are as follows:\n•\nThe information model is based on graphs and focuses\
    \ on information. The concept of Relation\nappears. Entities can have properties\
    \ and relations. Instances of each of the entities can be the\nobject of the properties\
    \ or relationships;\n•\nAll data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique\
    \ Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI)\ncorresponding to well-established semantic\
    \ identiﬁers;\n•\nIt allows one to make references to vocabularies: all terms\
    \ are deﬁned unequivocally. This allows\nusers to refer to their information deﬁnitions;\n\
    •\nThe model and query language is more constrained;\n•\nThe use of JSON-LD allows\
    \ us to operate with linked data to unify vocabularies;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n\
    7 of 20\n•\nThere were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary is no longer\
    \ needed, GeoProperty is\nused instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context is included,\
    \ TemporalProperty is used instead of\nDateTime, and an “object” ﬁeld is used\
    \ to encode the relation target.\n2.2. System Architecture\nSince the new IoT\
    \ devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with\nfaster\
    \ and more efﬁcient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent\
    \ of the\nprovider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between\
    \ applications/services\nand the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a\
    \ common framework so that applications can\ninteract with any aspect that is\
    \ part of a farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device\nor controller\
    \ using the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability\
    \ between\ndifferent manufacturers or services.\nThe architecture of the platform\
    \ proposed in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered\nmodular form\
    \ ranging from the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for\
    \ data\nextraction to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers\
    \ is based on open and standard\ninitiatives, such as the one provided by the\
    \ FIWARE community [29] or the ETSI ISG CIM group.\nFigure 2. General vision of\
    \ the proposed architecture.\nThe ﬁrst layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents\
    \ the different sources of information that form\nthe system; these include sensors,\
    \ actuators, open information available on the Internet, and databases\nwith updated\
    \ information of interest. These devices employ different communication technologies\n\
    to transmit information to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module\
    \ acts as an\nintermediary with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally\
    \ or bidirectionally\n(in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to\
    \ interact with the platform.\nA speciﬁc module is required because of the restrictions\
    \ imposed by the modules on the processing\ncapacity, memory, and even the available\
    \ power to these devices. These restrictions usually prevent\nthem from using\
    \ heavy protocols at the application level, so they use lightweight protocols\
    \ such as\nCoAP or MQTT or integrate other solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to\
    \ perform communications\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n8 of 20\nwith the different\
    \ devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G).\n\
    As such, the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating\
    \ the information\nsent through these protocols to the interface made available\
    \ by the broker through NGSI-LD.\nThe second layer, Information Management, contains\
    \ software components in charge of data storage,\nprocessing, and distribution.\
    \ The distributed infrastructure is composed of servers in the cloud that\nwork\
    \ together to manage massive amounts of data and make them available to the upper\
    \ layer. The\nNGSI-LD interface is used to send data updates and receive notiﬁcations\
    \ about data changes. Figure 3\npresents an example of how the information provided\
    \ by an IoT gateway, which implements JSON\nover MQTT, is integrated into the\
    \ platform.\nFigure 3. Data model from Internet of Things (IoT) level to applications.\n\
    The element chosen was the device that analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater\
    \ treatment\nplant and determines the levels of turbidity and ph of the water.\
    \ Once the entity is created in the\nbroker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers\
    \ can retrieve this information following two different\napproaches: query or\
    \ subscription.\nThe core of this platform is the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information\
    \ broker that exposes an\nHTTP REST API based on NGSI-LD for both registration\
    \ and consultation, as well as a subscription/\nnotiﬁcation approach. This is\
    \ the second point where interoperability is a signiﬁcant aspect. The use of\n\
    NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party platforms in both\
    \ directions. One\nof these solutions that has been integrated into the platform\
    \ through the development of a connector\nis MEGA [16]. The MEGA standard (ISO\
    \ 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a\nstandardized model applied\
    \ to irrigation that improves the speciﬁcation of irrigation schedules and\nthe\
    \ control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the stored\
    \ information of each\nentity is overwritten, with only the current state being\
    \ kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational\ndatabase, MongoDB. This\
    \ database contains data referring to infrastructure and information ﬂow,\nas\
    \ well as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled\
    \ using data\nmodels that allow for the uniﬁcation of data structures using standards\
    \ and also ensure the generality\nnecessary for the subsequent extensibility.\n\
    The last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central\
    \ layer to offer different\nsolutions to the problems that are generated in an\
    \ agricultural operation, such as water management,\nirrigation planning, data\
    \ analytics, and monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n9 of 20\nof other modules allows us to provide our solution\
    \ with more capabilities due to the possibility of\nintegrating new components\
    \ through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used to send\ndata\
    \ updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. A change in the conﬁguration\
    \ parameters\ntriggers control actions that are managed by subsystems at the user\
    \ level. As a result of the use of\nspeciﬁc connectors, the information is consulted\
    \ or notiﬁed to higher modules that are in charge of\npropagating it for other\
    \ interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management, or\n\
    integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a representational\
    \ state\ntransfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD for communication\
    \ between the ﬁnal\napplications and the analysis modules.\n3. Case Study in an\
    \ Irrigation Community\nThis section validates our data model and the architecture\
    \ of the platform. It was implemented in\nan irrigation community where different\
    \ systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA), GIS systems,\
    \ and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the platform.\n\
    3.1. Scenario\nIrrigation communities are corporations attached to basin organizations,\
    \ which are responsible\nfor the management of the shared use of public common\
    \ water. To this end, they relied on automatons\nand speciﬁc irrigation systems\
    \ for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction\nbetween\
    \ the devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting\
    \ with third-party\ndevices and software applications.\nThe Miraﬂores irrigation\
    \ community is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in\nthe Segura\
    \ river basin and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about\
    \ 1330 ha\nof agricultural land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by\
    \ localized irrigation. The main\ncrops produced are fruit trees, especially pear,\
    \ peach, and apricot. The community uses surface water,\n3.8 hm3 annually, and\
    \ water from the Jumilla sewage plant, 1.5 hm3 annually. This treatment plant\n\
    delivers the reclaimed water at its exit, from where the community drives the\
    \ available ﬂows to six\ninterconnected regulation rafts, with a total capacity\
    \ of 1 hm3. The distribution network conducts\nwater from the rafts to the various\
    \ irrigated farms, equipped with automatic ﬂow control counters and\nsetpoints,\
    \ ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m3/ha/year/farm.\nOne of the main problems\
    \ to be solved is the integration of the different technological elements\n(SCADA,\
    \ drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services) that provide\
    \ information\nto the community in a single control point. The data from SCADA\
    \ that are integrated into the platform\nare shown in Table 1. The results derived\
    \ from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month\nwere also integrated\
    \ into the platform.\nTable 1. Type of facilities from supervisory control and\

    \ Equipment and Implementation\nFigure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed\
    \ to address the deployment of the platform.\nThe ﬁrst step was to channel water\
    \ from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n10 of 20\nto the agricultural plots. The plot is one of the\
    \ key elements of the system. All the devices needed for\nits deﬁnition are integrated\
    \ using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through this process, SCADA data\nand\
    \ the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture sensors, agricultural\
    \ weather station, and\nhydrants) are integrated into the systems. The information\
    \ is transferred to the data model for later\nvisualization (using mobile or web\
    \ applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.\nFigure\
    \ 4. Layout of the case study.\nThe deployment involved the installation of controllers\
    \ for monitoring, and remote control in\noutdoor environments were provided by\
    \ Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform\nwas reduced due\
    \ to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget\
    \ needed\nfor dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform.\
    \ In this instance, the cost of\nthe chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average\
    \ price of around 600 euros (including conﬁguration\nand installation) and varies\
    \ according to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main\ncharacteristics\
    \ of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,\n\
    USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be conﬁgured by software\
    \ as digital or\nanalogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks\
    \ (3G), IPv6 over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox,\
    \ Narrow Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12\nis able to manage eight additional\
    \ slaves I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are conﬁgured\neffortlessly through\
    \ their web server, which permits us to conﬁgure tasks independently from the\n\
    MQTT commands received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed\
    \ for outdoor\nsettings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided\
    \ with water- and dust-proof enclosure.\nIt is provided with a battery and a solar\
    \ panel.\nThe dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil\
    \ conductivity, soil moisture,\nsoil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological\
    \ parameters, among others, and to operate\nthe solenoid valves to control the\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD\
    \ EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz, 32 GB of\nRAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB\
    \ each. It also runs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and\nLibVirt/KVM. A single virtual\
    \ machine was used here for the global broker, data saving, big data\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n11 of 20\nprocesses, and to host management with web services.\
    \ The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and\n400 GB of hard disk capacity.\
    \ A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the ﬂexibility\nof our\
    \ architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual images.\n\
    Once the different modules that form the platform were conﬁgured, the entities\
    \ were deﬁned\nin the broker so that their subscriptions could be made later.\
    \ The broker manages subscriptions\nto the creation or changes of entities. All\
    \ these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational\nJSON-LD object-based database,\
    \ to provide fast and ﬂexible access to information. The speed of\nprocessing\
    \ is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down\
    \ the rest of\nthe implementations.\nTo improve the data of the irrigation plots,\
    \ the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used\naccording to the needs proposed\
    \ by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was\nconstructed\
    \ through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is deﬁned in Listing\
    \ 2.\nListing 1. Next generation service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD)\

    \ and Validation\nThis section describes the validation of the platform in a community\
    \ of irrigators from three\ndifferent perspectives. The tests were conducted under\
    \ a controlled environment with the equipment\ndescribed in Section 3.2.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n14 of 20\n4.1. Information Broker Evaluation\nThe main element\
    \ of the platform is a NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the\n\
    information as well as processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions,\
    \ and the management\nof the information providers. For this reason, an analysis\
    \ was performed by selecting the following\nmetrics: CPU usage, memory consumed,\
    \ and response times, according to the operations performed.\nFirstly, different\
    \ execution tests were conducted to check the platform ability to perform the\n\
    changes without losing the quality of service. The tests were performed with the\
    \ same type of requests,\nchecking their response time in terms of both CPU and\
    \ RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute\nexecution varying the number of simultaneous\
    \ communications or connections with which it was\nperformed. Figure 5 shows the\
    \ results of the tests of the behavior of the processor and the memory.\n(a) CPU\
    \ usage\n(b) RAM usage\nFigure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.\nFigure\
    \ 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the ﬁrst intervals\
    \ (2, 4,\nand 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the CPU\
    \ remained stable with average\nvalues close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the\
    \ behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable\nfrom the beginning\
    \ to the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use\
    \ of the\nRAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that\
    \ are considered optimal.\nThe behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on\
    \ the information distribution characteristic\nthat the broker had acquired. To\
    \ this end, the response time obtained after performing various\noperations on\
    \ the different broker operating modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant\n\
    values obtained in the tests. The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for\
    \ the different modes:\nentity management, subscription management, and context\
    \ provider control.\n•\nThe publication/subscription model enables the reduction\
    \ of the number of queries because it is\nnot necessary to make periodic queries\
    \ to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The\ncreation time is\
    \ longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model;\n•\nThe management\
    \ of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,\n\
    making the process more transparent for the ﬁnal client. The broker’s mission\
    \ is to act as a proxy\nbetween the client and the context provider. For this\
    \ reason, search and consultation times are\nshorter compared with the rest of\
    \ the operations.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n15 of 20\n(a) Entities\n(b) Subscriptions\n\

    This section provides an evaluation of the response times of the platform based\
    \ on the three layers\nthat form its architecture. Figure 7 shows the times obtained\
    \ for the system after the execution of\n100 requests. Figure 7a shows the notiﬁcation\
    \ times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT broker\nnotiﬁes the IoT Agent)\
    \ and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information Management Layer are\n\
    longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic enrichment provided\
    \ by the use of the data\nmodel is performed in the database (MongoDB). However,\
    \ in exchange for this increase in time, it is\npossible to have all the relevant\
    \ information of the irrigation community homogenized and integrated\ninto a single\
    \ point. Figure 7b shows the system’s capabilities in terms of performance management.\n\
    The graph shows that if the device is connected, the response time is less than\
    \ if it is not; the average\nresponse time of 31.18 ms is considered low.\nSensors\

    \ Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level\nData interoperability is of critical\
    \ importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and\nplatform) provides\
    \ the necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model\n\
    together with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD.\
    \ This proposal enables\nthe integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources,\
    \ resulting in an open and interoperable data\nintegration model according to\
    \ the changing requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes\nto obtaining\
    \ performance indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms.\n\
    Figure 8 shows the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed.\
    \ The analysis of\nthe data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system.\
    \ To have a continuous and homogeneous\nirrigation system, we deemed it necessary\
    \ to deﬁne irrigation thresholds provided by the agricultural\ntechnicians. As\
    \ the ﬁeld capacity and the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits\
    \ of the\nsoil humidity that can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount\
    \ of water between these\ntwo values is the functional water or humidity available\
    \ to the plant. Once the community technicians\ndeﬁned the limits for the crops,\
    \ tests were conducted on an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation\nefﬁciency:\
    \ the ﬁrst as soon as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and\
    \ another after\nimproving the irrigation programming based on the results of\
    \ the ﬁrst test (between June and July).\nFigure 8. Evolution of the humidity\
    \ of an apricot crop based on set water levels.\nOnce the ﬁrst test was analyzed,\
    \ Figure 8, we found that during irrigation, two critical zones\nwere generated,\
    \ A and B, with extreme peaks that were outside the recommended limits, indicating\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n17 of 20\nthat water use was not efﬁcient, thus a scarce\
    \ resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root\nasphyxiation was produced\
    \ (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the roots)\n\
    in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have ability\
    \ to supply itself\nwith water, consequently reducing the quality of the production\
    \ of the crop. Once the maximum and\nminimum thresholds are set, rules can be\
    \ deﬁned for efﬁcient irrigation. When the thresholds are\nexceeded or not reached,\
    \ the platform generates notiﬁcations to users through the mobile application.\n\
    These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the\
    \ start-up of any device\nthat improves irrigation efﬁciency.\nAs a result of\
    \ the use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the\
    \ help of\nan agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established\
    \ or adjusted. In addition, other\nuseful parameters can be established, such\
    \ as the root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of\nthe probes. Once\
    \ the irrigation programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was\n\
    efﬁciently applied. The water contributions and vertical column are in line with\
    \ the humidity curves,\nshowing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the\
    \ hydrants and applying ﬁlters based on the\nlimits set, irrigation was controlled\
    \ to maintain the humidity within the desired parameters, or to\ninform of possible\
    \ alerts to activate programmed irrigation to avoid a reduction in production.\n\
    Figure 9.\nEvolution of efﬁcient irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water\
    \ contribution by\nthe hydrant.\nThe versatility of the platform is stressed by\
    \ the ability to export selected data for further\nprocessing or study, as shown\
    \ in Figures 8 and 9 using the export to CSV option.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work\
    \ demonstrated the importance of interoperability in the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ water\nmanagement, and irrigation systems. Herein, an interoperable and open\
    \ platform is presented which\nis capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources\
    \ at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision\nmaking in a community of irrigators.\
    \ The platform enables the integration of controllers and sensors\nfrom different\
    \ manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access point for all this information.\n\
    As such, improving the techniques used in the agricultural sector is possible,\
    \ thereby sustainably\nobtaining higher economic, environmental, and social yields.\
    \ As a result of its interoperable nature,\nthe platform can be combined with\
    \ other systems to expand its range of services. The interoperability\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n18 of 20\naspect was tested in a real-world context where successful\
    \ integration with other systems already\ndeployed in the facilities of the irrigation\
    \ community was possible thanks to this characteristic. The\nplatform integrates\
    \ different protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and\
    \ HTTP.\nThey transport the information following different data formats. Nevertheless,\
    \ a set of them promote\ninteroperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine\
    \ (LWM2M), JSON, and UltraLight. These\nrepresentation formats were adopted by\
    \ the presented platform as to facilitate its integration into IoT\ndevices, making\
    \ use of this technology. The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform\
    \ the\nadaptation of this information to the NGSI-LD interface and data model.\
    \ After analyzing the obtained\nresults in the community of irrigators, the following\
    \ conclusions were obtained:\n1.\nA homogeneous data model was proposed that meets\
    \ the speciﬁc needs of agriculture, such\nas efﬁcient water management. This model\
    \ was validated on the platform using an NGSI-LD\nbroker. The application of this\
    \ model in an irrigation community provides its managers with the\ncapacity to\
    \ manage the agronomic information and its relationship with the devices that\
    \ provide\ninformation to improve irrigation water;\n2.\nThe platform was validated\
    \ using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of the main\n\
    component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use of the CPU\
    \ (83.21%) and\nmemory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded\
    \ on the most relevant operations\nof the broker, highlighting among them the\
    \ average time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context\nprovider. The platform\
    \ was validated as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the\ndevice\
    \ receives the information and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and\
    \ from the\nmoment the action is performed (31.17 ms);\n3.\nAt the user level,\
    \ the platform was validated in several apricot tree plots, improving the\nmanagement\
    \ of the water used. This improvement was achieved because of the deﬁnition\n\
    of optimal irrigation thresholds for each crop and by generating ﬁlter notiﬁcations\
    \ that, under\ncertain conditions, allow the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling\
    \ efﬁcient water use.\nIn the future, the speed of computing and latency should\
    \ be compared by replicating the platform\nin edge computing with current cloud\
    \ computing to detect which one provides better performance and\nresponse times.\
    \ One of these involves the processing of satellite images. At the plot level,\
    \ this feature\nwill monitor the main characteristics of the crop with applications\

    \ and control of irrigation. Currently, this feature\nuses images of the Sentinel\
    \ 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural issues, but soon the PAZ\n\
    satellite (the ﬁrst Spanish radar earth observation satellite, which is included\
    \ within the National Earth\nObservation Programme) will be used. Another future\
    \ line of research is the development of a data\nanalysis module that will allow\
    \ us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired. This\nwill generate\
    \ better results in agricultural management, increase productivity, and reduce\
    \ expenses,\nsuch as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients, and phytosanitary\
    \ products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, J.A.L.-M., J.A.M. and A.F.S.;\

    and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate
    global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population growth
    and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table
    and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In
    this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages
    ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while
    enhancing crops’ yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that
    leverages cost-effectiveness . Commercial solutions are costly and thus become
    impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around
    three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation
    of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring
    using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration
    promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in
    water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and
    quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution
    has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have
    shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption
    (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source
    and can be easily adopted and adapted by other researchers to promote the setting
    of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for water-table usage, especially in arid
    and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart Agriculture: Testbed General Architecture.

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.
    Show All FIGURE 21. Real-time soil moisture average and irrigation duration. Show
    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    \ technologies have been applied to agricultural environments,\nresulting in new\
    \ precision agriculture systems. Some of the multiple proﬁts of developing new\n\
    agricultural technologies and applications include the cost reduction around the\
    \ building and\ndeployment of them, together with more energy-eﬃcient consumption.\
    \ Therefore, agricultural\nprecision systems focus on developing better, easier,\
    \ cheaper, and overall more eﬃcient ways\nof handling agricultural monitoring\
    \ and actuation.\nTo achieve this vision, we use a set of\ntechnologies such as\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks, Sensors devices, Internet of Things, or data analysis.\n\
    More speciﬁcally, in this study, we proposed a combination of all these technologies\
    \ to design and\ndevelop a prototype of a precision agriculture system for medium\
    \ and small agriculture plantations\nthat highlights two major advantages: eﬃcient\
    \ energy management with self-charging capabilities\nand a low-cost policy. For\
    \ the development of the project, several prototype nodes were built and\ndeployed\
    \ within a sensor network connected to the cloud as a self-powered system. The\
    \ ﬁnal target\nof this system is, therefore, to gather environment data, analyze\
    \ it, and actuate by activating the\nwatering installation. An analysis of the\
    \ exposed agriculture monitoring system, in addition to results,\nis exposed in\
    \ the paper.\nKeywords: agricultural automation; Arduino; energy eﬃciency; Internet\

    \ Network (WSN); ZigBee\n1. Introduction\nOne of the ideas derived from precision\
    \ agriculture is the application of existing technologies to\nbuild better and\
    \ more eﬃcient systems to handle agriculture businesses. Nowadays, we have devices\n\
    that often have built-in complex sensors and that can connect and communicate\
    \ which each other\neasily. These devices and systems also allow collecting and\
    \ processing large amounts of data with\nfairly small and aﬀordable hardware.\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) seeks to take these common technologies\nand devices\
    \ that are present in today’s world and interconnect everything to accomplish\
    \ new objectives\nand applications.\nThe concept of IoT together with existing\
    \ technologies opens a wide range of opportunities to\napply in the ﬁeld of agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Some of these opportunities are the following: Wireless\nSensor\
    \ Networks (WSNs), full connectivity between the system’s nodes, constant monitoring\
    \ of the\nenvironmental status, eﬃcient energy and water use in order to achieve\
    \ an autonomous system,\nor keeping the economic costs constrained.\nSustainability\

    Sustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n2 of 17\nThis paper contributes to the state of\
    \ the art by analyzing the literature to ﬁnd out the main\nfeatures involved in\
    \ most WSNs for smart irrigation systems. Secondly, the paper describes an open\n\
    system implementing all the studied technologies.\nThe projects’ target application\
    \ is small and middle-size agriculture plantations that are currently\nnot automatized\
    \ and could take advantage of a low-cost energy-autonomous sensor network.\nThe\
    \ rest of the document has the following structure. After this introduction, a\
    \ state of the art\nsection analyses the literature of similar systems and provides\
    \ a comparison between all of them.\nThen, we describe our proposed solution by\
    \ explaining the architecture, as well as the operation and\ncommunication technologies\
    \ that are used. Later, the section “Cloud analysis” describes the data\nanalysis\
    \ performed in a cloud platform using the data received from sensors. Section\
    \ ﬁve describes the\nproject from the energy eﬃciency point of view. The manuscript\
    \ ﬁnishes with a conclusion section that\nsummarizes the facts, status, and future\
    \ lines of work of the project.\n2. State of the Art\nOver the last years, there\
    \ have been huge developments in technological applications that allow\neasily\
    \ integrating and connecting multiple sensors in networks. Microcontrollers have\
    \ played a\nkey role in the proliﬁc development of IoT projects, speciﬁcally in\
    \ the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\nThe inclusion of a WSN for gathering information\
    \ is one of the key requirements for projects within the\narea of agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld monitorization. Authors in [1] indicate that the overarching goal of the\
    \ future\nsensing systems is synergy. They also highlight that the gap between\
    \ research and practice keeps\ngrowing signiﬁcantly and that eﬀorts to integrate\
    \ WSNs with existing technologies are much needed.\nTherefore, understanding the\
    \ context of eﬃcient sensor networks on agriculture implementation can\nhelp provide\
    \ a general idea of the sector’s growing and current status [2]. It is worth mentioning\
    \ some\nof the key factors that can heavily inﬂuence the growth of this sector,\
    \ which include reduced energy\nconsumption, reduced costs, data security, scalability,\
    \ as well as common development platforms and\nconnection protocols [3].\nPutting\
    \ special focus now on the precision agriculture sector, it is interesting to\
    \ mention some of the\nIoT applications with more potential during the following\
    \ decade [4,5]: agricultural drone surveillance,\ncattle monitoring, smart greenhouse,\
    \ wide agricultural plantation management, and smart watering\nsystem. Since the\
    \ energy and water resources are rather limited and expensive, one of the main\
    \ aims\nof the agricultural sector is looking for more eﬃcient watering systems.\
    \ Currently, the development\nand investigation of watering systems are focusing\
    \ on new trends and types of watering methods,\nsuch as nebulization watering\
    \ or watering drip systems [6]. Naturally, these watering systems must be\npowered\
    \ by heavy machinery that allows big amounts of water to be pumped over large\
    \ distances.\nApart from the traditional diesel engines or centralized electric\
    \ engines, a number of additional\nsolutions are currently under development.\n\
    It is worth to mention the idea of microgrids, where small autonomous cells can\
    \ provide energy to\nactivate the aforementioned systems [7]. For middle and large\
    \ agricultural farming businesses, vertical\nand seamless integration between\
    \ all features is needed, primarily in areas where the connection to the\nmain\
    \ distribution grid is not possible. A clarifying example is SenseFarm that allows\
    \ implementing\na sensor network based on LoRa, which was originally designed\
    \ for smart cities [8]. The most\ninteresting aspect of this solution is a common\
    \ base of technologies that can be easily adapted for\ndiﬀerent applications.\n\
    We review now a number of additional studies that have implemented other agricultural\
    \ systems\nthat use technologies similar to ours. Ramani et al. [9] designed a\
    \ system based on Arduino-compatible\ndevices, which included sensors and wireless\
    \ communication through 3G. This system was also able\nto generate its own energy\
    \ through photovoltaic panels. Saxena et al. [10] proposed a similar system,\n\
    where they introduced a solar-based WSN with several distributed nodes to measure\
    \ humidity and\ntemperature using sensor data.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n\
    3 of 17\nAdditionally, Adenugba et al. [11] described a solar-based energy harvesting\
    \ WSN system that\ncontrols the irrigation through sensor values and a weather\
    \ prediction. This prediction is based on\nhistoric and current data to determine\
    \ through neural networks if it is going to rain on a certain day\nor not.\nMekonnen\
    \ [12] described a WSN based on Arduino and ZigBee communication protocol that\n\
    includes an oﬀ-grid photovoltaic cell to supply power to the system. They collect\
    \ sensor data in a\ncloud platform to provide graphs about the sensor data evolution.\
    \ As the main contribution, their\nsystem implements also machine learning algorithms\
    \ to determine the actions to be taken regarding\nirrigation. Vij et al. [13]\
    \ also described a very similar system. The work of Jin et al. [14] is also\n\
    aligned to the AI-oriented proposals. They use a hybrid deep learning model to\
    \ obtain more accurate\npredictions of temperature, wind speed, and humidity to\
    \ meet the needs of precision agricultural\nproduction. Marcu et al. [15] described\
    \ a system that contains sensors collecting several parameters,\nsuch as temperature,\
    \ leaf wetness, relative humidity of the air, and soil and solar radiation. The\
    \ nodes\nare also powered by solar cells and batteries and send the data to a\
    \ cloud platform to generate a\ngraphical representation.\nKumar et al. [16] proposed\
    \ a cost-eﬀective system that monitors sensor data such as soil moisture,\ntemperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and light intensity to automate the irrigation and provide\
    \ a graphical\nrepresentation of the values. Sudharshan et al. [17] focused their\
    \ design on the use of fuzzy logic to\nautomatize the irrigation. The system also\
    \ uses a solar cell to power the system. Sharma et al. [18]\nalso focused their\
    \ work on maximizing the WSN network lifetime using a solar energy harvesting\n\
    technique. However, their work is just a mere simulation of network lifetime;\
    \ they did not really create\na prototype.\nKhoa [19] also described an Arduino-based\
    \ WSN with WiFi and LoRa wireless communications.\nThey measured ﬁve parameters\
    \ to increase crop productivity: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level. Their studies indicate an improvement of 30% in economic\
    \ beneﬁts\nwith respect to the traditional watering method. However, this system\
    \ does not include any energy\nharvesting technology to avoid the necessity of\
    \ a wired power supply. The system developed by\nDevanand et al. [20] does not\
    \ need energy harvesting of any form either. They centered their design in\na\
    \ cost-eﬀective Arduino platform. It provides automatic irrigation based on sensor\
    \ values, although it\ndoes not provide any cloud analysis.\nMahbub’s [21] WSN\
    \ is based on Arduino devices that use WiFi for node communication, and the\n\
    coordinator node uses GSM to send data to the cloud. It also uses a photovoltaic\
    \ cell to power the\nnodes. The data analysis done in this project is based on\
    \ a Google Sheet, which allows creating simple\ngraphs showing the evolution of\
    \ the data. As the main contribution, this system implements an SMS\nalert system\
    \ with predeﬁned messages to the farmer.\nZervopoulos et al. [22] also described\
    \ an Arduino WSN system that uses ZigBee and WiFi for\ncommunications. Their study\
    \ especially focused on message synchronization and network problems in\nnetworks\
    \ with a high number of nodes. Touseau et al. [23] also worked on a similar topic\
    \ developing\ndisruption-tolerant RESTful support for smart agriculture. They\
    \ used an HTTP REST web service and\nCoAP protocols for this purpose. In this\
    \ case, they used Raspberry Pi boards for each node.\nTrilles et al. [24] proposed\
    \ an open and low-cost sensorized system for the cultivation of a vineyard.\n\
    Their system is based on Arduino boards and uses Bluetooth for node-coordinator\
    \ communication\nand GPRS for coordinator-cloud communication. The messaging service\
    \ is orchestrated through\nlightweight REST messages. They use a solar panel and\
    \ a battery to provide energy to the system.\nThe system uses sensor data (temperature,\
    \ humidity, and rainfall) to send SMS notiﬁcations.\nBased on this analysis, we\
    \ can conclude that Arduino-compatible devices are the most popular\ndevices chosen\
    \ for the development of smart agriculture, at least for the experimental systems\
    \ described\nin the literature. Most of them use ZigBee and WiFi technologies\
    \ for nodes-coordinator communication,\nas well as GSM or LoRa for communication\
    \ between the coordinator-node and the cloud platform.\nFurthermore, most of them\
    \ include some kind of energy harvesting system, usually through a\nSustainability\
    \ 2020, 12, 5913\n4 of 17\nphotovoltaic cell. Finally, most of these systems use\
    \ the data from sensors (mostly temperature and\nhumidity) to activate the watering\
    \ systems when needed.\nAfter this literature review, we can summarize the main\
    \ conclusions on WSN features in agriculture\nenvironments as follows:\n•\nEnergy\
    \ autonomy: Energy autonomy is usually obtained by energy harvesting, for example,\n\
    based on solar cells. This is very helpful to be able to install the nodes in\
    \ any place without having\nto worry about energy supply.\n•\nIrrigation based\
    \ on sensor values and real-time weather forecast: Irrigation is implemented\n\
    commonly based on sensor values to eﬃciently estimate the adequate quantity of\
    \ water and\nenergy needed. For example, irrigation systems frequently use real-time\
    \ weather forecasts to\nminimize the quantity of water and energy in order to\
    \ avoid unnecessary irrigation.\n•\nRemote visualization: Cloud analysis and remote\
    \ multi-device visualization are implemented to\nallow operators/owners to monitor\
    \ the exploitation in real-time.\n•\nMessage orchestration: Large WSNs require\
    \ some message orchestration to ensure that the\ncoordinator node is able to receive\
    \ and process in the correct order the data sent by the rest of\nthe nodes.\n\
    •\nAlert systems: Most systems implement alerts to notify the operator/farmer\
    \ about events that\nneed attention.\n•\nCost-eﬀective design: Having the lowest\
    \ investment possible is an important factor to be\nable to have a proﬁtable business,\
    \ and having cost-eﬀective designs is a mandatory feature of\nthese systems.\n\
    •\nOpen project: The use of open hardware and/or free software usually reduces\
    \ considerably the\ninvestment and facilitates the deployment, interoperability,\
    \ and prototyping. Furthermore,\nthis hardware and software facilitate personalization\
    \ of the ﬁnal system according to the\nrequirements.\nFinally, if there is a community\
    \ around the product, they can support the\ninstallation and maintenance, as well\
    \ as ensure continuous improvements.\nOnce these main features to study are deﬁned,\
    \ we can compare (see Table 1) each one for the\nanalyzed systems. As can be seen,\
    \ none of the analyzed systems covers all the studied features. For that\nreason,\
    \ in our study, we proposed a system that includes all of them. Next sections\
    \ will provide a\ndetailed description of the proposed system.\nTable 1. Comparison\

    \ from sensor\nnodes to reach the coordinator node.\nThe ZigBee protocol performs\
    \ especially well under low energy requirements.\nHowever,\nits short-range coverage\
    \ makes it only a good choice for small exploitations.\nOther radio link\nalternatives\
    \ should be used for larger applications, such as those based on LPWAN (such as\
    \ LoRa) or\nmobile network operators (such as GSM, GPRS, 4G, or 5G).\nThe communication\
    \ protocol connecting the deployed network with the cloud interface and server\n\
    is set up with MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), which is a well-known\
    \ IoT protocol\nbuilt over TCP/IP.\nThe IoT cloud platform used in the project,\

    \ data or by\ndirect user commands. The ﬁnal goal for data processing is to achieve\
    \ an eﬃcient system for improving\nresource management and the subsequent savings\
    \ in water and power.\nThe interaction and data exchange from the WSN with the\

    5. Energy Efficiency \nEnergy management is another one of the key points of IoT\
    \ agricultural projects, especially for \nthose that are located in a large unwired\
    \ area. The end devices that incorporate a full sensor suite \nmust have energy\
    \ autonomy. In other words, no external power is available to supply them with\
    \ \nenergy. In order to reach this target, three components are often needed:\
    \ a renewable power source, \nan energy storage unit, and a charge/discharge control\
    \ module to handle the battery operations. \nTo achieve a fairly efficient energy\
    \ system, a set of LiPo batteries together with reduced-size \nsolar panels were\
    \ installed in every sensor node. Due to the complexity of the LiPo batteries,\
    \ a \nspecific controller is needed to manage the load of the battery. For this\
    \ purpose, a LiPo Rider module \nwas chosen. \nIn this way, we achieved good energy\
    \ efficiency through a self-charging module that permits \nthe sensor node to\
    \ work autonomously for extended periods of time. This was achieved by using \n\
    specific Arduino code and hardware configuration that help to reduce the base\
    \ rate of energy \nconsumption and a solar panel/battery tuple. \n5.1. Nodes \n\
    The Arduino models analyzed for the prototyping were Arduino Mega ADK, Arduino\
    \ Uno, \nand Arduino Nano. Each of these three mentioned models is composed of\
    \ a microcontroller together \nwith several other board elements. By studying\
    \ different models, we aimed to accomplish two \nobjectives. Firstly, we aimed\
    \ to test the minimum required features regarding the number of sensors, \ninputs,\
    \ and so on, and contextualize this with its economic potential. The second objective\
    \ was about \nthe energy consumption of these modules in each field of application.\
    \ \nIn Table 2, a visual comparison of different energy hardware and software\
    \ setups shows the \nduration and consumption, giving an idea of which are the\
    \ main key points about the energy \nconsumption pattern in Arduino devices. It\
    \ is important to note that these consumption values are \nbased on an individual\
    \ ATmega328P Microcontroller and Arduino Uno board, which also include \nFigure\
    \ 8. MATLAB code of the “Analysis High Temperature Calculation” function that\
    \ is called by the\nMaximum Temperature React.\n5. Energy Eﬃciency\nEnergy management\
    \ is another one of the key points of IoT agricultural projects, especially for\n\
    those that are located in a large unwired area. The end devices that incorporate\

    \ to reduce the base rate of energy consumption\nand a solar panel/battery tuple.\n\
    5.1. Nodes\nThe Arduino models analyzed for the prototyping were Arduino Mega\
    \ ADK, Arduino Uno,\nand Arduino Nano. Each of these three mentioned models is\
    \ composed of a microcontroller together\nwith several other board elements. By\
    \ studying diﬀerent models, we aimed to accomplish two\nobjectives. Firstly, we\
    \ aimed to test the minimum required features regarding the number of sensors,\n\
    inputs, and so on, and contextualize this with its economic potential. The second\
    \ objective was about\nthe energy consumption of these modules in each ﬁeld of\
    \ application.\nIn Table 2, a visual comparison of diﬀerent energy hardware and\
    \ software setups shows the\nduration and consumption, giving an idea of which\
    \ are the main key points about the energy\nconsumption pattern in Arduino devices.\
    \ It is important to note that these consumption values are\nbased on an individual\
    \ ATmega328P Microcontroller and Arduino Uno board, which also include the\nmentioned\
    \ ATmega328P and, additionally, other on-board elements. Both of them were compared\
    \ in\nidle state and using software energy-saving technics through Sleep modes.\n\
    Sustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n14 of 17\nTable 2. Arduino consumption comparison\
    \ per hour for Idle and Sleep Modes in a Microcontroller\nATmega328P and Arduino\
    \ Uno board. Calculated over a LiPo 3.7 V 1400 mAh battery [35].\nSetup\nConsumption\n\

    \ Mode 1\n0.36 mAh\n3888 h\n1 Several sleep modes are available; this table is\
    \ based on Sleep_MODE_PWR_DOWN.\nA conclusion from Table 2 is that some of the\
    \ most important consumption problems are\nrelated to non-linked microcontroller\
    \ elements. This information opens a potentially wide range of\nenergy-related\
    \ improvements that can be accomplished by reducing the number of non-essential\n\
    elements included by default in Arduino boards. Eventually, this can help to create\
    \ more energy-eﬃcient\nnodes. Recapitulating, testing which is the minimum technical\
    \ requirement allowed selecting the\nappropriate Arduino Board for each node function.\
    \ Therefore this was an important point about energy\nimprovement experimentation\
    \ regarding the Arduino platform. Other component consumption,\nfrom sensors or\
    \ ZigBee modules, will be presented in the following sections, but power consumption\n\
    can be considered of marginal respect to Arduino module consumption.\n5.2. Sensors\n\
    Regarding sensor energy consumption and diﬀerent powering modes, it naturally\
    \ depends on\nthe nature and model of the sensors. However, this project seeks\
    \ to establish a base to allow future\ndevelopment to speciﬁc agriculture applications.\
    \ Due to this ﬁnal target, speciﬁc sensor models are not\na priority. Commonly,\
    \ we use generic sensors to collect temperature, rain, or humidity measurements.\n\
    5.3. Communications\nAnother aspect for consideration is the one regarding the\
    \ use of speciﬁc protocols for internal\nand external communications. The ZigBee\
    \ protocol provides better adaptability to particular IoT or\nWSN needs, e.g.,\
    \ reducing energy consumption, packet size, simpliﬁed design of speciﬁc topologies,\n\
    or network routing are some of the advantages. This makes the implementation much\
    \ easier, robust,\nand secure.\nRegarding the energy consumption, ZigBee protocol\
    \ counts on parameters leveraging\nconﬁguration parameters to achieve lower energy\
    \ consumption, such as sleep modes. In Table 3, XBee\nZigBee power consumptions\
    \ in several available modes are presented.\nTable 3. XBee ZigBee Serie 1 power\
    \ consumption per hour [27].\nXBee ZigBee Mode\nConsumption\nSleeping Mode 1\n\
    10 µA to 49 µA\nAwake Mode\n50 mA\nTransmitting Mode\n45 mA\nReceiving Mode\n\
    50 mA\n1 Consumption may vary according to diﬀerent sleeping modes and supply\
    \ voltage.\nAnother point regarding the protocols is QoS (Quality of Service),\
    \ routing algorithm,\nand bandwidth organization. Finding a lighter protocol and\
    \ its correct parameter and keeping\nthe best network performance is not a trivial\
    \ task.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n15 of 17\n5.4. Self-Charging System\n\
    Achieving a system that can eﬃciently provide suﬃcient energy is one of the main\
    \ targets. Due to\nthis fact, a more extensive experimentation process was conducted\
    \ for this decision. Regarding both\nWSN and IoT projects, energy management is\
    \ one of the most limiting issues to take care of. A solution\ncan be functional\
    \ and technically correct from a design perspective, but in real situations deployed\n\
    in rural areas, these solutions must endure diﬀerent environmental and operational\
    \ aﬀairs, working\nproperly and for long periods of time. In order to reach this\
    \ target, the proposed energy system can be\nsplit into three parts.\nA set of\
    \ photovoltaic solar panels (6 V 1 W) will provide the energy system with a renewable\n\
    energy source. In the market, there are plenty of versions with diﬀerent capacity,\
    \ size, technology,\nand pricing. We tested several models for the sensor nodes,\
    \ but since our choice was restricted by the\ncost-performance ratio, we eventually\
    \ selected a standard photovoltaic panel.\nBatteries are the ones allowing the\
    \ deployed system’s prototype to continue operating during night\nhours. In the\
    \ market, there are plenty of models and technologies regarding batteries. After\
    \ evaluating\nthe diﬀerent alternatives, a LiPo battery was ﬁnally included. These\
    \ batteries are currently the most\nfrequently employed in a project such as,\
    \ for example, radio-control planes or drones. These batteries\nare interesting\
    \ for IoT projects due to their capacity and constant discharging rate. Regarding\
    \ the\nnegative points, two factors must be mentioned. The price of these batteries\
    \ is not cheap, but it is still\naﬀordable. Perhaps, the most important disadvantage\
    \ lies in the handling complexity.\nDue to the previously mentioned complexity\
    \ for using LiPo batteries, a third component is needed.\nA device must control\
    \ the charge and discharge of the LiPo battery at all times. This is highly important\n\
    because an incorrect setup or unbalanced charge in the design of these LiPo batteries\
    \ could lead to\nmalfunctioning or accidents. There are several of these controllers\
    \ on the market. In this project, a LiPo\nRider was chosen.\nTaking into consideration\
    \ the previously discussed power consumption of each system component,\nthe whole\
    \ device is able to work day and night autonomously. The system uses the LiPo\
    \ battery\nduring those periods of time when light is not available and a solar\
    \ panel as a recharging element.\nThus, the device can sustain extended periods\
    \ of work without further energy support.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this manuscript,\
    \ we have introduced a low-cost, energy-eﬃcient WSN system for smart\nirrigation.\
    \ The system provides contributions not only related to energy- and cost-eﬃciency,\
    \ but also\nregarding the data analysis done based on weather forecasts and sensor\
    \ values. This analysis allows\nreducing the number of times that the pump is\
    \ activated, which translates into water and energy\nsavings. However, the system\
    \ not only reduces water and energy consumption but also provides\ndetailed information\
    \ about the savings derived from its use and triggers automatic notiﬁcations.\n\
    From the design point of view, one of the most important factors to reduce the\
    \ gap between a\nprototype model and a market-ready system is the economic cost.\
    \ As mentioned in the introduction,\none of the main targets of this project was\
    \ to present an interesting and aﬀordable solution for middle\nand small farming\
    \ companies. With this idea in mind, several technical decisions have been made\n\
    under these premises. Environmental sensors are among the most common and well-known\
    \ sensors\nin the market. LiPo batteries are widely used in radio-control modeling.\
    \ Furthermore, open hardware\ndevices like Arduino are easy to obtain. These devices\
    \ have a broad support community around with\nthousands of users, projects and\
    \ tutorials. Additionally, this project is not only based on open hardware\ndevices\
    \ such as Arduino, but the ﬁnal schemas and codes were also released as open hardware\n\
    and software with the intention of creating a not-for-proﬁt community around the\
    \ system to ensure\ncontinuous evolution.\nFinally, it is worth to mention that\
    \ among the future lines of work, authors plan to evolve the\nelectronic design\
    \ towards a PCB to get cheaper devices in order to signiﬁcantly reduce the total\
    \ cost\nSustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n16 of 17\nof the project. In addition,\
    \ authors plan to perform in-ﬁeld real energy-consumption measures to\ncompare\
    \ if the oﬃcial information provided by the datasheets corresponds to the real\
    \ ones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.R.-R., Á.M. and S.M.; Formal\

    Internet of Tings (IoT) refers to a vast network that provides an interconnection
    between various objects and intelligent devices.

    Te three important components of IoT are sensing, processing, and transmission
    of data. Nowadays, the new IoT technology is

    used in many diﬀerent sectors, including the domestic, healthcare, telecommunications,
    environment, industry, construction,

    water management, and energy. IoT technology, involving the usage of embedded
    devices, diﬀers from computers, laptops, and

    mobile devices. Due to exchanging personal data generated by sensors and the possibility
    of combining both real and virtual

    worlds, security is becoming crucial for IoTsystems. Furthermore, IoTrequires
    lightweight encryption techniques. Terefore, the

    goal of this paper is to identify the security challenges and key issues that
    are likely to arise in the IoTenvironment in order to guide

    authentication techniques to achieve a secure IoT service.

    1. Introduction

    In recent years, technology sector has known a real evolu-

    tion. Furthermore, it has become an indispensable tool in

    our everyday life. Among these recent technologies, the

    Internet of Tings (IoT) has been improved continuously

    and has attracted more and more people. Tis growth has

    positively impacted many sectors, including social security,

    agriculture, education, water management, house security,

    smart grid, and so on. Terefore, the number of connected

    devices is increasing day after day. According to Strategy

    Analytics, the connected objects will reach more than 38

    billion by the end of 2025 and 50 billion by 2030 [1].

    IoT is a new technology that allows the implementation

    of systems interconnecting several objects, either in the

    physical or virtual world [2, 3]. In fact, the evolution of the

    Internet began with the creation of a simple computer

    network linking personal computers and then moved on to

    client-server architecture networks, World Wide Web,

    e-mail, ﬁle sharing, etc. Subsequently, it now reaches a wide

    area network interconnecting billions of intelligent objects,

    which were embedded in sophisticated systems. Teir op-

    eration is based on sensors and actuators designed for

    monitoring, controlling, and interacting with the physical

    environment where they exist.

    Despite many advantages, IoT has three main problems

    that are data collection, data transmission, and data security.

    To collect data, many sensing tools have been introduced

    and adapted to the IoT devices. For transferring collected

    data, various protocols have been developed and adapted in

    order to enable to the IoT devices to connect to existed

    networks and exchange data. However, for the last one, it

    does not give the attention that it merits. Consequently,

    many classic and recent security issues are closely related to

    the IoT as well as authentication, data security, authoriza-

    tion, etc. Indeed, a weakness in authentication can lead to

    numerous attacks, including replay attack, Denning–Sacco

    attack, denial of service attack, password guessing attack, etc.

    On the other hand, the authentication of IoT devices

    throughout heterogonous and interconnected protocols is a

    great challenge. Moreover, these protocols should take into

    account issues related to limitation of IoT devices as well as

    energy consumption, small memory size, and low processing

    capability [4–33].

    In the literature review, previous studies [34–45] have

    surveyed the security of IoT technology. However, our study

    reveals some security challenges and issues of IoT. Conse-

    quently, the focus of this review paper is to categorize the

    security tasks and topics that are encountered in the IoT

    environment. Hence, we provide here a short guidance to

    researchers to accomplish secure IoT services like authen-

    tication, access control, and so on.

    Te remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In

    Section 2, IoT architecture is detailed. Section 3 is reserved

    for discussing IoT security issues. IoT security requirements

    are presented in Section 4. In Section 5, we compare some

    authentication approaches applied in IoT authentication

    environment. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 6.

    2. IoT Architecture

    Te concept “Internet of Tings” may be deﬁned as a

    standard that refers to a large network connecting various

    sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers introduced in

    distinct objects. A large number of interconnected equip-

    ment such as smartphone, industrial machines, computers,

    vehicles, medical tools, irrigation system, TVs, or refriger-

    ators can be part of the IoT [46]. Furthermore, IoTis a rather

    recent design that stands out from its antecedents, including

    all traditional, mobile, and sensor-based Internet networks.

    IoT includes a very large number of hybrid terminals. Since

    the majority of these devices can be connected to the In-

    ternet, they generally support common web techniques,

    including HTTP, JSON, XML, etc. One of the strengths of

    this technology is that it is well supported and can therefore

    be adapted to diﬀerent existing infrastructures. Further-

    more, some new protocols are especially considered for IoT,

    for example, CoAP and MQTTare alternatives to HTTP and

    6LoWPAN is also an alternative of IPv4/IPv6.

    Due to non-standardization of IoT, there are various

    architectures that are diﬀerent [47]. However, we focus here

    on two known ones that are three- and ﬁve-layer archi-

    tectures. As illustrated in Figure 1, the three-layer archi-

    tecture consists of three layers including perception,

    networking, and application layers. Te role of each layer is

    described in the following.

    (i) Te perception layer is the ﬁrst layer of IoT ar-

    chitecture. It is connected to the physical world for

    sensing and collecting data from their environment.

    Tis layer consists of sensors and actuators to

    measure some values such as temperature, pH, light,

    gas, and so on, and to detect some functionality such

    as location and motion.

    (ii) Te network layer is the second layer; its role is to

    connect to various smart devices, gateways, and

    servers. It is responsible for transferring the

    captured values to other IoT network components.

    For these reasons, IoT uses several kinds of com-

    munication protocols and norms such as 4G/5G,

    Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN, WiMAX, and

    so on [48].

    (iii) Te application layer can oﬀer the speciﬁc service

    requested by user. For instance, this application can

    provide doctors some health parameters of patients.

    Tis layer determines which applications can be

    installed, such as smart environment [49–52], smart

    homes [53–55], and water monitoring [56, 57].

    On the other hand, the ﬁve-layer architecture includes

    processing and business layers in addition to the three

    previous ones. As depicted in Figure 2, the ﬁve layers are

    perception, transport, processing, application, and business

    layers. Te responsibilities of perception, transport, and

    application layers are identical to the similar layers in three-

    layer architecture. Te roles of the addition layers are de-

    tailed as follows:

    (i) Te processing layer is also recognized as the mid-

    dleware layer. It is responsible for controlling, an-

    alyzing, processing, and storing received data. It can

    make decisions according to the processing data

    without human intervention. Tis layer beneﬁts

    from existing solutions including cloud computing,

    big data, and databases.

    (ii) Te business layer has a responsibility to manage the

    whole IoT systems [47]. So, its role is to control ap-

    plications, business, and proﬁt models. Furthermore,

    the users’ privacy can be managed by this layer.

    Security and Communication Networks

    3. Security Issues in IoT

    3.1. DOS. Denial of service (DOS) is a security attack that

    aims to prevent legitimate user and entity to have an au-

    thorized access to network resources. It is considered as the

    most popular and dominant attack. Generally, attackers can

    use ﬂooding attack to exhaust system’s resources including

    memory, CPU, and bandwidth [58–63]. Tus, he either

    prevents the system to provide service or he makes it in-

    eﬀective. In this attack, pirates can use numerous skills such

    as sending unwanted packets or ﬂooding network with

    multiple messages. Terefore, legitimate users are prevented

    from taking advantage of services.

    3.2. Replay Attack. Replay attack is among old attacks on

    communication network, especially on authentication and

    key exchanging protocols. It allows the pirate to capture and

    store a fragment or the whole of captured session in a le-

    gitimate traﬃc [64, 65]. After gaining the trust in a public

    network, the attacker either sends the captured message to

    the entity that has participated in origin session or to another

    diﬀerent destination [66]. Terefore, in IoTnetworks, replay

    attack is measured as a security weakness in which particular

    data are stored without any authorization before been sent

    back to the receiver. Te goal of this attack is to trap the

    person in an unauthorized operation [67]. For example, in a

    smart home system, a temperature sensor is used to detect

    the temperature and then the measured values are sent to

    system controller. Based on these values, the system can run

    or stop the air conditioner to adapt the air temperature as

    desired by the personnel. However, if an attacker has pirated

    the sensor’s temperature, he can save the day’s values and

    send them at night. As result, the air conditioner will not be

    functioning normally.

    To deal with replay attack, current solutions use three

    main mechanisms including timestamp, nonce, and re-

    sponse-challenge. Te ﬁrst one is the mechanism that helps

    to detect replay attack by checking the freshness of received

    message. Nonetheless, it is hard to assure time synchroni-

    zation between IoT objects [68]. Te second mechanism is

    the nonce, which is a series of random digits. However, the

    problem of this mechanism is that the node has no suﬃcient

    memory for keeping the list of received nonces. Te last

    mechanism is the challenge-response. It has as objective to

    verify that the other party can resolve some challenges. But

    this technique necessitates that the two entities have a

    preshared secret.

    3.3. Password Guessing Attack. Due to the importance of

    password in authentication process and its large adoption by

    numerous authentication protocols, pirates have invented

    various attacks to get the correct one. Hence, the most used

    attack is password guessing. Particularly, this attack can be

    executed either online or oﬄine. In this attack, an attacker

    eavesdrops on the communication between two entities

    during authentication phase to get some useful values. Ten,

    attacker must guess all probable passwords to succeed in the

    authentication [60, 69–75].

    3.4. Spooﬁng Attack. In the network security context,

    spooﬁng attack is a situation when an unauthorized entity

    produces falsiﬁed parameter [76]. Te goal of this attack is to

    make servers believe that the attacker is an authorized entity

    [62]. So, the pirate gains the trust of the authority. For

    example, in smart health, the pirate can send fake infor-

    mation to authentication server. So, if he performed the

    authentication phase successfully, he can request victim’s

    sensor and then get the secret health information about this

    victim [38, 77–79].

    3.5. Insider Attack. In cyber security ﬁeld, insider attack

    occurs when a legitimate entity that has an authorized access

    tries to harm the system. Te action of authorized entity can

    be either intentional or accidental [80–84]. In both cases, the

    system is considered vulnerable and we should ﬁnd out the

    solution in the short term. According to [85], more than 57%

    of conﬁdential business data are targeted by insider attack.

    On the other hand, the study [86] conﬁrms that more than

    60% of existing attacks have been completed by insider.

    4. Required Security Services for IoT

    After debating various security attacks applied by attackers,

    this section mentions some security services. Tus, the

    objective of this section is to discuss the security require-

    ments for IoTdevices. As illustrated in Table 1, IoTsolutions

    must come with some basic security services including

    authorization, authentication, conﬁdentiality, availability,

    integrity, and non-repudiation.

    4.1. Conﬁdentiality. Generally, conﬁdentiality can be de-

    ﬁned as the capability and aptitude to prevent an unau-

    thorized user to access private data. Terefore, it promises

    and guarantees that the personal information is only con-

    sulted, edited, or removed by authorized entity [38]. Par-

    ticularly, in the Internet of Tings network, conﬁdentiality is

    one of the signiﬁcant security services. However, the con-

    ﬁdentiality is the most attacked service [87]. For example,

    viruses, spywares, and Trojans are considered as malware

    applications that attack the conﬁdentiality of the user’s

    private data. Tey can interact with system as executable

    codes or scripts with the aim to have an unauthorized access

    [88].

    In an IoT context, for warranting and assuring the

    conﬁdentiality of personal information captured by sensors

    and for preventing them from being discovered by the third

    party, the encryption algorithms and cryptographic methods

    can be used [89]. Terefore, all transmitted data between two

    devices must be encrypted. As a result, nobody can un-

    derstand the message except legitimate entities [90].

    4.2. Availability. An alternative required security service of

    IoT is the availability of resources to the legitimate entities

    independent of where and when they exist. Availability

    denotes that the resources and information must be easily

    reached by the legitimate user when he wants [91]. More-

    over, in the IoT architecture, the sensor is available if it can

    communicate the sensed values in real time.

    Likewise, the availability of an actuator means that it can

    execute user received commands immediately without any

    remarkable delay.

    Te availability of some particular resources could be

    interrupted as consequences of usage of dissimilar data

    transmission channel, networks, and protocols [46]. On the

    other hand, for damaging the availability, attackers may use

    three main malicious attacks including denial of service

    (DOS) attack, ﬂooding attack, or black hole attack. For the

    ﬁrst one, it is probably practiced in the availability situation.

    Pirates can use the simple denial of service (DOS) attack or

    distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack that necessitates

    the collaboration between various resources. For the

    ﬂooding attack, the attacker can ﬂood the networks by

    unwanted messages and commands for exhausting device

    resources. Tis attack not only targets bandwidth but also

    decreases CPU and memory capabilities. So, the device will

    not be reached or the communication will be slow [92].

    In order to guarantee the availability of appropriate

    resources, we can select distributed approach for operating

    the system and use numerous platforms which simplify the

    incorporation of various systems remotely [76].

    4.3. Authentication. Authentication service is considered

    the biggest challenge in the IoT network. It includes veri-

    ﬁcation of identity. On the one hand, in the authentication

    procedure, the devices must be able to check the validity and

    legitimacy of remote use in a public network. On the other

    hand, authentication prevents unauthorized person to take

    part in a private secured communication [38]. Previous

    authentication schemes are based on single factor that is a

    simple password. However, these schemes have to face

    various issues related to the password. First of all, users can

    easily forget the password. Secondly, users may have weak

    password. Finally, attackers are able to guess the correct

    password, either using exhaustive research attack or dic-

    tionary attack. Accordingly, password-based authentication

    is not enough to promise security. In our days, authenti-

    cation schemes based on smart card oﬀer multifactor au-

    thentication [4–9]. Typically, the system requires two factors

    including a valid smart card and correct preshared secret.

    Even so, it comprises the use of biometric print.

    Due to

    the important

    position of authentication

    mechanism in the Internet of Tings security, we have re-

    served the two following sections for discussing various

    techniques used for authentication in IoT and for studying

    some proposed IoT authentication schemes.

    4.4. Authorization. With the growth of number of con-

    nected objects to the Internet network, authorization is

    becoming a critical issue in the IoTsystem. In fact, it refers to

    the security service responsible for determining user right

    and privileges (read, write, or delete). It identiﬁes also the

    access control rules to allow or deny permissions to the IoT

    devices. Tus, the challenge is to prevent users with limited

    privileges to get additional ones to have an unauthorized

    access to devices and their data [93–97].

    4.5. Integrity. Integrity means that the message was not

    reformed by an unauthorized entity in the transmission

    session. So, it guarantees that the receiver has received

    exactly what the source has sent. Te main objective is to

    stop an unauthorized object doing illegal modiﬁcation.

    For sustaining the safety of smart devices in IoTnetwork,

    the system should guarantee data integrity. Terefore, nei-

    ther unauthorized objects nor user access should be granted.

    Besides, the cryptography and encryption mechanisms can

    be applied when the transmitted data are very important

    [37]. For instance, the authors of [98] suggested the usage of

    HMAC-SHA 256 algorithm for reassuring data integrity.

    4.6. Non-Repudiation. Non-repudiation is one of the se-

    curity aspects, which insures that communication members

    have ability to send or receive information in its integrality

    [99]. In addition, it makes conﬁdent that the transfer of data

    or identiﬁcations between two IoT objects is undeniable

    [100]. Non-repudiation guarantees to a source node to send

    its data, as well as to a receiving node to conﬁrm that the

    received data are matching with data’s source [34].

    5. IoT Authentication Techniques

    Due to the ability of IoT to access to all users’ information,

    the user’s private life must be protected against the malicious

    attacks. Furthermore, the devices should not be accessed by

    unauthorized users. So, it is necessary to check the user’s

    identity before getting the authorization. Hence, the veri-

    ﬁcation of user’s identity can be done in many ways.

    Nevertheless, the most frequently used is authentication

    system, which is based on the prior sharing secrets, keys, or

    passwords. Consequently, in this section, we review the

    techniques that are applied for reinforcing the authentica-

    tion in IoT environment.

    5.1. One Time Password Authentication. One time password

    (OTP) which is also called dynamic password is a password

    that is valid for authentication in one transaction. In the

    literature survey, various OTP authentication protocols are

    proposed for securing the communication in IoT environ-

    ment. Tese protocols are founded based on various

    mechanisms such as time synchronization, hash factions

    (MD5, SHA1, and SHA256), and cryptography RSA. Be-

    sides, they are all based on the OTP algorithm created by

    Lamport [101–104]. Unfortunately, these protocols are

    vulnerable against some attacks as described in [105–108].

    On the other hand, for reinforcing the OTP authenti-

    cation, Lee and Kim [109] proposed in 2013 an insider at-

    tack-resistant

    OTP

    scheme

    based

    on

    bilinear

    maps.

    However, it needs complex computation. Based on this

    problem, Shivraj et al. [110] proposed a robust OTP scheme

    for IoT. Te proposed protocol uses the principles of

    lightweight identity-based elliptic curve cryptography and

    Lamport’s OTP algorithm.

    5.2. ECC-Based Mutual Authentication. Generally, IoT de-

    vices have a limited resources. Besides, the communication

    between sensors, actuators, objects, and nodes must be in

    real time. For these reasons, it is indispensable to propose a

    lightweight authentication protocol for IoT. Accordingly,

    Azrour et al. [71] proposed an eﬃcient authentication

    scheme for IoT. Tis protocol is based on elliptic curve

    cryptography (ECC) which is measured better than the

    traditional RSA encryption algorithm. Furthermore, in

    addition, various authentication protocol based on ECC are

    proposed in [111–115]. Elliptic curve cryptography is

    considered more eﬃcient and more secure especially for

    systems with limited memory and processing capabilities.

    5.3. ID- and Password-Based Authentication. ID-based au-

    thentication is an approach for distinguishing authorized

    entities from illegal ones. According to ID, the user is either

    allowed or denied to access the resource. User ID refers to all

    attributes that can characterize one user form another, for

    instance, username, e-mail, phone number, IP address, etc.

    In IoT environment, numerous protocols are proposed

    [74, 116–118] based on this technique. However, this

    method is generally adopted in the server/client authenti-

    cation architecture. In view of that, a server is required in

    IoT environment for storing user’s ID and secret in server’s

    database.

    On the other hand, the usage of ID-based authentication

    approach has some issues that are detailed in following lines.

    Firstly, how user’s data are stored in server? Is the server

    capable to protect them against stolen veriﬁer attack and

    insider attack? Secondly, users may forget their authenti-

    cation parameters. Terefore, they cannot perform the next

    authentication. In this case, it is not suitable to save personal

    ID in an electronic device (laptop, tablet, and smartphone),

    even if it is not connected to public network. Tirdly, the

    transmission of user ID in public network is another

    challenge. In this situation, the hash functions or cryptog-

    raphy algorithm are recommended.

    5.4. Certiﬁcate-Based Authentication. For addressing prob-

    lems of ID- and password-based authentication, an alternative

    approach was proposed [119]. Tis technique is called certif-

    icate-based authentication. Certiﬁcate-based authentication

    has been commonly adopted by multiple applications. For

    example, in order to verify user''s identity in banking appli-

    cation, Hiltgen et al. [120] proposed a new certiﬁcate-based

    authentication scheme. Tis approach has been also used in

    IoT environment [120–124]. Although certiﬁcate-based au-

    thentication provides more security, device certiﬁcate pro-

    cessing and used algorithms necessitate a high processing

    resource, which is not always available in IoT devices. As a

    result, this approach is not suitable for IoT objects [125].

    5.5.Blockchain. Blockchain is a particular sort of database.

    It is diﬀerent from a traditional database because of the

    speciﬁc way in which it stores data. Blockchains save data

    in a series of blocks that are then linked to each other. In

    recent years, diﬀerent authors have taken advantage of

    this recent technology to propose authentication protocol

    for IoT [22, 31–33, 126, 127]. Te sustainability and

    veriﬁcation of the data stored in the blockchain provide

    Security and Communication Networks

    5

    the conﬁdence to use accurately recorded data in the

    future and at the same time provide transparency, ano-

    nymity, and traceability.

    Multiple and diﬀerent authentication methods are used

    in the IoT environment. As demonstrated in Table 2, the

    majority of proposed IoTauthentication protocols are based

    on encryption cryptography. In this situation, two types of

    cryptography are used. Te ﬁrst type is asymmetric en-

    cryption algorithm such as ECC, while the second one is

    symmetric encryption algorithm like AES. Furthermore, the

    hash functions are utilized in some authentication for

    hashing essential parameters. Finally, the random numbers

    are also adopted in certain protocol as they can be used to

    ensure the freshness of messages.

    On the other hand, the advantages and limitations of

    some selected IoT authentication protocols are depicted in

    Table 3. As we can notice, the protocol is considered eﬀective

    only if it is lightweight as well as fulﬁls all security re-

    quirements. To sum up, we can conclude that the running

    time and processing time are important due to the limitation

    capability of IoT devices.

    6. Conclusions

    Internet of Tings has a signiﬁcant role in the rapid de-

    velopment that recent technology has known recently. Tese

    technologies have made the exchange of data easier.

    However, the security of user’s data should not be ignored.

    Accordingly, the study performed in this paper is mainly

    focused on the security of IoTtechnology. Hence, as we have

    mentioned before, IoT suﬀers from several attacks, namely,

    DOS, password guessing, replay, and insider attacks. Au-

    thentication is the ﬁrst security services that IoT has to

    satisfy, so we have detailed the authentication approaches

    adopted for IoT. Te most techniques used for rienforcing

    the authentication are one time password, ECC-based

    mutual authetication, ID-based authentication, certiﬁcate-

    based authentication, and blockchain. After comparing re-

    cent authentication protocols, we have concluded that the

    majority of them is based on encryption cryptography.

    Finally, in our future work, we will try to enhance the

    security of IoT environment by proposing secure and eﬃ-

    cient IoT authentication schemes.

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The population would reach
    ten billion by 2050, and experts believe that the agricultural sector needs to
    boost production by 70% to satisfy the demand. Traditional farming practices rely
    on primitive technology that creates a yield gap with low productivity. A paradigm
    shift towards merging new technologies in the agriculture sector would enhance
    productivity, optimize cost, and encourage sustainable development. In this paper,
    we review the necessity for the fusion of the Fourth Industrial Revolution technological
    approach in the agricultural domain. We discuss the gap in supply chain management
    for the Industrial sector and Agricultural sector and identify the issues of vendor-specific
    production systems. We propose a multimodal communication model for the systematic
    integration of multi-vendor agricultural production systems. Our model utilizes
    the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware to enable communication between
    heterogeneous production systems to perform farming operations in a coordinated
    manner. Experimental work is conducted on a small-scale hydroponic farm to evaluate
    the system performance in terms of throughput, latency, and packet delivery ratio
    (PDR). The throughput for our proposed DDS system has significantly improved with
    the use of the BATCH QoS policy for payload size less than 1024 bytes. However,
    we incur an average latency of approximately 235 microseconds for any payload
    size. The value of PDR is 1 for any payload size ensuring our system to be reliable.
    The results suggest that our model can enable interoperability between multi-vendor
    production systems in real-time while incurring minimum latency. Proposed multimodal
    communication model in the agro-industry. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume:

    predict population estimation to reach 10 billion by 2050 and 16.5 billion by
    2100. As a consequence, the demand for food would escalate; agricultural production
    needs to increase by 70% to sustain this population growth. Currently, agriculture
    produces around 80-85% of food globally, but only 5% of the world’s population
    works in agriculture. Agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of freshwater
    withdrawal and 90% of total water consumption worldwide. Moreover, urbanization
    leads to nutrition transition increasing processed food and meat consumption from
    36.4 kilograms to 45.3 kilograms per person in 2030 [1]–[6]. A significant challenge
    faced by the agricultural sector is coping with the indeterministic weather conditions,
    deteriorating soil conditions, and negative environmental impact by farming practices.
    This sector needs to adapt to new technologies for enhancing productivity and
    efficiency to meet the food requirement of the increasing population. The prospective
    of future agriculture would provide social benefits such as food security as well
    as environmental benefits [7]–[9]. Agricultural processes are mainly crop and
    animal production, but mixed farming is gaining popularity due to its added advantages.
    Mixed farming is a combination of both arable farming and pastoral farming that
    can conserve the nutrient cycle in agriculture [10], [11]. With the advent of
    emerging technologies, agricultural operations would need to move away from the
    traditional methods and adopt new technologies that increase yield and production,
    reduce resource and post-harvest waste, recycle bio-waste and increase bio-diversity
    [12]. Due to unpredictable weather patterns, reduced fertile land, and issues
    of agricultural infrastructure, we tend to move towards sustainable agriculture
    through the use of automation and digitization. The Fourth Industrial Revolution
    (Industry 4.0) [13], [14] will have a crucial influence on the agricultural domain
    to scale and commercialize production [5]. The first industrial revolution began
    in 1760 with the invention of steam engines. With the discovery of the internal
    combustion engine, the second industrial revolution started around 1900. Eventually,
    this led to mass production with the use of oil and electricity. In the 1960s,
    the third industrial revolution started and characterized by the use of a programmable
    logic controller (PLC) [15] and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
    [16] systems to automate the manufacturing process. Hence industrial automation
    was first possible using electronics and information technology. The fourth industrial
    revolution, in 2011, transformed the industry integrating the cyber-physical system
    (CPS) [17], [18] and the Internet of Things (IoT) [19], [20] network to interconnect
    industrial production systems. Industry 4.0 provides greater versatility and more
    efficient resource allocation to optimize production and improve product life
    cycle [21]. Figure 1 outlines the industrial revolutions. FIGURE 1. Outline of
    industrial revolutions. Show All The foundational technologies [22] associated
    with the Industrial Revolution 4.0 are as follows: IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT)
    Autonomous Robots Simulation System Integration - Vertical and Horizontal Additive
    Manufacturing Big Data and Analytics Cloud Computing Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    Augmented Reality Cybersecurity Drones Smart Sensors Many of the above technologies
    are not recent innovations, but the application in the agricultural domain is
    limited. The advantages of incorporating Industry 4.0 approaches are improved
    productivity with lower production risks, bulk data collection for analysis, greater
    control over internal processes, and cost-effective. The most vital aspect of
    production in the industrial sector is the supply chain management [23], [24].
    Therefore value creation in the agricultural domain must align with supply chain
    management. The uncertainty in farming supply chain management is due to the unpredictable
    weather and environmental (soil and nutrient dynamics) conditions [25]. This complexity
    in the agricultural domain makes experience-based heuristic methods appropriate.
    Existing approaches in farming supply chain use data-driven technologies such
    as precision agriculture to increase yield, reduce pest and disease infestation,
    and optimize resource usage. Other technologies, such as Bluetooth, Global Positioning
    System (GPS), and radio frequency identification (RFID), enable communication
    between machinery and systems to produce optimized, interconnected, and independent
    production systems. With Industry 4.0, we need to rethink the concept of supply
    chain and manage system integration. The main idea is the merging of the real-world
    environment and digitalized systems along whole agricultural supply chains. Emergent
    technologies, such as the IoT, Cloud Computing, Robotics, and AI, have the potential
    to progress to the next agricultural revolution [26]–[30]. Agriculture 4.0, that
    advanced from the Green Revolution (Third Agricultural Revolution) [31], uses
    system integration and coordination between farming activities. Agriculture 4.0
    will have to balance between demand-side and the supply chain value side of the
    food-scarcity equation, using technology to improve and address the real concerns
    of the value chain. The tools and machinery in the farming environment have advance
    embedded technology, which allows automation and real-time communication with
    interlinked production systems. The use of robotics, AI, cloud computing, and
    big data analytics would further boost overall productivity, improve sustainability,
    and reduce the yield gap. Nonetheless, planning and control can be inconvenient
    due to the high mobility of production plants and inconsistent communication.
    Agricultural activities can be sequential or parallel, thereby requiring a highly
    coordinated system. A crucial aspect in the area of supply chain management is
    the ability to coordinate activities. Industry 4.0 relies on the concept of independent
    CPSs to reliably communicate with each other and achieve a high level of coordination.
    Table 1 displays the design principles [32], [33] that govern the Industry 4.0.
    TABLE 1 Design Principles of Industry 4.0 The vision of Agriculture 4.0 is considerably
    limited to the application of precision farming and automation. This limitation
    is due to the use of distributed vendor-specific production systems in the agro-industry.
    The increased degree of complexity with heterogeneous production systems can render
    the agro-industry inoperable. We propose a multimodal communication model for
    the agro-industry to integrate these multi-vendor production systems. The objective
    of our research is to introduce a model that allows interoperability and adaptability
    between production systems in a heterogeneous environment in real-time. The rest
    of the paper is structured as follows: Section II reviews the literature survey
    comprising the approaches taken in agriculture and agro-industry. Related terminologies
    and their applications in the smart agricultural systems are highlighted in Section
    III. Section IV provides an overview of the real-time distributed systems and
    DDS model and architecture. Our proposed communication model is presented in Section
    V. Section VI describes the experimental work carried out for our study, followed
    by results discussion in section VII. Finally, in section VIII, the conclusion
    and future work are discussed. SECTION II. Literature Review Traditional agricultural
    methods are not adequate to meet the population demand. Due to the unpredictable
    weather and environmental conditions, farm producers are shifting towards Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) and IoT based smart farming systems to enhance productivity
    and efficiency while reducing negative impacts on the ecosystem. Several prominent
    studies have been carried out by various research groups in the agriculture domain
    [34], [35], and details of a few works have been presented in this section. Developments
    in the communication network infrastructures and technologies have led to the
    integration of modules in WSN that provide connectivity between nodes and change
    network topology from centralized to distributed infrastructure. The authors of
    [36] designed an automated variable rate irrigation system that allows remote
    monitoring and control of a site-specific irrigation system using a distributed
    wireless sensor network. The proposed system consists of an in-field sensing station
    that periodically monitors the environmental conditions, an irrigation control
    station that controls remote sprinkler head valves, and a base station that processes
    the data. In-field sensed data, along with data from weather stations, are transmitted
    to the base station wirelessly. The graphical user interface was developed for
    real-time monitoring and control and implemented using wireless in-field sensing
    and control (WISC) software, which was elaborated in [37]. The base station calculates
    the watering instructions based on the in-field data and sends control signals
    to the nozzle controller to automate the irrigation process. In [38], the authors
    presented an autonomous device to optimize water usage in agriculture using wireless
    sensor nodes with GPRS connectivity. The system design consists of an electronic
    board (main-board), sensor-board, and GPRS-board. The configuration information
    is loaded during bootup, and the main-board defines the sampling time, rate of
    transmission, server configurations, and GPRS settings. The crop and environmental
    data are collected by the external sensors, which are interfaced to the sensor-board
    and transmitted to a remote storage server via GPRS-board for further analysis.
    The system is implemented following a client-server architecture, which can serve
    as a bottleneck when the number of sensor nodes is increased. A computer-based
    vertical hydroponic system was developed by Rius-Ruiz et al. [39] that analyzes
    and calculates the optimum low-cost nutrient solution for tomato plants. The authors
    of [40] proposed a reliable control system to cultivate tomato plants hydroponically
    using a different frequency band on the IEEE standard protocol. Wireless sensor
    nodes measure the environmental parameters in real-time and send the aggregated
    data to the system via a gateway. Based on the temperature, light intensity, and
    humidity readings, the proposed hydroponic control system calculates evapotranspiration.
    If the value exceeds a certain threshold set by the user, then control signals
    are sent to the actuator system that controls the flow of nutrients. The authors
    believe their system to be fault-tolerant and acknowledge the existence of scalability
    issues. Nevertheless, both works do not track or automatically manage all the
    required parameters for agricultural production. Also, the system is not suitable
    for large size of data. There have been tremendous advances in sensing and network
    technologies that enable multiple sensors to connect and integrate for real-time
    management of the farm. For the development and implementation of IoT solutions,
    embedded devices like microcontrollers and single-board computers have been used.
    An automated IoT-based connected farm was introduced in [41] for growing and monitoring
    crops. The proposed system can integrate multiple farms which can support several
    IoT devices. The three main components are the physical devices, &Cube, and Mobius.
    The physical devices are the sensors and actuators that monitor and measure the
    environmental parameters. &Cube is the software platform deployed on the IoT gateway
    for enabling connectivity of devices to the connected farm. Mobius is an oneM2M
    compliant IoT service platform that facilitates the monitoring and controlling
    of the connected farm. Any IoT device can connect to Mobius via &Cube through
    registration. The users can monitor and access the farm data via web or mobile
    application using RESTful API interfaces implemented on the Mobius. The authors
    implemented the proposed farming system and mobile application to test the feasibility.
    Also, service scenarios are described to highlight the advantages of a connected
    farm. However, considering the heterogeneity of existing communication devices
    and protocols, it lacks versatility. The authors of [42] proposed a ubiquitous
    sensor network platform using IoT technologies to integrate heterogeneous machines,
    monitor and control crop growing systems for precision agriculture. The three
    elements of the proposed platform are Things, Local Gateway, and Network and Cloud.
    These elements are distributed into four layers and use the Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol and RESTful API as the communication paradigm. Experimental
    work was conducted using embedded devices, such as Raspberry Pi, and sensor networks
    on a hydroponic station within a greenhouse. The authors concluded their system
    to be cost-effective and lower water usage. However, there is a lack of versatility
    in this proposed method, and the use of gateway could give rise to scalability
    issues. Kamruzzaman et al. [43] developed an IoT-based device for smart farming
    to monitor and control environmental factors that affect crop production. Sensors
    to measure soil and atmospheric conditions are interfaced with a microcontroller,
    and the aggregated data is transmitted to a remote server via a WiFi module. A
    data analysis and prediction algorithm called autoregressive integrated moving
    average (ARIMA) is implemented to predict future environmental conditions for
    better growth. The authors do not consider the integration of several heterogeneous
    IoT devices in the system. Also, it followed the client-server communication paradigm
    that can act as a bottleneck when more number of IoT devices are integrated into
    the system. IoT networks can consist of heterogeneous devices, and one key challenge
    is the interoperability between them. Recent research on sematic interoperability
    allows system integration using the Web of Things (WoT) [44], [45]. Touseau et
    al. presented ASAWoO [46], a WoT based middleware platform, to integrate heterogeneous
    cyber-physical objects using Avatars in a farming environment. It employs WoT
    technologies for interoperability between objects and uses opportunistic networking,
    an extension of the Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN), for connectivity between physical
    objects. The physical objects, controlled through Avatars [47], [48], monitor
    and manage environmental conditions at the farm. Avatars functionalities are implemented
    as REST services, which are invoked using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and
    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) application-level protocols. The authors
    validated the proposed platform by deploying it on single-board computers (Raspberry
    Pi) to act as physical objects on an experimental farm. The Avatars hide device
    heterogeneity, and the platform implemented as a loosely coupled client-server
    architecture ensures monitoring of the farming environment in real-time. Although
    this platform can be beneficial when there is no network infrastructure, numerous
    data exchanges and highly mobile objects can make it less efficient. The authors
    of [49] intorduced an IoT-based water management system for monitoring water consumption
    in real-time at smart agricultural farms. The system has microcontrollers integrated
    into the nodes and gateway for balancing between accuracy and energy efficiency.
    Detailed schematic diagrams of the components are presented as a design objective.
    The sensor nodes have external sensors interfaced to the microcontroller to measure
    the soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rain, and water level. The measured
    environmental data is sent to the cloud or mobile application via the gateway
    using LoRa and WiFi modules. The experiments conducted show the feasibility of
    the system in tunnel farming. The authors believe their system to be cost-effective,
    achieving higher productivity and flexibility to manage multiple independent farms.
    The authors did not address the data packet loss in the proposed application.
    Also, efficiency might reduce when more nodes are needed. Triantafyllou et al.
    [50] proposed a remote sensing reference architecture model that employs IoT and
    WSN technologies for monitoring smart farming systems. The model components are
    distributed similarly to the OSI Model into seven layers, namely Sensor Layer,
    Link Layer, Encapsulation Layer, Middleware Layer, Configuration Layer, Management
    Layer, and Application Layer. The sensors and smart embedded devices to measure
    and monitor environmental parameters reside in the Sensor Layer. The Link Layer
    composes the network and routing technologies between sensors for data transfers.
    The encapsulation of the in-field measured data takes place in the Encapsulation
    Layer to connect to the internet. The Middleware Layer interconnects heterogeneous
    IoT nodes or devices using application-level transport protocols. This layer is
    responsible for the interoperability of different devices and their underlying
    protocols. The Configuration Layer is responsible for data aggregation, organization,
    and publication as context information. The Management Layer processes and analyzes
    the collected data based on data mining or management methods. The application
    module for users resides in the Application Layer. The authors present a use case
    study based on the DIAS project to understand the proposed architecture model.
    However, this work did not consider the communication mechanism between the seven
    abstraction layers, and no real implementation was carried out and discussed.
    In [51], the authors proposed an autonomous sensor network to monitor and control
    irrigation systems for rural agriculture environments. The prototype developed
    is suitable for small or medium-sized farms. The system consists of sensor nodes,
    a coordinator node, and a cloud platform. The sensor nodes are microcontrollers
    (Arduino NANO) with external sensors, actuators, and the Zigbee module interfaced
    for communication. Environmental parameters such as temperature, light, humidity,
    and rain levels are measured and aggregated data sent to the coordinator node
    using Zigbee protocol for communication. The coordinator node consists of a microcontroller
    (Arduino Mega ADK), WiFi module (ESP8266), and Zigbee module. Local weather information
    can be accessed using the weather forecast API. The received sensor data is sent
    to the cloud platform using MQTT as the communication protocol. The users can
    visualize information and control the watering system remotely. The authors believe
    their system to be cost-effective with the capacity to self-charge. However, the
    authors did not perform in-field extensive experiments to validate system performance.
    The evolution of IoT in the agricultural sector will incorporate IoT technologies
    in different production systems to enable automation. With automation in farming
    operations and machinery, modern agriculture directs towards becoming more industrialized
    to fulfill future food production demands. The authors of [52] introduced Ipanera,
    an IoT-based platform to control water quality in a distributed aquaponics system
    using Industry 4.0 technologies. The system architecture consists of endpoints
    with adaptive fuzzy logic controllers, analytical and web servers, and an IoT
    cluster. The authors believe that their platform would integrate and adapt multiple
    soil-less food production systems to automate and control the water quality. However,
    the authors did not carry out any experimental work to validate their proposal.
    The stages of agricultural food production systems require a balance between the
    supply chain and the value chain. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies
    promote the automation of production systems and enable food traceability [53].
    Agricultural logistics interconnect producers and consumers to trace the whole
    production process [54]. Pang et al. [55] proposed an IoT-based value-centric
    framework to trace the food production supply chain. Sensor portfolios are derived
    from value creation, availability, and cost assessment analysis to track and monitor
    production logistics. The authors implemented a prototype to check the feasibility
    of their proposed system. However, the authors did not consider reliability and
    connectivity issues in WSN. Most of the existing research uses a centralized client-server
    communication pattern, which becomes a single point of failure. Also, the addition
    of more IoT devices can act as a bottleneck, degrading system performance. IoT
    systems are highly distributed, with the devices being characteristically heterogeneous.
    This heterogeneous nature gives rise to interoperability and connectivity issues.
    There is a lack of integration between heterogeneous systems that can make it
    inconvenient to expand businesses with different IoT devices. Integration of legacy
    proprietary systems into modern farming systems is difficult due to interoperability
    issues. These studies do not tackle the challenges of incorporating IIoT technologies
    in the agricultural domain, as mentioned in [56], [57]. Few works used the MQTT
    protocol, which follows a broker based publish-subscribe pattern. Although it
    solves the interoperability issues, the system suffers from centralization problems
    with a single point of failure reducing performance. Furthermore, none of the
    works in the literature consider the different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements
    of production systems. Therefore, from a careful examination of existing studies,
    we concluded that there is a requirement for a communication model to integrate
    multiple modular heterogeneous production systems. Our proposed model would enable
    horizontal and vertical integration of modules while ensuring reliability and
    versatility. Interoperability between systems would automate the production process
    enhancing productivity and efficiency. SECTION III. Related Terminologies Various
    techniques have been adopted by researchers and practitioners to enhance productivity
    and efficiency in agriculture. Related terminologies and approaches are discussed
    in details in this section. A. Internet of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks
    The authors of [58] proposed a context-aware middleware, that uses ontology model
    for context representation, to provide abstraction of the collected data from
    ubiquitous greenhouses and process or filter the data depending upon the services
    intended to be received by the user. For performance evaluation, the proposed
    middleware was integrated with the management system in the greenhouse. Soil and
    environmental sensors were deployed in the greenhouse as well as CCTVs were installed
    to acquire all the data produced from the greenhouse. The environmental parameters
    were controlled using ventilation system, irrigation system etc. that are in turn
    controlled through a PLC. The proposed system was tested by measuring CPU usage
    and response time and the authors believed it to be practical. Zamora-Izquierdo
    et al. [59] proposed and developed a platform that incorporates automation, IoT
    technologies, edge and cloud computing to monitor and manage the closed hydroponic
    system with recirculation using saline water. The proposed system architecture
    has been divided into three planes namely local CPS plane, edge plane and cloud
    plane. The CPS plane is responsible for atomic decisions taken by CPS nodes after
    it gathers data from sensors. The main precision agriculture tasks are managed
    in the edge plane where CPS nodes communicate using MQTT [60], [61] or CoAP [62],
    [63]. The cloud plane performs data storage and analysis. It maintains communication
    with the system using Next Generation Service Interface. The authors implement
    the proposed platform in a real greenhouse environment and conclude that their
    system is reliable and cost-effective in semi-arid conditions. The SheepIT project
    [64] was introduced to develop an IoT-based autonomous solution for monitoring
    and condition the sheep’s posture and location in vineyards. The details of the
    requirements of the SheepIT project was discussed in [65]. The system architecture
    composed of two modules namely WSN that included set of mobile nodes and beacons
    to perform local functions of the system and Computational Platform (CP) that
    provided data storage and data analysis for the user [66]. The proposed stack
    consisted of four layers (Physical Layer, MAC Layer, Transportation Layer and
    Application Layer) and are described in details in [67]. In [68], the authors
    reviewed the proposed stack and focused primarily on the design and development
    of the gateway connecting the two modules, WSN and CP. The gateway apart from
    forwarding data between the two modules support few real-time critical functions
    such as raising alarm in case of emergency, perform on-site administrative tasks
    and enabling technical interruptions. The performance of the gateway was evaluated
    in a real scenario and authors concluded the proposed system to be feasible and
    scalable. B. Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks The adoption of artificial
    intelligence and machine learning techniques have enhanced productivity and eased
    the decision process in the agricultural industry. Machine learning algorithms
    and automatic classification techniques are more effective in the detection and
    monitoring of crops or livestock than manual methods. Seed classification is vital
    for seed harvesters to ensure the quality of the product. The research in [69],
    [70] proposes the use of machine learning and ant colony optimization algorithms,
    and data mining techniques to classify seeds more accurately. Frost events in
    farmland can be harmful for crops and can affect the production of goods [71].
    The peach project in [72] proposed using IoT technologies in predicting frost
    events in orchards. The authors deployed a low-power dense mesh network with sensors
    to collect data and predict the frost events. The authors of [73] extended this
    work by applying appropriate machine learning algorithms to predict the frost
    events with fewer errors and more sensitivity. There are three stages involved
    in predicting frost events and the authors mainly focused on the second stage
    which is training the frost-prediction engine using machine learning algorithms.
    They proposed to use Bayesian networks (BNs) [74] and random forest (RF) [75]
    for regression and logistic regression and binary trees for classification. The
    samples were generated using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)
    [76]. Also, thermodynamic information of neighboring location has been used to
    improve the accuracy of the prediction. IoT based hydroponic system using Deep
    Neural Networks [77] proposed by Manav Mehra et al. implemented Deep Neural Network
    (DNN) at the edge for controlling the parameters of the hydroponic system and
    at the cloud for classifying the control action based on the parameters collected.
    Parameters such as pH, temperature, humidity, water level and light intensity
    are measured by sensors in real-time and sent to the microcontroller. The single-board
    computer acts as the edge where the DNN model is implemented and trained from
    the cloud based on the data set. The predicted output based on the DNN model is
    then communicated to the microcontroller for the appropriate action to be taken.
    A case study for the growth of tomato plant was conducted using the developed
    prototype and results showed an accuracy of 88.50%. Mark F. Hansen et al. [78]
    presented three face recognition techniques in order to identify the individual
    pigs on the farm. A webcam was placed on the drinker connected to a laptop to
    collect digital images of the pigs. The collected image data undergoes structural-similarity
    index measure (SSIM) [79] to remove similar data. The authors proposed using convolutional
    neural network and a fully connected layer for feature extraction and classification.
    The proposed algorithm identified pigs based on three regions namely snout and
    wrinkles above snout, marking on top of the head and eye regions. It was compared
    against Fisherfaces [80] with Euclidean distance and VGG-face pre-trained Convolutional
    Neural Network [81] with linear support vector machine (SVM) for face recognition.
    The authors concluded that their proposed algorithm is feasible and provides an
    accuracy of 96.7%. C. Drones The term “Internet of Drones (IoD)” was first coined
    in [82], presenting the conceptual architecture to tackle the drone airspace management
    problem along with defining new terminologies and goals of the proposed model.
    Nayyar et al. [83] introduced the concept of the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT),
    including the associated technologies, challenges, and applications. The authors
    also highlighted some real-time implementations in smart agriculture and smart
    city domains. In [84], the authors presented an end-to-end IoT platform for precision
    agriculture with the help of sensors and drones. The proposed platform ensures
    connectivity and availability even during power and Internet outages. The system
    architecture consisted of four modules namely sensors and drones, IoT base station,
    IoT gateway and cloud service. The authors proposed a weather-aware IoT base station
    that ran on solar energy and the different components are duty cycled based on
    the weather forecast and charge state of the batteries. The IoT gateway provided
    local functions in the farm and also summarized the collected data to be uploaded
    to the cloud. The authors also incorporated a path planning algorithm and yaw
    control algorithm for the drone to optimize the energy consumption and extend
    the battery life of the drones. In addition, the generation of the precision map
    from drone and sensor data have been implemented. The proposed system was deployed
    in two farms and each components have been evaluated in terms of power, time and
    accuracy. In [85], the authors discuss the use of AR drones for irrigation in
    the agricultural domain and propose to implement Optimized Link State Routing
    Protocol (OLSR) [86], [87] to route the information between devices in an ad hoc
    network. To enhance the video sensing and transmission quality, they integrated
    Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [88] and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    [89], [90] protocols in the system. In another variation [91], the authors propose
    using multiple AR drones forming mobile ad hoc network (MANET) for intelligent
    video sensing to deploy herbicide sprayer based on a geo-reference system. They
    believe the system can save the amount of herbicide used, and the quality of the
    crop is improved. A distributed swarm control algorithm was proposed in [92] to
    allow control of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems used for agricultural
    purposes. A single operator can remotely control the multi-UAV system using control
    inputs such as velocity control, formation control, and collision avoidance control.
    The system has two layers, the UAV control layer that manages the formation of
    multiple UAVs and the teleoperation layer that controls the motion and velocity
    of the UAVs. The authors implemented the proposed algorithm using a robot operating
    system and Gazebo to validate and evaluate the control algorithm. They concluded
    that the proposed distributed control algorithm is more efficient than a single
    UAV system. The added advantage of utilizing DDS middleware for communication
    between multiple UAV systems are presented and discussed in [93], [94]. D. Cyber
    Security An attacker can discover new methods to infiltrate the IoT based farming
    systems, raising new security and privacy concerns that require better security
    mechanisms to tackle the issues in communication [95]. To protect against false
    data injection attacks, the authors of [96] proposed a Lightweight Privacy-preserving
    Data Aggregation (LPDA) system to aggregate fog-computing data from hybrid IoT
    devices at the network edge by applying homomorphic Paillier encryption [97],
    Chinese Remainder Theorem, and one-way hash chain. Security analysis using differential
    privacy techniques [98], [99] implied the proposed scheme to resist against differential
    attacks. The proposed technique was evaluated against Aggregation with the Basic
    Paillier Encryption (AggBPE) in terms of communication overhead and computational
    cost, and the experimental results indicated it to be lightweight for fog-computing
    nodes. The use of RFID technology in agriculture is growing significantly, from
    monitoring and tracking cattle to use in food traceability systems [100], [101].
    Due to privacy and security concerns, the authors of [102] introduced an anonymous
    lightweight RFID authentication system for distributed IoT environments using
    hash functions. The proposed system architecture included an authenticated cloud
    server, a back-end database server for each RFID network, and clusters containing
    readers and RFID-tags. The proposed authentication scheme had three phases and
    used hash functions. Although false data injection and distributed denial-of-service
    attack (DDoS) attacks are not considered, the proposed system can protect against
    cloning attacks, replay attacks, forgery attacks, and location tracking attacks
    as described in functional and security analysis. In [103], the authors introduced
    a security model to allow secured data communication independent of the network
    infrastructure using symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, digital
    signature, digital envelope, and public key infrastructure (PKI). The authors
    believe their proposed scheme can ensure data security but consume more energy
    due to the inclusion of authentication overhead. E. Autonomous Technologies Automation
    technologies in the agricultural industry have made farms more productive and
    automate the production cycle of crops or livestock. With the development of autonomous
    vehicles, farming operations need to consider the entire production system to
    enable a high degree of automation. While these innovations are recent, a growing
    number of agricultural businesses have been implementing field automation in their
    industrial processes. The EU-project CROPS [104] developed a modular and reconfigurable
    agricultural robot to perform agricultural tasks such as monitoring, spraying,
    and harvesting. In [105], the authors studied the detection of powdery mildew
    in grape vineyards and the application of pesticides to control the disease using
    the robot developed by CROPS. The proposed system automatically identified the
    disease and applied spray while reducing the amount of pesticide used. The authors
    introduced an autonomous Agricultural Robot (AgBot) System [106] that can detect
    weeds using Haar feature-based cascade classification and spray a controlled amount
    of herbicide or fertilizers while navigating using GPS. In [107], the authors
    proposed a solution for the connection between the autonomous vehicle and spray
    management system to perform spraying operations autonomously in the field. The
    architecture comprised of four subsystems, namely, mobile tracking robot, localization
    and navigation system, smart spraying system, and human-machine interface (HMI)
    system. The performance of the system was evaluated in the greenhouse and vineyard
    scenario, and results indicated that the autonomous vehicle followed the desired
    trajectory. The authors believe their proposed system can expand by incorporating
    other applications using this approach. Other automation advances in greenhouse
    technology and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) are discussed in detail
    in [108]. Most of the research implements Industry 4.0 technologies in their systems
    to enhance productivity or reduce cost without taking into account the possibility
    of heterogeneous vendor-specific production systems. The communication between
    these production systems needs to be homogeneous. Hence we tend to propose a communication
    model that will integrate these production systems. The proposed model relies
    on DDS middleware [109] discussed in the following sections. SECTION IV. Background
    A. Real-Time Distributed Systems A distributed system is a group of autonomous
    devices that interact and coordinate through a network. The integration approaches
    shown in figure 2 for a distributed system are as follows: Point-to-point (application-centric)
    Centralized Distributed (data-centric) FIGURE 2. Integration approaches for distributed
    systems. Show All The point-to-point approach is tightly-coupled with high life-cycle
    costs, difficult to maintain, poor information sharing, and robustness. Centralized
    integration relies on the broker hence resulting in low scalability and performance
    with a single point of failure. On the other hand, the distributed integration
    approach has high throughput with low latency, high scalability, high reliability,
    integration logic is vendor-independent, robust, and high availability. Due to
    these advantages, DDS follows a distributed integration approach. Real-time systems
    are time-constrained systems where expected response time can be assured. Their
    classification is of three types, which are explained as follows with the help
    of figure 3. In figure 3, e 1 and e 2 represents two consecutive events in time.
    Hard Real-Time: The timing constraint is defined as a point of time i.e. t( e
    1 )=t( e 2 ) . Soft Real-Time: The timing constraint is defined as a window of
    time i.e t( e 1 )<t<t( e 2 ) . Acceptable time window but can be flexible by few
    seconds. Firm Real-Time: The timing constraint is defined as a strict window of
    time i.e t( e 1 )<t<t( e 2 ) . Time window is strict and delays are not acceptable.
    FIGURE 3. Timing constraint diagram for real-time systems. Show All B. Data Distribution
    Service The Object Management Group (OMG) introduced DDS in 2004, an open data-centric
    standard, to address the communication challenges of real-time mission-critical
    applications with the issue of scalability in mind [110]. This specification standard
    intends to integrate heterogeneous systems enabling interoperability and portability.
    The purpose of the DDS specification is to allow the sharing of information efficiently
    in a distributed environment masking the underlying complexities [111]–[113].
    The specification standard is composed of the DDS application programming interface
    (API) and Data Distribution Service Interoperability (DDSI) wire protocol. There
    are two interface levels specified in the DDS API standard, namely Data-Centric
    Publish-Subscribe (DCPS) and Data Local Reconstruction Layer (DLRL). The lower
    DCPS layer deals with topic-based data dissemination using the publish-subscribe
    paradigm. This layer aims to provide an efficient delivery mechanism between the
    Publishers and Subscribers. The higher layer, DLRL, is responsible for allowing
    the integration of DCPS components into the application. This layer is optional
    and helps application developers to create an object model above the DCPS layer
    hiding the underlying DCPS information. Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) is
    the standard DDSI wire protocol that ensures interoperability between the various
    implementations of the DDS standard [114]–[116]. DDS also encompasses a rich set
    of QoS policies that control the communication behavior and properties of information.
    The model of DDS relies on the concept of a fully distributed Global Data Space
    (GDS) in which participants can either publish or subscribe to data. Due to the
    decentralized implementation of GDS, there is no single point of failure or bottleneck
    that might degrade the performance. A domain is a single GDS instance uniquely
    identified by domain ID. As shown in figure 4, the DDS Entities belonging to a
    particular DDS domain are as follows: Domain Participant: It represents the joining
    of an application to a specific domain. A single application can join multiple
    domains by creating multiple domain participants with different domain IDs. DDS
    Entities are contained and managed by the domain participant. Topic: Topic is
    defined as a 3-tuple Entity composed of a unique name, type, and QoS parameter.
    It is associated with a unique key to distinguish a topic instance. Samples are
    updates of topic instances that are produced or consumed by the Publisher or Subscriber,
    respectively. Topic types can be specified using Interface Definition Language
    (IDL), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), Unified Modeling Language (UML), or annotated
    Java. DataWriter: This Entity generates samples of one or more instances of a
    topic with a given QoS. It is associated with the Publisher to write data to the
    GDS. A single DataWriter is owned and managed by one Publisher only. DataReader:
    It consumes samples of one or more instances of a topic with a given QoS. It is
    associated with the Subscriber to read data from the GDS. A DataReader can store
    multiple samples in the cache based on the QoS setting. A single DataReader is
    owned and managed by one Subscriber only. Publisher: The Publisher is the Entity
    that is responsible for publishing data with a given QoS. It can send data for
    several different topics with different data types. Multiple DataWriters are owned
    and managed by a single Publisher. Subscriber: This Entity is responsible for
    receiving the published data in the GDS with matches QoS. It can read data for
    numerous different topics with different data types. Multiple DataReaders are
    owned and managed by a single Subscriber. FIGURE 4. Architectural representation
    of data distribution service model. Show All Domain participant nodes in the GDS
    are either a Publisher, Subscriber, or both. A Publisher encloses one or more
    DataWriters, whereas a Subscriber contains one or more DataReaders. These DataWriters
    and DataReaders will be automatically discovered and matched to other participants
    with similar properties establishing connections. Adaptive connectivity enables
    a Publisher or Subscriber to join or leave the DDS domain at any given time. Active
    participants in the GDS are discovered by the Participant Discovery Protocol (PDP)
    that exchange information and establish endpoints using the Endpoint Discovery
    Protocol (EDP) [117]. The communication behavior of the system relies on a set
    of configurable parameters specified in the QoS policies, as shown in Table 2.
    Each policy governs a particular aspect of Entity behavior, which can be configured
    using QoS parameters to ensure reliable and efficient communication. Due to the
    fully distributed nature of DDS, the standard offers incredibly high levels of
    efficient abstractions to create and integrate distributed modular systems on
    a large scale. Therefore, we tend to utilize the concept of DDS in the agricultural
    domain. TABLE 2 Quality of Service Policies Governing Data Distribution Service
    Behavior SECTION V. Proposed Model In our study, we introduce a novel multimodal
    communication model to integrate real-time farming production systems in a heterogeneous
    environment. The proposed model uses a distributed integration approach along
    the agricultural supply chain. Our model uses the DDS specification standard by
    OMG that enables the communication between the different automation layers of
    agro-industry production plants. Figure 5 depicts the proposed multimodal communication
    model that is tailored to the requirements of the agro-industry. The automation
    levels along with the tasks are discussed below: Level 0: This automation level
    (field-level) consists of sensors and actuators to accumulate data from the environment
    and perform an action respectively. Typical examples of sensors can be a temperature
    sensor, humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, electric conductivity sensor, pH
    sensor, light sensor, thermal sensor, solar radiation sensor, barometric pressure
    sensor, carbon dioxide sensor, dissolved oxygen sensor, macro-mineral sensor,
    wind speed and direction sensor, air-quality sensor, RFID tags, weight sensors,
    etc. Actuators can be sprayers, linear actuators such as stepper motors, spreader
    actuators to spread fertilizers and pesticides, electric motors, hydraulics. Level
    1: Control level where machines have PLC, or proportional–integral–derivative
    (PID) integrated into them. In a typical factory environment, this could be a
    single production line. In our case, a single Zone Controller (ZC) is placed within
    a farming zone to control and perform a particular function. For example, a ZC
    used to control the temperature in a greenhouse farm. Level 2: This supervisory
    (process control) level functions to synchronize and control all machines or production
    lines in an integrated manner. A process management system, such as SCADA, is
    used to monitor and control multiple systems in real-time. The Farm Controller
    (FC) is used to gather data for analysis, monitor, and control in an automated
    manner. FC can manage multiple ZCs with the help of a graphical user interface
    (GUI) or Human-Machine Interface (HMI) remotely. Level 3: This Production Planning
    and Control level (PPC) comprises the manufacturing execution system (MES) that
    serves to control the planning and operations of the entire plant from raw materials
    to the finished product in real-time. PPC manages multiple FCs to work in a coordinated
    manner to achieve the target. Data gathered from lower levels are analyzed and
    help the actors for the decision-making process. This planning level ensures optimized
    productivity and cost by adjusting the system in real-time. An example in the
    agro-industry would be the management of multiple hydroponic farms that harvest
    different food products. Each product might need different environmental conditions
    to cultivate. Therefore PCC controls the activities related to only production
    of the intended product. Level 4: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) level is
    the management level in the industrial plant. The role of ERP is to maintain overall
    production planning via the ERP system. It deals with product life cycle management,
    supply chain management, and warehouse management, etc. ERP controls all activities,
    from production to distribution and consumption. FIGURE 5. Proposed multimodal
    communication model in the agro-industry. Show All As discussed above, all the
    levels have distinct functions to be carried out along the supply chain. A high
    level of coordination might be necessary between each level to enhance productivity
    and quality, reduce the production cost, and to ensure sustainable production.
    Synchronization and integration are significant between automation levels to reduce
    the yield gap. Therefore, interoperability between modular production systems
    is of great importance. We propose to implement DDS middleware to enable the communication
    between these production systems in different automation levels. The production
    systems would act as Publishers or/and Subscribers. The integration of DDS middleware
    would make the system more flexible and adaptable to changes in real-time. Another
    advantage of using DDS middleware is the availability of a rich set of QoS policies
    that govern the communication between the systems. These QoS policies would impact
    the overall performance of the system and ensure efficient resource usage. A.
    Case Study Illustration for the Employment of the Proposed Communication Model
    in Hydroponic Systems We represent a case study to describe and elaborate on the
    proposed communication model in the context of smart agriculture. Nowadays, farm
    producers are shifting towards hydroponic systems. Hydroponic systems have more
    efficient water utilization with an increase in production confined in a limited
    dense space. Also, crops are grown faster in a well-controlled hydroponic system.
    These systems provide an opportunity to cultivate crops in an unfavorable environment.
    Therefore, we consider a smart hydroponic system to discuss our case study. Figure
    6 illustrates the reference architecture for our case study. The hydroponic system
    components consist of several subsystems, sensors to measure the crop and environmental
    conditions, and actuators to control the environmental parameters. Each subsystem
    in the hydroponic system performs a particular function. For example, the circulation
    system monitors and controls the liquid flow in the system. Farming operations
    require multiple subsystems to integrate and coordinate among themselves. The
    lighting system, ventilation system, and irrigation system need harmonization
    to utilize water efficiently. Sensors are used to measure the temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, pH, nutrient level in the reservoir, electric conductivity, water
    quality, total dissolved salts (TDS), and carbon dioxide of the system. The sensor
    types, models, and their usages are shown in Table 3. The subsystems receive data
    from the sensors, check against a predefined threshold, and send control signals
    to the actuators. The actuators receive the control signals and execute commands
    to switch on or off the ventilation fan, submersible pump, or window linear actuator
    to reserve water. TABLE 3 Sensor Types, Models and Their Usages in Our Case Study
    FIGURE 6. Reference architecture of the smart hydroponic farm case study. Show
    All Smart agriculture, more precisely smart hydroponic systems, are information-intensive
    systems that may have strict QoS requirements. Our proposed model follows a data-centric
    approach, and the isolation of individual components adds modularity to the system.
    Based on the reference architecture, we define our data model for the smart hydroponic
    system. We map the defined data model to the DDS domain, data types, and topics.
    The elements of the system are domain participant nodes that join or leave multiple
    DDS domains. These nodes can act as Publishers, Subscribers, or both. Each node
    can distinctly define information as topics. The updates of the topic instances,
    known as data samples, are exchanged between them. All communication between the
    components of the system is through the middleware. The auto-discovery mechanism
    of DDS middleware would allow any component to join or leave the DDS domain at
    any time. Therefore, integrating two or more components to coordinate and perform
    a particular operation is simple without the need for centralized control. The
    architecture, shown in figure 6, consists of six subsystems, nine sensors, and
    three actuators. The sensors are the Publishers that publish environmental conditions
    to the GDS. The subsystems act as both Publishers and Subscribers where it subscribes
    to the sensed data and publishes control data. The actuators are the Subscribers
    of the control data. In the perspective of our proposed multimodal communication
    model, we categorize the automation levels in an agro-industry environment. At
    level 0, the sensors and actuators exist to measure and control the local farming
    processes. The Zone Controllers (ZCs), at level 1, monitor the data and send control
    instructions to the actuators. Typical ZCs are the subsystems that manage the
    functions in a single farming zone. Microcontrollers connected to sensors and
    actuators can function as ZCs. At level 2, the Farm Controllers (FCs) regulate
    multiple subsystems to work in a coordinated manner. It receives the aggregated
    data from the ZCs and analyzes it for better decision making regarding the whole
    production process on a single farm. Single-board computers such as Raspberry
    Pi or BeagleBoard can function as FCs. At level 3, PPC operates multiple farms
    to ensure optimized productivity and cost by adjusting the system in real-time.
    ERP, level 4, maintains the overall production planning along the whole supply
    chain. With regards to the reference architecture, the subsystems make up the
    ZCs. The sensors and actuators connect to the ZCs. The FCs operate several ZCs
    to automate the hydroponic production. All communications within a single hydroponic
    plantation follow a publish-subscribe pattern using DDS middleware, ensuring modularity
    and reliability. SECTION VI. Experimental Work For our experimental work, we used
    single-board computers as FCs to set up on a small scale hydroponic farm. The
    dimensions of the hydroponic system are 10m long and 1m wide. Figure 7 and 8 exhibits
    the interior of the farm. The farm had five polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) pipes with
    hollows made for pots with Rockwool, a reservoir with a submersible pump, and
    a ventilation fan. The water flowed from the top to the bottom pipeline using
    the pump in a closed recirculation. The system components are the sensors, actuators,
    ZCs, and FCs. Sensors, such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and ultrasonic
    sensors, are used to measure and sense the environment. A submersible water pump
    and ventilation fan are the actuators of the hydroponic system. Figure 1 presents
    the schematic circuit diagram of the ZC. The sensors, actuators, and the WiFi
    module are interfaced to it, as seen in the figure. The ZCs transmit the aggregated
    data to the FCs, which in this scenario are the single-board computers. The FC
    target machines were Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, and we checked the feasibility and
    performance of the proposed system against a system that uses plain sockets. The
    ZCs and FCs would act as both Publisher and Subscriber and communicate via DDS
    middleware. The purpose of the experiment was to analyze the system performance
    using DDS standard middleware for data communication. FIGURE 7. Small-scale hydroponic
    farm (front view). Show All FIGURE 8. Small-scale hydroponic farm (back view).
    Show All Assuming the channel is error-free, we will evaluate the system in terms
    of throughput, average latency, and packet delivery ratio (PDR) as performance
    metrics. The QoS policies used for our research are as follows: RELIABILITY: This
    policy indicates the extent of reliability the system can provide or receive.
    There are two kinds, RELIABLE or BEST_EFFORT. For RELIABLE kind, the Publisher
    will continue sending data until all the data is completely received by the Subscriber.
    For BEST_EFFORT, the Publisher will not resend data in case of failure. HISTORY:
    Defines how the system will buffer data and send data gradually. KEEP_LAST and
    KEEP_ALL with depth as optional are the two kinds. KEEP_ALL kind stores all the
    data in the buffer, whereas KEEP_LAST stores the latest data with depth=1 as the
    default values. DURABILITY: Specifies how long the data can exist after being
    written. There are four kinds, namely VOLATILE, TRANSIENT, TRANSIENT_LOCAL, and
    PERSISTENT. VOLATILE indicates that no samples of data are kept. TRANSIENT means
    data is stored in memory. TRANSIENT_LOCAL keeps data in local memory and is associated
    with the DataWriter. For PERSISTENT, data is kept on permanent storage. PRESENTATION:
    Two Boolean, coherent_access and ordered_access, control how the data is represented
    to the Subscriber. Coherent_access if true represents the set of changes as a
    unit to the Subscriber. Ordered_access represents the changes in order as occurred
    in the Publisher. RESOURCE_LIMITS: This policy states the amount of resources
    that can be consumed. It is defined by the integer variable max_samples and max_samples_per_
    instance. The default value is set to LENGTH_ UNLIMITED. Table 4 denotes the parameter
    values set for each QoS policy for our experimental work. We run the hydroponic
    system for two weeks to collect and model the network traffic of the system. We
    use D-ITG (Distributed Internet Traffic Generator) [118] to generate the modeled
    network traffic. We vary the payload size (data sample size) in bytes for the
    system and measure the throughput, average latency, and PDR with and without DDS
    middleware. Another extended QoS policy feature of DDS is BATCH to reduce transmission
    overhead associated with reliable communication. We examine the effect of batching
    on the throughput of the system. TABLE 4 QoS Policy Parameters Defined for the
    Experimental Work SECTION VII. Results and Discussion In this section, we discuss
    the performance results of our experimental work. Our research aims to measure
    the system performance with DDS middleware integrated for reliable communication
    between production systems in a heterogeneous environment. We compare these results
    with the system with no DDS implemented, i.e., communication via UDPv4 sockets.
    Furthermore, we observe the effect of batching on the throughput. The throughput
    is measured by the average rate of successful data messages delivered in a given
    time. Figure 10 presents the throughput graph against varying payload sizes for
    our proposed DDS system and system without DDS middleware (UDPv4 sockets). There
    is a linear increase in throughput for packet size more than 32 bytes until it
    saturates at 8192 bytes, as seen in the figure. For payload size greater than
    8192 bytes, the throughout saturates around 95 Mbps for both systems. The maximum
    bandwidth supported by the network interface controller (NIC) of FCs is 100 Mbps.
    Therefore, the throughput increases with an increase in payload sizes until it
    reaches maximum network utilization at around 95% for both systems. FIGURE 9.
    Schematic circuit diagram of the Zone Controller (ZC). Show All FIGURE 10. The
    figure presents the throughput of the proposed DDS system compared against system
    without DDS implemented with varying payload size. Show All Referring to [36],
    [38], we will look more closely at throughput results for payload size between
    32 and 1024 bytes. Table 5 exhibits the throughput results obtained from the experimental
    work. From figure 11, we can view the graphical representation of the throughput
    results. The system using DDS middleware and no BATCH QoS policy for communication
    has a linear increase in throughput. However, a system using plain sockets performs
    better than using DDS middleware. The gap between the throughput values of both
    systems increases with increasing payload size. The difference in the throughput
    values is highest at 512 bytes. A significant improvement in the throughput is
    observed with the use of the BATCH QoS policy. Batching aggregates the data samples
    into a single data packet specified by the batch size parameter. When packet size
    is less than 1024 bytes, the throughput of our proposed system with BATCH QoS
    policy is higher. Therefore, using our proposed model for communication would
    be more efficient. TABLE 5 Throughput Values Attained From the Experimental Works
    FIGURE 11. The figure shows the throughput of the proposed DDS system compared
    against system without implementation of DDS and the use of BATCH QoS policy.
    Show All Average latency denotes the time required by the data samples to reach
    the Subscriber from the Publisher. Table 6 presents the average latency values
    in microseconds incurred by the system. Figure 12 graphically illustrates the
    average latency values attained for varying payload sizes. The average latency
    increases linearly with increasing payload size. We can observe that our proposed
    DDS system has suffered higher average latency than the system using plain sockets
    for communication for any payload size. The difference in the average latency
    values of the two systems is constant for varying payload sizes. The added average
    latency for using DDS middleware to communicate between systems is approximately
    235 microseconds. This added latency is due to the inclusion of additional logic
    to send or receive data through the DDS middleware. Although the application of
    batching increases throughput, the system incurs a minimum latency of 235 microseconds.
    TABLE 6 Latency Values Achieved From the Experimental Works FIGURE 12. The figure
    displays the latency of the proposed DDS system compared against system without
    implementation of DDS. Show All PDR indicates a ratio of the total number of received
    data to the total number of sent data. PDR equals one if all the data is received
    by the Subscriber successfully. PDR less than one indicates lost or dropped packets
    in the system. Table 7 shows the calculated PDR values for both systems. The graph
    in figure 13 displays the PDR values for varying payload sizes. For our proposed
    model, PDR values remain 1 for any payload size. The system using sockets has
    PDR less than 1 for packet sizes 128, 256, and 1024 bytes. The highest number
    of packets lost is when the payload size was 256 bytes resulting in a PDR value
    of 0.97. PDR values for a system with no DDS implemented (UDPv4 sockets) are less
    than 1 when payload sizes are more than 128 bytes indicating dropped data packets.
    Hence system using DDS middleware for communication ensures reliability. TABLE

    compared against system without implementation of DDS. Show All SECTION VIII.
    Conclusion The incorporation of Industry 4.0 technologies in the agricultural
    domain will transform the agro-industry significantly. The adoption of new technologies
    and strategies will enhance productivity and reduce the yield gap to satisfy the
    market demand of the growing population. Agriculture 4.0 approaches can tackle
    the challenges of agricultural supply chain management, but managing production,
    planning, and control are difficult due to the high mobility of production systems.
    Production systems use a distributed integration approach due to its advantages
    such as resource sharing, scalability, fault tolerance, etc. Nevertheless, manageability
    and system integration can be highly complex if the modular production systems
    are heterogeneous. We propose a multimodal communication model that utilizes DDS
    middleware to integrate production systems for interoperability between multi-vendor
    production lines. The research conducted suggests that DDS integrated systems
    can reliably communicate with each other in real-time, but incur additional latency
    due to the discovery mechanism. Furthermore, the throughput of the DDS integrated
    system improves with the use of batching. Based on our findings, our recommendation
    would be to design and integrate production systems with DDS middleware to reach
    maximum network throughput with minimum expected latency ensuring reliability.
    Future Scope The Green Revolution was directed towards sustainable development
    in the agricultural sector with the support of global policy-makers. Modern farming
    practices that use AI, big data analysis, robotics, and machine learning plays
    a vital role in the advancement of Agriculture 4.0 to increase the productivity
    and eco-efficiency of agricultural value creation. For future work, we tend to
    analyze how tuning the QoS policies might affect the performance in a large-scale
    farm while considering the energy consumption. We aim to develop an ad-hoc printed
    circuit board (PCB) of the Zone Controller for minimizing the total cost of deployment.
    Also, we will consider studying the security aspects of the integration of DDS
    middleware in production systems. Additionally, employing machine learning algorithms
    in agricultural supply chains and the adoption of 5G technologies can be considered
    for future work. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the unwavering

    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\

    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\

    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\
    \ an Atmel ATmega128L\nmicrocontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160].\
    \ The microcontroller demon-\nstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS\
    \ at a maximum of 8 MHz. The on-chip\nmemory comprises a programmable in-built\
    \ 128 KB of ﬂash memory along with 4 KB of\nstatic RAM. Other integrated peripherals\
    \ consist of JTAG for debugging, timers, counters,\npulse-width modulation, and\
    \ 10-bit analog-to-digital converter.\nFigure 6. (a) Pictorial description of\

    \ over parallel programming\nparadigm to enhance processing and reduce execution\
    \ time [161,162]. A key aspect of Epic\nis the support of prototyping and reusability\

    \ of\nIrene Mote.\nFigure 8. Pictorial description and illustration of Irene Mote\

    \ with Cortex-M3 controller which is\ncompatible with IEEE 802.15.4 radio frequency\
    \ module. In addition, this module enables\ndevelopers to develop the wireless\
    \ module codes using an object-oriented programming\nlanguage like Java [169].\
    \ It also demonstrates the functionalities of external interfaces, i.e.,\nUSB,\

    \ ﬁtted with moisture, temperature,\nand light sensors [162]. These motes also\
    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\
    \ of 37\nwhich allows programming, both event-driven and thread-driven. Some of\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ 8 December 2017\nAbstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has promised a future\
    \ where everything gets connected.\nUnfortunately, building a single global ecosystem\
    \ of Things that communicate with each other\nseamlessly is virtually impossible\
    \ today. The reason is that the IoT is essentially a collection of\nisolated “Intranets\
    \ of Things”, also referred to as “vertical silos”, which cannot easily and efﬁciently\n\
    interact with each other. Smart cities are perhaps the most striking examples\
    \ of this problem since\nthey comprise a wide range of stakeholders and service\
    \ providers who must work together, including\nurban planners, ﬁnancial organisations,\
    \ public and private service providers, telecommunication\nproviders, industries,\
    \ citizens, and so forth. Within this context, the contribution of this paper\n\
    is threefold: (i) discuss business and technological implications as well as challenges\
    \ of creating\nsuccessful open innovation ecosystems, (ii) present the technological\
    \ building blocks underlying an\nIoT ecosystem developed in the framework of the\
    \ EU Horizon 2020 programme, (iii) present a smart\ncity pilot (Heat Wave Mitigation\
    \ in Métropole de Lyon) for which the proposed ecosystem signiﬁcantly\ncontributes\
    \ to improving interoperability between a number of system components, and reducing\n\
    regulatory barriers for joint service co-creation practices.\nKeywords: smart\
    \ city; Internet of Things; interoperability; semantic web; communication standards;\n\
    API economy; business ecosystem; open innovation\n1. Introduction\nOver the past\
    \ decade, a ﬂourishing number of concepts and economic shifts appeared such\n\
    as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Semantic Web, or still the sharing\
    \ economy [1–3].\nThis evolution opens up the way for new applications that leverage\
    \ ubiquitous connectivity and\nanalytics in a wide range of sectors (e.g., transportation,\
    \ energy, manufacturing, healthcare, cities,\netc.), as well as for disruptive\
    \ innovation and business models that reduce costs for societies, foster a\nsustainable\
    \ economic growth, and improve the quality of citizen-oriented services. Ideally,\
    \ the IoT\nshould provide means to create, when and as needed, ad hoc and loosely\
    \ coupled information ﬂows\nbetween any kinds of smart connected objects, databases\
    \ and users. Nonetheless, while new smart\nconnected objects hit the market every\
    \ day, they mostly feed “vertical silos” that are closed to the rest\nof the IoT\
    \ [4,5] (e.g., we still need to install ten different apps to interact with ten\
    \ different devices).\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849; doi:10.3390/s17122849\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 2849\n2 of 21\nThis ineluctably leads to the emergence of isolated\
    \ and protected islands of information, which entails\nthe development of competition\
    \ in the IoT market [6]. As stated by Guinard and Trifa [7], the problems\nis\
    \ that there is no lingua franca spoken by each and every object, there are literally\
    \ hundreds! The worst\npart is that most of these IoT protocols and standards\
    \ are not compatible with each other, which is\none of the key reasons why the\
    \ IoT has not (yet!) delivered on its promises. IoT integrator companies\nestimate\
    \ that support for every new service API requires a few days to months of software\
    \ development\neffort [8], not to mention the effort to maintain these APIs.\n\
    Several organisms and standardization fora understood this critical challenge\
    \ and started to build\nup consortia and initiatives such as for instance, the\
    \ Web of Things initiative at W3C that aims to create\nopen ecosystems based upon\
    \ open standards, including identiﬁcation, discovery and interoperation\nof services\
    \ across platforms [9]; the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI)\
    \ launched by the\nEU with the aim of strengthening links and building new relationships\
    \ between the different IoT\nplayers (industries, SMEs, startups) [10]; the Open\
    \ Platform 3.0TM at The Open Group that focuses more\non industrial applications\
    \ and practices (https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/W145, last\naccessed\
    \ October 2017); the OneM2M global standards initiative that involves eight standard\
    \ bodies for\nMachine to Machine (M2M) communications [11]; the IEEE Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) initiative [12], or still\nthe International Technical Working\
    \ Group on IoT-Enabled Smart City Framework developed at NIST [13].\nAlthough\
    \ most of these initiatives promote various types of standards and technology\
    \ enablers [14–17],\nthey all share the same vision about relying as much as possible\
    \ on open and interoperable standards\nin order to move towards open innovation\
    \ ecosystems that have the capabilities to break down the\nvertical silos that\
    \ shape today’s IoT.\nEven if it is true that narrowing the range of IoT messaging\
    \ standards, especially at the application\nlayer, is a necessary step to enable\
    \ the IoT to live up to its potential, there are other architectural\nand structural\
    \ considerations to be taken into account. Amongst them, it is important to provide\
    \ IoT\nstakeholders with easy-to-use tools, and most importantly incentive environments\
    \ for publishing,\nsearching for, and consuming various types of IoT data/services\
    \ (A distinction is made between\n“IoT data” and “IoT services”. “IoT data” refers\
    \ to data streams coming from sensors or other\nsystems generating or holding\
    \ data (database, ﬁle ...), while “IoT services” refers to the call of a\nweb\
    \ service that takes, as inputs, one or more parameters and may imply a processing\
    \ stage to return\nthe expected result.) [18]. Such environments must also ease\
    \ the control of personal data and business\nservices, seeking to transform the\
    \ current organisation-centric system to a human-centric one. Such a\ntransformation\
    \ was one of the reasons contributing to the development of the General Data Protection\n\
    Regulation (GDPR) directive recently voted by the EC [19], in which rules are\
    \ deﬁned to both give\ncitizens back control of their personal data and simplify\
    \ the regulatory environment for businesses.\nAll the above discussed aspects\
    \ must be carefully tackled in any open innovation ecosystem, from its\ndesign\
    \ to its development, use and management.\nThe recent IoT-EPI initiative (http://iot-epi.eu,\
    \ last accessed October 2017), which is a joint project\ninitiative between seven\
    \ R&I (Research and Innovation) and two CSA (Coordination and Support\nAction)\
    \ projects funded under the H2020 framework, is committed to make strides towards\
    \ the creation\nof open and sustainable IoT ecosystems in Europe. This paper presents\
    \ the architectural building\nblocks of the IoT ecosystem developed in one of\
    \ these R&I projects. The paper is structured as follows:\nSection 2 discusses\
    \ the implications and challenges of creating an open IoT ecosystem. Section 3\n\
    presents the technological building blocks underlying the presented ecosystem,\
    \ with a speciﬁc focus\non how to efﬁciently and productively access, ﬁnd, share\
    \ and compose new services/applications\nbased on existing distributed/heterogeneous\
    \ IoT endpoints. A real-life application in city of Lyon is\nthen introduced in\
    \ Section 4, in which the introduced ecosystem building blocks have been deployed\n\
    and used by city system integrators. Discussion and conclusion are given in Section\
    \ 5.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n3 of 21\n2. Towards Successful Open IoT Ecosystems—The\
    \ European Ambition\nWhile in the US, IoT ecosystems are created around big, multinational\
    \ players such as Google,\nAmazon, Facebook and Apple—so-called GAFA [20]—the\
    \ EU’s strength is rather in smaller and agile\ncompanies [21]. In this respect,\
    \ the EU launched various initiatives to foster the emergence of open\ninnovation\
    \ ecosystems enabling and incentivizing public and private institutions, as well\
    \ as citizen\ncommunities, to join and contribute to the growth and sustainability\
    \ of the established ecosystems.\nAmong other initiatives, the AIOTI alliance\
    \ (https://aioti.eu, last accessed October 2017), consisting\nof 13 Work Groups\
    \ (focusing on security, standards, smart mobility, healthcare, etc.), was launched\n\
    to make recommendations for future collaborative work in the context of the IoT\
    \ Focus Area in the\nH2020 EU programme. As part of AIOTI, a sub-alliance named\
    \ IoT-EPI (IoT-European Platforms\nInitiative), composed of 7 Research and Innovation\
    \ (R&I) projects funded under the ICT30 cluster\n(2016–2019), has been initiated\
    \ with the aim to turn existing vertically-oriented platforms and services\ninto\
    \ economically viable IoT ecosystems [5]. Figure 1 provides an at-a-glance overview\
    \ of the desired\nimpact from an “API economy” perspective [22,23], which, as\
    \ stated by IBM [24]:\n“The API economy has changed how we think about building\
    \ applications (think apps) and how\nwe deploy software (think cloud). The largest\
    \ impact of this change for business is speed: Business\nprocesses and data are\
    \ no longer locked inside applications. The result is the death of data and\n\
    application silos.”\nAn important prerequisite for a successful open IoT ecosystem\
    \ is to create a solid foundation, both\ntechnologically and economically viable,\
    \ to ensure its take up by end-users. This includes establishing\nappropriate\
    \ strategies to incentivize them in publishing and/or consuming IoT data/services,\n\
    including the provision of secure and trustable services (e.g., with more open/intuitive\
    \ solutions that\nhelp end-users to choose to start or stop sharing data) [19]\
    \ to the provision of some kind of a digital\nmarketplace through which end-users\
    \ can trade personal data and/or services [25]. To accomplish\nthis, it is important\

    Diﬀerent domains, Diﬀerent data representations !\nHere a limited number of standards\
    \ is needed !\nDiﬀerent domains, Diﬀerent requirements !\nHourglass challenge\
    \ for breaking\ndown the “Vertical Silos”\nFigure 2. Key technological layers\
    \ underlying open IoT ecosystems (adapted from [7]).\n2.1. Networked Things\n\
    Connecting every Thing to the Internet and giving them an IP address is only the\
    \ ﬁrst step\ntowards the IoT, where the communication network can be a short-range\
    \ radio (e.g., Bluetooth,\nZigBee), a metropolitan area network (e.g., LoRa) or\
    \ still a local Wi-Fi network in a building (e.g.,\nZ-Wave, KNX). Building a single\
    \ global IoT ecosystem to enable seamless communications between\nThings at this\
    \ layer is virtually impossible, and does not even make sense as each protocol\
    \ has been\ndesigned to meet different requirements (e.g., for ﬁrm, hard or soft\
    \ real-time applications), often in\ndifferent application domains.\n2.2. ACCESS\
    \ Layer\nUnlike the Networked Thing layer, the application layer would require\
    \ a single universal protocol\nto enable devices and applications to talk to each\
    \ other regardless of how they are physically connected.\nThis has been illustrated\
    \ through the “hourglass” challenge in Figure 2. Nonetheless, at the time of\n\
    writing this paper, many initiatives, pursued by distinct standardization fora,\
    \ are currently underway,\nwhich inevitably slow down the convergence and adoption\
    \ of a de facto application protocol for the\nIoT. Amongst these initiatives,\
    \ there are two “schools of thought” if we may put it that way with:\n1.\nthe\
    \ creation of new protocols that bypass traditional web protocols such as HTTP.\
    \ Examples\nof well known protocols falling within this category are MQTT, CoAP\
    \ or still the native XMPP\nprotocol that directly rely on TCP or UDP;\n2.\nthe\
    \ reuse and leveraging of widely popular Web protocols such as HTTP. Examples\
    \ of such\nprotocols are OneM2M, O-MI, Webhook that directly rely on or extend\
    \ the HTTP protocol.\nEven though a single universal application protocol is desirable\
    \ for the IoT to become a\nreality, these two “schools of thought” once again\
    \ address different requirements at the application\nlayer. While the former specify\
    \ protocols that are more suited to D2D (Device-to-Device), D2G\n(Device-to-Gateway)\
    \ and D2C (Device-to-Cloud) communication models (considering the four IoT\ncommunication\
    \ models deﬁned in the RFC 7452) [26], the latter is more suited to the BDS (Backend\n\
    Data Sharing) communication model. What cannot be disputed is the fact that the\
    \ second school of\nthought gave rise to the so-called “Web of Things” (WoT),\
    \ which uses and adapts Web protocols to\ngive a digital presence to the Things\
    \ on the World Wide Web [7]. We believe that these two categories\nof application\
    \ protocols are likely the biggest hindrance to the mass adoption of IoT today,\
    \ sometimes\ncausing confusion in the academic and industrial sectors due to the\
    \ wide range of standards today’s\navailable. Given this situation, it remains\
    \ difﬁcult to speculate about which protocol(s)/standard(s)\nwill remain or disappear\
    \ in the future.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n5 of 21\n2.3. FIND Layer\nMaking Things\
    \ accessible through a single universal application protocol does not ensure that\n\
    applications can really “understand” what Things are about (i.e., the meaning\
    \ and description of data\nand services they offer). This is where the second\
    \ layer (FIND) plays a major role. This layer aims to\ndescribe Things in a way\
    \ that enables automatic search, indexing, and integration of data/services\n\
    exposed by these Things into applications. This issue is often described as a\
    \ semantic interoperability\nchallenge and mainly concerned with the payload of\
    \ messages, which not only addresses the encoded\ndata format, but further the\
    \ semantic model that describes the meaning of the data. Furthermore, it is\n\
    a prerequisite in order to understand the service description (i.e., to have a\
    \ clear deﬁnition of what the\nservice offers and how to request it).\nExisting\
    \ IoT platforms often rely on pre-deﬁned data models to describe and annotate\
    \ data that\nis generated by Things. However, such data models are technology-dependent\
    \ and often inherent\nimplementation-speciﬁc features (e.g., speciﬁc protocols,\
    \ language support, structures, etc.), which\naffect the way and expressivity\
    \ of the semantic deﬁnition [27]. In order to overcome these limitations\nand\
    \ ﬁnd a common approach that can be understood and extended by all stakeholders,\
    \ Semantic\nWeb [28] technologies are more and more often applied in IoT projects.\
    \ The overall approach of\napplying ontologies to solve the semantic interoperability\
    \ of the IoT is often described as the Semantic\nWeb of Things (SWoT) [29]. The\
    \ cornerstone of the semantic web is the Resource Description Format\n(RDF) which,\
    \ when combined with other standards such as RDF Schema (RDFS) and Web Ontology\n\
    Language (OWL), can represent knowledge about the physical world [30].\nThe fundamental\
    \ idea to facilitate interoperability with semantics is to reuse and link to existing\n\
    and commonly adapted ontologies of the corresponding domain, e.g., using the Semantic\
    \ Sensor\nNetwork Ontology (SSN) [31] to describe sensor setups and readings.\
    \ In practice, several repositories\nof such Linked Vocabularies have emerged\
    \ in order to discover and promote the reuse of already\ndeﬁned terms and vocabularies,\
    \ like the Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) repository [32]. However,\nsemantic-based\
    \ approaches also face various challenges which are not yet solved. Firstly, creating\
    \ and\nreusing semantic models for a speciﬁc domain is not an easy process, especially\
    \ for non-experts of\nthe semantic web [33]. Second, integration efforts of the\
    \ Semantic Web principles to web services, like\nSemantic Web Services based on\
    \ OWL-S [34], add even further complexity, which is an aspect that could\ncontribute\
    \ to the disruption and wide adoption of semantic-based approaches [35,36].\n\
    2.4. SHARE Layer\nThe role of this layer is twofold, specifying: (i) how the data\
    \ generated by Things can be securely\nshared between data publishers and consumers;\
    \ and (ii) how to incentivize stakeholders (developers,\nanalysts, businesses\
    \ and citizens) in sharing/consuming personal IoT data and/or business services.\n\
    Regarding the ﬁrst role, one of the major concerns is the satisfaction of requirements\
    \ in terms\nof network security (conﬁdentiality, integrity, authenticity), identity\
    \ management (authentication,\nauthorization, accountability, revocation), data\
    \ privacy (anonymity, pseudonimity, unlinkability),\ntrust among users and Things,\
    \ as well as resilience against attacks and failures [37–39]. This is of\nstrategic\
    \ importance within open innovation ecosystems since software producing organisations\
    \ open\ntheir platforms to third parties, thus posing new challenges (e.g., malicious\
    \ players may make use of\nvulnerabilities in the platforms, and vulnerabilities\
    \ that were previously considered harmless are now\nopen to the community) [38,40].\
    \ Privacy is also a major concern of any product and service consumer,\nwhere\
    \ today’s models are mostly “organisation-centric” rather than “human-centric”,\
    \ lacking of\ntransparency and auditability [41,42]. The GDPR has the ambition\
    \ to embrace such a paradigm shift\nby giving end-users back the control of their\
    \ data [19], e.g., by informing end-users about what data\nhas been collected,\
    \ for what purposes and under which policies the data is going to be processed\
    \ and\nretained, or still by enabling end-users to choose to start (or stop) sharing\
    \ speciﬁc data/service items.\nEven though security and privacy mechanisms widely\
    \ adopted by the Web community beneﬁt IoT\napplications, such as TLS for making\
    \ transactions secure, OAuth for authentication delegation, JWT for\nSensors 2017,\
    \ 17, 2849\n6 of 21\nsecurely transmit information between parties, Public Key\
    \ Infrastructure (PKI), or still blockchain-like\ntechnologies for maintaining\
    \ a permanent and tamper-proof record of transactional data, there are\nstill\
    \ many challenges ahead that require further attention in IoT applications, as\
    \ thoroughly discussed\nin [43–46].\nRegarding the second responsibility (i.e.,\
    \ incentivizing IoT stakeholders to SHARE and consumes\nIoT data/services), there\
    \ is a need to deﬁne and implement effective mechanisms for communities of\ndevelopers\
    \ and end-users to successfully engage with IoT ecosystems, thus featuring some\
    \ challenges\nat the governance level. Indeed, while short-time collaboration\
    \ is relatively easy to achieve in open\necosystems, it is much more challenging\
    \ to deﬁne an efﬁcient strategy to hit the intrinsic motivators of\nbusinesses/developers\
    \ and end-users to achieve long-term engagement [47]. Open IoT ecosystems are\n\
    expected and intended to support joint offerings, ad-hoc collaboration and co-creation\
    \ between all\ncategories of IoT stakeholders, thus following a value co-creation\
    \ logic in which no ﬁxed contracts\nbetween actors are established; collaboration\
    \ is rather trust-based and agile [48–51]. A smart city is\nvery concerned by\
    \ this logic as it is a complex ecosystem comprising a wide range of stakeholders\n\
    and service providers who must work together, including public administrations,\
    \ network operators,\nenergy providers, logistics and transportation centers,\
    \ and so forth. To support trust-based and agile\ncontracts, there is a need for\
    \ the emergence of web environments that help publishers and consumers\nto securely\
    \ expose, consume and even trade IoT data/services. Some platforms emerged in\
    \ this\nregard, such as Dawex (https://www.dawex.com/en/), Placemeter (https://www.placemeter.com),\n\
    Datacoup (http://datacoup.com) or still thingful (https://thingful.net), they\
    \ cover different needs\n(Placemeter focusing on turning video into data, Thingful\
    \ focusing on indexing IoT data/services\nwithout providing any reward in sight)\
    \ and thus do not fulﬁll all prerequisites of open IoT\necosystems [5,52].\n2.5.\
    \ COMPOSE Layer\nOnce Things are published using a common/universal application\
    \ protocol (ACCESS layer),\nwhere they can be found by humans and machines (FIND\
    \ layer) and their resources be securely shared\nwith third parties leading to\
    \ potential rewards (SHARE layer), it becomes time to look at how to build\nmeaningful\
    \ cross-domain and/or cross-platform services. To put it another way, data and\
    \ services\ncoming from heterogeneous Things can now be easily, or at least with\
    \ minimum interoperability\nissues, combined together and plugged to analytics\
    \ software and mashup platforms in order to fulﬁl\nuntapped applications across\
    \ systems and application areas. Such a combination (COMPOSE layer) can\nbe achieved\
    \ using various IDE (Integrated Development Environment) solutions, ranging from\
    \ web\ntoolkits (e.g., JavaScript SDKs offering higher-level abstractions) to\
    \ dashboards with programmable\nwidgets, or still physical mashup tools such as\
    \ ReactiveBlocks, Wyliodrin, Zenodys, AT&T Flow\nDesigner, Node-RED. The latest\
    \ tools, and particularly Node-RED, become increasingly used in both\nscientiﬁc\
    \ and industrial communities, empowering ecosystem stakeholders to build applications\n\
    without requiring advanced programming skills [7,53,54].\n3. bIoTope Ecosystem:\
    \ Architectural Building Blocks\nAs part of the seven R&I projects composing IoT-EPI,\
    \ the bIoTope project that stands for “Building\nan IoT OPen innovation Ecosystem\
    \ for connected smart objects” (http://www.biotope-project.eu, last\naccessed\
    \ October 2017) focuses on solving the “Hourglass challenge” previously introduced\
    \ in Figure 2\n(i.e., addressing the ACCESS and FIND layers). Also, a more in-depth\
    \ overview of the bIoTope\necosystem is given in Figure 3, highlighting the key\
    \ building blocks set up at each layer of the bIoTope\necosystem (the color set\
    \ used for each layer in Figure 2 has been reused in Figure 3). Section 3.1 details\n\
    the building blocks being speciﬁed and developed at the ACCESS/FIND layers, while\
    \ Section 3.2\nfocuses on the ones at the SHARE/COMPOSE layer. Technologies used\
    \ at the Networked Things layer\nis pilot-dependent, and thus will be discussed\
    \ for the Métropole de Lyon’s pilot in Section 4.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n7 of\

    3.1. Access & Find\nFigure\n2\nshows—through\nstage\ndenoted\nby\n\x8C—that\n\
    bIoTope\nleverages\nthe\navailable\nvertically-oriented platforms and cloud endpoints,\
    \ thus following the logic discussed in Section 2.1\n(i.e., not imposing any messaging\
    \ protocol at the “Networked Things” layer).\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n8 of 21\n\
    From a data/service publication and consumption standpoint (see \x8D in Figure\
    \ 2),\nbIoTope complies with the second school of thought by—at the ACCESS layer—leveraging\n\
    HTTP to support more advanced operations such as subscription-like mechanisms.\
    \ To this\nend,\nthe\nbIoTope\nconsortium\nselected\nthe\nO-MI\n(Open-Messaging\n\
    Interface)\nstandard\n(https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C14B, last accessed\
    \ October 2017) published\nby The Open Group, which is protocol agnostic so they\
    \ can be exchanged using HTTP, SOAP,\nSMTP, FTP or similar protocols.\nO-MI provides\
    \ a standardized open API for implementing\nRESTful IoT information systems, supporting\
    \ various types of subscription mechanisms (e.g.,\ninterval-based, event-based,\
    \ with or without callback address, etc.) based on the Observer Design\nPattern\
    \ framework presented by [55] that makes it possible for Things to communicate\
    \ with\neach other in a peer-to-peer fashion, thus differing from the Pub/Sub\
    \ model that rely on brokers.\nIn analogy to the Web that uses the HTTP protocol\
    \ for transmitting HTML-coded information\nmainly intended for human users, O-MI\
    \ is used for transmitting O-DF (Open-Data Format)\n(https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C14A,\
    \ last accessed October 2017) represented IoT\ninformation mainly for processing\
    \ by information systems. Let us note that, in the same way as HTTP\ncan be used\
    \ for transporting payloads also in other formats than HTML (e.g., XML), O-MI\
    \ can be used\nfor transporting payloads also in other formats than O-DF. The\
    \ O-DF standard fulﬁlls the same role in\nthe IoT as HTML does for the World Wide\
    \ Web, meaning that O-DF is a generic content description\nmodel for Things in\
    \ the IoT. O-DF can be seen as a ﬁrst semantic enabler of the FIND layer, acting\
    \ as a\n“domain independent semantic model” that can and should be extended with\
    \ more speciﬁc semantic\nvocabularies (cf. Figure 2), both/either domain-independent\
    \ vocabularies (e.g., iot.schema.org, SSN)\nand/or domain-dependent (e.g., DATEX\
    \ II for the mobility sector, HL7 for the healthcare sector, WoT\nmodels, HyperCat,\
    \ etc.).\nSuch an extension of O-DF has been discussed e.g., in [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ a few examples of what\nO-MI/O-DF request/response messages look like can be\
    \ found in [57–59], even though an example\nfrom Métropole de Lyon’s pilot will\
    \ be presented in Section 4.\n3.2. Share & Compose\nThe SHARE and COMPOSE layers\
    \ are in charge of incentivizing IoT stakeholders (e.g., developers,\nanalysts,\
    \ businesses, citizens) in sharing and consuming IoT data/services. Incentive\
    \ schemes in\nbIoTope imply, among other prerequisites, to (i) support “human-centric”\
    \ security models, seeking\nboth to give citizens back control of their data and\
    \ to simplify the regulatory environment for\nbusinesses, and (ii) enable data\
    \ owners to easily participate in data trading [25]. To this end, an\nIoT data/service\
    \ marketplace is currently being speciﬁed and developed in bIoTope, as illustrated\n\
    in Figure 2. This marketplace, called IoTBnB (http://iotbnb.jeremy-robert.fr,\
    \ last accessed October\n2017) standing for IoT service puBlication and Billing,\
    \ is intended to assist data owners (O-MI gateway\nowners to be more precise)\
    \ in:\n•\nchoosing what data/service items they want to make available/visible\
    \ to the user base engaged\nwith the bIoTope ecosystem (cf. \x8E in Figure 2).\
    \ Stages denoted by \x96 to \x9B in Figure 4a provides\nan overview of the IoTBnB\
    \ back-end components, along with the different steps that gateway\nowners have\
    \ to perform if they want to register to IoTBnB;\n•\nspecifying for which purpose\
    \ the exposed data/service items can be used, for how long, and at\nwhat cost.\n\
    And furthermore assist data consumers (cf. \x8F in Figure 2) in:\n•\nsearching\
    \ for valuable IoT data/service providers,\nenabling multimodal search like\n\
    (i) spatial/temporal search: one may want to search for services within a geographical\
    \ area;\n(ii) keyword search: one may want to search for services falling within\
    \ a speciﬁc sector such\nas mobility, healthcare, environment, etc. (iii) reputation\
    \ search: one may want to search for a\nservice ensuring a certain quality level,\
    \ which may depend on various dimensions: data provider\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n\
    9 of 21\nreputation, data stream quality, etc. (iv) contractual term or technology\
    \ search: one may want to\nsearch only for IoT data/service producers that make\
    \ available data/service for free, or who are\ncompliant with one or more crypto-currencies\
    \ or still with speciﬁc license conditions;\n•\ntrading and negotiating for accessing\
    \ one or more data/service items.\nIt should be stressed here that, at the marketplace\
    \ level, only the “description” of what the data\nstream or web service is about,\
    \ and how to call it, is collected and indexed by the O-MI search engine.\nTechnically\
    \ speaking, only the semantic models speciﬁed at the FIND layer of each IoT gateway\
    \ is\nindexed in the service catalog, and not the underpinning data streams generated\
    \ at the “Networked\nThings” layer. Indeed, once data consumers have found valuable\
    \ data source descriptions via IoTBnB,\nagreed upon the terms and potentially\
    \ paid for accessing the underlying resources, they can start\ncommunicating in\
    \ a peer-to-peer manner with the corresponding IoT gateway(s), as illustrated\
    \ through\nstage denoted by \x90 in Figure 2. So far, three distinct publication\
    \ and consumption schemes are made\npossible in the bIoTope ecosystem, as summarized\
    \ in Figure 4 (cf. Case 1–3).\nH\nCity’s avatar\nI\nCompany’s avatar\n\x13\nHouse’s\

    \ IoT data/services\nFigure 4. Data/Service consumers & publishers from the bIoTope\
    \ ecosystem standpoint.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n10 of 21\nCase 1 corresponds\
    \ to the basic publication/consumption scheme, where IoT data/services are\npublished\
    \ for free and without any access right. In this case, consumers search for relevant\
    \ and valuable\ndata/services on IoTBnB and then get the necessary information\
    \ to access the underlying ressource\n(cf. arrows denoted by \x96 to \x98 of Case\
    \ 1 in Figure 4b). Case 2 provides data/service publishers with\nthe possibility\
    \ to decide who can access what and how; this being speciﬁed at their gateway\
    \ level\n(cf. “security module” in Figure 4b). When a consumer wants to directly\
    \ access a secured data/service\nitem whose URL is already known, she/he has to\
    \ send a request to the gateway owner/administrator\nin order to be granted. In\
    \ cases where the consumer discovers and selects the secured data/service\nitem\
    \ through IoTBnB, a token is generated by IoTBnB on behalf of the data/service\
    \ owner (cf. arrows\ndenoted by \x96, \x99–\x9B of Case 2 in Figure 4b). Beforehand,\
    \ the gateway owner/administrator must give\nfull authority to the marketplace\
    \ to manage the access to (or denial of) the data/service items when\nconsumers\
    \ have (or not) fulﬁlled the access/purchasing terms. This is done when the administrator\n\
    registers her/his node to IoTBnB. Furthermore, to enable administrators to manage\
    \ the who, what\nand how their data/services can be accessed by third parties,\
    \ a complementary security module has\nbeen speciﬁed and developed in bIoTope,\
    \ based upon ﬁve key requirements, which have been listed in\nTable 1. Figure\
    \ 5 provides an overview of what the module consists of, namely: a \x8C back-end\
    \ database:\nfor storing user groups and related access rights; \x8D external\
    \ authentication service: using the external\nweb service Auth0; \x8E User Interface:\
    \ enabling administrators to specify and manage access rights\nrelated to the\
    \ registered users; \x8F Access control service: for checking what kind of permissions\
    \ end-users\nhave on the requested data/service. To avoid a scalability issue\
    \ at the gateway level when managing\na high number of users’ policies, part of\
    \ this issue can be shifted to the (trusted) marketplace when\nregistering a node,\
    \ as the stateless JSON Web Tokens technology is used implying that the gateway\n\
    only needs to generate and verify tokens when requested. This can be seen as one\
    \ of the marketplace\nincentives to foster ecosystem participation. Case 3 aims\
    \ to design a microbilling framework to help\n(i) gateway administrators: in evaluating\
    \ the quality of their data/service items and thereby setting a\nreasonable purchase\
    \ price; (ii) data/service consumers: in buying IoT data/services in ad-hoc, loosely\n\
    coupled ways (cf. arrows denoted by \x9E, \x9F of Case 3 in Figure 4b). Although\
    \ Case 3 is not yet fully\noperational in bIoTope, ﬁrst ﬁndings suggest that well-known\
    \ decentralized currency technologies\nsuch as Bitcoin fail to meet key IoT requirements\
    \ for efﬁcient and scalable micropayments (e.g., ability\nto conduct fast transactions\
    \ and scale massively in the number of users and payments). This is the\nreason\
    \ why new decentralized ledger technologies are emerging, whether at the academic\
    \ or industrial\nlevel, such as Duplex [60], Lightning Network (LN) [61], Inter-Ledger\
    \ Protocol (ILP) [62], Greedy\nHeaviest-Observed SubTree (GHOST) [63], etc. As\
    \ a starting point for experimentation, the bIoTope\nconsortium decided to focus\
    \ on the LN technology that allows for the creation of fast, scalable and\nad\
    \ hoc bitcoin-supported micropayment channels between users. Although some limitations\
    \ still\nremain to be solved, LN is still under speciﬁcation and associated reference\
    \ implementations under\ndevelopment, therefore leaving room for innovation.\n\
    At the stage denoted by \x91 in Figure 3, third party consumers can rely on their\
    \ own preferred\nIDE (Integrated Development Environment) for accessing and processing\
    \ the selected data/services,\nmeaning that bIoTope does not impose the use of\
    \ a speciﬁc IDE tool. That being said, all software\nmodules developed in bIoTope\
    \ are made available in Node-RED.\nx\nAdministrator\nUI\nAuthentication\nservice\n\

    \ as Interoperability Enabler Of “Smart Métropole de Lyon” Strategy\nPredictions\
    \ state that 66% of the world’s population will live into cities by 2050 [64],\
    \ thus impacting\nhow environment, housing, economy, transport and well-being\
    \ of citizens is managed. The population\nof Lyon—59 municipalities with an area\
    \ of 538 km2—is expected to increase up to 1.45 million inhabitants\nby 2030.\
    \ This growth is accompanied by a rapid change in climatic conditions; the average\
    \ temperature\nin Lyon having increased by 1.9 ◦C between 1959 and 2017 [65].\
    \ In order to cope with this growth,\nMétropole de Lyon has drawn up a climate\
    \ adaptation plan, along ﬁve strategic development and\ninnovation axes: (1) Preserving\
    \ water resources: by increasing from 78% to 85% of water supply network\nefﬁciency;\
    \ (2) Reducing urban heat-island (UHI) effects: by increased the planting of new\
    \ trees in the\nregion (2000 to 3000 new trees per year); (3) Better assisting\
    \ the population: by planning for heat waves\nwith follow-up indicators; (4) Adaptation\
    \ of agricultural structures and practices: accompanying measures\nto move towards\
    \ a conservation agriculture; (5) Improving local knowledge: by better understanding\
    \ the\nimpact of climate change on local scales, understanding the local biodiversity/species\
    \ and the needs of\nthe territory and its inhabitants. Within the framework of\
    \ bIoTope, a real-life pilot related to the second\n(UHI) axis is currently being\
    \ developed, partly relying on the architectural building blocks presented\nin\
    \ Section 3. Let us note that two other pilot cities (Brussels and Helsinki) are\
    \ also part of the bIoTope\nproject and ecosystem, thus making use of the different\
    \ bIoTope building blocks previously discussed.\nEven if this paper focuses only\
    \ on the most advanced pilot (i.e., Métropole de Lyon), comparisons\nbetween pilots\
    \ will be carried out at the end of the project in order to evaluate and validate\
    \ the extent\nto which one pilot (or part of the pilot) can be replicated in other\
    \ cities.\nSection 4.1 provides an overview of the work undertaken to renovate\
    \ a whole street in Lyon\n(primary goal being to provide a wider pedestrian zone),\
    \ from which Métropole de Lyon has beneﬁted\nto conduct IoT research and experiments.\
    \ In this section, ﬁrst solutions deployed at the Networked\nThings layer are\
    \ discussed and evaluated. Section 4.2 details the communication infrastructure\
    \ (and\nassociated performance) covering the ACCESS and FIND layers, while Section\
    \ 4.3 focuses on the\nSHARE & COMPOSE layers.\n4.1. Pilot context & Networked\
    \ Things layer\nMétropole de Lyon has been carrying out UHI measurement campaigns\
    \ using temporary or mobile\nsensors. However, partners of the territory, and\
    \ in particular researchers focusing on the modelling\nof UHI phenomena and its\
    \ impact on citizens, would like now to beneﬁt from a true IoT network in\norder\
    \ to carry out more rigorous studies. Within this context, the Garibaldi street,\
    \ which is located\nin the heart of a business district in Lyon and is the subject\
    \ of a large-scale urban renewal project,\nhas undergone a fundamental transformation/renovation\
    \ in 2014 in order to enable IoT experiments.\nThe different steps of this transformation\
    \ are shown in Figure 6 (left side) through three pictures\nshowing the Garibaldi\
    \ street before, under, and after renovation. An interesting feature of this street\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 2849\n12 of 21\nis that there was an underground vault of 1200\
    \ m3, which has been repurposed to store rainwater\nwhich can be used to clean\
    \ the streets, to reﬁll street sweepers, or to water green areas. In this respect,\n\
    and as highlighted in Figures 6 and 7, the street-planted strips have water inlet\
    \ connections to the\npumps in this basin. During summer 2016, four green areas\
    \ were equipped with various kinds of\nsensors, in particular, air temperature\
    \ sensors (for UHI phenomenon analyses), soil moisture and tree\nactivity/health\
    \ sensors (for monitoring the watering needs of plants). Remote controllable pumps\n\
    and valves (for irrigation control management) were also installed. These devices\
    \ and associated\ncommunication protocols are summarized in Figure 7. Since this\
    \ pilot is intended to be an experiment\nspace, three distinct communication protocols\
    \ are used, namely: (i) LoRa network: allows for the\ncollection of temperature\
    \ data (on an half-hourly basis); (ii) Sigfox network: allows for the collection\
    \ of\nboth soil moisture and tree activity data (on a half-hourly basis, too);\
    \ (iii) Proprietary STELLA network:\nallows for the collection of water level\
    \ data, as well as for the control of the water pumps and valves.\nAfter renovation\n\

    Whenever a measure of temperature and tree growth is collected by the LoRa and\
    \ Sigfox networks,\nthe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is measured and recorded.\
    \ Even though the objective is not to compare\nLoRa and Sigfox technologies, it\
    \ can be observed that the SNR values are better for Sigfox (cf. Figure 8b).\n\
    On the other hand, LoRa technology does not necessarily imply to rely on a service\
    \ provider/network\noperator; each person who owns a LoRa antenna/gateway can\
    \ actually grant access to any third\nparty. Such independency is an important\
    \ aspect when dealing with/stepping into “open” IoT\necosystems. As a result,\
    \ we have tested the LoRa network by installing our own LoRa gateways\n(Kerlink\
    \ Wirnet Station 868 MHz ISM band, sensitivity up to −141 dBm) in the ofﬁce of\
    \ Métropole\nde Lyon with street temperature sensors within a 1 km radius (exact\
    \ distances are given in Table 2).\nThe objective of this experiment is to understand\
    \ how the LoRa network/protocol behaves in urban\nenvironment settings. As shown\
    \ in the Figure 8 but also in Figure 9, the small Received Signal Strength\nSensors\
    \ 2017, 17, 2849\n13 of 21\nIndication—RSSI—(around −110/−120 dBm) and negative\
    \ SNR values would suggest that the data\nwas sent by devices that are located\
    \ too far from the gateways. However, these results are mainly due\nto urban obstacles\
    \ that impact on the signal intensity. Furthermore, we observed that the greater\
    \ the\nradius distance between the antenna and sensor, the higher the daily packet\
    \ loss.\nxxy\nx\n%\n%\n❖\n❖\nHumidity sensors\nTemperature sensors\nPlant/Tree\n\

    \ & Find Layers\nIn this pilot, the temperature data collected by LoRa sensors\
    \ are exposed through an O-MI/O-DF\ngateway, which runs on a physical machine\
    \ having 2 processors (CPU E5-2640 @2.50GHz) and 48 GB\nof RAM. This machine is\
    \ hosted in Lyon (France) behind a ﬁrewall. In this section, we propose to\nevaluate\
    \ the behavior of the O-MI gateway—mainly in terms of response time—under heavy\
    \ trafﬁc load.\nTo do so, a stress test is performed by using the open-source\
    \ software Apache JMeter (Apache JMeter:\nhttp://jmeter.apache.org/, accessed\
    \ on July 2017). This software allows to send concurrent requests to\nthe O-MI\
    \ gateway. Such requests were generated and sent from Luxembourg University’s\
    \ network\n(from a APPLE Macbook Pro Retina—mid-2015—with an Intel Core i7 CPU\
    \ @2.8GHz and 16 GB of\n1600 MHz DDR3 RAM).\nThe test plan is designed as follows:\n\
    simulated end-users send O-MI/O-DF requests to\nthe gateway in order to receive\
    \ temperature data measured by sensor number 1 (referred to as\nSL-T-P1 in the\
    \ O-DF tree).\nThe corresponding O-MI read request message (for each user) is\n\
    displayed in Figure 10.\nRows 1 to 4 (and 23 to 25) correspond to the message\
    \ interface (i.e.,\nO-MI-related parameters) whose requested operation is set\
    \ to read. Rows 5 to 22 detail the message\npayload built on the generic O-DF\
    \ information hierarchy (as summarized in the right-hand side\nof Figure 10).\
    \ The instantiation made of this generic hierarchy by Métropole de Lyon highlights\
    \ that\nOrganization###Metropole-de-Lyon#v0-2-0’, OrganizationalUnit###DINSI and\
    \ so on are deﬁned\nas O-DF ’Object’ with speciﬁc IDs (cf. rows 7 and 9). The\
    \ InfoItem (i.e., Object’s property) that needs\nto be read in that case is speciﬁed\
    \ at row 16, namely the sensor 1’s value). As part of the FIND\nlayer, it can\
    \ be noted that the information hierarchy presented in this scenario is enriched\
    \ with\nstandardised vocabularies (linked open vocabularies to be accurate) such\
    \ as “Sensor, Observation,\nSample, and Actuator” (see acronym sosa at row 16),\
    \ which contributes to ease the indexing and\ndiscovery process—via IoTBnB—of\
    \ the associated information. Let us also note that any ontology can\nbe used/integrated\
    \ to the O-DF structure (e.g., SSN, SEAS, FOAF or GEO to name a few). The mapping\n\
    between RDF, ﬁrst-class citizen in semantics, and the O-DF structure, can be performed\
    \ by applying\nthe following simple rules: (i) RDF class members become O-DF Objects\
    \ and (ii) RDF literals become\nO-DF InfoItems. Upon translating RDF into the\
    \ O-DF structure, pretty much all the information is\npreserved except for the\
    \ RDF properties linking RDF class members. As shown in Figure 11 (see curve\n\
    in the right side), the number of concurrent users increases gradually, by groups\
    \ of 300 users, up to\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n15 of 21\n900 concurrent user requests\
    \ on the same InfoItem. After 600 s, the number of users is decreased\n300-by-300\
    \ until the end of the experiment (1000 s). This scenario was run only three times\
    \ since\nthe observed response times are similar in all the experiments. Figure\
    \ 11 provides an aggregated\nview of the results as a probability-density function\
    \ of 95% response time values. The remaining 5%\ncorresponds to more important\
    \ response times, which is likely due to either a bias introduced by the\nJVM\
    \ (maximum memory deﬁned for the application Jmeter exceeding) or a network infrastructure\n\
    issue (e.g., due to a HTTP error code such as 502 Bad Gateway). As a result, this\
    \ 5% are not considered\nin our study.\n1\n<?xml version=” 1.0 ” encoding =”UTF−8”\

    \ Figure 10.\nBased on the resulting response time, the following conclusions\
    \ can be drawn:\n•\nWhen the load is relatively low (i.e., between 1 and 300 concurrent\
    \ users [0 s; 200 s]), the response\ntime are mainly less than 0.5 s (i.e., more\
    \ than 65% of the values);\n•\nWhen the load increases (due to the increase of\
    \ users [200 s; 600 s]), the probability of response\ntime being equal to 0.5\
    \ s decreases accordingly (i.e., ≈ 50% of the values). In addition, the\nprobability\
    \ of having response times between 1 to 1.5 slightly increases. However, all the\
    \ response\ntimes remains under 4 s;\n•\nFinally, when the number of users is\
    \ reduced back to 300, the server progressively adapts itself\nand the probability\
    \ of short response time (≈0.5 s) increases to more than 65% of the values.\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 2849\n16 of 21\nThese response times are therefore suitable\
    \ for slow dynamic systems that would be controlled\nover the Internet (i.e.,\
    \ with no hard real-time requirements). Let us note that the response times can\n\
    be signiﬁcantly higher when the size of the request increases (especially when\
    \ a user wants to get\nseveral O-MI infoItems at once), therefore resulting in\
    \ an increased number of TCP segments needed\nto generate and transport all data.\
    \ To keep requests as small as possible, the developer ﬁrst needs to\nsearch for—through\
    \ the marketplace—InfoItems he/she would like to access to, therefore requesting\
    \ a\nlimited number of data on the corresponding IoT gateway(s).\n4.3. Share &\

    \ bIoTope ecosystem and associated service marketplace (IoTBnB) are\nused to allow\
    \ combining heterogeneous data sources into different high-level services such\
    \ as\nWeb-based apps (e.g., for citizens) or dashboards (e.g., for city management\
    \ department) in order\nmonitor the behaviour of the Garibaldi street, as well\
    \ as the “health” of the sensors (e.g., in\nterms of battery charge or signal\
    \ quality). The reader can refer to the video tutorial available at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdFOVXd25o\
    \ to get an overview about how IoT stakeholders\ncan easily use bIoTope components/services\
    \ made available through Node-RED (e.g., O-MI and O-DF\nnodes, IoTBnB node, etc.)\
    \ in order to compose IoT workﬂows. All of this is summarized through\nFigure\

    SHARE layers\nCOMPOSE layers\nFigure 12. Screenshot overview of tools related\
    \ to the ACCESS, FIND, SHARE & COMPOSE layers.\nThe objective of Métropole de\
    \ Lyon is twofold: (i) showing that standardized data can be easily\ndiscovered,\
    \ accessed and composed; (ii) developing an irrigation system with the aim to\
    \ mitigate heat\nisland effects, thus increasing the citizens’ comfort. In this\
    \ context, Métropole de Lyon has developed a\nphysical mock-up of the Garibaldi\
    \ street (see Figure 13) combining all data sources published by the\nO-MI gateway.\
    \ It is composed of two distinct green areas contributing to the production of\
    \ sensor data\non air temperature, tree growth, etc. Data is collected at the\
    \ “DATACENTER” building, standing for\none of the buildings of Métropole de Lyon.\
    \ For demonstration purposes, a simulated comfort indicator\n(based on simulated\
    \ sensor data) is computed for each zone by the back-end system. Two simple\n\
    control rules are applied, namely: (i) when the indicator exceeds the upper threshold,\
    \ the system sends\na command—using an O-MI/O-DF write request—to irrigate the\
    \ area, which results in turning the (blue)\nLEDs located on the ground and (ii)\
    \ when the indicator falls below the lower threshold, the system\nsends a command—using\
    \ an O-MI/O-DF write request—to stop the irrigation. The evolution of the\nSensors\
    \ 2017, 17, 2849\n17 of 21\ncomfort indicator and the two thresholds are vizualized\
    \ on the computer screen. In the Figure 13,\nit can be observed that the both\
    \ comfort indicators (blue and red lines) exceed the upper threshold\n(even though\
    \ the blue curve is between the lower and upper thresholds, the irrigation—cf.\
    \ leds in the\nmock-up—is still active until the curve reaches the lower threshold),\
    \ which is why both areas were\n“irrigated” (blue leds on the ground) when the\
    \ picture was shot.\nIn this application, even though we showed that the irrigation\
    \ system is feasible, it still remains\nto reﬁne the control rule logic by relying\
    \ on machine learning and domain-expert knowledge.\nFor instance, it will be needed\
    \ to analyse UHI patterns to verify whether additional irrigation can\n“boost”\
    \ perspiration and keep trees in better health. Preliminary investigations show\
    \ that, when\ntrees are sufﬁciently hydrated, they evaporate water and, as a consequence,\
    \ a better comfort level is\nperceived by the citizens. In the framework of Lyon’s\
    \ pilot use case, such a control rule logic reﬁnement\n(i.e., identifying the\
    \ optimal indicators and valve opening/closing rules) will be achieved by one\
    \ or\nmore companies that will join the bIoTope consortium through open calls\
    \ in early October 2017.\nFigure 13. Physical mock-up designed by Métropole de\
    \ Lyon as a proof-of-concept of the heat wave\nmitigation system built on the\
    \ open IoT ecosystem (and related building blocks) developed in bIoTope.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The IoT is revolutionising the digital landscape, making it possible for billions\
    \ of devices to\ndiscover, communicate, and autonomously interact with each other\
    \ for a wide range of smart\napplications.\nHowever, all these Things are today\
    \ feeding vertically-oriented closed systems,\narchitectures and application areas\
    \ (commonly referred as “vertical silos”), which prevent the\ninteraction between\
    \ Things, thus entailing the development of competition in IoT markets and slowing\n\
    down co-operative work between IoT stakeholders. This is all the more true in\
    \ the context of Smart\nCities, which are complex ecosystems comprising a wide\
    \ range of service providers (network operators,\nenergy providers, logistics\
    \ and transportation centers, etc.) who must work together to meet societal\n\
    and economic needs. Given this, and as part of an ongoing H2020 EU project (named\
    \ bIoTope), the\npresent paper discusses the EU’s vision and ambition to move\
    \ towards successful and viable open\nIoT ecosystems.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n\
    18 of 21\nTo be technologically and economically viable, and to contribute to\
    \ break down the vertical silos,\nopen IoT ecosystems need to support key technological\
    \ layers, described as the Access, Find, Share\nand Compose in this paper (cf.\
    \ Figure 2). It is argued that, to create a true and federated IoT, the most\n\
    critical layer is the Access one for which a common agreement about a single universal\
    \ protocol needs\nto be reached. However, there is still a ﬁerce competition between\
    \ standardization fora, making it\ndifﬁcult to to speculate about what standard(s)\
    \ will remain or disappear in the future. In the framework\nof the bIoTope project,\
    \ two open communication standards named O-MI and O-DF are considered at\nthe\
    \ Access and Find layers respectively. The smart city pilot, jointly developed\
    \ with Métropole de Lyon,\nshows that these two standards enable to meet the prerequisites\
    \ of an open IoT ecosystem. Pilots in\nBrussels and Helsinki cities are currently\
    \ under development, which will be used as comparison basis\nfor evaluating and\
    \ validating the extent to which one pilot (or part of the pilot) can be replicated\
    \ in\nother cities.\nFuture research work is concerned with the integration of\
    \ contextual data in the ecosystem (e.g.,\nbeneﬁting from semantic web technologies\
    \ at the Find layer) in order to design and support more\nadvanced and “smart”\
    \ services. In addition of this technological proof-of-concept, much remains to\n\
    help cities and business to step into open IoT ecosystems from a business perspective.\
    \ To this end,\nbIoTope proposes an IoT data/service marketplace (called IoTBnB),\
    \ which opens up new forms of\nBusiness-to-Business and Customer-to-Business interactions.\
    \ Indeed, IoTBnB seeks to provide IoT\ndata/service producers and consumers with\
    \ an easy-to-use and secure environment for publishing\nand/or consuming (even\
    \ trading) IoT data and services. Such marketplace environments can greatly\n\
    contribute to transform the current organisation-centric system to a human-centric\
    \ one, which is\naligned with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\
    \ directive 95/46/CE.\nAcknowledgments: The research leading to this publication\

    The continuous growth of world population, environmental change, industrialization,
    the arable land over the globe is decreasing every year [1]. Therefore, the demand
    and requirement for hygienic food and crop yield have been growing continuously.
    A survey conducted by the United Nations of Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) estimated that the population of the world is expected to reach 9.73 billion
    in 2050 [2]. It is expected that more cropland and water will need to meet the
    future food demands globally. Furthermore, other challenges such as abrupt changes
    in climate, lack of labor, and water scarcity spiral the pressure on agriculturists
    and farmers [3]. The challenges faced by traditional agriculture and greenhouse
    farming need a fundamental change to develop sustainable and ecological food.
    Greenhouse farming is one of the best alternatives to overcome the food crisis
    as well as to ensure the sustainability of socio-ecological. Initially, the greenhouse
    farming method was introduced in France and Netherland 19th century [5]. At present,
    greenhouses have become one of the ideal farming methods in the agriculture world
    [6]. The greenhouse is a structure like a house that is covered with a plastic
    material or glass mainly designed to cultivate multiple crops in any season. In
    order to increase the quantity and quality of food, a greenhouse can regulate
    the growing patterns of plants accordingly. Traditional greenhouses are specifically
    designed with dry lands and ignore the multiple environmental variables such as
    temperature, humidity, among others [7]. Usually, a smart and productive greenhouse
    requires environmental monitoring and control devices, to manage various weather
    parameters [8]. In the conventional greenhouses, climatic variables and other
    growing methods were depending upon the cultivators’ assessment and demand for
    the number of growers [9]. In the last few years, the smart farming concept has
    attracted the broad attention of farmers, agriculturists, and researchers. Smart
    greenhouse farming is an enclosed cultivation process that manages the farm by
    using information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance the quality and
    quantity of crops with minimal human involvement [10], [11]. The emerging IoT
    technology provides a high potential for innovative methods and smart solution
    development which can transform the agriculture sector in all aspects. Thus, integrating
    the IoT with a greenhouse to convert it into a smart and automated greenhouse
    is considered to be one of the foremost and ideal solutions. Thus, IoT-enabled
    greenhouses can mitigate these challenges as well as assist growers to enhance
    the productivity of food and crops [12]. Figure 1 shows the IoT-enabled greenhouse
    farming trends. The deployment of a wireless sensor network (WSN) enables climatic
    data to be gathered and distributed for understanding and monitoring the internal
    system of the greenhouse, but there is a need to handle several other features
    which can cause significant destruction to the grown plants, such as, less or
    high-water supply, bad weather conditions, and light intensity. The eradication
    of these issues can be done through a precise system that helps to automate the
    monitoring and control methods for a smart greenhouse [15], [16]. FIGURE 1. IoT
    based greenhouse farming trends. Show All Current research developments demonstrate
    that how researchers are exploring and utilizing the IoT technologies in greenhouses
    for different farming practices. As a result, there are several prototypes, applications,
    and services in IoT-based greenhouse farms. In a smart greenhouse, the research
    trends consist of network architectures, new applications, interoperability, and
    security challenges. Therefore, it is expected that a state-of-the-art understanding
    of current research on IoT-based greenhouse farming is highly informative and
    valuable for agriculturists, farmers, stakeholders, and researchers. Although
    a huge amount of research has been accomplished in the area of IoT-based greenhouse
    farming, still there is a need for detailed study in this area to understand the
    current research status. The motivation of the survey is to investigate the IoT-enabled
    greenhouse research trends and various open issues that are vital to transforming
    greenhouse farming technologies through IoT modernization. The modification of
    greenhouse techniques on the basis of IoT advancement is explained in this paper
    by analyzing several approaches, communication protocols, network technologies,
    applications, challenges, and industry trends in smart-greenhouse farming. The
    structural flow of this paper is presented in Figure 2 which contains the following
    sections: Major components of IoT-based greenhouse are presented in section II.
    In section III, a brief discussion is given on technology-based cultivation techniques
    related to greenhouse farming. IoT-based greenhouse farming categories are discussed
    in section IV. Section V presents IoT-based greenhouse farming technologies which
    consist of edge/cloud computing, big data analytics, IoT communication protocols,
    IoT sensors/devices. Mobile applications and IoT applications for a smart greenhouse
    are discussed in section VI. The major problems and challenges regarding greenhouse
    farming with future research direction have been explained in section VII. Top
    technology firm’s trends have been discussed in section VIII that provides detail
    on how technology industries are investing in this area. IoT-based smart farming
    success stories and statistical analysis made by different countries to boost
    greenhouse farming are presented in section IX The survey is concluded in section
    X. FIGURE 2. Structural flow of the paper. Show All SECTION II. Key Components
    of IoT-Enabled Greenhouse The smart-greenhouse structure has been shown in Figure
    3. The structural design is based on three key components which are used to accomplish
    several tasks. The first component named physical structure is divided into three
    sub-components namely actuators, sensors, micro-controller. Sensors act as a prominent
    part to accumulate information regarding internal climatic situations using light
    sensors, humidity/temperature sensors, gas sensors, soil-moisture sensors. These
    sensory devices transfer the gathered data to a micro-controller for taking a
    decision accordingly by interacting with the user remotely by using the internet.
    Actuators consist of a nutrient tank, water pump, lights, and windows for greenhouse
    farming. They are used to implement the command given by the user. FIGURE 3. Major
    components of IoT-enabled greenhouse. Show All Monitoring is the second major
    component of smart greenhouse farming that consists of plant, soil, and climate
    monitoring. In climate monitoring, the appropriate observation is done by the
    devices to balance the environment that is mandatory for the certain crop which
    is cultivated within the greenhouse. In case, climatic factors like temperature,
    CO2 level, humidity, air pressure are not matching to the limit defined by the
    user, at that time micro-controller is informed to trigger the devices for balancing
    the internal environment. In soil monitoring, all the essential ingredients like
    phosphorus, potassium are examined by the sensors. Besides this, the level of
    soil wetness and soil salinity is also observed for avoiding damage to the grown
    plants. Plant monitoring contains observation of crop diseases and leaf temperature
    to recognize the behavior of the plant growth so that users can be able to get
    information about the health of plants. This data can be evaluated for further
    cultivation practices in greenhouse farming. IoT data acquisition contains two
    sub-components i.e. standard data acquisition and IoT-based data acquisition.
    Standard type includes communication protocols, for instance, SIGFOX, Low Range
    Wide Area Network (LoraWAN) Wi-Fi, ZigBee for remote and small range communication
    purposes. They are managed according to the required conditions. IoT-based data
    acquisition holds three major protocols which are MQTT, HTTP, and CoAP. These
    protocols are used for long-range communication. Further, IoT-based data acquisition
    is used to maintain the conditions within the greenhouse to surge the production
    rate of quality crops efficiently. SECTION III. Technology Based Cultivation Techniques
    of Greenhouse The productivity and efficiency of a greenhouse farm are widely
    depending upon the growing structure of the crop. Although there exist multiple
    structures to select from, but it is more important to have deep knowledge about
    the challenges and benefits of each greenhouse farming method. In this section,
    three technology-based cultivation techniques namely; less, average, and highly
    developed greenhouse are discussed. A. Less Developed Greenhouse (LDG) LDG is
    a permanent greenhouse farming technique that is suitable for flowers and vegetables
    not applicable in hot regions because they do not have ventilation techniques.
    Additionally, the wooden stuff is commonly available, so it is easy and affordable
    to construct a greenhouse by the agriculturists who do not have sufficient budget
    to build advanced technology-enabled greenhouses. However, the structure has poor
    environmental control and fewer investment charges. Moreover, farmers can also
    attach multiple units of the greenhouse to generate a larger one [17]. B. Average
    Developed Greenhouse (ADG) Greenhouse based on Average technology has more flexibility
    as compared to LDG. The structural design is generally constructed by polythene
    or glass sheet with a well-organized environmental control mechanism. The ventilation
    method in this technique can be static or moveable for permitting the air to blow
    within the greenhouse which makes it capable to manageable in hot regions as well.
    For these partial automatic procedures, the cost ranges from 30 to 100 $ /m^2
    in which vegetables, as well as high-quality plants, can be cultivated [11]. These
    greenhouses are applicable for quality production with the cheapest cost and consume
    less power as compared to highly-developed greenhouses [18], [19]. C. Highly Developed
    Greenhouse (HDG) A type of greenhouses that minimizes the labor expenditure by
    automating the tasks. The methodology has an extra maintenance cost that is more
    than 100 $ /m^2, due to which, it is not certainly affordable for farmers. HDG
    has a glass/iron structure in which the internal weather is entirely independent
    of the external atmosphere. The climate can be set accordingly by monitoring climatic
    factors like temperature, CO2 level, and humidity. The use of this type of greenhouse
    is suggested in cold-winter areas to develop nursery production [17]. To surge
    the quality and yielding rate of crops, this eco-friendly technique is efficient
    for use [18]. SECTION IV. IoT-Based Greenhouse Categories Nowadays, devices based
    on IoT are used at a large scale in the monitoring and controlling systems of
    several sectors. The IoT-based technologies consist of different kinds of actuators,
    sensors, drones, cloud computing, analytical system, and navigation which make
    efficient decisions to surge crop production with less human involvement [20],
    [21]. The usage of these sensors and devices is to observe the atmosphere and
    collect information like temperature, humidity, the intensity of light, and soil
    moistness. The collected information related to the environment is stored on the
    cloud computing server that can be analyzed and visualized by the user at any
    location using the internet [22], [23]. This section presents the greenhouse technologies
    based on IoT particularly three techniques named; Smart-Greenhouse, Hydroponics,
    and Vertical-farm. A. Smart-Greenhouse Greenhouse can be defined as an agricultural
    modernization for providing a controlled and organized atmosphere to plants. A
    packed loop is formed in the greenhouse and plants are protected from the external
    climate. A safe situation is produced for growing crops and it shows a high significance
    in the varying climatic circumstances. Hence, greenhouse acts as a great illustration
    of precision farming. Greenhouse’s efforts are based on the conception of the
    “greenhouse effect”. Light enters into the greenhouse via walls/roof and is trapped
    within the greenhouse because of sealing arrangements. Today’s greenhouses are
    furnished with smart technologies such as cameras, lights, Arduino/Raspberry Pi,
    and wireless sensors to offer automatic controllers for the intensity of light,
    temperature, soil moistness, and the level of humidity for maintaining the necessary
    atmospheric condition which is necessary for the plant growth. WSN is used to
    assist in monitoring and controlling these devices and create an optimized climate
    for crops [24], [25]. For example, soil sensors assist to gather facts on the
    flows of water by the land to track fluctuations in soil wetness, temperature,
    and nitrogen/carbon levels. This process lets the growers to optimize, observe,
    and regulate the cultivation of sensitive crops, to maximize their crop yield
    while maintaining its quality for the end product. They are able to sense data
    such as moisture, light strength, and value of temperature to alter the sequence
    of irrigation for avoiding the chances of damage. A greenhouse climate monitoring
    system is shown in Figure 4. Irrigation plays a vital role in a good production
    rate to guarantee that agriculturalists would be able to meet the water load for
    the crop. However, poor planning for irrigation and ineffective usage of water
    resources are limiting crop production in several agricultural areas. Through
    a traditional irrigation method, soil moisture faces great variations in its concentration.
    Sometimes, the soil is completely dried, and then irrigating it with a high volume
    of water creates a vertical surge in the value of soil moisture. These thrilling
    alterations are not beneficial for crops, because they need moistness in the soil
    to keep themselves at a moderate limit. Additionally, dry soil consumes a high-water
    quantity for irrigation because it cannot keep the water just like slightly moist
    soil [26]. Irrigation procedures are commonly automated using computer control,
    timers, and specialized controllers. In an open-loop irrigation system, the output
    measurements are not implemented to alter the inputs, this irrigation is based
    on predetermined time intervals, for example, time-clock scheduling. FIGURE 4.
    Smart-greenhouse. Show All An enclosed-loop controlling method is used in the
    irrigation based on feedback, in which the system offers growers real-time output
    data to reschedule irrigation, for example, drainage percentage and plant water
    position. In a feed-forward irrigation system, water usage is estimated through
    transpiration and growth models [27]. Another method of irrigation is through
    an overhead crane that is linked with a pipe, in which green manure/water is shifted
    to a crane for crops. Crane moves vertically/horizontally to deliver the stuff
    in plants [28]. Moreover, maintaining suitable humidity and temperature inside
    a greenhouse climate is crucial. Temperature altering can damage crops within
    a few hours, this decline in productivity. Thus, the environment is a vital parameter
    for plant growth [29]. When humidity surges, it causes more chances for crop diseases.
    Further, the dew condensation arises in the greenhouse at the time when the temperature
    of a dew point is greater than the crop’s temperature, and its relation is deep
    with relative humidity [30]. A pack of sensor nodes is used to sense the temperature
    and humidity within the greenhouse. The hygrometer sensor monitors the humidity
    and pyroelectric film is used to monitor the temperature. The modification gathered
    by both sensors is transferred to a mutual analog/digital signal converter (ADC)
    system which alters these analog signals of information into a digital signal
    for ease of understanding and decoding through server [31], [32]. Another parameter
    naming as light intensity is also important to monitor for healthy plant growth.
    The light sensor’s output voltage modification depends upon the intensity of light.
    The increasing intensity identifies high voltage in the result and when the intensity
    becomes low, then the resulting voltage drops [25]. Figure 5 shows that once the
    sensors create the context information, it is then sent towards a gateway or micro-controller
    that is used for integrating all the deployed devices at a single platform [33],
    [34]. FIGURE 5. Environment monitoring in greenhouse. Show All Micro-controllers
    are assumed as the heart for a greenhouse system in which several actuators and
    sensors are interconnected to construct a precise automated system [29]. The connectivity
    of Wi-Fi within the Cloud facilitates data transmission towards the cloud by using
    a microcontroller and then kept in the database based on the cloud. The material
    saved within the cloud is repeatedly conveyed to the user’s mobile through the
    internet for initiating a distant checking so the user can be able to alter the
    threshold for the greenhouse climate. This enables the “human towards machine”
    communication and offers a “machine towards machine” collaboration. The drivers
    of the motor circuit connected with sliding windows and coolers are fixed to help
    the motor for regulating the movement of air inside the greenhouse. Depending
    on the threshold fixed for the humidity, temperature, light, and moisture, the
    micro-controller activates the driver circuit for regulating the airflow and stabling
    the temperature [25]. In case, there is dryness inside the greenhouse, the water
    sprayer is triggered for increasing the level of humidity. The sprayer can be
    switched off. Moreover, if the humidity surged inside the greenhouse farm, then
    a rooftop is opened for lowering the humidity level [31]. 1) Benefits of Smart
    Greenhouse The platform of the IoT offers an automated greenhouse environment
    that enables a significant association among tangible things and people. A user
    is allowed to gather real-time data processing, analysis, and meditation. The
    system is deployed to offer automation for monitoring as well as controlling.
    The deployed system collects and transfers the sensed information via the IoT
    cloud for easy access from anywhere and at any time. Thus, IoT enabled greenhouse
    farming to enhance productivity and decrease labor costs. A farmer can grow multiple
    crops in the appropriate season with less human effort as shown in Figure 6. The
    efficient use of water and proper soil monitoring results in high crop production.
    FIGURE 6. Benefits of smart-greenhouse. Show All B. Hydroponics Greenhouse Hydroponic-Greenhouse
    system is a cultivation technique using water instead of soil. It shows that soil
    is not vital for plant cultivation, only the vital minerals, nutrients, and adequate
    pH are required within a specified range inside the water [35]. This system is
    a highly productive and fast process as compared to a plantation in soil. Moreover,
    vegetables are cultivated via the hydroponics process. Hydroponics farming has
    a short harvest time and is usually rounded up for minimizing costs [36]. Hydroponic
    farming required precise control of climate parameters for high-quality production.
    The most important parameters are humidity, light intensity, pH, temperature,
    and electrical conductivity. These parameters can be monitored through any sensing
    and monitoring devices. Sensing/monitoring devices are controlled by a micro-controller
    known as Raspberry Pi [37]. The micro-controller is managed by connecting to the
    Wi-Fi module, which transfers all sensing devices’ information related to hydroponics
    to cloud storage. A typical hydroponic structure is shown in Figure 7 which contains
    the hydroponic water pressure pump, pipes, nutrient container, artificial lights,
    water tank, and adjustment of PH solutions. The sensors related to Electrical
    Conductivity (EC) are standardized using low, high, and dry EC adjustment by using
    solutions having dissimilar EC levels. PH and EC are significant aspects to maintain
    the healthy growth of the crop and plants. In the hydroponic method, the concentration
    of EC can be increased by following the instruction mentioned in the solution
    container. The primary objective of the pH controller is to investigate and identify
    the existence of bicarbonates or carbonates within the nutrient solution by which
    pH values can be determined. The pH levels of bicarbonate-ion (HCO3) are altered
    from 4.5 to 8.3 and the nutrient solutions which are containing carbonate-ion
    (CO3) surge levels of its pH beyond 8.3. Hence, the solubility of salts having
    calcium-carbonate is reduced. Once the precipitation process has been done, it
    is challenging to re-establish the value of the solution’s PH. The greatest way
    to avoid this problematic situation is taking out constant usage of marketable
    acids which deactivate and also finish the bi-carbonates created within the solution.
    Acid’s amount that requires to be combined with nutrient’s mixture relies on the
    used water and bicarbonates in the nutrient combination. Additionally, acid would
    lead the pH level to that value where it can be dangerous for crops [35], [38].
    The PH and EC controlling methods enable farmers to efficiently manage nutrients
    in solutions that can be reused by rapidly detecting instability that arises in
    the nutrient [39]. The liquid flow within the hydroponic method is also necessary
    to control, for example, there are chances that the crop size can be small or
    it would die in case the system delivers a slight hydroponic liquid. In another
    case, if supply goes beyond the required limit, it may return abnormally-shaped
    crops. Hence, system function and system supply should be controlled. FIGURE 7.
    Hydroponics greenhouse. Show All The quantity of hydroponic fluid supply can be
    determined through evapotranspiration, which is measured by Relative-Light-Intensity
    (RLI) and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD). In Evapotranspiration, process water is
    wasted through the leaves of plants. The use of relative humidity and temperature
    enables the calculation of VPD. RLI means the ratio of light quantity which is
    dispersed at the upper and bottom sides of the crop. The deployed sensor nodes
    within the hydroponic structure gather greenhouse environment information on the
    crop’s conditions. The accumulated data is then transferred towards the sensor’s
    gateway via the sink node that collects the important information from all the
    nodes shown in Figure 8. The data is authenticated by sensor gateway and shifted
    to the actuator controlling system and cloud storage. Lastly, the actuators are
    driven by the system and supply the required amount of hydroponic fluid that is
    mentioned in the received information. The system also permits the user to visualize
    the collected information and put control information by staying anywhere using
    a web browser. Hence, the ease of use can be enhanced by arranging both data and
    information of the actuation process on a cloud-based server. If the Internet
    failure occurs, the control signals will be unable to reach the controlling program,
    then the actuators will not be controlled by the system. Moreover, when entire
    data is stored only on cloud then data can be lost or unavailable whenever the
    Internet would not be available. Therefore, it is vital to prevent data loss even
    in case of failure in uplink/downlink to attain effective climatic control by
    keeping data storage as a backup through the local network [40]. FIGURE 8. Hydroponics
    functional platform. Show All 1) Benefits of Hydroponics Greenhouse Unnecessary
    pesticides are not required for the soil in this method. The water need is fewer
    as compared to traditional greenhouse farming. The plant production is not affected
    due to any external change in the environment. 2) Issues of Hydroponics Greenhouse
    The need for manual checking to deliver the essential nutrients is extensive [21].
    Scalability issue arises due to heavy starting investment for structure. The system
    that is normally used for communication within hydroponic farms is inappropriate
    for remote communication [41]. C. Vertical-Farming The concept of food supply
    in cities has already existed, but the awareness of a whole building occupied
    by crops is an emerging idea. In vertical farming several crops are cultivated
    inside an enclosed region, that is structured like an elevated style to accommodate
    plants [42]. The vertical farming concept is presented in Figure 9. Generally,
    the structure of vertical farms is designed to cultivate plants in the high-tech
    buildings that normally reside in the middle of a city. The vertical farm act
    as a type of advanced agricultural system which is completely surrounded by a
    controlled climate and used to eliminate the external factors related to the environment.
    There is no need for a wide land area for the installation of vertical farming.
    The system can be set within any building which has raised a global environment
    without considering the current environment as the winter or rainy season [43],
    [44]. FIGURE 9. Vertical farm. Show All The information of environmental conditions
    is crucial to monitor and control through an appropriate device. These factors
    are helpful to define the working for the devices and their facilities as well.
    Environmental parameters contain both the outdoor and indoor climate conditions.
    The everyday atmospheric situations like climate limitations require to be processed
    and manipulated. The seasonal factors and regular climate differences are necessary
    to consider for more precise developing conditions. In an indoor system, the environmental
    situations and the conditions related to soil are given important concern. Figure
    10 shows the conceptual design of a smart greenhouse. Several devices, for instance,
    actuators, sensors, and controlling tools are installed inside the vertical farm
    to observe and control the services. Sensors are linked directly to the climate
    parameters, through which collected data is transmitted to the server by IoT protocol.
    Moreover, the link of actuators to the parameters is indirect. Actuators regulate
    the control devices such as a heater, humidifier, air-conditioner, sliding window,
    and lights. The variation outcomes of environmental conditions force the actuation
    process to reset the required standard condition by regulating the devices [45].
    The simulation of sunlight within the vertical farm is with the usage of LED lights
    which enables the crop for carrying out the process of photosynthesis. Hence,
    light monitoring is necessary to give optimal photonic energy to achieve proper
    photosynthesis. FIGURE 10. Conceptual design of Greenhouse farming. Show All Thus,
    for this purpose, the light sensor is used in the system. Humidity and Temperature
    are also vital for the good health of the crops in an enclosed environment. This
    makes the need for the deployment of sensors related to temperature and humidity.
    Window sliding is used to control these factors. Finally, a continuous process
    is required to monitor the moisture content of the soil, and enable a burglar
    alarm to measure the fall of required moisture level [46]. A sensor for soil moisture
    assists to identify the humidity. If the reading shows a humidity level lower
    than the fixed threshold, it indicates that the soil has a low amount of water.
    Thus, the valve is opened for watering the affected soil within the vertical farm.
    In case, the level of reading is higher, it shows that the soil contains an extra
    amount of water. To avoid an excessive amount of water the valve stops the flow
    of water on the farm [43]. The sensed information by the sensor is transmitted
    towards the cloud server by using IoT protocol. The detected data is stored within
    the database and the control actions are performed for maintaining the optimal
    situation in the environment [47]. 1) Benefits of Vertical Farming Vertical farming
    acts as a climate-controlled farming method. In this farming method, the occurrence
    of seasonality issues is very less because crop production is continuous for all-year.
    The system provides organic food that is healthy and uncontaminated. Moreover,
    its enhanced productivity improves income and it is useful for lowering energy
    and food costs as well. 2) Challenges of Vertical Farming Start-up costs for the
    vertical farm can be high if the farming area is obtained within commercial districts.
    In this system, the farming procedure cannot be as wide as compared to rural areas.
    Furthermore, yielding capacities don’t increase as in a wide region farming as
    well as leads towards increasing complexity and cost. SECTION V. IoT-Based Greenhouse
    Network Technologies The digital gap between IoT technologies and agricultural
    producers has been reduced. Productivity will be improved by using IoT technologies
    through sustainable food cultivation. Smart agriculture (i.e. IoT-based Greenhouse)
    contains actions such as automated irrigation, automated environment controlling
    mechanism, remote monitoring, fertilization, and frost protection. These control
    activities are assisted through the integration of IoT technologies with other
    technologies i.e. cloud computing, hardware, integration platforms, operating
    systems, and monitoring/controlling processes [48]. A. IoT-Enabled Greenhouse
    Network Architecture The smart greenhouse has been coined after describing smart
    farming notions such as sensors, communications technologies, and variable rate
    technology for plants growth and crop management. An IoT-based greenhouse network
    architecture has been presented in figure 11 in order to obtain precision greenhouse
    farming. The architecture contains multiple components in order to interact, analyze,
    and predict the farming data through end-user applications. Sensor technology
    is deployed for data acquisition purposes. However, the data collected through
    deployed sensors is transmitted towards the gateway for analysis and mining purpose.
    IoT communication standards such as Zigbee, COAP, MQTT, WIFI, Bluetooth, etc.
    support all interactions in the network architecture. These communication standards
    are widely used for precision greenhouse farming where IoT devices and sensors
    can collaborate and interoperate with any underline communication. FIGURE 11.
    IoT-based greenhouse network architecture. Show All B. Edge & Cloud Technology
    Cloud computing states a cloud of resources on the internet that is either in
    a centralized or distributed form. Clouds are built with physical or virtualized
    resources over large centralized or distributed data centers. Smart monitoring
    methods mainly pay heed to monitor and controlling plant growth in the greenhouse
    [49]. The participation of IoT-agriculture and cloud computing helps the process
    of monitoring to become faster, easier to maintain, easily understandable, and
    precisely solve the problems of greenhouse farming [49], [50]. The use of cloud-based
    design allows the information to be collected by the sensors and analyzed by comparing
    with given constraints. Then the server will be able to make a decision that is
    distributed to the subscribed users. In this way, if a disturbance occurs, a notification
    must be transmitted to the user through mobile [49], [51]. Moreover, edge computing
    acts as a backbone for cloud computing and plays an important role within the
    greenhouse to control and monitor the internal environmental conditions. Key control
    actions of a greenhouse are arranged through a layer at the edge which consists
    of other controlling segments for climate, nutrition, irrigation, and supplementary
    tasks. The ‘Network-Function-Virtualization’ (NFV) is used to power them, hence
    they are instantiated at dissimilar nodes alongside the network path that is from
    crop to cloud [52]. The cloud-based greenhouse farming structure is shown in Figure
    12 which is using four different layers named Cloud Storage, Fog/edge Computing,
    Gateway, and hardware segment. The cloud storage component delivers the resources
    on request by centralizing the greenhouse environmental information. Gateways
    are used to play a significant role in data distribution for those devices which
    have no design capability to share information directly by using the internet.
    FIGURE 12. Cloud-based greenhouse network structure. Show All Fog/edge computing
    is helpful to integrate all the resources for the distributed components. The
    resource’s scalability is surged by decreasing the computational burden at the
    cloud. Lastly, the hardware segment contains multiple sensors, actuators, microcontrollers
    (Arduino or Raspberry PI), and a central processing unit (CPU) which are used
    to measure several greenhouse farming variables. Fast communication can be achieved
    in a smart greenhouse by using IoT communication protocols such as MQQT, COAP
    as Representational State Transfer (REST), and MQTT. C. Big-Data Analytics-Based
    Greenhouse Farming Big data means a large amount of data like business data, sensor
    data, and public networking data is collected in several ways for a long duration.
    The significant challenge is to get, analyze, store and search. Processing of
    business data is done using a big-data technique to find secret patterns within
    the information. In the agriculture domain, it is useable for supporting the management
    chain of agriculture products, to reduce the cost of production [53], [54]. The
    big data analytics model contains several modules which are shown in Figure 13.
    The prediction model acts as an optimization segment that is useable to guess
    parametric standards that are not accomplished by the sensors, for example, photosynthesis.
    The prediction has been given based on parameters that are already available.
    Artificial neural networks are useable as a tool for the implementation of predictive
    modeling which can be helpful in constructing a proactive model for greenhouse
    farming. FIGURE 13. Big data analysis based greenhouse mode. Show All All these
    models are used to estimate the values of general parameters, for instance; humidity
    and temperature by analyzing them with previously collected data to lessen sampling
    load and execute proactively [24] The farmer or user experience component assists
    the greenhouse owners to observe crop growth, climate situations, and soil capability.
    The multiform analysis explains the various greenhouse farming techniques to reduce
    the destruction risk of plants by using scientific ways. The sensing/Monitoring
    unit is used to collect and analyze the internal greenhouse farming parameters
    by means of multiple monitoring and sensing devices. This precise data is delivered
    to the farmers or farm managers for keeping them updated about crop growth. To
    achieve long/short-range communication, several protocols like LoRaWAN, WIFI and
    ZigBee are used in greenhouse farming. Farmers keep information regarding crop
    health for making improved analyses in the future. In the physical implementations
    module, some hardware devices like micro-controller (Arduino or Raspberry Pi),
    routers, sensors, gateways, and actuation devices are deployed to observe the
    greenhouse environment. D. Data Trasmission Protocols Smart greenhouses demand
    great struggle for data acquisition systems like wired connection and distribution
    of sensors which is expensive and complex. Moreover, some crops need modification
    of point’s location with time which is easily possible by the wireless-sensor
    network due to its mobility and simple implementation. A WSN consists of multiple
    nodes which are distributed within the greenhouse to find the plant growth by
    gathering information via communication protocols shown in Table 1. These protocols
    gather, encapsulate, and transfer greenhouse farm information. Similarly, WSNs
    are cheaper as well as have fewer energy-consumption methods and let the networks
    connect and provide flexibility in information sharing [55], [56]. Some data communication
    and transmission protocols are discussed in this section which is playing a vital
    role in greenhouse farming. TABLE 1 Comparison of IoT Transmission Protocol 1)
    IEEE 802.11 WiFi The IEEE 802.11 is a well-organized wireless local-area-network
    protocol due to its capability of taking heavy information like audio/video file
    transmission [56]. It is based on IEEE 802.11 b, IEEE 802.11 ac, IEEE 802.11 a,
    IEEE 802.11 g, and IEEE 802.11 n. Although it is a much expensive, short-range,
    and power-hungry communication standard it is useful for sensor networks in a
    greenhouse with distinct benefits. Portable devices which are used in greenhouse
    farming, contain this protocol broadly. In addition, it provides the facility
    to carry high agricultural information. This communication standard is highly
    effective for monitoring irrigation in the greenhouse by wireless cameras and
    drones [57]. 2) LoRaWAN A communication protocol that is organized by the LoRa-Alliance
    to connect IoT devices wirelessly for long-range bidirectional communication in
    greenhouse farms. This protocol has slight maintenance with less energy consumption
    that makes it capable of dealing with several types of sensors [58], [59]. 3)
    RFID The structural design of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) uses radio
    waves for keeping the gathered data safe and secure on a machine. RFID method
    includes tags (active and passive), readers, and hosts. The tags consist of an
    ID number of greenhouse atmospheric objects. The ID number is attached to the
    object which can be identified by the reader to read data and then transferred
    to the end host. An active tag has more energy consumption value and is expensive
    as compared to another one. The host acts as a processing portion of the RFID
    method [60]. 4) MQTT A bidirectional, publish/subscribe and asynchronous protocol
    named as Message-queuing-telemetry protocol was designed by IBM in favor of machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communication to offer flexibility, less bandwidth usage, and computational
    resources [61]. Singh et al. [62] have been developed an IoT-enabled greenhouse
    monitoring system by using the MQTT protocol which monitors and controls the climatic
    parameters within a greenhouse to provide efficient growth of the crop. Through
    MQTT, an irrigation method with less cost has been analyzed to collect and transmit
    sensed data [63]. 5) SIGFOX A SIGFOX is a long-range, low data-rate protocol that
    is used to transfer collected information by global positioning system (GPS) to
    a central server by consuming less power [64], [65]. SIGFOX uses a two-tier topology
    like LoRaWAN, where its gateways transfer the traffic flow towards cloud servers.
    The robustness of network transmission in the greenhouse can improve by repeating
    the message several times over dissimilar frequency channels [66]. 6) WiMAX A
    protocol that offers 100 MB/s to 1 GB/s for mobile or fixed stations respectively
    [47]. Greenhouse farming can get portable/fixed communication by using a multi-access
    connection through WiMax using wireless/wired media. In Ghana, this technology
    has been implemented to empower the end-users to attach using WiMax networks [67].
    7) Bluetooth A low-cost, short-range, and low-power communication protocol named
    Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) was designed for personal area networks (PAN) to communicate
    greenhouse data with multiple mobile devices. The information can be transmitted
    over different frequencies in dissimilar intervals of time by using medium access
    control (MAC) protocol [68]. The other version of Bluetooth with ultra low cost
    and low power is known as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) which was combined with v4.0
    standard Bluetooth in the early stages [69]. 8) ZigBee ZigBee protocol is low
    energy consuming protocol having low cost, great performance, and capability to
    prevent interference. It comes in the topmost standards of IEEE 802.15.4 and has
    high-level communication. The consistency for wireless communication can be improved
    significantly in greenhouse farming by implementing this protocol [70]. E. Sensor-Technology
    In this era, there is a keen focus on the precise use of resources in greenhouse
    farming to enhance crop productivity. Many tasks are involved that are accomplished
    within the field, for instance, seeding, fertilizing, and watering, which are
    repetitive and required labor work [71]. Sensor technology is implemented within
    the smart-greenhouses for assisting the farmer to automate several tasks inside
    a greenhouse and to deliver precise climatic conditions (temperature/humidity,
    CO2, and irrigation) which are necessary for the effective growth of crops [72],
    [73]. Hence, sensor networks create a link between the real world and cyberspace
    to connect agriculture and IoT [74]. Following are the most widely used IoT sensors
    in greenhouse farming: 1) Biosensors The excessive amount of pesticides to increase
    crop productivity cause the wastage of water and oil. In this situation, smart
    greenhouses use environment friendly and energy-effective technology which consists
    of bio-sensors as well as physical sensors. Bio-sensors are a sub-group of chemical
    sensors that contain biological recognition components (enzyme, receptor, antibody,
    micro-organism) to analyze the crop health, growth, pesticide, and required quantity
    of fertilizer [75]–[77]. For example, the microbial sensor can simply discover
    the microbial activity within the soil. Their self-maintainability allows them
    to be dormant, tailored to accept the modification, and reusable to accomplish
    long-term monitoring procedures within the greenhouse. The deliverance of energy
    to sensors is achieved by the microbial fuel cell (MBC) [78]. Some functions that
    are performed by bio-sensors are detailed below. a: Soil Pesticides A large number
    of bio-sensors are used to detect pesticides in water and a heavy amount of nanostructured
    (bio) sensors have been realized for pest detection and monitoring in water and
    other resources. For instance, quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes
    are the most widely used sensors. Similarly, a tyrosinase/TiO2 biosensor is used
    for herbicide (atrazine) detection in soil. b: Detect Nutrients Bio-sensor is
    inexpensive and competent to recognize the mandatory precise fertilizer doses
    at particular stages of plant growth by analyzing comprehensively soil and water
    patterns. For example, Mura et al. have been discovered nitrate discovery in water
    [79]. 2) Physical Sensors The physical sensors recognize the signal transformation
    via physical variation of the material inside the sensor which is principally
    humidity, temperature, and PH [80]. Some processes achieved by the physical sensor
    are discussed below: a: Temperature/Humidity Detection Sensor Temperature/humidity
    is recognized using DHT 11 sensor that contains two-component named as pyroelectric-film
    (for temperature recognition) and hygrometer (for humidity recognition). It is
    a power-efficient and reliable temperature and humidity monitoring sensor [32].
    Besides this, PIR sensors are also used to sense heat within the greenhouse. When
    temperature surges inside the greenhouse, the sensor transforms the effects into
    high-voltage output [1]. b: PH Sensor For detection of PH value in greenhouses,
    a reliable sensor is required that can make a precise PH measurement. For this
    purpose, a PH sensor is used to dip into pipelines, tanks, and open channels.
    It has a serial output form that shows a PH range from 2 to 12 [81]. SECTION VI.
    IoT Based Greenhouse Applications The advancement of IoT technology empowers things
    to be regulated remotely. Instead of controlling and monitoring a greenhouse farm
    manually, users can observe the day-by-day progress of cultivated crops by using
    IoT sensors/devices and mobile applications remotely. Several applications have
    been developed for making the farmers capable of efficiently controlling their
    greenhouse farms. In this section, we have discussed the applications of IoT in
    the greenhouse and a few mobile applications in table 2. TABLE 2 Smart-Greenhouse
    Mobile Applications A. Monitoring In greenhouses, the crop is cultivated under
    a controlled environment. The cultivation of a smart greenhouse is highly strong,
    therefore it needs high precision in terms of monitoring. Humidity, temperature,
    and light are the most important factors to monitor to obtain the high quality
    of the crop. The constant monitoring of such variables gives valuable and informative
    data to greenhouse farm managers for better understanding. Recent studies show
    that how IoT technology is innovating greenhouse farming patterns by minimizing
    the labor cost, human effort, and providing direct communication among farmers
    and stakeholders. Most of the researchers have concentrated only on remote monitoring
    greenhouse farming [82], [83], [84]. Further, to obtain high precision in greenhouse
    farming the well-evaluated crop models have been implemented which helps the farmers
    to take accurate measures [85]. The low power and low-cost nature of IoT networks
    make them the top choice among agriculturists and growers in the greenhouse to
    monitor the soil moisture content. Heble et al. [86] developed a low-cost and
    power-efficient system for monitoring greenhouse soil humidity. Moreover, IoT-enabled
    monitoring systems have approximately 83% prolonged lifetime at minimum cost.
    B. Controlling The greenhouse is an under-controlled farming method to cultivate
    plants and crops. To obtain a high yield of plants and crops, continuous controlling
    of environmental variables such as light intensity, soil PH, temperature, and
    CO2 are necessary. However, the major aim of IoT utilization in the greenhouse
    area is to develop cost-effective and simple solutions for controlling climatic
    parameters to achieve optimum growth of plants. Vimal et al. [87] developed an
    Arduino-based low-cost system to control the environmental parameters which are
    updated on regular basis. Multiple sensors/devices such as LDR sensor, PH sensor,
    and DHT11 sensors are implemented to measure the exact value of greenhouse environmental
    variables. The monitoring parameters are sent to the mobile phone in the form
    of short message services (SMS) to identify the present status of environmental
    factors. When the sensor value exceeds a certain amount of defined level, an SMS
    is sent to the greenhouse manager or farmer. In this way, a farmer can control
    his greenhouse farm from anywhere by knowing the present status of different controlling
    parameters. Subahi and Bouazza [29] proposed an intelligent greenhouse temperature
    controlling system by implementing IoT technologies. The objective of the developed
    structure is to control and monitor the internal temperature in order to maintain
    good conditions that increase productivity. Moreover, controlling the microclimate
    parameters in greenhouses is a real problem due to which growers face different
    microclimate issues. Sagheer et al. [88] proposed a multitier cloud-based IoT
    platform to control the microclimatic issues in the greenhouse. The proposed platform
    was implemented on the cultivation of cucumber in a commercial-sized greenhouse
    to enhance productivity and improve quality. Different actuators, controllers,
    and sensors were deployed in the greenhouse farm to offer wide-range communication
    to control the greenhouse. C. Tracking The IoT asset tracking application can
    track the location of assets, audit as well as monitor the assets in order to
    keep the centralized records accurate in all greenhouse farming businesses. The
    emergence of IoT with big data, AI, satellite images, drones, and GPS enables
    the farmers to put less human effort to track the greenhouse farm remotely. Besides
    this, the IoT-enabled system also helps the farmers to track machinery (drones,
    tractors) and unwanted movement on the farm. Satyanarayana et al. [70] has been
    proposed a crop health monitoring architecture that monitors the different soil
    patterns. In the proposed architecture ZigBee is integrated with GPS and GPRS
    for real-time data tracking. GPRS provides connectivity with a monitoring device
    and gives an alarm to the greenhouse farm, the owner when suspicious activity
    occurs. In this way, farmers can take corrective measures spontaneously in order
    to avoid any hassle. Although the maintenance cost of such a system is high it
    is extremely effective due to its exact tracking ability. SECTION VII. Open Issues
    and Challenges Although IoT has brought a great revolution in smart farming, still
    there exist some fundamental, development, and conceptual challenges in this area.
    In this section, IoT-based greenhouse farming technical and non-technical challenges
    have been discussed. A. IoT-Based Greenhouse Non-Technical Issues Digital farming
    faces new management and operation issues that suffer various non-technical challenges
    such as cost, plants disease detection, and marketing pricing. In this sub-section
    IoT-based greenhouse, non-technical challenges have been discussed. 1) Huge Investment
    A smart greenhouse does not use the sun as the key source of light for the procedure
    of photosynthesis [89]. They use artificial lights which are organized within
    the greenhouse farms. Therefore, lots of energy consumption by LEDs create a challenge
    for the greenhouse farmers to bear the energy expenses. Although the solar panel
    technique brings into use in vertical farms which are used in a larger range within
    the cities. But it is still difficult to accomplish the necessary amount of energy
    through this approach because of high building shades [90]. Moreover, plant growth
    may be affected due to the deficiency of these natural resources. Furthermore,
    IoT-based greenhouse farming has also nutrient supply issues. A huge investment
    is required to retain the equal distribution of nutrients to all portions of greenhouse
    farms [21]. 2) Fossil Fuel The greenhouse farmers face difficulty to take the
    produced yield to the market, as they have to manage the expenditures of transportation.
    The demand for fossil fuel and heavy machinery to plow seeds and harvest the crops
    is high which is costly. Therefore, it becomes hard for local farmers to take
    initiative in this regard. Furthermore, on a large scale, the extra use of fossil
    fuel can cause air pollution which is hazardous for human beings [91]. 3) Crop
    Disease Sometimes, crop disease is a major issue for the farmers because of having
    less knowledge for the transfer of the proper amount of nutrients. Unequally irrigating
    the plants inside the greenhouse can damage crop growth and cause different kinds
    of diseases [90]. 4) Soil Salinity Greenhouse farming becomes challenging in some
    regions due to the high salinity of the soil and water. Thus, the usage of saline
    water for irrigation purposes in the greenhouse at these locations can make the
    crop growth slow and lessen the production rate [78]. 5) Less Government Support
    Designing or developing an IoT-based greenhouse farm is a big challenge for the
    local farmers without government support. Some farmers follow indirect ways like
    the internet, agricultural exhibitions, and trial-and-error techniques to eradicate
    the trouble they face while running their greenhouse farms. These approaches lead
    them towards financial destruction [112]. 6) Marketing Pricing The market prices
    fluctuate day-by-day which is another problematic issue for the farmers. They
    try their best and invest their savings for greenhouse cultivation but in the
    end, they don’t get enough return due to which they shift to another crop, and
    shortfall for those specific crops arises [113]. B. IoT-Based Greenhouse Technical
    Issues In literature IoT technical issues in greenhouse farming have attracted
    a lot of attention such as communication protocols, connectivity issues, interoperability
    issues, low power WSNs, and sensor design. In this sub-section state-of-the-art
    IoT-based greenhouse technical challenges have been discussed. 1) Security and
    Privacy Issues Lack of security and privacy in IoT-enabled greenhouses is a key
    challenge. Therefore, it is difficult to handle the collected data regarding greenhouse
    environmental parameters. In case, there is a slight vulnerability within the
    system, the sensitive data may be lost. There are also low communication competencies
    and less storage that makes the implementation procedure of complex algorithms
    difficult. Likewise, chances of intrusions in wireless communication methods are
    more, for example, Distributed Denial of Services (DDOS) attack, forwarding attack,
    and congestion attack [90]. Thus, the security of smart-greenhouse farming consists
    of three major elements i.e. data confidentiality, authorization, and access control
    [104]. These three countermeasures must be employed for the data access phase.
    In addition, the authentication of particular entities can stop external attacks.
    Several security threats like Information leakage, wiretapping, tampering, and
    replay attacks can bring severe destruction to sensitive data of greenhouse farms.
    Users can overcome the probabilities of these outbreaks by implementing encryption
    algorithms and robust intrusion monitoring policies in the greenhouse network
    systems. 2) Lack of Connectivity Connectivity is the major challenge of IoT in
    greenhouse farming due to poor 2G/3G/4G coverage. Although some low power wide
    area technologies such as Sigfox and LoRa provide overcome such issues but they
    are not able to handle large datasets [105]. 3) Sensor Distribution Network Structure
    The sensors distribution directly impacts on controlling and monitoring parameters
    of a greenhouse farm [106]. Specified certain monitoring and regional requirements,
    the objective of this operation is to develop a sensor distribution network under
    specific constraints such as sensor cost and range. The optimization standards
    may be conflicting, such as the lowest costs and highest precision. Furthermore,
    the process models will be unique when sensors are portable. In addition, besides
    static network sensor models, dynamic and multi-objective optimization is also
    obligatory [106]. 4) Societal Acceptance The implementation of smart and innovative
    technologies will be a challenging task for non-technical users. Therefore, training
    and education are highly important to help the users or farmers understand the
    applicability and utilization of new technologies. However, in developing countries,
    farmers believe that there is no need for such enhancement and they are not willing
    to adapt IoT-based farming methods. So, thorough training is necessary for all
    stakeholders and non-technical users in the smart farming field [21]. 5) Nodes
    Repairing and Recharging In greenhouse farming, IoT architecture contains a wide
    selection of nodes with limited battery time. Furthermore, the nodes in remote
    areas are not able to connect solar panels and power grids. Moreover, the IoT
    nodes may be collapse or break down due to unpredicted events like severe weather
    and other farming activities. In addition, repairing and recharging network nodes
    implemented in greenhouse farms is one of the most complicated operation challenges.
    Battery lifetimes of any node in the network are often not stable due to battery
    types, environments, and discharge rates, therefore, regular recharge plans may
    cause the failure of network nodes [108]. 6) Data Processing Power Accessing the
    high scale processing power to resolve complex calculations at affordable cost
    is a significant challenge for medium and small-level farmers. So, the non-existence
    of data processing services considerably hinders IoT [109]. 7) Lack of Interoperability
    Data protocols, IoT communication standards, and common building blocks are required
    for millions of devices to interoperate [109]. This type of standard exists for
    weather data prediction, semantic modeling, agricultural machinery, and various
    initiatives such as the association of IoT standards with IEEE standards. Moreover,
    some standards such as ISOBUS standards have not been designed in parallel to
    the pace of change and new machinery has trademarked connectivity with the same
    manufacturer’s machinery. This approach follows vendor lockin and extended resistance
    from growers. So, here the challenge is not the unavailability or lack of standards
    but the major issue is the emergence of an unlimited number of standards. 8) Key
    Knowledge Greenhouse farming needed highly skillful and knowledgeable users to
    run IoT-based smart farming solutions. Unfortunately, in some areas, there are
    not sufficient resources and ways to get the awareness and appropriate skills
    about smart greenhouse farming. Hence, it leads the farmers to waste their assets
    without having the knowledge of the cultivation process [92]–[94]. 9) Technology
    Selection According to the geographical position and climatic circumstances, there
    are various technologies developed every day in the market. It is difficult for
    the consumer to choose what type of IoT technology is suitable for their greenhouse
    farming practices. Moreover, they also need to modernize the greenhouse system
    by the time which is an expensive and difficult procedure [90]. C. Future Research
    Directions in IoT-Based Greenhouse Farming Based on this survey and discussion
    of major technologies, sensors, and communication protocols, we will present future
    research directions and key developments in the following aspects. A generic platform
    is necessary to build for all kinds of crops and plants, quality of service (QoS),
    integration of explainable artificial intelligence for pest control, and crop
    growth monitoring. Explainable artificial intelligence is highly necessary in
    order to understand and analyze the reasons behind any specific decision [115].
    It hides the traditional farming method and empowers the farmers or growers in
    understanding the factor behind the obtained solution. At the perception layer,
    the development of the sensors should concentrate on new and innovative sensitive
    material, processes, mechanisms, and methodologies with low cost and minimum power
    consumption. Apart from this, it is necessary to accelerate the deployment of
    sensors and rapid detection of a plant’s life. On the application layer, organizations
    and governments should introduce unified standards for communication protocols,
    sensors, identification devices, and application services in protected greenhouse
    farming by international negotiation or corporation. The developers should design
    large and open-source databases as well as libraries of processing algorithms
    for multiple areas to facilitate the farmers. Moreover, at the network layer,
    we should concentrate on low power management strategies, high-capacity broadband
    communication protocols, and low power networks for complex greenhouse farming
    application environments. LPWAN is best for some greenhouse farming scenarios
    where voice and video support are not necessarily due to its low-power consumption,
    low cost, and high capacity. More focused research is needed in the future on
    IoT-based greenhouse farming solutions on LPWAN. With the widespread deployment
    of IoT sensors, there should be a virtualized sensor in which farmers have access
    to manage and control their IoT-based greenhouse farms virtually. A large volume
    of data is captured, forwarded, stored, and examined for efficient decision-making
    in an IoT-based smart greenhouse. Big data analytics is used to give predictive
    insights in smart greenhouse farming procedure by providing operational decisions.
    The major problem with data analytics is the sustainable integration of big data
    sources, intelligent processing, and data quality [101]. So, the openness of big
    data platforms is highly important subsequently it can authorize and empower the
    growers or farmers in their site in supply chains. IoT utilization generates a
    widespread experience of cyber security attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities
    in IoT-based greenhouse farming. Although, a number of intrusion detection systems
    (IDS) have been developed to mitigate the security attacks and analyze the network
    traffic to identify an infected device [102], [103]. But none of them provide
    a specific solution for smart farming. Therefore, development in ML-based IDS
    and a farm-specified access control mechanism is an open research direction. SECTION
    VIII. Smart Greenhouse Success Stories A lot of new opportunities for the farmers
    are provided in the developed countries to tackle the challenges they face, specifically
    in greenhouse farming. Garcia et al. [114] have been elaborated on several technological
    methods which are used in agricultural farming globally. Some success stories
    regarding IoT-enabled greenhouses in several countries have been explained in
    this section. A. Malaysia Malaysia faced problematic issues to cultivate sensitive
    crops like strawberries because of the equatorial country, but through the deployment
    of IoT-enabled greenhouse farms, it is potentially easy to produce strawberry
    plants [123]. Farmers installed IoT-based greenhouse farms on several locations
    in Malaysia to automatically regulate and monitor the internal environment which
    is suitable for the growth of plants. This system has also facilitated the user
    to remotely track the supply and distribution of the product. B. Korea Smart greenhouse
    farming is exponentially rising in Korea day-to-day [125]. Farmers breed several
    types of plants, for instance, tomatoes, strawberries, and sweet peppers efficiently
    by using IoT-based farming techniques. Park et al. [124] elaborated some important
    factors regarding greenhouse farming in Korea such as farm requirement, crop growing
    approaches, and pests controlling. The survey originates the significant threats
    for the greenhouse users and their satisfaction rate related to greenhouse farming.
    These results will be supportive to cope and design the greenhouse system in the
    future. C. Italy Agricultural practices are successfully experienced in Italy.
    They introduced different categories of energy proficient sources for greenhouse
    farming, one of them is producing electricity through a photovoltaic system that
    is also environment friendly [126]. Further, they also improved their existing
    greenhouse farming method to a modular, low-priced, and Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoraWAN) based platform to observe environmental conditions related to the plants
    inside the greenhouse farm [127]. D. India A controlled greenhouse farm is implemented
    by the farmers to improve their yielding rate by accessing the climatic parameters
    (soil moisture, temperature/humidity, CO2) remotely within the greenhouse in India
    [128]. Further, in the hill areas like Uttar-Akhand it is difficult to accomplish
    greenhouse farming due to severe environmental conditions. Therefore, low-cost
    IoT-enabled greenhouses have been implemented for the cultivation of off-season
    crops and accomplished a good return on investment. E. China A wireless greenhouse
    technology has been established which is cost-effective and consumes less energy
    by controlling the greenhouse atmosphere automatically [11]. One of the Chinese
    provinces has practiced an IoT-based farm which has decreased the labor charges
    and surged the crop yielding rate proficiently as compared to traditional farming
    [129]. However, in rural areas, farmers have developed the agriculture system
    through government support. The sale procedure of agricultural products has been
    transferred to E-Commerce which overcome the cost and simplified the trading process
    [130]. F. Russia Several agricultural universities as well as a center for special
    analysis have been established under the Russian Agricultural ministry to train
    the farmers for digitalizing agriculture. Kulyasov et al. [131] described a model
    which interacts with different objects of agriculture like a smart greenhouse,
    smart garden, and smart field. This model provides the opportunity of using different
    digital technologies to precisely monitor and automatically control the atmospheric
    system for increasing the production rate. SECTION IX. IoT Based Greenhouse Industry
    Trends The IoT technology brought a revolutionary change in the agriculture sector
    all over the world. Top technology firms are also effectively working in the area
    of greenhouse farming to facilitate farmers all over the world and minimize the
    key challenges regarding farming practices. Besides this, some IoT gadgets have
    been shown in Figure 14 that are playing an imperative role in smart greenhouse
    farming. FIGURE 14. IoT greenhouse products. Show All Xtreme IoT kit acts as a
    weather monitoring sensor with the capabilities of improved sensing and efficient
    accuracy [132]. However, the sensor also measures oxygen volume, the required
    amount of fertilization, and water quantity in the soil. Leaf moistness can be
    determined by using a wetness sensor [133]. It uses electrical resistance to find
    the moisture content on the leaf surface within the greenhouse. A greenhouse drone
    is used to monitor the cultivation area and find the area that is not properly
    irrigated [134]. The weather station is used for the distribution of greenhouse
    data to a master sensor within a 600-meter range [135]. The water leakage detector
    finds water leakage using a rope sensor within a 3 to 10-meter area and forwards
    the notification to the farmer [136]. Smart valve is a wireless battery operated
    and low power consumption valve to irrigate crops in greenhouses farm at long-distance
    [137]. A rat trap is used to remotely monitor, store, and alert the farmer about
    rodent activity within the greenhouse farm [138]. The water flow meter monitors
    the water consumption on a daily basis and informs the user regarding water usage
    in the greenhouse [139]. The ultrasonic sensor has the ability to identify specific
    plant growth in the smart greenhouse to keep the farmer updated about the growth
    rate [140]. Auto filler is used to replenish the water tank automatically when
    the tank becomes empty [141]. Moreover, table 3 has presented the top technology
    firm’s efforts regarding greenhouse farming. TABLE 3 IoT Based Greenhouse Farming

    SECTION X. Conclusion The current status of the research has indicated that it
    was feasible to remotely monitor the greenhouse parameters such as CO2, PH, moisture
    content, humidity, temperature, and irrigation by using IoT sensors and devices.
    In this survey, we have discussed emerging technologies of IoT and provided a
    rigorous discussion on IoT-based greenhouse farming patterns. Furthermore, various
    traditional and developed cultivation techniques are discussed which can help
    the growers to understand the technological structure of a greenhouse. In addition,
    we have also discussed the IoT-enabled greenhouse network structure based on cloud
    and big data analysis, which act as an IoT backbone and help farmers to increase
    crop productivity. Moreover, this survey provides a state-of-the-art overview
    of IoT-based greenhouse farming applications, sensors/devices, communication protocols,
    and technologies. Furthermore, several important dimensions of IoT-greenhouse
    farming, top technology firm’s trends, and success stories performance metrics
    have been discussed to succor the stakeholders. This article also considers many
    IoT-enabled greenhouse open issues and security challenges with future research
    directions. From this comprehensive survey, it is clear that the government and
    many big organizations have started investing to develop new smart greenhouse
    farming techniques by using IoT. Lastly, it is expected that this research generates
    very useful information for agriculturists, researchers, policymakers, and technologists
    who are researching and working in the IoT-based smart farming field. Authors

    \ This study intends to explore a platform that oﬀers an infrastructure to link\

    \ contemporary network diﬃculties relating to agriculture are also\ncovered. Conclusion.\
    \ The results of this study can be used as a guide for creating particular network\
    \ protocols for the\nagriculture industry.\n1. Introduction\nIn the economic development\
    \ of a region, agriculture plays a\ncrucial role. Agriculture is an essential\
    \ profession [1]. In\nIndia, almost 70% of families survive on the income gener-\n\
    ated by agriculture [2]. The protection and improvement\nof agriculture are therefore\
    \ necessary. Keeping in view the\nimportance of agriculture, smart farming was\
    \ introduced.\nAgriculture and information technologies check the produc-\ntion\
    \ of diﬀerent crops [3]. Several problems are yet to be\nsolved in agriculture\
    \ as the most critical portion of farmers’\nstrategies is obsolete and does not\
    \ reach an acceptable yield\n[4]. Humidity, air temperature, and farmland signiﬁcantly\n\
    aﬀect plant development and the agriculture industry, which\nare crucial for sustainability\
    \ [5]. Sustainable agriculture and\nintelligent farming have drawn widespread\
    \ interest in acade-\nmia and industry, which is seen as a modern way of achiev-\n\
    ing food development, including crop monitoring in a real\nenvironment, smart\
    \ greenhouse, disease detection in crops\n[6], and smart city management [7],\
    \ among others. Other\nchallenges, including data collection and recording, are\
    \ the\nprimary steps toward fundamental analysis and intelligent\nfarming applications\
    \ [8]. Data has become more ubiquitous\nwith the exponential growth of mobile\
    \ and wireless network-\ning technology. An IoT (Internet of Things) system consists\n\
    of low power, small in size, and sensor nodes operated using\nbatteries [9], which\
    \ also leads to wireless sensor networks\n(WSNs) [10]. To sense the environment\
    \ continuously in\nremote geographical areas, a network of inexpensive nodes\n\
    is deployed, a typical IoT application. The IoT draws much\nHindawi\nWireless\
    \ Communications and Mobile Computing\nVolume 2022, Article ID 5617903, 16 pages\n\
    https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5617903\ninterest due to high demands for creative\
    \ operation, perfor-\nmance, and productivity enhancement [11]. Cloud comput-\n\
    ing\nand\nthe\nInternet\nof\nThings\nperform\nelementary\nmanagement jobs, manage\
    \ visual data related to crops, and\nobserve the growth environment [12]. The\
    \ projected market\nsize of smart farming worldwide in 2017 and 2022 as smart\n\
    agriculture global market size is projected to rise from\naround US$ 9.58 billion\
    \ in 2017 to US$ 23.14 billion by\n2022 [11]. Smart farming increases agricultural\
    \ productivity,\nsolves agrarian challenges like food demand, and makes\nfarmers\
    \ more connected and intelligent. By 2023, the market\nsize of smart agriculture\
    \ worldwide is expected to hit around\nUnited States (US) $ 26.76 billion. Precision\
    \ farming is\npoised to become the most inﬂuential agricultural trend in\ndeveloping\
    \ countries. It is also projected that the market size\nof precision farming will\
    \ rise from US$ 730 million in 2015\nto US$ 2.42 billion by 2020. Figure 1 shows\
    \ IoT projects’\nglobal share and trends [13].\nWith the growing development in\
    \ mobile and wireless\nnetworking technologies and the ever-increasing amount\
    \ of\ndata and related resources distributed via heterogeneous net-\nworks, the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed the con-\ncept of a more interconnected\
    \ society into reality [14]. The\nIoT, also known as the Internet of Things or\
    \ the Modern\nInternet, is a modern technology model designed as a global\nnetwork\
    \ of computers and machines capable of connecting,\ndelivering innovative activities,\
    \ and improving production\nand productivity [15]. The IoT is now generally known\
    \ as\na product that already has a signiﬁcant impact on industrial\nmarkets. Current\
    \ innovations rely mainly on managing and\ntracking diverse operations, increasingly\
    \ growing to satisfy\nhuman requirements. Most of these innovations are based\n\
    on eﬃcient management and control of various processes.\nSeveral remote health\
    \ tracking system sensors can screen\nvariables and transfer data to a personal\
    \ computer or an\nonline storage website [16]. This device can resolve patients’\n\
    concerns by continuously recording data on their mobile\nphones, PC, or various\
    \ remote gadgets, which may inﬂuence\ntheir procedures. Sensors allow patients\
    \ to self-screen, mon-\nitor, and survey human physiological information while\
    \ sup-\nplying healthcare providers with interfaces and a dashboard.\nThese sensors\
    \ are eﬃciently tracked for patient consider-\nation and eventually become accurate\
    \ and robust. Incorpo-\nrating the wearable integrated sensor [17] is used to\n\
    assemble physiological and development information to\nenable the status checking\
    \ of patients. The medicinal use of\nintrigue represents sensors. Using wearable\
    \ frameworks,\nhealth tracking systems often use multiple sensors periodi-\ncally\
    \ organized into a sensor that is either conﬁned to\nbody-wearing sensors or incorporates\
    \ a network of sensors.\nThe use of wearable sensors and systems that are important\n\
    to the restoration ﬁeld includes well-being and health obser-\nvation, safety\
    \ control, home recovery, adequacy of treatment\nassessment, and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of disorders [18].\nThe relationship between the Internet of Things (IoT)\n\
    and agriculture is highlighted in this research. For doing this,\ndiﬀerent communication\
    \ protocols have been discussed in\nthis paper. Similarly, the network protocols\
    \ are further\ndivided into subprotocols, and each protocol’s speciﬁc pur-\npose\
    \ is elaborated. After that, the relationship between agri-\nculture and IoT is\
    \ discussed, including the function of\nnetwork protocols in agriculture and their\
    \ problems.\nThe remaining parts are arranged as follows: Section 2.1\nexamines\n\
    existing\nliterary\napproaches\nand\nprotocols,\nfollowed by Section 2.2 on communication\
    \ protocols. Sec-\ntion 2.3 then discusses the purpose of distinct protocols in\n\
    a network; Section 2.4 then discusses agriculture and the sig-\nniﬁcance of computer\
    \ networks in agriculture; Section 2.5\nthen discusses the analysis of computer\
    \ network protocols\nin agriculture; Sections 2.6 and 2.7 then illustrates potential\n\
    research and technologies used in agriculture, and Section\n2.8 discusses network\
    \ issues in agriculture. Section 2.9 pro-\nvides the discussion based on research\
    \ questions, and Sec-\ntion 3 concludes the paper.\n2. Survey Methodology\nBased\
    \ on the discussion mentioned in the introduction sec-\ntion, the proposed work\
    \ focused on three research questions\nand targeted them as:\nQ1. What network\
    \ protocols have been utilized in the lit-\nerature for agricultural digitization?\n\
    Q2. Which protocol is the best in IoT?\nQ3. What challenges existed in agricultural\
    \ networks?\nWe investigated the role of IoT in agriculture and net-\nwork protocols\
    \ in depth. A review approach was used for\nthe deep investigation. This aided\
    \ us in integrating previous\nwork and deﬁning our strategy in a broad sense.\
    \ The\nresources are connected to IoT methods in agriculture and\nnetwork protocols.\
    \ Other sources include books, research\npapers, and review articles. The primary\
    \ goal of our research\nis to give all users information so they can pick which\
    \ proto-\ncols will best fulﬁll their needs. Table 1 provides the detail of\n\
    the gathered research.\n2.1. Literature Review. Discuss the constraints that are\
    \ used\nto reduce the risk level in farming. The author highlighted\nthat many\
    \ farm areas with the ownership of that land could\nincrease the expectations\
    \ of a high growth rate due to free-\nhand decision capability and can determine\
    \ adoption pace.\nMoreover, it is mentioned that developing countries use\ntwo\
    \ successful technologies in agriculture. First, technology\nis for aﬀordability\
    \ and availability of resources, and second,\ntechnology is used to proﬁt by minimizing\
    \ risk levels in\nfarming decision-making. The proﬁt maximization depends\non\
    \ the number of laborers, the farm size, and the agricultural\nresources [19].\
    \ In [20], the authors introduced a blockchain\nmethod as the central spine where\
    \ IoT devices worked to\ncollect data from the ﬁeld along with smart contracts,\n\
    responsible for communication among all the contributing\nparties. In [21], the\
    \ authors predicted whether the area is\nsuitable for harvesting or growing a\
    \ speciﬁc fruit tree using\nhigh-level protocols. The research discusses the network’s\n\
    strategy used in the business’s functionality. The authors\nexamined the protocols\
    \ and services from a high level and\nhighlighted data transport mechanisms in\
    \ a continuous\ncommunication stream. That data stream was assigned from\none\
    \ company to another and performed transit of message.\n2\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nThe main focus is on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\n\
    applications, and the method used is Hypertext Markup\nLanguage. The research\
    \ claims that the Internet Protocol\n(IP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\
    \ is easier to\nhandle. Furthermore, the paper discusses appropriate HTTP\nsecurity\
    \ methods [22].\nThe research uses Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to\nanswer\
    \ the queries of mapping from a logical address to a\nphysical address. ARP protocols\
    \ are preferred to save\ndenial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MITM)\n\
    attacks. So, through this, sensitive data can be exchanged\nwithout any ﬂaws.\
    \ After analyzing that no solution is feasi-\nble, the author discussed many solutions\
    \ and generated a\nstatement. Also, a secure and eﬃcient ARP version is pro-\n\
    vided through this research. The proposed version is viable\nfor all attack types\
    \ and provides a more reliable solution.\nThe authors claim that the designed\
    \ ARP is more eﬃcient\nand can solve entries related to storing in the ARP cache\n\
    [23] using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The selection\nparameters have an\
    \ objective function in node degree,\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nIOT ANALYTICS\

    \ energy, and several optimal\nCHs. Compared to routing protocols, the model works\
    \ best\nin terms of complex network metrics [24]. The research\nhighlighted performance\
    \ and security issues. Secure Sockets\nLayer (SSL) is used to discuss security\
    \ issues. The claim is\nthat SSL is a speciﬁc protocol to facilitate user communica-\n\
    tion. Through SSL secure authentication, data encryption,\nand data decryption\
    \ can be done. This protocol provides\nexcellent security service but is less\
    \ eﬃcient in performance\nthan other protocols and services. Now we combine both\n\
    the terms “data” and “communication” as “data communi-\ncation (DC).” DC deals\
    \ with an encoded movement of infor-\nmation by using an electronic transmission\
    \ system. Data is\nsent from one point (known as a source) to another point\n\
    (known as a destination) [25]. Ahmed et al. [26] introduced\nfog computing and\
    \ WiFi-based Long Distance (WILD) net-\nworks in present WSN-based solutions to\
    \ cover long range\nwith minor delays. Also, a cross-layer-based media access\n\
    control (MAC) is adopted to observe traﬃc nature and lead\nto an assigned duty\
    \ cycle that improves delay and through-\nput. In [27], the researchers demonstrated\
    \ the consequences\nof increasing the overall processing time and decreasing the\n\
    number of bytes available in memory. The researchers\nclaimed that SSL has a higher\
    \ impact on real processing time\nwhen taking the percentage of the bytes available\
    \ in mem-\nory. The primary function of any sensor network is to route\nthe sensor-assembled\
    \ information and forward it to the BS.\nThe simplest way to transmit data is\
    \ direct transfer, where\nthe nodes have to direct their data to the base station\
    \ or sink\nnode. However, suppose the distance between the sink and\nthe network\
    \ is high. In that case, the node will die out\nquickly due to unnecessary energy\
    \ consumption. The clus-\ntering algorithm eliminates wasteful energy consumption\n\
    when delivering data to BS by grouping the network into\nclusters. Each cluster\
    \ is assigned a cluster head (CH), which\nsends data to base station (BS). Choosing\
    \ CH, which should\nensure a uniform energy distribution between the sensors,\
    \ is\ncrucial in the clustering algorithm [28]. The selective iden-\ntity attack\
    \ model is often considered in identity-based\nencryption, which means the identity\
    \ to attack should be\nannounced before the attacker requests the necessary infor-\n\
    mation. The attacker could ﬁrst pick multiple identities to\nexpose, known as\
    \ the selective multi-ID attack, for various\nreceivers Strategic Management and\
    \ Innovations Division\n(SMID) [29]. Using optoelectronic components and a poly-\n\
    dimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS)\nmicroﬂuidic\ndevice,\na\ncolorimetry-based miniaturized\
    \ device for accurately asses-\nsing two soil, nitrogen, phosphorus, and macronutrients\n\
    was constructed. A microcontroller and Bluetooth-based\nmodule are adopted to\
    \ ﬁnd the remote location and monitor\nthe data. Moreover, an android application\
    \ is also developed\nto monitor data transmission [30]. A blockchain-based opti-\n\
    mization technique is used for the system of greenhouse.\nHowever, the proposed\
    \ method performs three primary\ntasks (prediction, optimization, and controlling),\
    \ whereas\nthe Kalman ﬁlter is utilized to predict the greenhouse sen-\nsory information.\
    \ Similarly, for indoor greenhouse climate,\nthe\noptimal\nparameters\nare\ncalculated.\n\
    Finally,\nthese\nimproved parameters are used to activate and control the\nactuator\
    \ with the help of the control module. The proposed\noptimization strategy reduced\
    \ energy consumption by 19%\ncompared with prediction-based techniques and 41%\
    \ com-\npared to the baseline scheme [31]. An IoT multiagent preci-\nsion irrigation\
    \ approach enhances water usage in irrigation\nsystems. Irrigation is supervised\
    \ and regulated in each ﬁeld\nwith the help of an intelligent irrigation agent\
    \ that prescribes\nand applies the amount of water based on agronomical\nparameters\
    \ in the proposed system. The results showed that\nirrigation levels were administered\
    \ accurately on the ﬁelds,\nresulting in increased water eﬃciency [32]. Data exchange\n\
    can be done through a wireless or wired transmission\nmedium from one device to\
    \ another. In simple words, digital\ninformation transferring from one place (source)\
    \ to another\n(destination) is known as data communication (DC) [25,\n33]. Smart\
    \ agriculture consists of several parameters such\nas soil nutrients, business,\
    \ security, proﬁt, storage, and com-\nmunications. However, the soil is an essential\
    \ parameter to\nenhance business in agriculture. Measuring soil capability\nﬁrst\
    \ and then investing in it is necessary [30]. Similarly,\nthe greenhouse method\
    \ can improve or accelerate agricul-\ntural progress. As a result, a blockchain-based\
    \ technique\n[31] exists in the literature that eﬃciently monitors green-\nhouse\
    \ performance using sensory information. However,\nthis method can be implementable\
    \ after measuring the soil’s\ncapability.\nSimilarly, other methods [32] are also\
    \ used to manage or\nmonitor other agriculture components like water and honey.\n\
    Furthermore, because a large number of sensors are operat-\ning at the same time,\
    \ security is an essential aspect of intel-\nligent agriculture. Security may\
    \ be improved by addressing\nvulnerabilities and employing attack-prevention tactics.\n\
    Many methods [21–23, 25, 26] may be used to enhance net-\nwork security and performance.\
    \ The summary of literature\nis summarized in Table 2.\nThe IoT integrates the\
    \ Internet with intelligent devices\nand objects, becoming an omnipresent network.\
    \ Messages\nfrom the satellite must also be stored until they can transmit\nto\
    \ the device. The satellite IoT gateway should eventually be\nﬁtted with store-and-forward\
    \ functionality [34]. Besides, the\ngateway could also store the data received\
    \ from the smart-\nphones when traveling beyond the satellite contact range to\n\
    avoid data loss and vice versa. Moreover, because of BLIP’s\nsmaller footprint,\
    \ Berkeley IP (BLIP) makes it simple and\nstraightforward to build network apps.\
    \ We performed test-\nbeds on actual WSN consisting of TELOSB and MICAZ\nhardware\
    \ systems to discover the characteristics of LowPAN\nin (BLIP). It is important\
    \ to note that BLIP can only use the\nIPv6 unicast address that is part of the\
    \ network shared from\nthe edge router and its interface identiﬁer derived from\
    \ the\ninterface’s MAC address [35]. WSN provides a platform\nfor data processing\
    \ and networking to map and navigate\nthe natural environment and strengthen society\
    \ [36]. Wire-\nless\ntechnology\ntransfer\ndrains\nmore\nelectricity\nthan\nmachines\
    \ designed to receive or stay idle. In [37], the\nauthors developed a routing\
    \ mechanism using a memetic\nalgorithm that elevated the performance of IoT-based\
    \ WSAs\nin regards to throughput, stability period, the actual number\nof nodes,\
    \ end-to-end delay, and network lifetime. The rising\n4\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nnumber of smart devices connecting to the Internet has\n\
    made energy eﬃciency an excess parameter in the IoT archi-\ntecture. Setting up\
    \ energy-eﬃcient methods for integrating\nsensor networks has always been diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers.\nOnce combined with the IoT, control becomes a more criti-\n\
    cal concern due to the number of computers [38].\nTechnologies such as Automatic\
    \ Identiﬁcation and Data\nCapture (AIDC), barcode, QR code, and near-ﬁeld commu-\n\
    nication (NFC) are used to identify warehouse organiza-\ntions. Using NFC technology\
    \ is the opportunity to use it as\nan NFC tag reader on a cell phone. Barcodes\
    \ can provide fast\nand accurate data transmission that ensures monitoring of\n\
    products/pallets/packages and enhances service quality for\nend-users [39]. In\
    \ multilinear maps setting MPHF parame-\nters, a new ID-MRPKE scheme based on\
    \ MPHF is built. In\nthe basic model, we illustrate the security of the suggested\n\
    method. Our plan is only formulated concerning a standard\nmultilinear level map.\
    \ Using the improved noisy crypto-\ngraphic multilinear maps of Gu’s work is necessary\
    \ to con-\nstruct our scheme, which proved contrary to the attack\n[40]. The main\
    \ research focused on HTTP, highlighting that\nprotocol is the critical and essential\
    \ data communication\nprotocol. He discusses the TCP/IP model in detail and OSI\n\
    layers. He highlights the message traveling from sender to\nreceiver or client\
    \ to server. He discusses the packet tracer’s\nmonitoring and simulating mechanism\
    \ [41]. A wide variety\nof applications, including smart cities, traﬃc congestion,\n\
    waste management, systemic health, defense, emergency ser-\nvices, logistics,\
    \ retail, industrial control, and healthcare, are\nenabled by the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [42]. IoT is mega\ntechnology that can build links on a website\
    \ and any net-\nwork with something, anybody, at any time, location, or\noperation.\
    \ It has a massive eﬀect on the entire blockchain\nof heterogeneous network connectivity-enabled\
    \ organiza-\ntions, intelligent objects and applications, networks, and ser-\n\
    vices built as an intellectual, ubiquitous framework of smart\ndevices. IoT devices\
    \ operating in several areas attach to\ndynamic devices and communicate with hostile\
    \ environ-\nments [43].\nThe Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic approach\nwas used\
    \ to test the system. Cryptanalysis ﬁnds that our\nscheme can solve the security\
    \ vulnerabilities of previously\npublished techniques. The result reveals that\
    \ our scheme’s\nsecurity features are quantitative and can increase authenti-\n\
    cation performance in IoT environments. Notably, it has\nexcellent performance\
    \ reliability, low cost of computing, fru-\ngal electricity consumption, and low\
    \ communication cost\n[44]. The traﬃc route between the heads of the zone and\n\
    the base station is distance-centered and designed to elimi-\nnate data packet\
    \ loss at one hop and dual-hop speeds at\nthe site’s leaders. Each site is planned\
    \ by uniform random\ndeployment to own approximately 1/4 percent of the\ndeployed\
    \ sensor node count like network energy usage, sen-\nsor node average energy consumed,\
    \ packet distribution ratio,\npercentage of packet loss, and network throughput\
    \ [45].\nWith SWIPT, we have a modeling system for sustainable cel-\nlular mass\

    we see many apps that make our lives easy, such as smart\ncars, smart houses,\
    \ intelligent traﬃc control, intelligent\nworkplaces, innovative medical consultation,\
    \ smart cities,\netc. All such services are beyond an average citizen’s control\n\
    to improve information and communications technologies.\nThe vision of the word\
    \ Internet has continuously spread its\nwings in all facets of life over the past\
    \ few years. Identifying\nthe optimum capacity of the Internet use has been a\
    \ diﬃcult\nchallenge for researchers. Over time, items have been corre-\nlated\
    \ with the word Internet and are not known as IoT [47].\nAs the name suggests,\
    \ Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation\n(RFID), wireless sensor networks (WSN), Bluetooth,\
    \ near-\nﬁeld communication (NFC), Long-Term Evolution (LTE),\nand numerous other\
    \ intelligent communication technologies\nare related through the Internet [48].\n\
    Communication is not only between humans in sci-\nence, but it can also be between\
    \ devices or computers.\nThe exchanging of information between two (or more)\n\
    bodies is known as correspondence, while knowledge is\nused in a well-formed or\
    \ ordered manner as information\nabout someone. Data can occur in several ways,\
    \ such as\ntext (SMS) or device data in a text ﬁle or image, or a sig-\nnal, such\
    \ as cell phone data. The “digital-analog signal” or\n“digital bit” is known as\
    \ data in electronic science. Specif-\nically, data is a plural form that describes\
    \ a single piece of\nknowledge [49]. WSNs have been an integral part of appli-\n\
    cations, such as environmental surveillance, military, and\nmedical surveillance,\
    \ through feasible connectivity, practi-\ncal inspection, and application eﬃciency.\
    \ Many sensor\nnodes are composed of WSNs that are thinly deployed\nand wirelessly\
    \ communicated to transmit and receive envi-\nronmental data. At least one or\
    \ more sensors, a radio\ntransceiver, a processor, and a power supply portion\
    \ are\nﬁtted for each sensor node. Due to the sophistication of\nsuch structures,\
    \ developing WSNs is a very demanding\ntask [50]. In accumulation, some essential\
    \ speciﬁcations,\nsuch as the power consumption criterion, which is the pri-\n\
    mary key, need to be fulﬁlled during the construction of\nthe WSN. Several programming\
    \ methods, which concen-\ntrate on low-level machine problems, have been proposed\n\
    in existing real-world WSN implementations [51]. High-\nlevel processes have been\
    \ recognized, and many solutions\nhave been suggested to simplify the architecture\
    \ of the\nWSN and abstract from low-level technical data. The\nmodel-driven engineering\
    \ (MDE) methodology, in particu-\nlar, is becoming a promising alternative [52].\
    \ Figure 2\nshows the recently utilized communication technologies\nin IoT.\n\
    2.2. Communication Protocols. A set of data communica-\ntion rules is known as\
    \ a protocol. Two devices must be\nused as a protocol to perform communication\
    \ to send or\nreceive bit-streams to each system. And all the entities\nshould\
    \ be agreed on a “Protocol” to do contact. We han-\ndle the following queries\
    \ [53, 54].\n(i) What is communicated?\n(ii) How is it communicated?\n(iii) When\
    \ is it communicated?\nProtocols act like an agreement among communicating\ndevices.\
    \ Following are the elements used in the protocol.\n(1) Syntax: data structure\
    \ or format means the order in\nwhich data is presented. Like the simple protocol,\n\
    the design uses the ﬁrst 8 bits as the sender address,\nthe second (after the\
    \ ﬁrst 8 bits) 8 bits used as the\nreceiver address, and the rest\n(2) Semantics:\
    \ each section’s bit meaning is known as\nsemantic\n(3) Timing: is a combination\
    \ of two things\n(i) When sent the data\n(ii) How fast we sent it\nIf both sides\
    \ do not use the compatible mechanism,\nsome data may be lost on the receiver\
    \ side. Two systems\nmay be interconnected but can neither send the data nor\n\
    communicate without a protocol. Communication protocols\nact as the rule descriptions\
    \ through which devices are\nallowed for communication. They deal as one component\n\
    of the DC system.\n2.2.1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is the sig-\n\
    niﬁcant communication protocol in two or more electronic\nsystems on a network\
    \ setup. TCP allows the devices to trans-\nmit data among them. TCP breaks the\
    \ data before sending\nthem into IP packets and reassembles them at the receiver.\n\
    A system sends a request to another device through TCP\nfor communication, sending\
    \ the request to the receiver’s\naccurate address. After getting an agreement\
    \ between two\nparties/systems, TCP allows communication after setting\nup a “Full-Duplex.”\
    \ Full-Duplex maintains a communica-\ntion line between designs and work until\
    \ one of the systems\ndisconnects or closes the path. TCP/IP have several further\n\
    protocols inside them, like TCP between applications, User\nDatagram Protocol\
    \ (UDP) for the most straightforward\ncommunication among applications, Internet\
    \ Protocol (IP)\ncommunication between computers, Internet Control Mes-\nsage\
    \ Protocol (ICMP) to handle errors and check statistics,\nand Dynamic Host Conﬁguration\
    \ Protocol (DHCP) used\nfor “Dynamic Addressing.”\n2.2.2. Internet Protocol (IP).\
    \ Communication-less means no\nphysical line (cable) for communication is required\
    \ between\ntwo systems. The communication-less protocol is known as\nthe Internet\
    \ Protocol. This protocol uses a subnet mask\n6\nWireless Communications and Mobile\
    \ Computing\nand IP address to determine whether the data is remote or\non a local\
    \ network. A default gateway is used to forward data\nknown as a “router” if a\
    \ remote network links to another\nnetwork. IP used a hop to keep track of the\
    \ transverse num-\nber towards the destination.\nInternet Protocols support all\
    \ the local area network\n(LAN) types and have a point-to-point link with nodes.\
    \ IP\ncan solve the Ethernet problem of scaling. Through IP, we\ncan achieve universal\
    \ “connectivity.” IP supports global\nrouting and addressing mechanisms to send\
    \ packets of\ninformation from one host to another. The most common\nversion is\
    \ IPv4, also known as version 4; it has 4 bytes, which\nmeans 32 bits. The speciﬁc\
    \ point of IPv4 from IP is that it\nhas two parts of address: the “network part”\
    \ and the second\n“host part.” The router is vital in sending packets toward the\n\
    accurate destination system. Same as TCP, IP splits the data\ninto small-sized\
    \ boxes (independent) and is sent via the\nInternet to the system. The beneﬁt\
    \ is that each communica-\ntion line can be used simultaneously among diﬀerent\n\
    methods.\n2.2.3. Wireless Routing Protocol (WRP). This protocol com-\nprises a\
    \ routing protocol, also known as vector routing.\nRouting tables are used to\
    \ store each node’s information.\nThe store’s data is node distance value, link\
    \ cost, routing\ninformation, and information about the “Message Retrans-\nmission\
    \ List (MRL).” Each node in this interconnectivity\nhas its own path known as\
    \ the “Shortest-path Spanning Tree\n(SST)” within their adjacent nodes. These\
    \ adjacent nodes get\nupdated information. If no change occurs in the direction,\n\
    then information is directly transmitted among nodes; oth-\nerwise, a new path\
    \ is built after the new shortest path for\nrouting information. All the data\
    \ is updated in the table.\nWRP has faster transmission of information because\
    \ this\nprotocol does not use the loop phenomenon in algorithms.\n2.2.4. Address\
    \ Resolution Protocol (ARP). In the TCP/IP pro-\ntocol, another protocol is named\
    \ “Address Resolution Proto-\ncol (ARP) in the network layer protocol bottom.”\
    \ The HOST\npart is identiﬁed by 32 bits (Portion in IP address). TCP/IP\nhas\
    \ a diﬀerent addressing scheme name, “Medium Access\nControl” or MAC, and uses\
    \ 48 bits for address. The network\nlayer receives a packet and checks the destination\
    \ IP address.\nThe packet is directly sent from the sender machine to the\ndestination\
    \ machine if the destination is at some network\n(local network). If the destination\
    \ is diﬀerent, then a router\npath would be found. The sender machine needs the\
    \ MAC\nto address the destination machine for sending direct\npackets. ARP can\
    \ accomplish this. It also has an ARP cache\nto make the temporary memory map\
    \ 32 bits address to 48\nbits address scheme. ARP sends the request message (ARP\n\
    request) and receives a reply (ARP reply). ARP request is a\nform of the message,\
    \ and in this message, it depends on\nthe MAC address. Then all the hosts broadcast\
    \ this request.\nARP reply is a form of the message containing the MAC\naddress\
    \ requested.\n2.3. Protocol for Speciﬁc Purpose. Speciﬁc protocols are\ndesigned\
    \ to perform a speciﬁc task (single task) for commu-\nnication through network\
    \ systems. Some of these protocols\nare listed below, and their functionalities\
    \ are for analysis\npurposes.\n(1) Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) maintains\n\
    the communication between the browser and server\n[41]. For this communication,\
    \ it uses a request\nwhich sends from the browser (client) to the server\n(web),\
    \ and in return for this request, web contents\nare sent from server to browser\
    \ (client), as shown\nin Figure 3\n(2) Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS):\n\
    when the “S” letter is attached to the HTTP, it indi-\ncates the communication\
    \ (above mention) is secure\n[22, 55]. It means S has a speciﬁc meaning. Usually,\n\
    bank transactions have sensitive data, so they use\nthis protocol\n(3) Secure\
    \ Socket Layer (SSL): this protocol is worn for\ndata encryption to perform secure\
    \ transmission of\ndata [56, 57].\n(4) Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME):\n\
    this protocol transmits binary data and voice and\naudio (multimedia ﬁles) across\
    \ the TCP/IP network\n(5) Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): this pro-\n\
    tocol’s speciﬁc use is retrieving and arranging (sort-\ning) email data\n(6) File\
    \ Transfer Protocol (FTP) handles the ﬁle trans-\nmission between the systems\
    \ [58] (Mazin, 2013)\n(7) Network Time Protocol (NTP): its particular pur-\npose\
    \ is to perform time synchronization between\nsystems [56, 59]\nGreen\ncomputing\n\

    \ is used for IP address dynamic alloca-\ntion of systems into a network [60].\n\

    \ protocol\ntakes care of it\n(12) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): it must\

    \ Figure 4 shows the pur-\npose of each protocol in visual form\n2.4. Agriculture.\
    \ Agriculture is the most recent trend that has\ngained popularity due to its\
    \ collaboration with systems and\nthe Internet. Using network capabilities and\
    \ computing\npower can enhance the agriculture growth rate. Instead of\ntraditional\
    \ tools, computers and the Internet can also facili-\ntate agriculture without\
    \ physical objects. For example,\napplying diﬀerent sensors to get ﬁeld updated\
    \ status could\nnot be done with old traditional tools. In 2025, according\nto\
    \ the report of the United Nations organization named\nthe “Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO),” the total\npopulation will increase by up to 8 billion\
    \ people. This\nmeans we must build a mechanism to increase the food\ngrowth rate\
    \ (practical food production will be increased by\nup to 70%). To achieve the\
    \ target of FAD mention number\nand provide food to each person globally, we need\
    \ to intro-\nduce the modernization of agriculture technology and gener-\nate\
    \ high-quality products. Resources and a high-water\nsupply are mandatory to get\
    \ all the beneﬁcial agriculture\npoints.\nCollecting valuable measurements from\
    \ raw information\nis the goal of any research. Get the crop data that needs to\
    \ be\nprocessed in a well-deﬁned manner. A year ago, the term\n“precision agriculture”\
    \ came into the research ﬁeld to per-\nform crop management, generating digital\
    \ data (digital\ninformation). To get the appropriate or correct decision\nrelated\
    \ to the crop conditions and crop diseases, an entire\ndevelopment process is\
    \ needed to get the crop diagnoses.\nDiagnoses of any crop or ﬁeld can only be\
    \ made with ﬁeld\nexperience, and data can be perceived over a farmer’s eye.\n\
    Our primary purpose of this research is to manage the crops\nand farms with the\
    \ help of information related to the ﬁeld\nand make intelligent decisions after\
    \ diagnosing. A proper\nsystem must connect smart devices or sensors to achieve\n\
    the abovementioned objectives. The interconnectivity of\nthese devices can generate\
    \ desired information about crops.\nThis information acts as the data that is\
    \ retrieved directly\nfrom the soil and crops. There are two ways to retrieve\
    \ the\ndata from the soil. First is using the sensors and getting\ninformation\
    \ through these sensors in the form of ﬁelds. Sec-\nond, use an application or\
    \ software. This application is usu-\nally synchronized with the Internet. In\
    \ our research, we use\nthese two steps in the same order. We interconnect devices\n\
    through the computer network protocol and will build an\napplication. After receiving\
    \ data from the sensors, our con-\ntrol unit will perform a decision that means\
    \ physical action\nexecution. This action can be in any form, which means\nwe\
    \ can achieve any speciﬁc action from our machinery after\nany command.\n2.4.1.\
    \ Computer Network in Agriculture. A lot of work has\nbeen done in the last decade\
    \ to enhance the growth rate of\nagriculture. People have used Internet functionalities\
    \ and\nphysical things such as sensors in the previous decade to\nget the highest\
    \ growth rate target. When the Internet func-\ntionalities and material objects\
    \ known as “things” are com-\nbined, it made a new concept of research named the\n\
    “Internet of Things” (IoT). The structure of IoT is built upon\nthe three layers.\
    \ The three layers are (1) perception layer, (2)\nnetwork layer, and (3) application\
    \ layer. The perception\nlayer has sensing ability; the network layer is used\
    \ to send\ndata or as a data transfer, and the application layer stores\nthe data\
    \ and performs data manipulation.\nOur primary research topic is a computer network\
    \ in\nagriculture and IoT. The ﬁrst word, “Internet,” is used to\nget all the\
    \ Internet features and functionalities.\n2.4.2. Computer Network Functionalities\
    \ in Agriculture:\n(1) Perception Layer. As we mentioned earlier, this layer has\n\
    sensing ability, which means a wireless sensor node is used,\nand its processing\
    \ module is known as microcontroller unit\n(MCU). One or maybe more external or\
    \ embedded digital or\nApplication\nlayer\nData processing\nlayer\nNetwork layer\n\
    Application\nProcessing unit\nCPU\nGateways\nSensors\nSensing layer\nFigure 3:\
    \ IoT architecture.\n8\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nanalog device\
    \ for sensing is used along with this node. The\nnext step is to get control of\
    \ identifying monitoring and agri-\nculture tracking during production. To get\
    \ the control\nmechanism during the show, WSN is used for logistics and\nstorage\
    \ control facilities and performed monitoring.\n(2) Network Layer. As the name\
    \ shows, the network layer\ncan connect neighboring nodes for communication, interact\n\
    with the environment or physical objects through WSN, and\nbuild a network for\
    \ data forwarding to get valuable informa-\ntion for further analysis. Communication\
    \ protocols facilitate\nnetwork functionalities and act as the bridge between\
    \ end\nnodes and Internet gateways. Standard protocols used in this\nstep are\
    \ ISA100.11a, Zigbee, Sigfox, one-NET, and wireless\nHART [63].\n(3) Application\
    \ Layer. As we know globally, billions of sys-\ntems are available and provide\
    \ Internet access and function-\nality control; identiﬁcation is necessary. To\
    \ access Internet\nmobility, we use IPv6 to handle identiﬁcation problems. This\n\
    layer has a challenging responsibility because devices’\nuniqueness is identiﬁed\
    \ at this layer. Another challenge is\nheterogeneity, which means it should achieve\
    \ diversity in\ndiﬀerent machines, either they are compatible with another\ndevice\
    \ or control power related to computing and adjust to\nthe environment. To handle\
    \ the identiﬁcation challenges,\nIPv6 supplementary uses context-aware addresses\
    \ and\nmeta-data. One software layer is used between the applica-\ntion layer\
    \ and the primary device. This software layer is mid-\ndleware and has a particular\
    \ scope in the new service\ndevelopment. Using this middleware mechanism, we get\n\
    the combined functionalities of the sensor network and\nservice-oriented architecture\
    \ (SOA) infrastructure.\n2.5. Computer Network Protocol Analysis in Agriculture.\n\
    Interconnected services in wireless technology are mainly\nsplit into six categories.\
    \ These categories are Global System\nfor Mobile Communication (GSM), Wireless\
    \ Personal Area\nNetwork\n(WPAN),\nWireless\nRegional\nArea\nNetwork\n(WRAN),\
    \ Mesh, Point-2-Point (P2P), and Low Power Wide\nArea Network (LPWAN). The purpose\
    \ of highlighting the\nwireless technology categories in the analysis section\
    \ is to\ncompare them and measure their functionality levels.\nReaders can select\
    \ the appropriate protocol for agriculture\nresearch and projects by comparing\
    \ and analyzing this\nreview paper. They can increase the growth rate, as we men-\n\
    tioned earlier. This wireless interconnectivity provides a\nwide bandwidth range\
    \ for an extensive communication\nrange. It can perform security measures and\
    \ less power con-\nsumption. Our research focus is network protocols in agri-\n\
    culture, so we provide a summarized protocol comparison\nin Table 3 as our research\
    \ ﬁnding. These protocols are used\nin the agriculture ﬁeld with speciﬁc requirements.\
    \ Through\nour research ﬁndings, readers can easily select proper com-\nputer\
    \ network protocols with high eﬃciency and compatibil-\nity with the device. However,\
    \ the comparison of IoT\nprotocols is also shown in Table 4.\nIn agriculture,\
    \ two phenomena work as vital entity in\nany project or research named (1) humidity\
    \ and (2) temper-\nature. Like temperature, humidity can irrigate the system\n\
    and wireless nodes (radio wave propagation). At tempera-\ntures like 270C to 600C,\
    \ received signals have some\nunwanted data. This is a severe issue in the development\
    \ of\nagriculture while using the wireless transceiver, their num-\nber of nodes,\
    \ and the distance among the used nodes.\n2.6. Research Approach. Climate changes\
    \ are usually consid-\nered an initial parameter to measure the changes and check\n\
    the soil condition. We apply diﬀerent sensors (more than\none) to get these measurements\
    \ in the soil. These sensors\ngenerate the data that guides us in many directions,\
    \ which\nleads us towards the higher growth of crops. For example,\nHTTP\nClient-server\
    \ communication\nSecure connection\nData encryption to perform secure transmission\n\
    Transmits binary data and voice and audio\nSorting email data\nFile transmission\n\

    \ is needed for a speciﬁc plant? How do we\npreserve crops from water (a high\
    \ water level is dangerous\nfor some crops; it varies from crop to crop)? What\
    \ is the\nimpact of extra irrigation on the earth’s level? What is the\natmosphere\
    \ condition? Some researchers use additional\noptical sensors to map the ground’s\
    \ situation and sense the\nremote temperature. Our integration of interconnectivity\
    \ of\nnetwork protocol can cover the larger area of the ﬁeld, and\nthrough sensing\
    \ devices, we can get more accurate condi-\ntions related to soil and weather.\
    \ With the help of this pre-\ncise information usage, we can increase the growth\
    \ rate of\ncrops. Another reason to use wireless network protocol sen-\nsors is\
    \ that they are available at reasonable prices, which\nmeans we have less impact\
    \ on cost. It allows researchers to\nTable 3: Comparison of computer network protocols\

    \ and Mobile Computing\nconnect end devices more sophisticatedly and have higher\n\
    computational capabilities with sensor incorporation. The\nconnectivity of nodes\
    \ will increase the processing. Some\nresearchers use camera devices to get images\
    \ of the crop.\nUsing these images, they implement diﬀerent image process-\ning\
    \ algorithms and predict the attack of insects.\n2.7. Technologies Used in Agriculture\n\
    2.7.1. Sensors. Sensors are intelligent devices designed to get\nspeciﬁc information\
    \ from humans or the environment.\nThese sensors are attached or deployed on the\
    \ ground or\nin the inner soil in agriculture. After deploying the sensor,\nthe\
    \ next challenge is to get a wide range of sensors to cover\nthe maximum area\
    \ of sensors. A wide range can reduce the\noverall deployment cost because we\
    \ can cover a larger area\nof any ﬁeld. But the issue is that most organizations\
    \ focus\non the data only and ignore the range parameters. IoT sen-\nsor nodes\
    \ capture data from the farming environment, such\nas soil moisture, air humidity,\
    \ temperature, soil nutrient\ncomponents, pest images, and water quality, and\
    \ then send\nit to IoT backhaul devices. IoT sensor nodes can be deployed\nas\
    \ RFDs (reduced-function devices), which only connect\nwith FFDs (full-function\
    \ devices), depending on the opera-\ntional purpose and installation location.\
    \ Farmers can use\nsmart mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to\n\
    access real-time agricultural data (soil and plant condition,\nirrigation, fertilization\
    \ [65].\n2.7.2. Satellites. Satellites are another artiﬁcial medium\nthrough which\
    \ we can get remote data to achieve smart\nfarming. Foreign countries are making\
    \ a lot of investments\nin getting satellite data, for example, “GeoEye-1 system”,\n\
    “European Sentinel 2 Satellites”, “American Landsat Satel-\nlite,” and “WorldView3.”\
    \ Asian countries do not have any\nsuccess stories about satellites to get information\
    \ about ﬁeld\nor weather data. The only solution is to use ground-level\nsensors\
    \ and their interconnectivity. It is reasonable to claim\nthat precision agriculture,\
    \ which involves gathering and uti-\nlizing data about crops, soil, and weather\
    \ conditions via\nremote sensing, signiﬁcantly reduces human eﬀort in farm\nand\
    \ ﬁeld management in North America. With a market\nvalue of $6,215.9 million in\
    \ 2021 (compared to $2,792.3 mil-\nlion in Europe), the area had the most signiﬁcant\
    \ tech mar-\nket value globally.\n2.7.3. Aircraft Systems. The distance is too\
    \ long to get accu-\nrate information and point at the target through satellite.\n\
    The minimum length is 700 kilometers, measured between\nthe satellite and the\
    \ soil. To overcome the distance issue, air-\ncraft systems are used. The minimum\
    \ distance between the\naircraft and the soil is 100 meters. In Spain, 120 meters\
    \ is\nconsidered the legal distance of an aircraft system. Com-\nmonly two aircraft\
    \ systems are used. The ﬁrst is the\n“unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),” and the\
    \ second is the\n“remotely piloted aircraft (RPA).” Aircraft systems have\nimportance\
    \ because they can work where conventional\nground vehicles cannot perform their\
    \ duties. UAV has more\nbeneﬁts in precision agriculture.\n2.7.4. Proximal Sensing.\
    \ Sensors are known as proximal\nsensing when information is gathered from the\
    \ platform\nbased on the ground. In other words, ground-based plate\nforms are\
    \ proximal sensing. “Ground vehicles” also work\nas proximal sensing because these\
    \ vehicles are the nearest\nto the crop. They can get more accurate crop data\
    \ and more\nfeasible per meter crop samples. They can also solve the lim-\nitation\
    \ problems of sensor implementation. But they can\ndetect the weather conditions,\
    \ for example, high tempera-\nture and appropriate sunlight needed for the speciﬁc\
    \ crop.\nAircraft systems cannot perform soil scouting and crop anal-\nysis. Most\
    \ of the research progress in achieving the robots’\ntilling, seeding, pest control,\
    \ ﬁeld scout, transplanting, soil\nanalysis, and crop harvesting.\n2.7.5. Data\
    \ Gathering. The traditional farming mechanisms\ndiﬀer from the latest farming\
    \ techniques because they can-\nnot gather crop data. All crop decisions are taken\
    \ by the\nvisual assessment done by the farmer’s eye. Modern technol-\nogy assesses\
    \ and generates production decisions by using\nquantitative data. If we can compromise\
    \ on the cost, we\ncan hybridize two or more technologies and techniques for\n\
    more accurate data and gain a broader range of data. For\nexample, sensors can\
    \ perform crop data acquisition, and air-\ncraft systems can be used for other\
    \ crop-related functions.\n2.7.6. Data Representation. Crop data is usually represented\n\
    in a coherent, understandable composition for the end-\nusers. The simplest way\
    \ to show the “homogeneous zone”\nand mapping is maps format in agriculture. In\
    \ agriculture,\nmaps represent larger areas and are used in the design, mak-\n\
    ing questions to answer them. We can add or be interested\nin several parameters\
    \ to the plan. Many software is used to\ngenerate a map of a speciﬁc area. We\
    \ can also add coordi-\nnates to the map. The “Local Tangent Plane” system can\n\
    do this and provide Euclidean geometry features. Another\nfeature, the name grid,\
    \ is used in the map representation to\nshow the systematic. By using it, more\
    \ accurate information\ncan be produced.\n2.7.7. Software. “Geographic Information\
    \ Systems (GIS)” is\nused to get the practical answers and display this informa-\n\
    tion into map representation (as we mention in the data rep-\nresentation section).\
    \ This information manages all the ﬁelds.\nGIS acts as a “computer-based” tool.\
    \ Using this tool, we can\nget, manipulate, analyze, and store ﬁeld information.\
    \ As we\nmentioned earlier, “precision agriculture” has a broader\nscope; a unique\
    \ software is designed to get the information\nabout precision agriculture known\
    \ as “Filed Level Geo-\ngraphic Information System (FIS).” The drawback of this\n\
    software is that it can operate only on previous operating\nsystems like Windows\
    \ NT, 98, and 95. Some updating is\ndone in FIS to provide the information for\
    \ management\npurposes. The updated version is the “Farm Management\nInformation\
    \ System (FMIS).” A tool to help farmers manage\ntheir farms more successfully\
    \ and eﬃciently is the FMIS. To\ncultivate the farm, a system called FMIS deals\
    \ with the accu-\nracy of data, optimization of the use of resources, and proce-\n\
    dures. FMIS aims to minimize the production cost, maintain\n11\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nagriculture standards, maximize production quality, and\n\
    provide accurate decisions. Another advantage of this soft-\nware is that we automate\
    \ the whole data acquisition process.\nWe can monitor the entire process, plan\
    \ better, and make\naccurate decisions according to the situation. Some software\n\
    is so intelligently designed that they produce proper map\nrepresentation and\
    \ a decision-based model, which means\nbeginners can also make the appropriate\
    \ decision. Further-\nmore, this software also provides information about the\n\
    weather through which risk levels will be minimized.\n2.7.8. Actuation. Actuation\
    \ is the situation in which an exe-\ncutable decision is made after obtaining\
    \ the crop’s appropri-\nate information. The executable decisions mean farmers\
    \ can\nuse the advanced tools and equipment; more spray medicine\ncan be used\
    \ to prevent insects’ crops from being attacked\nafter gathering computerized\
    \ information from the control\nunit. Actuation can increase the production proﬁt\
    \ and\nreduce the impact on the environment. The actuation can\nincrease the production\
    \ rate by 35% in one ﬁeld or farm.\nSo now, we can roughly measure or assume that\
    \ the whole\nprocess positively impacts crop growth rate when we gather\nit from\
    \ area to ﬁeld.\n2.7.9. The Technology of Swath Control. Swath control can\nhandle\
    \ the overlapping issues in the area mapping. With\nthe swath control, all the\
    \ guidelines will lead to how to invest\nin farming. A farmer can increase his\
    \ farming capabilities\nwith swath size controlling through this approach. The\n\
    ﬁeld’s size and shape can change the need for fertilization\nand seeding process\
    \ and may cause irregulating applications.\nRadio frequency energy harvesting\
    \ technique is also used in\nthe agriculture domain [66].\n2.7.10. Controlling\
    \ and Monitoring via Smart Devices or\nSmartphones. Smartphones have become a\
    \ necessary part\nof our lives and played an essential role in controlling and\n\
    monitoring our daily life tasks. Researchers try to use smart\ndevices in agriculture,\
    \ especially smartphones, to manage\nand monitor purposes. An application is installed\
    \ on the\nsmartphone to control his irrigation system. Smartphones\nalready have\
    \ weather condition checking applications to\nreduce the cost of weather detection\
    \ sensors. But still, some\nsensors are required because they are not embedded\
    \ in\nsmartphones. For example, a moisture checking sensor is\nstill needed to\
    \ get the soil moisture level data. We can con-\ntrol the amount of water with\
    \ moisture information and\ndecide accordingly.\n2.8. Network Challenges in Agriculture.\
    \ In agriculture,\nmainly farming, various challenges arise. We discuss these\n\
    challenges step by step and according to their categories.\n2.8.1. Hardware. Hardware\
    \ can be directly exposed to the\nperception layer due to a challenging environment.\
    \ A chal-\nlenging environment can cover many factors like high tem-\nperature,\
    \ extreme humidity, high radiations of solar,\nincreased rain, earth vibration\
    \ in an earthquake, and strong\nair (winds) that can destroy the capability, functionality,\
    \ and\nhardware structure.\nAnother hardware factor is batteries used as power\n\
    resources; their functionalities will not be the same for long\nperiods. As a\
    \ result, substantial and long-term batteries\nand appropriate tools for programming\
    \ act as mandatory.\nAny resulting program or structure and replacement of bat-\n\
    teries will also increase the cost and the time factor. As well,\nthe disconnectivity\
    \ of interconnected devices will lead to\ndata loss. Devices sometimes lack tamper-resistant\
    \ enclo-\nsures since doing so would increase their cost. The absence\nof tamper-resistant\
    \ boxes leaves the system vulnerable to\ninteractions with outside forces, including\
    \ humans, animals,\nand farm machinery. The system integrity may be compro-\n\
    mised if a farm worker or wild animal accidentally bumps\nagainst a sensor, displacing\
    \ or removing the object from its\noriginal position. A tractor or other farm\
    \ equipment might\nstrike the device, resulting in either temporary or permanent\n\
    physical damage, data corruption, data loss, or device\ndamage.\n2.8.2. Interoperability.\
    \ In agriculture or food industries,\ninfrastructure aims to exchange goods, supply\
    \ globally, and\noptimize production. The interconnectivity of devices will\n\
    gradually transform business and make product or food ﬂow\ncontinuous with real-time\
    \ visibility. With the interconnec-\ntivity of computer protocols, we can get\
    \ high-quality product\ndata, handle computational process and storage issues,\
    \ and\nget high quality. It is a deliberate alteration of the resources\nof an\
    \ autonomous system. Robotics, autonomous tractors,\nand unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) are precision agricul-\ntural technologies that are becoming more common,\
    \ espe-\ncially on big farms. Sensors, cameras, GPS, maps, and\nremote-control\
    \ systems are just a few of the aspects that\nmake this equipment function. The\
    \ autonomous system\nmay operate incorrectly or experience/cause mishaps if an\n\
    adversary alters one or more components. Failures might\ncause signiﬁcant losses\
    \ due to poor soil or crop manage-\nment, destruction of crops, structures, machinery,\
    \ and\nequipment, or even the autonomous tractor itself.\n2.8.3. Networking. The\
    \ network layer has an impact on the\nenvironmental characteristics. In agriculture,\
    \ wireless com-\nmunication is preferable because it can reduce the wire cost.\n\
    Using multipath propagation’s eﬀect, we can increase the\nlink quality level.\
    \ Like hardware, the network is also aﬀected\nby humidity, high temperature, and\
    \ diﬀerent obstacles exist-\ning in the space. So, it is a big challenge to transfer\
    \ the data\ninto its original shape in this environment’s rural behavior.\n2.8.4.\
    \ Security. Your data sent through the computer net-\nwork protocol should be\
    \ secure from external threats or\nattacks. When paired with Internet connectivity,\
    \ storage,\nadministration, and data processing create a slew of diﬃcul-\nties\
    \ and security risks. When data transfer occurs through\nthe interconnectivity\
    \ of devices, conﬁdentiality, security,\nstakeholder privacy, and authentication\
    \ are the primary con-\ncerns. The perception layer sends the protected data to\
    \ the\nnetwork layer (secure data aggregation), and then this data\naccessible\
    \ can be modiﬁed in the application layer. Hard-\nware physical security and acquisition\
    \ of information are\n12\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\ninvolved\
    \ in the perception layer. We can summarize the\nsecurity into three further requirements:\
    \ (1) access control,\n(2) conﬁdentiality, and (3) authentication. As we know,\n\
    devices are deployed in open areas of agriculture, which\nmeans machines are doing\
    \ their functionalities for a long\ntime without any surveillance. Other concerns\
    \ are attached\nto the security, such as modiﬁcation of tag frequency, tag\nblocker\
    \ usage, encryption, tag destruction policies, and jam-\nming. When we talk about\
    \ intelligent device restrictions,\nmany things are involved with hardware restrictions,\
    \ such\nas key distribution and routing, security, intrusion detection\nmechanisms,\
    \ and encryption algorithms. Other security\nthreats are tempering, replay attacks,\
    \ cheating, and wiretap-\nping. For example, routing attacks change network paths\
    \ to\ngain traﬃc control. Malicious nodes on IoT networks may\nattempt to change\
    \ routing pathways while data is being sent.\nAttacks like wormholes and sinkholes\
    \ might compromise\nthe communication network and gain unwanted access.\n2.8.5.\
    \ Stack. Middleware is used between the two layers (net-\nwork and application).\
    \ The responsibility of middleware is\nto act as an interface and is responsible\
    \ for communication\nand data processing. Threats can be handled at the network\n\
    layer by detecting intrusion, authentication, negotiation\nmechanisms, authentication,\
    \ negotiation mechanisms, and\nkey management. The application layer exists when\
    \ data\nstream ﬂow ends. In other words, the nearest to the cloud\nis the application\
    \ layer. Here, control structures are also\nrequired to access the management\
    \ rights and data adminis-\ntration ownership.\n2.8.6. Agriculture Potential Points.\
    \ Many services and appli-\ncations emerge with computer network protocols and\
    \ agri-\nculture,\ngaining\npopularity\nin\nrecent\nresearch.\nMany\nresearchers\
    \ are studying a system or device heterogeneity\nand implementing device integrations.\
    \ In a diﬀerent busi-\nness process, optimization analytics deals with big data.\n\
    Our government is trying to increase food production with\nfood quality and enhance\
    \ meat production (which can be\ndone only with the care of animals with each\
    \ animal’s up-\nto-date and accurate data). The meat and food production\nincrement\
    \ can increase the consumer’s request/demand.\nThe interconnectivity of devices\
    \ in the agriculture ﬁeld can\nimprove and have the ability to increase the production\n\
    cycle. It means that the agriculture ﬁeld has a secure future\nin the income sector,\
    \ and this ﬁeld has a higher impact on\nany country’s economic rate. Figure 5\
    \ shows the network\nchallenges in agriculture.\n2.9. Discussion and Future Direction.\
    \ We focused on three\nquestions in this study, addressed at the outset. As a\
    \ result,\nvarious protocols, such as SSL, HTTP, and ARP, have been\ndiscussed\
    \ in the literature. On the other hand, SSL estab-\nlishes a secure connection\
    \ and transmits data. This may be\naccomplished by using an encryption mechanism\
    \ that\nensures the security of user authentication, data, and infor-\nmation\
    \ security. The server/client connection is established\nthrough HTTP as well.\
    \ The ARP protocol is used to keep\nthe routing table updated so that linked devices\
    \ can be\nreconﬁgured. In addition, choosing the right IoT protocol\nfor your\
    \ next IoT project is crucial. As a result, this article\nanalyzes IoT protocols\
    \ and provides a concise overview of\nthe advantages and disadvantages of each\
    \ primary standard.\nDevelopers may use Nabto Edge to build Constrained Appli-\n\
    cation Protocol (CoAP) request/response clients. It does,\nhowever, circumvent\
    \ either peer’s ﬁrewall setups. This dra-\nmatically boosts the message’s credibility.\
    \ Anonymity is also\nassured out of the box since Nabto Edge bundles CoAP with\n\
    authentication, encryption, and other features. Nabto+CoAP\nis superior in terms\
    \ of latency, messaging type, built-in secu-\nrity, ease of development, and encryption.\
    \ At the same time,\nit is limited in terms of lightweight. MQTT, on the other\n\
    hand, is lightweight and ideal for low-power and compact\ndevices. Finally, the\
    \ obstacles in agricultural networks were\nhighlighted, which helped the reader\
    \ and developer grasp\nthe issues of farm networks when designing IoT applications\n\
    for agriculture. In the future, we will discuss how to make\nNabto+CoAP lightweight\
    \ and ideal for low-power device\ncompared to MQTT. What kind of parameter may\
    \ be\nimproved upon or changed to make Nabto+CoAP optimal\nand lightweight?\n\
    3. Conclusion\nIn this research, all the essential concepts of computer network\n\
    (CN) protocols are discussed in precise form. Although many\nresearch works are\
    \ done in agriculture, no one provides the\nbest protocol mechanism for speciﬁc\
    \ scenarios and require-\nments. Initially, the paper details the utilization\
    \ of CN proto-\ncols in agricultures in literature. After describing other CN\n\
    protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.), the suggested article\npointed out that TCP\
    \ is superior since it is more eﬀective in\nterms of a three-way handshake, which\
    \ is a crucial require-\nment for networks. We have also performed CN protocol\n\

    \ Mobile Computing\nanalysis related to agriculture. Based on characteristics\
    \ such as\nlatency, messaging type, built-in security, ease to build on, and\n\
    encryption, we determined that Nabto+CoAP is far superior,\nalthough it is not\
    \ lightweight. MQTT, on the other hand, is\nlightweight and suitable for small\
    \ and low-powered devices.\nSimilarly, several network diﬃculties are also covered\
    \ in this\nstudy to provide readers a thorough understanding of them\nwhile considering\
    \ network agriculture. Agriculture is an open\nﬁeld environment, and temperature\
    \ and humidity can change\nour signal values so that sensors can generate false\
    \ output due\nto high temperature and humidity levels. As we know, many\nfoods\
    \ are destroyed due to excess rain. Our research ﬁndings\nexplain the Internet’s\
    \ existence in the agriculture ﬁeld and\nthe whole mechanism and enhancement of\
    \ growth rate with\ncollaboration.\nData Availability\nNo data were used.\nConflicts\

    In recent years, underwater visible light communication (UVLC) has become a potential
    wireless carrier candidate for signal transmission in highly critical, unknown,
    and acrimonious water mediums such as oceans. Unfortunately, the oceans are the
    least explored reservoirs in oceanogeographical history. However, natural disasters
    have aroused significant interest in observing and monitoring oceanic environments
    for the last couple of decades. Therefore, UVLC has drawn attention as a reliable
    digital carrier and claims a futuristic optical media in the wireless communication
    domain. Counterparts of traditional communications, the green, clean, and safe
    UVLC support high capacity data-rate and bandwidth with minimal delay. Nevertheless,
    the deployment of UVLC is challenging rather than terrestrial basis communication
    over long ranges. In addition, UVLC systems have severe signal attenuation and
    strong turbulence channel conditions. Due to the fact that, this study provides
    an exhaustive and comprehensive survey of recent advancements in UVLC implementations
    to cope with the optical signal propagation issues. In this regard, a wide detailed
    summary and future perspectives of underwater optical signaling towards 5G and
    beyond (5GB) networks along with the current project schemes, channel impairments,
    various optical signal modulation techniques, underwater sensor network (UWSN)
    architectures with energy harvesting approaches, hybrid communication possibilities,
    and advancements of Internet of underwater things (IoUTs) are concluded in this
    research. An overview of RF-VLC hybrid communication system where the oceanographic

    evolution of underwater visible light communication (UVLC) towards the next-generation
    wireless network 5G and 5G beyond (5GB) vision would have an enhancement in overall
    system performance while satisfying the current requirements. From the perspective
    of VLC, data transmission is highly secure with very minimal interception. The
    5GB is an advanced wireless communication networking approach that provides a
    downlink data rate of more than 1Gbps. Moreover, the drawback in 5GB is the high
    cost of infrastructural development [1]. On the other hand, the ongoing transition
    of VLC across the 6G wireless network has more eminence over 5G network such as
    enhanced machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable & low-latency communication
    (uRLLC) [2]. However, a promising VLC technology has no interference as RF communication
    system does. Therefore, VLC has acceptability of benefits to deploy, where the
    RF wireless networks are less implemented such as medical fields, oil rigs and
    gas plants, nuclear power plants (NPPs), underwater communication and further
    numerous applications [3]. As the oceans are mysterious water reservoirs that
    need to be explored through various signal processing techniques and applications
    such as undersea monitoring, observing marine life, detecting oil and natural
    gas sources, early warning of tsunamis, floods, and underwater location coordinates
    for navigation purposes [4]. Under these conditions, underwater wireless communication
    (UWC) has become an essential approach to exploring undersea sectors and plays
    a significant role in order to provide the natural phenomenal underwater activities.
    The state-of-the-art UWC in coastal securities, fishing farms, marine transportation,
    and pollution control have been implemented for several decades [5]. UWC networks
    are necessarily vital approaches in inaccessible and unmanageable regions of the
    deep ocean, which are highly sought-after research areas among scientists, researchers,
    and academics. A comprehensive and detailed discussion on UWC as a potential method
    of wireless signal transmission is recorded as in [5]–[9]. In addition, the proposed
    deployable underwater communication technologies in existing surveys support the
    collection of the oceanographic data, observation of water pollution, undersea
    monitoring, immediate warning of floods & natural disasters, and the phenomena
    of melting ice sheets due to global warming caused by rising ocean levels are
    also discussed in [9]. Recent studies encourage exploring the oceanic environment
    by deploying UWC technologies such as electromagnetic waves (EM) in terms of RF,
    acoustic, and optical waves propagation. As RF waves highly attenuate by the seawater
    and change the properties conductor to dielectric at 250GHz frequency ranges [10].
    Therefore, RF carriers are not feasible and cover short ranges of communication
    in an aquatic medium. As claimed by the existing underwater architectural system
    in literature, the frequency ranges of EM waves in underwater propagation is extremely
    low between 30−300Hz for military applications [11]. A large sized antenna is
    required in UWRF signaling for better performance in underwater mediums [12].
    Similarly, RF waves are also operated as ultra-low frequencies (ULF) to proceed
    with low attenuation but at a very high budget and at a low data rate. it provides
    low data rates [13]. Most recently, a joint technical WMO-IOC Commission for Oceanography
    and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) as an observing network of the Global Ocean Observing
    System (GOOS) has proposed a high-frequency radar network (HFR) in 2017s [14].
    In [14], the proposed communication system has drawn an attention of HFR system,
    that is continuously observed and map of ocean currents up to 200km offshore site
    in the coastal area. It supports detecting the floating objects on the sea surface,
    such as fishing ships, buoys, floating nodes, boats, yachts, etc., and extremely
    helpful for rescue operations. In the HFR networking system, the signal propagation
    is held from the radar and the signal reception by the conduction ocean waves,
    measuring the Doppler shift and giving direction and velocity. A pictorial view
    is depicted the function of HFR by Fig.16. FIGURE 1. An overview of RF-VLC hybrid
    communication system where the oceanographic data collects by distinct types of
    underwater sensor network nodes architecture (1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D types of UWSNs
    architecture). The extracted data has been transferred to the offshore station
    for further analysis. In this type of scenario, the different internet of underwater
    things (IoUT) are included to communicate with each other by utilizing the latest
    wireless network or beyond. As depicted, the floating nodes collect the information
    along with the network nodes at the specified depth in the underwater medium.

    16. A hieroglyphic overview of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) in diversified
    possible underwater applications. Each Internet-connected tool functioned differently
    for a specific purpose. As floating nodes, sea gliders, Unmanned underwater vehicles
    (UUVs), Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are used for long-range communication,
    localization, bathymetric data-collection, and real-time monitoring. On the other
    hand, the high-frequency radar, a floating drifter, geographical satellite, surface
    floating gliders, and Tsunami buoy are used for continuously observation and mapping
    ocean currents, oceanographic imaging and geographical mapping, and early detection
    warning of the tsunami and tectonic plates movement. Moreover, the clod cards
    and animal telemetry are usable for studying the underwater flow pattern and observation
    of the marine environment. Show All At a glance, EM waves were initially used
    as low-frequency ranges to transmit signals on terrestrial-based communication
    for reliable communication to achieve high bandwidth. Though, in an underwater
    environment, RF waves propagate differently compared to terrestrial-based signaling
    and totally depend on water mediums. The advantageous feature of RF waves propagate
    with high velocity (similar to the optical waves) provide efficient communication
    among the network nodes. Underwater wireless RF (UWRF) experiences signal fading
    and easily attenuates over very short distances in underwater. It is challenging
    to transmit signals through RF waves in a highly turbid water medium. An impressive
    survey work is proposed on UWRF based communication in seawater, where the authors
    widely discussed the recent advances of RF waves for coastal and military applications
    [11]. Besides UWRF, the acoustic waves are received the utmost interest in signal
    propagation over long distances in underwater medium with the limited bandwidth
    [15]. The traditional acoustic wireless carriers propagate over long distances
    with a low speed of approximately 1500m/s , and a meager data rate [12]. Generally,
    acoustic waves propagation speed is influenced by channel impairments. Conversely,
    the speed of acoustic waves increases tremendously due to fluctuation of the temperature
    and salinity of the water [8]. The affecting factors such as scattering, reflection,
    and absorption by suspended particles corrupt acoustic signals. Therefore, the
    main concern of UWC is the establishment and architectural design of underwater
    sensor networks (UWSNs) for obtaining proper communication among nodes. An exhaustively
    detailed review study of UWSN is summarized in [16]. Additionally, the shipbuilding
    industries are also increasingly interested in widespread communication through
    sensor network architectures. The possible UWSNs applications are over-viewed
    in various underwater applications such as observing strong influences of the
    aqueous medium, undersea nutrient production, natural oil retrieval, underwater
    transportation, and the impact of water climate regulation on ecological system
    [17]. In these corresponding applications, the sensor nodes such as autonomous
    underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) support
    the data collection with the onshore nodes (sub-station) [18]. The cluster of
    underwater sensor networks is depicted in Fig.1, Fig.14 and sensor network architecture
    in Fig.16. Due to the limited data rate and bandwidth of UWRF and acoustic waves,
    an alternative optical signaling approach has become the most significant and
    reliable wireless carrier candidate for digital signaling in underwater [19].
    For instance, in the first stage of optical signaling, fire, fire-smoke, fire
    beacons, torches, and reflecting sunlight were introduced. In the starting phase
    of optical signaling about 800 BC, the ancient Romans and Greeks used to transmit
    optical signals for communication purposes over long ranges [20]. During 1880s,
    the optical wave-based telephone (photophone) was invented by the famous scientist
    Alexander Graham Bell for signal transmission over 210m [21]. In this photophone,
    a parabolic mirror with a selenium cell was used as an optical signal receiver.
    In the end of the 19 th century, the continuous development of optical signaling,
    Heliographs were firstly proposed to deliver messages through optical waves in
    the battlefield for military applications [22]. Generally, the heliographs were
    assembled with a dual-layer of mirrors and directly used to control the light
    beam propagation. For further development of optical communication, lasers were
    introduced as an alternative for signal transmission to serve wireless carrier
    over long distances [12]. On the other hand, the demand for ocean exploration
    is hiking up for a couple of decades. For instance, a real-time data streaming
    fiber optics signaling is applicable for several underwater applications and proposed
    during 1970s [23]. However, the main drawback of fiber optics is highly cost setups
    and unpleasant for undersea species. Moreover, in connection with the limited
    propagation coverage and high attenuation, underwater signaling is highly challenging
    to fill the gap of the desired communication. For consistent development of optical
    signaling, He-Ne laser ( λ =632.8nm) was investigated as an optical signal carrier
    over the 30 – 40km range during 1960s [23]. In the early ages of laser development,
    the very initial foundational laser link was established to control commercial
    traffic in Japan by Nippon Electric Company during 1970s [21]. This deployed laser
    link was firstly used for signal transmission over 14 km. Later on, full-duplex
    communication Free Space Optics (FSO) enabled He-Ne laser at 0.6325μm was introduced
    for communication between the cities of Yokohama and Tamagawa in Japan [21], [23].
    To keep evolution going, FSO communication technology was proposed to transmit
    high data-rate signals with minimal delay over long distances among communication
    nodes, which is extensively discussed in [12] and [24]. Later, in the end of the
    20 th century, the numerous developments have been documented for optical signaling.
    Kahn and Barry extended Gfeller and Bapst’s work, where they demonstrated a laser
    of wavelength 780 – 950nm with high data rates 50 – 70Mbps [21], [25] [26]. In
    laser counterparts, the implementation of Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in VLC
    are widely used as transmitters through an illumination nature that provides an
    ultrahigh bandwidth to achieve a high data rate. For optical signal transmission
    and receiving, LDs and LEDs are the potential tools and widely use in optical
    communication over very short, short, medium and long ranges as per the requirement
    of the applications [27]. Therefore, these LEDs are considered the main sources
    of optical signal contributors. Moreover, the various light sources, photosensors
    transmit and receive optical signals such as a laser diode (LDs), Avalanche photodiode
    (APD), p-n diode, etc. The consumption of LED seems to be a novel approach cause
    of its dual nature. LED turn-on and turn-off ability turns a new communication
    paradigm formally known as the visible light communication system. Although, the
    invention of LEDs received a remarkable extent of research for high data transmission
    of its dual nature as illumination and signal carrier [28]. The illumination phenomenon
    occurs based on the visible light wave spectrum at the wavelength 380 – 750nm,
    which is used as a transmitter and an image sensor at the receiver end [29]. Historically,
    VLC was proposed by the Visible Light Communications Consortium Japan (VLCCJ),
    Japan Electronics & Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) CP-1221,
    and CP-1222 during 2003s to 2007s [21]. For continuous development of VLC, the
    Visible Light Communications Associations (VLCA) was established in Japan for
    further standardization [30]. As Japan Traffic Management Technology Association
    (JTMTA) and VLCC conducted an experiment where they achieved 4800 kbps data rate
    over a distance of 300m. Overall, Japan had contributed the initiatives for the
    development of products based on VLC signal modulated technologies. Additionally,
    in 2012s, Casio Japan developed the new Apple application “Picapicamera” for users
    where the images could be sent instantly through VLC technology [27]. In contrast,
    the modulation schemes and dimming phenomenon supports possible VLC communication
    that has been widely investigated by IEEE 802.15.7 standard [31]. The optical
    wireless communication (OWC) IEEE 802.15.7r1 standardization is used for short-range
    communication as VLC implementation [32]. The new era of optical communication
    has become a more significant trade for digital wireless signaling media with
    the integration of different techniques, which are mentioned in Table 1. Subsequently,
    the optical camera communications (OCC) system is used as image sensors at the
    receiver end to provide triple functions simultaneously, i.e., illumination, data
    transmission, and wireless energy transfer [20]. TABLE 1 An Overview of the Different
    Optical Communication Technologies Along With the Description of Transceivers
    are Used. In Addition, the Distinct Characteristics and the Possible Applications
    of an Individual Technique are Also Summarized TABLE 2 The Description of Acronyms
    and Notations are Used in This Study TABLE 3 Nomenclature and Description of Acronyms
    are Used in This Research All the above matter facts for real-time data streaming
    and high bandwidth signal propagation approaches are needed. Therefore, underwater
    optical wireless communication (UWOC) in terms of visible light, particularly
    the blue-green spectrum of wavelength (450–532)nm [20], has been chosen and is
    widely used for high data transmission underwater communication. In the UWOC,
    the hydrological optical beam experiences signal absorption due to electron transition
    and converted into another form of energy. It is noticeable that water offers
    transparency with blue-green light spectrum [20] rather than with other light
    spectrum wavelengths. Moreover, the ocean water offers less attenuation for the
    blue light spectrum while the green light spectrum is attenuated by coastal water
    [33]. The optical signal attenuation depends on the inherent optical properties
    (IOPs), and apparent optical properties (AOPs) of water medium [34]. Additionally,
    the physio-chemical properties of the water channel supports fading contribution
    due to absorption, optical scattering, and reflection caused by turbidity, pressure,
    temperature, and existing suspended material within the water environment [35].
    As a result, underwater visible light communication (UVLC) has become a complementary
    approach compared to traditional acoustic communication in high data rates ranging
    from hundred Mbps to Gbps over short range applications. Even UVLC has received
    superiority over traditional underwater acoustic and EM signaling. As compared
    to the existing traditional UWC techniques, UVLC technology has advantages in
    harsh environments as it is handy to use, easy to deploy with low cost, and highly
    qualitative communication media [36]. A broad detailed scenario of UVLC and connecting
    nodes optically in an underwater environment is depicted in Fig.1. Underwater
    signaling is entirely different from the terrestrial radio environment due to
    its energy costs and signal propagation phenomena. As a result, it is challenging
    to provide energy to power-hungry devices in underwater mediums. To cope with
    the energy harvesting (EH) issues, Simultaneously Wireless Information and Power
    Transfer (SWIPT) [37] and Simultaneously Light-Wave Information and Power Transfer
    (SLIPT) techniques [38], [39] are proposed in the literature in preference to
    powered up UWSNs. SWITP, wireless power transfer (WPT), and SLIPT will be widely
    discussed in further sections in this study. At a glance, EH is an optimum solution
    for power supply to activate the internet-enabled devices. Although, very few
    existing EH techniques are capable of supplying energy to the internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs). Several EH techniques are proposed in the open literature to power
    up underwater-based sensor nodes through RF and acoustic waves, which are mentioned
    in section IX. Considering the EH scheme in acoustic communication, the Microbial
    Fuel Cell (MFC) and Acoustic Piezo-Electric (APE) techniques are the key enabling
    solutions for self-energizing nodes [40]. WPT and SWIPT techniques are investigated
    and introduced to provide energy with information transmission simultaneously
    over the wireless network [37]. Similarly, SLIPT has been announced as a futuristic
    wireless carrier candidate for EH and information transmission through light wave
    [41]. A more detailed summary and comparison between SWIPT and SLIPT is recorded
    in the literature in [42]. Furthermore, enabling the next-generation wireless
    network proliferates the communication system quality and efficiency. 5G enabled
    underwater wireless communication system will be the futuristic communication
    networking system that has been introduced recently in [35]. The authors in [43]
    and [44] are investigated the Filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) and generalized
    frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) schemes which are considered as the latest
    reliable networking techniques for 5G applications in underwater. Improving the
    system quality of communication setup within the higher signal modulation techniques
    also significantly achieves a high data rate. The higher modulation techniques
    support a high degree of signal transmission between transceivers with minimum
    delay. The different types of optical signal modulation techniques are summarized
    in [45] and [21]. The hybrid links established for the long ranges of communication
    in different channel environmental conditions are used to deploy according to
    the requirement. A hybrid RF-UWOC system is investigated in [46]–[52]. Therefore,
    throughout this study, we present the various optical signal modulations, demodulations
    techniques, and their implementations in various wireless systems with recent
    trends in the underwater environment. A. Related Survey Literature The various
    existing works are recorded based on UWC techniques and investigated with numerous
    emerging development methods in this domain. The existing related works are summarized
    by Table 4. For several decades, accelerating UWC to explore the underwater environment
    has become an alternative communication media that attracts human activities in
    an aqueous medium. Plenty of underwater wireless applications based on acoustic
    waves are investigated in existing works to explore the oceanic environment. However,
    the limited signal propagation speed and bandwidth recorded in underwater sound
    waves caused communication delay among nodes [12]. Therefore, the requirement
    for underwater acoustic communication setups for real-time monitoring and to access
    underwater applications are typically challenging. Based on underwater acoustic
    communication (UWAC), the most promptly military applications, especially in underwater
    acoustic communications among nodes such as submarine to the base station, submarine
    to ship, and submarine with military divers, are widely summarized in [53]. On
    the other hand, underwater optical signaling propagation reliably supports high
    bandwidth and high data-rate with minimal delay and latency. This is particularly
    appealing for real-time underwater applications [54]. To mitigate of its limitations,
    a hybrid mixed communication system design and evaluation of underwater optical-acoustic
    networks are investigated as in [55]–[59]. Similarly, for real-time scenarios,
    the performance of RF underwater communications operating system at frequency
    ranges 433MHz to 2.4GHz is investigated [60]. A range of existing hybrid underwater
    links are summarized in Table 4. Due to high signal propagation delay and very
    few kbps data rate in UWAC, counterparts of UWRF could be a complementary solution
    to receive high data rate and bandwidth range. For short distances, the RF conduction-based
    system design for voice communication in an aqueous medium has been recorded in
    [61]. TABLE 4 The Table is Summarized the Most Recent Existing Similar Works Along
    With the Related Contributions From the Perspective of Future Directions. Furthermore,
    it has Also Mentioned the Channel Modeling, Impairments, Signal Affecting Factors,
    and the Most Widely Deployable Underwater Applications Prior works are designed
    on theoretical propositions as a function of the physical properties of channels
    such as pressure, temperature, salinity, etc. A recent survey on UWOC is widely
    discussed about signal propagation-related issues based on the physical layer
    and localization technique in [13]. The authors in [62] investigated the path
    loss performance of a vertical UVLC link with the physical properties of the water
    channel considering n th water layers. A UVLC system model considering LOS & non-LOS
    vertical configurations and the variation of refractive index is also presented
    in [63]. The survey [12] is exhaustively enlisted the critical factors of optical
    signals propagation in an underwater medium where the authors modeled the UWOC
    channels. However, the survey is provided a detailed summary of optical signal
    modulation and demodulation techniques according to the experimental setup of
    the system. UWOC wireless carriers as FSO and UVLC technology have been compared
    and widely discussed in [64]. The higher modulation techniques of UVLC have become
    attention for developing optical signals in the underwater environment. Due to
    this, a 16-QAM modulation scheme for underwater signaling was proposed in [65].
    The authors in [65] are investigated the four types of different geometrical shaped
    16-QAM constellation experimental approaches for improving the system efficiency.
    The most recent work based on the MIMO-OFDM scheme utilizing VLC in underwater
    is proposed as in [66] and [67], where the authors proposed the BER performance
    of the system under consideration of weak turbulence channel conditions. Another
    study is observed the BER performance over NOMA-based assisted UVLC link as in
    [68]. In hybrid communication, EH is an issue concerning nodes in active modes.
    An EH hybrid acoustic-optical underwater sensor networking system was investigated
    in [69]. The authors in [70], are introduced the possible underwater applications
    and the differences between the terrestrial-based wireless network (TWSNs) with
    the underwater sensor network nodes (UWSNs). In the previous work [4], we reviewed
    the comparison among the three most significant UWC technologies and concluded
    the various advantages of UWOC over traditional wireless carriers. In this presented
    survey, we studied the recent advent of UVLC within different channel conditions.
    The following complementary sub-topics are widely summarized in this research
    as follows; UVLC channel model is considered within the combined influence of
    weak to strong turbulence channel conditions along with the pointing error between
    transceivers; The performance of underwater hybrid communication is obtained in
    different water types along with the simulation results; The distinctive VLC higher

    are also summarized; Integration of UVLC towards 5G and 5GB networking in UWC
    domain is concluded; A SLIPT assisted scheme, based on time-switching and power
    switching methods to powered up UWSNs is highlighted in this research. B. Motivations
    and Contributions Since humans footed on earth, oceanic reservoirs are least explored
    and are far-fetched to envisage the undersea environments. We tend to know more
    about the moon and mars rather than oceans existed on our earth. The interest
    growth of human activities in underwater is proposed the new research advances
    become familiarization with the natural oceanic phenomenal activities. Numerous
    UWC systems demand plenty of underwater applications for new research perspectives
    in this particular domain due to the immense development of industrialization.
    Traditional acoustic signaling is widely used for various underwater applications
    over long ranges. Nevertheless, a novel optical communication wireless media has
    been proposed recently to fulfill the requirement of desired data rate. Therefore,
    optical wireless signaling has become a potential wireless candidate for information
    transmission, and energy harvesting technology. However, UVLC is in its early
    age to cope with signal transmission and energy harvesting issues wirelessly in
    highly turbid water mediums. This study carries an exhaustive survey of UVLC towards
    5GB futuristic networking system, the latest and current projects are running

    and their contributions are perspectives. The main contributions and recent trends
    of UVLC through this study are as follows; The main purpose of this research is
    to provide a clear understanding of the main characteristic features of UVLC terminology
    towards future 5GB networking systems. In addition, the study also discusses signal
    processing extraction methodology with the possible solutions to the current factual
    challenges of improving the efficiency and potential wireless carriers of data
    communication in the underwater environment; An essential goal of this study includes
    a clear viewpoint of technical aspects of underwater networking architectural
    communication applicable for various applications and different higher modulation
    optical signal processing techniques among students, young scientists, and researchers
    to understand challenges and future directions in the corresponding domain; An
    extensive range of underwater applications requires communication techniques with
    high performance and reliability. Due to this, most of the significant channel
    impairments and challenges are widely studied. However, absorption, scattering,
    misalignment of transceivers (Pointing Error), and turbidity are the main influencing
    factors overlooked in single-hop, dual-hop, and hybrid multi-hop wireless communications;
    A wide detailed summary of VLC modulation, and demodulation techniques towards
    5G enabled FBMC, and GFDM techniques are briefly summarized. UVLC enabled 5GB
    supports a proper connection among underwater-based internet-connected elements
    with the satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the sake of expanding
    human activities [1]; This study is visualized the most distinctive type of UWSN
    architectures to power up the nodes through SWIPT and SLIPT schemes; the UWSNs
    architecture in both academic and industrial perspectives are majorly discussed;

    and engineers. In addition, the key fundamentals of this proposed survey are associated
    with professionals communication academics. C. Paper Structure The remainder of
    the paper is organized into XV sections. An underwater wireless communication
    overview enabled with different communication media is presented in section II.
    We are discussing the fundamentals and propagation terminology of UVLC along with
    the types of waters, channel impairments in section III. The necessity of signal
    transmitter and receivers are summarized by section IV. Further, an exhaustive
    survey relating to the current project schemes and future deployments are widely
    summarized in section V. In section VI, there are plenty of computational methods
    discussed to provide a problematic solution of bulk data in optical signal processing.
    To cope with the channel impairments and signal fading factors have taken into
    account. Therefore the various UVLC system models are proposed and their overview
    is given in VII. The modulation schemes are the most practical terms to propagate
    digital signals. Due to this, the optical modulation and demodulation techniques
    are introduced in section VIII. Furthermore, deploying UVLC systems in critical
    environmental conditions is challenging and far-fetched to transfer energy to
    underwater-based sensor nodes. The SLIPT, SWIPT, and WPT wireless energy transfer
    and simultaneous information decoding schemes are broadly discussed in section
    IX. The aim of this study is to improve the performance and coverage range of
    UVLC by integrating with traditional UWC technologies. The various possible dual,
    triple, and multi-hop hybrid communication link system models are also presented
    in section X. For long-ranges communication coverage, the distinctive UWSNs architecture
    beneficial for various underwater applications is tabulated and introduced by
    section XI. Recent advancements of internet-connected devices underwater according
    to the requirements and advantages are also over-viewed in section XII. The implementation
    and future trends in UVLC towards 5G and 5GB are investigated in section XIII.
    Underwater optical wireless applications and recent advances are the impressive
    features of this study are summarized by section XIV. Finally, Section XV concludes
    the paper. SECTION II. Underwater Wireless Communication as an Overview UWC networks
    are challenging and become a significant approach to exploring an inaccessible
    unguided sector in the deep ocean with a wired and wireless connection. The deployable
    technologies allow to get familiar with the oceanic environment. Therefore, UWC
    accommodates an opportunity for oceanographic data collection and analysis, water
    pollution, underwater environmental monitoring, changes in currents, early warning
    of flood or tsunami, and observing the phenomena of ice sheet melting due to global
    warming cause of rising water level of oceans [4]. Nowadays in UWC, the three
    most significant distinctive technologies are employable for transmitting the
    information. These wireless carrier candidates are based on optical, sound, and
    electromagnetic waves based [5], [13]. The signal transmission is dependent on
    signal strength which is affected by the brutally chemical properties of the channel.
    The optical signal could be absorbed, scattered, and reflected caused by the chemical
    vitality of the channel, and suspended particles in a water environment [10].
    Considering UWRF, which is used for short ranges, the signal decay happens by
    the hydrological properties and water channel. These water channel properties
    known as permittivity, conductivity, and permeability are directly responsible
    for the contribution of RF signal attenuation while increasing frequency ranges
    [37]. Since the saline seawater allows to propagate RF waves in few meters at
    extra low-frequency range of (30–300Hz), which is enabled to the transmission
    of few characters per minute to submarine [11]. Moreover, RF waves at the frequency
    range MHz to GHz accomplishes work efficiently in hybrid scenarios [4]. However,
    for shallow water scenarios, RF-enabled communication is called buoyant communication
    [5]. The UWRF system requires a costly and large sized information transmission
    antenna along with high energy-consuming transceivers [71]. In hybrid UWRF signaling,
    it offers a significant platform for the connection between underwater and terrestrial-based
    nodes. It also permits the exploration of the forbidden field of ocean and underwater
    environment. Extremely low frequencies (ELF) are used for long ranges underwater
    communication while the high frequencies (HF) strongly attenuate the cause of
    signal losses [72]. On the other hand, the frequency ranges as ultra-high frequency
    (ULF) to medium frequency (MF) are mainly used for a variety of underwater environments
    [73]. As far as long ranges in underwater signaling, acoustic waves are widely
    used and challenging communication technology to deploy in an underwater environment
    [74]. Nevertheless, in UWAC propagation, the speed of sounds deficient with high
    delay over long ranges [75]. According to [9] and [76], an impressive feature
    of UWAC offers an incremental speed propagation on raising the temperature of
    the water. An impressive increment (approximately 4m/s) has been recorded on rising
    1°C of water temperature. Moreover, the salinity is also another cause of signal
    fading, and acoustic waves speed in enhanced by 1.4m/s while rising salinity 1
    practical salinity unit (PSU). In respect to receiving signals over long distances
    under consideration of plane wave model or spherical wave model, emerging technology
    is widely known as UWSNs, which is alternative and a complimentary communication
    media solution, especially for military and naval tactical, operational applications
    [77]. SECTION III. Fundamentals of Underwater Visible Light Communications UVLC
    has become a unique advantageous technology in the new era of wireless signaling
    that has drawn attention as a dominant signal propagation over short ranges in
    the harsh underwater medium. Towards the next generation of 5GB wireless networking
    system, UVLC will be applicable for numerous undersea applications such as geographical
    mapping, underwater navigation, naval operations, data-retrieving among nodes,
    and high quality of UWSNs are also considered [119]. Additionally, UVLC has superiority
    including high data-rate, real-time steaming data transfer with high security
    compared with its counterpart traditional underwater signaling acoustic and RF
    signaling. Despite all of these advantages, several factors affect the signal
    propagation, such as absorption, scattering, and turbulence due to the IOPs and
    AOPs properties of water channel and nature of light [5], [9], [12], [34], [79].
    The affecting factors cause signal fading, limiting a limited communication range
    for UVLC systems. Another degradation of signal fading is multi-path propagation
    that generates an inter-symbol interference (ISI). In this context, the fading-free
    impulse response (FFIR) of UVLC channel, which is a MIMO-UVLC system, has been
    recently investigated in [105]. In [105], the authors presented a thorough approach
    to UVLC channel characterization, performance analysis, and effective transmission
    along with the reception methods of the proposed system model. Moreover, in another
    study [120], the authors proposed a CDMA-UVLC approach based on assigning unique
    Optical Orthogonal Codes (OOC) for each underwater mobile user. An underwater
    cellular optical CDMA network and related applications of serial relaying mechanism
    has been recently proposed in [121] and [122]. The wireless signal transmission
    underwater is challenging, especially when optical transceivers are deployed.
    Acoustic and VLC are complementary deployable communication technologies to fulfill
    the desired communication gap in the wireless communication domain. However, acoustic
    link suffers signal attenuation and high signal propagation latency. The implantation
    of acoustic transceivers is expensive, bulky (highly challenging to deploy rather
    than optical setup), and high power consumption. The VLC link is considered as
    an alternative viable underwater signaling technology over moderate distances
    compared with acoustic and EM waves. To mitigate all the above facts, optical
    communication systems are defined as horizontal and vertical or slant links according
    to their implementation direction [123]. The horizontal links are proposed to
    improve the system performance and minimize the turbulence effects [63]. On the
    other hand, in the underwater vertical or slant link scenario, the transceivers
    are arranged in LOS link configuration [100]. A. Underwater VLC Configuration
    Links UWC is expected to achieve desirable receiving information in the underwater
    environment significantly. The design of a VLC link can be classified into three
    most significant categories such as i) UVLC Line of sight (LOS) link, ii) Retro-reflector
    assisted LOS link, and iii) Non-LOS configuration link. UVLC Line of Sight Communication
    (LOS) Link:- Generally, in optical communication LOS links are widely used; the
    LOS scenario is depicted by Fig.2. In this scenario, the deployable transceivers
    should be aligned and directly linked to one another in the line of direction
    of signal propagation. This type of combination supports and enhances the power
    efficiency, as well as immunity of the environmental distorting effects such as
    ambient and artificial light source [124]. Additionally, the LOS scenario is the
    most reliable approach for an underwater wireless communication system in terms
    of high data rate, better BER performance, improving system efficiency, and system
    performance. However, the drawback of LOS links is the mobility of transceivers
    due to water currents and the random flow of water waves. Even the received optical
    signals depend on the physical parameters of the experimental setup. According
    to [124], the LOS communication link by using laser diode wavelength 470nm is
    capable of covering 200m distance in the deep ocean that allowed 5Mbps data-rate
    transmission. On the other hand, in coastal ocean water, yellow-green LEDs are
    the optimal solution to deal with the signal scattering, and field of view (FOV)
    a wide-angle of beam causes increased attenuation. The propagation loss under
    Beer Lmabert’s law can be defined as follows [125], h pl ij (λ, d ij )=exp{−c(λ)
    d ij }, (1) View Source where i , j are denoted the transmitter and receiver nodes,
    the euclidean distance between the transceivers and the total sum of absorption
    and scattering as extinction coefficient are defined as d ij and c(λ) , respectively.
    The propagation losses depend on the path loss component as well as the geometrical
    parameters of the setup. Generally, the geometrical gain in optical LOS scenario
    can be written as [79], h gl ij = A i cos( ϕ ij ) 2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij , (2)
    View Source where the receiver aperture area of nodes and the beam divergence
    angle of i th transmitters are represented as A i and θ i , respectively. Furthermore,
    the channel conditions, which are the contribution of the path-loss and geometrical
    losses, are defined as follows [101], h ij = h pl ij + h gl ij . (3) View Source
    The channel conditions h ij is modified by replacing (1) and (2) into (3) given
    as follows, h ij = 2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij ) e {−c(λ) d ij } + A i cos( ϕ ij )
    2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij ) . (4) View Source Furthermore, for approximation of the
    maximum achievable distance to achieve a specified bit-error-rate is investigated
    in [101], which can be defined as, d ij = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ W( c(λ) 2 (1−T)( D r
    θ F ) h ( T−1 2 ) ij ) c(λ) 2 (1−T) ( D r θ F ) T ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 1 1−T (5) View
    Source where W , D r , T , and θ F represent the Lambert-W function, the aperture
    diameter, the correction coefficient for data fitting with the simulation results,
    and divergence angle for full-width transmitted beam, respectively. For the LOS
    of laser diode, the divergence angle is generally planned for few milliradians,
    whereas LEDs fixed a divergence angle below 140 milliradians for diffusing light
    to a wide-angle [13]. At the receiver end, the received power ( P j t ) describes
    the product of transmission power efficiency, channel gain, propagation loss,
    and geometrical loss [79] of setup i.e. P j t = P i t η i t η j r h gl ij χ( ψ
    j i ) h pl ij (c(λ), d ij cos( ϕ j i ) ), (6) View Source where P j t , P j r
    , η i t , η j r , χ( ψ j i ) and ψ j i are denoted as the transmission and received
    signal powers, transceivers efficiencies, concentrator gain, and the incident
    angle concerning the receiver axis, respectively. UVLC Retro-reflector-assisted
    LOS Link: Optical retro-reflector type links are based on the back-scatter phenomenon
    principle consisting of a light source with an optical reflector. In this scenario,
    the capacity of the source is more powerful than the receiver node [125]. Although,
    the reflector is considered an interrogator with a basic anatomical design with
    minimal power availability. Consequently, the optical beam propagation source
    continuously emits a light beam during propagation of the light signal modulated
    and reflected by a local reflector then received by the destination. A UVLC retro-reflector
    LOS link is depicted by Fig.3. In more contrast, the retro-reflector scenario
    is sub-divided into two significant categories known as photon-limited and contrast-limited
    retro-reflector [5]. The photon-limited retro-reflector phenomena occurs in shallow
    waters such as lakes, deltas, and rivers either clear sea waters. In this scenario,
    the link range and the system capacity depends on the received falling photons
    at the detector end due to absorption phenomena. Although, the retro-reflector
    link is most widely used in turbid harbor water mediums, where signal scattering
    is considered an influential factor for system range and capacity. A contrast
    limitation for more specific uses underwater imaging applications is reducing
    the number of photons responsible for reducing the image contrast and quality.
    The reflector is capable of amplifying the modulated signal or light beam for
    the sake of better system performance in both scenarios as photon and contrast
    limited retro-reflectors [13]. Even, the retro-reflectors reflect the modulated
    beam and signals to the interrogator when the modulated signals are received on
    it [125]. In this retro-reflector design, if η t , η r , and η Ret are the optical
    transmitter efficiency, receiver efficiency and retro-reflector efficiency, then
    the received power in retro-reflector link is given as follows [13], [125], P
    j r = P i t η t η r η Ret h ij χ( ψ j i ) h j i (λ, 2 d ij cos( ϕ i ) ) ×[ A j
    cos( ϕ j i ) 2π d 2 ij (1−cos( θ i )) ][ A r cos( ϕ ij ) π d ij tan( θ r ) 2 ],
    (7) View Source where the aperture receiver area of reflector, the divergence
    angle of the reflector, and the angle between the receiver trajectory of the source
    are denoted by A r , θ r , and ϕ j i , respectively. UVLC Non-LOS Configuration
    Link:- Non-line of sight (NLOS) optical signal propagation happens due to existing
    or suspended large scale particles or obstructions, even misalignment of the transceivers,
    and random orientation of the transceivers in underwater mediums. In this aspect,
    the reflected light from the sea surface or the bottom of water reservoirs (in
    shallow regions) could be beneficial to facilitate multi-point communication as
    depicted in Fig.4. In the NLOS scenario, the cone of light is emitted by the source
    with inner and outer angles θ min and θ max in an upward direction. This upward
    optical beam strikes with the water surface with an annular area A nn , either
    a reflection of the light beam strikes with the ocean surface and reached the
    desired nodes. In contrast, if the transceivers are designed vertically upward,
    then the propagated beam partially refracts and partially reflects with the water
    surface. The reflected light beam propagates from the transmitter, which locates
    x distance apart water surface as depicted in Fig.4, where A nn is defined as
    equal power density while apart at a distance x 0 . The annular surface area can
    be written as follows [125], A ann =2π(x+ x 0 ) 2 [cos( θ min )−cos( θ max )],
    (8) View Source where (x+ x 0 ) is defined as the radius of the spherical geometry,
    which means the uniform power density in free space. The received power at the
    specified destination in the NLOS scenario is expressed as [126], P j r = P i
    t η i t η r j h NLOS ij χ( ψ j i ) h pl ij (c(λ), x+ x 0 cos( ϕ j i ) ). (9) View
    Source B. The Necessities and Advantages of UVLC UVLC has become a potential wireless
    candidate (transmission standard IEEE 802.15.7) for signal transmission in an
    underwater environment without any interference as in RF signaling. There are
    plenty of benefits to deploying VLC over traditional acoustic waves as very cost-effective,
    easy to install, high data transmission 3Gbit/s, real-time monitoring [105], and
    the collection of bathymetric data [127]. Under consideration of UVLC the blue-green
    colored optical wavelengths have been chosen for no-radiation and non-harmful
    for underwater species [128]. Numerous applications are deployed underwater where
    channel conditions emerge with a high-power LED-based VLC system. For real-time
    communication scenarios the underwater sensor network nodes (UWSNs) are connected
    with visible light sources and further communicate with the base station (BS)
    [129]. The sensors positioning system and localization in the UVLC system have
    been drawn attention in the literature in supporting and improving the system
    capacity and efficiency. For instance in the initial stage of VLC, it was deployed
    intensively in mining sectors and further used as a wireless candidate in underground
    areas [130]. The electromagnetic waves as VLC counterparts, are absorbed and effortlessly
    attenuated by underground channels. Therefore, the evolution of VLC technology
    to bridge the gap in such complex applications as mining sectors, tunnel operations,
    and underwater communication. Due to this, most organizations are seeking further
    developments in the VLC communication systems. It turns the clock back as Disney
    Research had developed an in-light lightning system for their theme parks [131].
    Huawei just recently signed an agreement with a German company Schnell Li-Fi to
    build optical hospitals that make the hospitals smarter and remotely operation
    could be possible through the wireless connected medical equipment [132]. These
    applications will support safer operations because visible light is free of interference
    compared to electromagnetic carriers. Another key driver is that the VLC (enabled
    LEDs) can deploy and make the oceans smarter, supporting an urgent need for efficient
    and highly secure communication. The micro-LEDs are being used for high data transmission
    in VLC systems. However, LEDs are tiny in size, and transmission power is relatively
    low compared to the laser. At a glance, lasers are not associated with the efficiency
    Doppler effect, which means they can reach higher power and higher power density
    even a very tiny device. Also, the laser operation in the stimulated emission
    regime has a much higher modulation bandwidth compared with LEDs. The requirement
    is to move from LED to laser source because lasers have more advantages over LEDs.
    A recently developed narrow bandwidth blue lasers-based distributed feedback laser
    (DFB) wave-guide structure has been proposed [133]. The DFB laser structure with
    III-layer nitride is still under development. An experimented wave-guide structure
    builds a high-speed DFB blue laser with enormous potential for future speed Li-Fi
    applications. C. The Characterization of Oceanic Layers Generally, the deep oceans
    are categorized into three distinct zones for optical signaling, i.e., Euphotic,
    Disphotic, and Aphotic zones widely known as sunlight zone, twilight zone, and
    midnight zone, respectively, depicted in Fig.5. The range of the visible light
    signal, living organisms, and the variation of pressure concerning the depth is
    also summarized in Fig.5. Euphotic zone: The sunlight zone is the top layer of
    the water surface; enough amount of sunlight penetrates this zone. The green algae
    can survive due to the primary source of sunlight, and photosynthesis happens
    [134]. Moreover, the living creatures can be found in this zone [135]. The typical
    depth of this zone depends on water quality, such as the clarity or murkiness
    of the water. The depth of this zone varies in different in water types of waters.
    Euphotic zone can be quite deep up to hundreds of meters while it can be 15m meters
    in coastal ocean water in vertical column [5], [136]. Generally, the depth of
    the sunlight zone is approximated up to 200m from the water level. In this zone,
    the temperature fluctuates approximately 28 0 C to freezing point − 2 0 C [137].
    Twilight Zone: The twilight zone is formally known as the Disphotic zone, which
    is beneath the Euphotic zone. The expected depth of this zone varies from 200m
    to typically 1km in the ocean [138]. At this level, a small amount of light visualize
    and rarely the algae alive in this zone. The very dim light falls and the dim
    blue light could penetrate this zone. There is not sufficient light to sustain
    the photosynthesis process in the disphotic zone. Some adaptable creatures can
    be found in the Twilight zone. The pressure increases and the temperature falls
    due to increasing depth. Mid-Night zone: A vast portion of the ocean belongs to
    this layer, known as the Aphotic zone. Approximately 90% of the ocean consists
    in the Midnight zone. It is entirely dark; there is no light extent this massive
    unguided water sector. The water pressure extremely low and below the freezing
    point. The depth of the midnight zone varies more than 1000m to 11km where is
    no light has taken place. The temperature fluctuates far from a chilling temperature
    of 40C to −150C or below. Rarely or more specific living organisms and creatures
    can be found in this zone [139]. D. Different Water Types, Challenges & Affecting
    Factors in UVLC Systems Considering the channel conditions which affect optical
    signal propagation, the water has been categorized into different categories.
    According to [10], the three main types of waters exist and are classified for
    optical signaling as clearest water, intermediate water, and murkiest water. The
    geographical location of the clearest ocean water is located in the Mid-Pacific
    and Atlantic oceans, whereas intermediate water is possibly found in the Northern
    Pacific ocean. The North Sea and Eastern Atlantic oceans are the major water reservoirs
    of the murkiest water. Furthermore, another classification is commonly discussed
    in the open literature, which has been sub-divided into four distinctive categories:
    i) Pure seawater, ii) Clear ocean water, iii) Coastal ocean water, and finally,
    iv) Turbid harbor & estuary water. The light beam attenuates in these water differently.
    As in pure seawater the optical signals absorb because of the chemical composition,
    while the scattering loss occurs widely in clear ocean water due to its higher
    concentration of particles than pure seawater. A higher amount of particle concentration
    is founded in coastal ocean water rather than clear ocean water, which causes
    a higher rate of scattering and absorption of the light beam. Moreover, turbid
    harbor and estuary water has the highest concentration of particles. The deployment
    of UWOC is more challenging as per channel condition requirements. The channel
    properties vary with distinct water types and geographical conditions [10]. Additionally,
    another classification while the propagation of light beam based on the environmental,
    geographical conditions, and the chemical vitality of the water is categorized.
    The subcategories are called as IOPs, and AOPs [140]. The IOPs are only medium
    dependents on existing substances and the composition of the medium [140], while
    AOPs depend on both the mediums and nature of the light beam. The AOPs are used
    to evaluate the ambient light levels for communication near the water surface.
    AOPs contribute radiance, irradiance, and reluctance. In more contrast, the spectral
    absorptive coefficient and volume scattering function are the two main factors
    that are considered in IOPs [141]. The transmission of the light beam experiences
    the absorption of photons by water and further converts them into another form
    of energy to increase the temperature of water molecules. In absorption phenomena
    the signal path-loss occurs where the beam intensity does weaken and the propagated
    photons absorb by the channel. The absorption occurs by chlorophyll in phytoplankton
    at colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), by water molecules and existing salt
    contents [140]. Moreover, the CDOM matters are the combinations of the two components
    known as fulvic and humic acid as mentioned in [142]. In more detail, the absorption
    and scattering phenomena in different waters have been discussed in further subsections.
    The absorption effect is calculated in terms of wavelength and represented by
    α(λ) . Though, scattering is defined as the randomness of photons with the direction
    of beam propagation. The optical signal scattering phenomena occur by the vitality
    of salt ions in pure water and collimated with particle matters. The scattering
    coefficient measurement per meter is denoted by β(λ) . Due to scattering and absorption,
    the energy of the optical beam falls and occurs the overall attenuation. The typical
    values of α(λ) , β(λ) , and extinction coefficients c(λ) in different water mediums
    are summarized in Table 5. Absorption & Scattering Phenomenon in UWC:- Signal
    scattering in UVLC is the function that changes signal path, direction, and distance
    covered by photons in the underwater medium. The energy loss of optical beam by
    water (interaction between photon and water molecules) cause absorption, while
    the collision happens with suspended particles in UWOC. The optical signal absorption
    is an irreversible process where the photons lose their energy and improve the
    water temperature of water molecules. In more detail, if the photons strike with
    suspended particles and change their direction of propagation, scattering happens.
    The total energy loss of propagated optical beam due to absorption and scattering
    can be defined as the energy loss per meter. In addition to that an another cause
    of energy loss is inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the receiver aperture
    captures fewer incoming photons on its cross-sectional area. The extinction coefficient
    (summation absorption and scattering) is the signal loss phenomenon and directly
    affects the signal intensity and changes the direction of an optical beam. Concerning
    the physio-chemical properties of the channel and the geometrical model of absorption
    and scattering coefficient are proposed in [5] and [13]. Due to the harsh water
    channel conditions, the best way to understand the signal attenuation mechanism
    through a geometrical model of a water element is depicted by Fig.6. The optical
    beam energy is either absorbed by dangle particles or is transformed into heat
    energy, or raises water molecules thermal energy. Therefore, signal absorption
    affects signal strength, while the scattering phenomenon occurs the spreading
    photons randomly and strikes with the suspended particle. As a result, signals
    are partially received by detecting aperture or delayed to reach the destination.
    Thus, multi-path fading, time-jitter, and ISI occur in UWOC. To reduce ISI, the
    optimal multiple-symbol detection (MSD), as well as sub-optimal generalized MSD
    (GMSD) algorithms, are further investigated as in [105]. TABLE 5 The Typical Values
    of the Contribution Underwater Absorption, Scattering, and Extinction Coefficients.
    The Data is Applicable for Different Waters Mediums [5], [82] The recent surveys
    are detailed severe attenuation in optical signaling in harsh water cause absorption
    and scattering. Absorption and scattering are the two phenomenons responsible
    for signal fading caused by the suspended particles, the quality, and nature of
    water, dissolved organic matters affecting the signal strength, phase, and arrival
    angle of the received beam. The blue-green wavelength spectrum of visible light
    severs the minimum amount of absorption in pure seawater rather than coastal and
    turbid harbor water [143]. Moreover, light scattering is the cause of organic
    and inorganic matters due to the strong spatial and temporal dispersion of photons,
    which may affect photon strength and intensity [144]. E. Affecting Factors in
    UVLC Signaling In the UWOC system, the absorption and scattering effects light
    pulses by existing suspended particles leading to photons path loss and intensity
    deviation. Both of these signal fading factors are wavelength-dependent per meter
    of signal propagation distances. Generally, these factors occur due to the interaction
    of the light beam with micro and macromolecules of water, algal sediments, and
    color division organic materials. In general, the organic particles are responsible
    for absorbing photons while inorganic particles are creditworthy for scattering
    [143]. Further, the CDOM strongly absorbs the light photons in the ultra-violate
    (UV) spectrum [144]. The total signal fading contribution by absorption α(λ) and
    scattering β(λ) of optical beam energy loss describes in terms of extinction coefficient
    c(λ) known as signal attenuation as c(λ)=α(λ)+β(λ) . The extinction coefficient
    depends on the different water types. To formulate the expression for absorption
    and scattering, an elemental unit volume of water δ(V) with thickness δ(r) is
    considered and depicted by Fig.6. If the intensity of incident light-beam is denoted
    by P i (λ) with fixed wavelength λ collides with unitary elemental water volume.
    The incident beam is passing through the elemental volume and experiences absorption
    & scattering. The outcome beam is split into three fractions; as a certain amount
    of power, an incident beams P a (λ) absorbed and some extent of incident power
    P si (λ) will scatter at an angle ψ i . The remaining apparent beam P ri (λ) passed
    through the element and detected by receiver. Thus, the energy conservation law
    and total incident power is calculated as the addition of all above fractions,
    i.e., P i (λ)= P a (λ)+ P si (λ)+ P ri (λ) . Furthermore, the absorbed signal
    power ratio A(λ) and B(λ) scattered signal power ratio are defined as, A(λ)≡ P
    a (λ) P i (λ)  and  B(λ)≡ P s (λ) P i (λ) . (10) View Source In (10), the absorption
    and scattering ratios with the radius δr of an elemental water volume are infinitesimally
    small. Then taking the limits by an elemental water volume, the absorption and
    scattering coefficients can be written as [117], α(λ)= β(λ)= lim δ(r)→0 [δA(λ)/δ(r)]=dA(λ)/dr,
    lim δ(r)→0 [δB(λ)/δ(r)]=dB(λ)/dr, (11) (12) View Source Apart from the absorption
    and scattering, the seawater acts as a conductor medium for electromagnetic waves
    and offers dielectric properties for optical signaling [9]. In more precise terms,
    the seawater dramatically serves conductivity to dielectric at 250GHz frequency
    range [10]. However, underwater optical signals experience several extreme challenges
    and might be affected by fluctuation of scintillation index, scattering, absorption,
    dispersion, and temperature fluctuation due to the physio-chemical properties
    of the channel. Optical waves do not propagate simultaneously in water such as
    on a terrestrial basis, but accelerate exponentially in the water medium due to
    attenuation. The attenuation is the total contribution of signal fading, absorption,
    and scattering. In UWOC, scattering losses occur cause of discontinuity of the
    water molecules, while absorption occurs by the physical properties of channel
    conditions. In coastal ocean water, the optical signals are extremely corrupted
    by noise and path loss due to more scattering; the scattering event happens by
    the collision of the optical beam with the existing suspended particles and multiple
    reflections of angles [145]. The phenomena of absorption in UOWC have to be firmly
    taken into account cause several photons could reach the photo-detector or receiver
    end by passing harsh channel conditions. Absorption is a high wavelength-dependent
    process where the transmitted photons are absorbed and converted into chemical
    or heat energy of the water. For instance, in [142] the authors have modeled absorption
    coefficient under consideration of absorptivity by pure seawater in terms of chlorophyll
    as a function of wavelength. The absorption by chlorophyll is defined as the change
    in light beam intensity per meter of path length. The total contribution of absorption
    is the chlorophyll and the color dissolved organic components (CDOMs) i.e., [146]–[148]
    α(λ)= α w (λ)+ α cl (λ)+ α f (λ)+ α h (λ). (13) View Source In (13), the absorption
    coefficient of water, chlorophyll absorption coefficient are represented by α
    w (λ) and α cl (λ) . Moreover, the two CDOM components fulvic acid absorption
    coefficient α f (λ) , and humic acid absorption coefficient α h (λ) are defined,
    respectively. The individual absorption and scattering components for different
    water mediums are calculated in (14) and (15) to model. As a result, we consider
    transmitting the blue-colored spectrum wavelength (450nm) of visible light. The
    absorption coefficient by water types with respect to water concentration of ranges
    0≤ w c ≤15 mg/ m 3 , is calculated as follows, α w (λ)= α 0 w (λ) [ w c w 0 c
    ] a 0 w , (14) View Source where w 0 c =1mg/ m 3 is the reference water concentration.
    For the different types of water the a 0 w (λ) differentiate accordingly [142].
    The water concentration for different water types such as for pure sea water,
    clear ocean water, coastal ocean water and turbid harbor water varies 0.0405λ
    , 0.114λ , 0.179λ and 0.266λ , respectively. According to [145], the absorption
    component due to chlorophyll a cl (λ) with respect to the chlorophyll concentration
    C 0 c varies 0≤ C c ≤12mg/ m 3 , and can be written as, α cl (λ)= α 0 c (λ) [
    C c C 0 c ] 0.0602 , (15) View Source where the reference concentration of chlorophyll
    C 0 c =1mg/ m 3 , and α 0 c is equalized to 0.0602λ . Furthermore considering
    the CDOM components as, fulvic and humic acid absorption coefficients also formulated
    with respect to the chlorophyll concentration [146], α f (λ)= α h (λ)= α 0 f C
    f exp(− k f λ), α 0 h C h exp(− k h λ), (16) (17) View Source where the specific
    absorption coefficient for fulvic and humic acid component are a 0 f and a 0 h
    respectively. The concentrations of fulvic acid C f and humic acid C h in mg/
    m 3 can be expressed as follows [147], C f = C h = 1.74098 C c exp[0.12317( C
    c C 0 c )], 0.193348 C c exp[0.12343( C c C 0 c )]. (18) (19) View Source Due
    to suspended large and small scale particles underwater, the scattering phenomena
    occurs. The scattering coefficient β(λ) defines the total signal loss due to the
    redirection of the photons. In contrast, the total scattering is the sum of scattering
    coefficient of water β w (λ) , small particles β s (λ) , and large particle β
    l (λ) , respectively. The scattering function is wavelength and concentration-dependent.
    Therefore, total scattering can be calculated as [142], [146]–[148], β(λ)= β w
    (λ)+ β s (λ) C s + β l (λ) C l , (20) View Source where the small scale concentration
    C s and C l the concentration of large scale in g/ m 3 can be calculated as [145]
    C s = C l = 0.01739 C c exp[0.11631( C c C 0 c )]g/ m 3 , 0.76284 C c exp[0.03092(
    C c C 0 c )]g/ m 3 . (21) (22) View Source Another noticeable optical property
    concerning signal scattering is known as albedo scattering, which is the ratio
    of scattering signal loss to the total signal losses [144]. The albedo scattering
    number is formed as, ω 0 = (Scattering signals β(λ) )/(Total signal scattering
    c(λ) ). The albedo number shows a significant scale factor to measure absorptivity
    or scattering of water medium, which varies from 0.25 to 0.8 for clear ocean water
    to turbid coastal water. The scattering phenomenon is stated as the detected optical
    information in terms of angular, temporal, and polarization which causes the degradation
    in the number of photons at the receiver end. The cause of suspended CDOM and
    inorganic particles, the scattering coefficient may be termed as the function
    of the volumetric scattering function β v (VSF) over total angles (θ) as follows
    [149], β(λ)=2π ∫ π 0 β vsf (λ;θ)sin(θ)dθ. (23) View Source Moreover, the VSF is
    prescribed the normalization of β(λ) by the scattering phase function. Therefore,
    the spectral VSF coefficient β ¯ v (θ,λ ) is defined as follows, β ¯ v (θ,λ)=
    β v (λ,θ) β . (24) View Source Simultaneously, the optical beam propagated through
    the water channel and lost some fraction of its propagation energy in interaction
    with water molecules, number of biological substances, CDOM, etc. The are two
    signal-affecting mechanisms widely considered as absorption and scattering. The
    optical signals are severely affected by the channel turbidity due to the random
    fluctuation of the refraction index. F. Turbulence Turbulence is another cause
    of optical signal fading resulting from the random fluctuation in the refractive
    index. Plenty of valuable experimental results have recently been recorded in
    the open literature on characterizing underwater optical turbulence (UOT). In
    other words, turbidity is described as the varying changes in refractive index
    due to fluctuation of density, salinity, and pressure of underwater environment
    that affects optical signal propagation. It means the random variation in scintillation
    index induced turbidity in the channel environment. The consistency of oceanic
    turbulence occurs by wave current, physio-chemical properties of water, large,
    and small suspended particles. The wave currents are defined as weak to strong
    turbulence conditions based on Reynolds number. If Reynolds number ρ≤1000 , then
    water flow is considered laminar or steady flow, with the minimal fluctuation
    in scintillation index. Whether, if it is 1000 ≤ρ≤2000 , then the flow has shown
    uncertainty, which means weak turbulence channel conditions. In the case where
    Reynolds number 2000≤ρ exceeds 4000, then it is considered as heavy turbulence
    channel conditions. G. Affect of Noise in UWOC Noise is the factor that corrupts
    the signals, which directly affects the signal efficiency during communication.
    In UWOC, the noise occurs due to the reception of a random variation of photons
    propagation by transceivers. Different background noise sources are widely studied,
    such as quantum shot noise, optical-excess noise, optical background noise, photo-detector
    dark current noise, diffused extended background noise, background noise from
    sunlight, or other objects in the optical communication systems received at the
    receiver end. There are different types of noises in UWOC are recorded in existing
    literature [4], [5], [9], [150]. Optical Excess Noise: The communication setup
    should be more accurate and reliable for information transmission purposes. However,
    some irregularities or faults in the experimental setup causes falling transmission
    accuracy. Due to inaccuracy of the transceivers noise occurrence, the glitches
    happen and corrupt the received signals defined as excess optical noise. Background
    Noise: In contrast to this noise, background noise is considered black-body radiation;
    the refracted sunlight is responsible as the main source of background noise.
    This type of noise majorly interfered by the sunlight, limiting the optical system
    performance for tens of meters (mostly in the Euphotic zone). The noise contribution
    of total background environment in the literature is recorded as in [4], [5],
    [9], and [150]. The total background noise power in optical signal propagation
    is defined as follows [150], P BG = P B G sol + P B G black−body . (25) View Source
    For channel modeling, the background noise variance σ 2 BG =2qR P BG B , depends
    on electronic signal bandwidth B , power of solar background P B G sol , and electron
    charge q , respectively. Furthermore, P B G sol is expressed as, P B G sol = A
    R (πFOV ) 2 δλ T F L sol . (26) View Source In (26), the receiver aperture area,
    the optical filter transmissivity is presented by A R , and T F , respectively.
    However, the solar radiance also depends on down-welling irradiance E , underwater
    reflectance of down-welling irradiance R , the directional dependence of underwater
    radiance L f , diffuse attenuation coefficient K , and the underwater depth d
    . Therefore, the solar radiance L sol is expressed by (27) as follows, L sol =
    ER L f exp(−Kd) π . (27) View Source Furthermore, the noise power of a black-body
    irradiance expressed as P BG = 2h c 2 γ A R (πFOV ) 2 δλ T A T F (λ ) 5 [ e (hc/λkT)
    −1] , (28) View Source where c , h , k , and γ are described as the speed of light,
    the Plank constant, the Boltzmann constant and the radiant factor. Moreover, the
    signal transmission factor in underwater is defined as T A =exp(− τ 0 ) . Photo-Detector
    Dark Current Noise: The dark current noise is described and related to the photo-diode
    [35]. This type of noise occurs due to electrical current leakage from the photodetector.
    The variance of the dark current noise can be defined by (29), which is the function
    of electron charge q , the DC intensity I DC , and electronic bandwidth [150],
    σ 2 DC =2q I DC B. (29) View Source Current Shot Noise: This type of noise is
    generated while receiving the signals at the receiver end. If the signal power
    symbolized by P s , then the shot noise variance can be written as [10], σ 2 ss
    =2qr P s B. (30) View Source Thermal Noise: The random motion of electrons generates
    noise within the conductor medium due to a temperature rise. To model the thermal
    noise, if it considers The noise figure parameters F=4 , load resistance R l =100Ω
    , and equivalent temperature T e =290K are taken, then thermal noise variance
    given as [10], [150] σ 2 TH = 4k T e FB R l . (31) View Source In the UWOC system
    model, the sum of total noise variances is responsible for the system noise. Therefore,
    without any interference of optical signal, the noise variances of electrical
    current at the detector end is given as, σ 2 I = σ 2 TH + σ 2 DC + σ 2 BG + σ
    2 ss . (32) View Source SECTION IV. Transceivers for UVLC A. Transmitter and Transducer
    The function of optical transducers is to transform the modulated information
    into an optical or electrical or vice-versa signal pattern. The transducers are
    mounted on transceivers and fixed on a well-defined path for smooth signal propagation
    in an underwater medium. In another words, the transducers are designed to generate
    an optical signal from an electrical signal made from optical transmitters during
    optical beam propagation. On the other hand, an actuator can be used in UWOC [9]
    to generate the pulse of optical signal in electrical format at the receiver end.
    With the rapidly increasing interest in exploring aquatic media, UWOC plays a
    vital role in realizing a wide range of scientific, commercial, and coastal security
    applications. VLC is an alternative communication media as a UWOC implementation
    in the range of LEDs illuminating light sources. In UVLC, the transmitter transforms
    digital information into analog format over channel conditions. Generally, LEDs
    and LDs are used for signal transmission over high data rates and bandwidth. Another
    adhesive advantage is LED structure, where the photons are emitted spontaneously
    at different phases. In coherent radiation, the photons are stimulate by another
    photon that is radiated with phase correlation [151]. More precisely, LEDs excel
    as incandescent reliable light sources, power consumption devices, and efficient
    luminous tools. The LEDs efficiency operate 210 m/W more than the incandescent
    lamps efficiency [45]. The multi-functional transmitter-enabled LEDs emit light
    and information simultaneously with the optical dimming power this is most widely
    used; for efficient signal propagation while the optical transmitters do not use
    flickering phenomena. In a general aspect, the LEDs are designed for white-light
    emission sources and divided into two categories: blue and red-green-blue (RGB)
    emitting types of LEDs. Both types of LEDs emit different colors of light, as
    yellow-white light causes phosphorus polishing. Blue LEDs are considered more
    energy-efficient and widely use for light illuminating systems rather than blue
    LEDs. The blue-LEDs could achieve reliability for optical signal transmission
    by combining yellow color (RGBY). In optical beam propagation, the VLC link depends
    on the dimming or switching nature of LEDs. The optical sources are categorized
    as laser transmitter type or an LED type optical transmitter. Consequently, the
    laser type of technological sources quiet different and are used according to
    the application requirement. An argon-ion laser is a well-known laser transmitter
    suitable for converting electrical signals into an optical format [10]. A transducer
    assists in converting and then transmitting all maximum quantities of photons
    toward the receiver or other nodes. For optical signal modulation, different types
    of laser modulators are being used. In general, the laser modulator is designed
    for low data rates over long-distance signal propagation, [9]. Compared to laser
    modulators, LEDs are cheaper though they cover very short ranges. The arrangement
    of an LED array is designed in a hexagonal type pyramidal shape for high-intensity
    and long-distance optical beam propagation, as proposed in [148]. In this type
    of pyramidal LED array structure, a single lens is used to illuminate the LED.
    This structure must be very compact for the output signals. For the sake of a
    signal, the direction can be created by switching an intense beam towards the
    destination. B. Optical Receiver Optical receivers are the collection arrangements
    of all-optical signal transmission within a medium. In other words, receivers
    could be defined as the process of optical signal entities absorbed by the photodetector
    and the photons detection on its surface to generate an electrical signal called
    an optical receiver. The conversion process of photons energy into an electrical
    signal is performed through photoelectric effect. Otherwise stated, the received
    photons at the semiconductor junction diodes release either an electron or a hole.
    Subsequently, these released entities moved to the conductance and release their
    excessive energies [21]. The propagated optics are collected by a lens for the
    detection and demodulation process at the receiver end. A photo-sensor is used
    to convert optical signals for further analysis. Taking into account improving
    system performance, a photo-sensor is characterized as easily accessible, very
    cost-effective, robust, and small in size, along with the low current consumption
    [152]. To cope with these advantages, plenty of different types of photo-sensors
    are being used and summarized in recent surveys as [9], [152]. These photo-sensors
    are photo-resistors, phototransistors, photomultiplier tubes, avalanche photodiode
    (APD), p-n photodiodes, and a photon detector semiconductor, photo-sensors, and
    biologically-inspired quantum photo-sensors (BQP). PIN and avalanche photodiode
    (APD) are widely used as a photodetectors in optical communication [153]. SECTION
    V. Current Project Schemes on UVLC In this section, we provide the details of
    the most recent current project in underwater medium currently running worldwide.
    A wide detailed description are summarized in Table 6. Most recently, UNEXMIN
    project scheme [154] was launched and funded by the European Commission (EU) for
    3D mapping and more widely autonomous exploration of European flooded mines (AUEFM)
    during the period of 2016 – 2019. The main purpose of this project scheme was
    to develop a novel underwater robotic system for bathymetric, oceanographic, oceanic
    bathyscaphical data collection, and ocean exploration in 3D geographical imaging
    in real-time monitoring and video streaming. The Robotics Explorer is made by
    three robots named UX-1a, UX-1b, and UX-1c to adjoining for the purpose of valuable
    geological and mineralogical information collection. UX-1 is the first prototype
    was proposed to open the new technological lines and uncover mysterious challenges
    in this research project development. The first prototype was finished in April
    2018 and has been tested at the Kaatiala mine (Finnland), Idrija mine (Slovenia),
    during 2018, and later in Urgeirca mine (Portugal), Ecton mine (England), Molnar
    Janos cave (Hungary) during 2019. The Surf3DSLAM project [155] was coordinated
    by the University de Girona, Spain, and proposed an innovative research proposal
    for Probabilistic 3D Surface Matching for Bathymetry based Simultaneous Localization
    and Mapping (Surf3DSLAM) by deploying aquatic vehicles. The main challenges of
    this research project were navigation and detection of the exact position of the
    underwater vehicles. Further development of this project scheme proposed a remotely
    operated underwater vehicle (ROV) instead of AUV that supports low operational
    cost. The main objective of Surf3DSLAM was to accurately localize the ROVs and
    AUVs in 3D environmental space under the concept of simultaneous localization
    and mapping (SLAM). To associate SLAM within the 3D environment, the whole investigation
    was addressed as Surf3DSLAM. Surf3DSLAM framework mainly aimed to deploy AUVs
    for navigation purposes, replace other economical, efficient robotics vehicles,
    and further deploy for safe and precise surveys in an unguided aqueous environment.
    Most recently underwater activities are unveiling the mystery of occupied water
    territories and exploring natural mineral sources. Due to this, project scheme
    as Submarine Cultures Perform Long-Term Robotic Exploration of Unconventional
    Environmental (subCULTron) [156] was proposed and coordinated by the University
    Graz, Austria. This project was launched and aimed to achieve a long-lasting self-determination
    learning device, a self-configurable, self-maintainable underwater robotic tool
    in very high-impact-modified application areas in Italy. The main perspectives
    of this project are to develop a better quality of communication and energy harvesting
    among the underwater sensor nodes. The subCULTron is subdivided into few sections
    as the entitled project. The upper layer of sea surface in the proposed system,
    and the artificial objectives are introduced as the information collective robotic
    tools for long-run system exploration capabilities. The artificial robotic tool
    allows monitoring the marine environment, and the incredible natural oceanic environments,
    including biological materials such as algae, bacterium, and aquatic species.
    In contrast through subCULTron, a deployed artificial lily-pad on water surface
    communicates with human-culture and transmit energy along with the collected information
    from ship traffic. Apart from that, the artificial fish floats and exchanges information
    with mussels and lily-pad. The subCULTron is aimed to propose the real world for
    humans and animals in cohabitants of high impact such as venice canals and lagoon.
    Thus, the cultural evolution promotes a sub-culture development and an artificial
    society underwater along with the cultural services of human society over the
    water reservoir. The TRIDENT project scheme [157] formally known as Marine Robots,
    and Dexterous Manipulation for Enabling Autonomous Underwater Multipurpose Intervention
    Missions (MRDME-AUMIM) was proposed for multipurpose underwater challenges in
    highly turbid and complexity channel conditions. In other words, the development
    of novel methodology for marine robotics systems accommodates versatile dexterous
    adaption and the capabilities for operational activities in unguided underwater
    environments. This project scheme also has drawn attention to various specific
    skills in marine environments: navigation, bathymetric data, geographical mapping,
    vehicle-manipulator systems, dexterous manipulation, and the development of a
    wide range of intelligent control UWSNs architectural techniques. The project
    has been classified into two phases. In its first phase, the autonomous surface
    craft (ASC) is carried AUV towards the sector to be surveyed, while in the second
    phase, the assembly of ASC and AUV navigate the underwater targeted position.
    The latest project scheme [158] entitled Smart and Networking Under Water Robots
    in Cooperation Meshes (SWARMs) was funded by the EU and also coordinated by Universidad
    Politechnica de Madrid, succeeded to forward the extensive research of AUVs/ROVs
    to the next level. The further development of AUVs/ROVs research provides a solution
    to the threat of offshore industries. SWARM project aimed to expand a better utilization
    of robotics in underwater, various marine applications and offshore operations,
    which affects the assigned safety patterns and operational costs. The main attraction
    of the project research is to improve AUVs’ autonomy and enhance the usability
    of ROVs in the underwater environment. Moreover, no specialized underwater vehicles
    are required; instead of AUVs/ROVs work in a cooperative network; as a result,
    it opens the doors for new futuristic underwater applications. At a glance, the
    achievements of SWARM could be demonstrated in several testing sites and numerous
    applications such as inspection and water pollution monitoring. Oceans and seas
    are the source of life on earth and the most significant water source for humankind.
    Nevertheless, these water reservoirs are affected by human interactive activities.
    Therefore, exploring these massive water mediums are necessary by deploying artificial
    devices or robots, called marine robots. In general, the vitality of marine robotics
    technology is an enormous significance in an extensive range of functional underwater
    applications. These applications are mostly utilized to observe and monitor purpose
    and the life beneath the water surface, observation of water pollution, oil and
    gas rig observations, surveillance and coastal securities, fish farming, and early
    detection warning of natural disasters. Given this, an innovation of the project
    scheme Sibiu-HCEV [159], is introduced as the resolution of an intelligent hybrid
    high capacity electric underwater ROVs. The Sibiu-HCEV is an underwater floatable
    robot at different depths in an unguided water environment that is an innovative
    invention in underwater robotics technology to reduce risk to the capital expenditure
    (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX). Marine robotics industries are rapidly
    growing up to uncover the complexity of harsh oceanic environments. The marine
    robots have pulled back the curtains of the mysterious thesaurus of the deepest
    oceans. This underwater robotics industrial sector is a crucial, significantly
    cost-effective domain with considerable entry barriers to resources and developments.
    The project EUMarineRobots [160] is aimed to extend the underwater challenges
    into more depth, remotely operations, and in the very hostile marine environment.
    Additionally, the aim of EUMarineRobots are deploying for a full range of air
    and open international access to Europe. EUMarineRobots has an impressive research
    group from ten countries in marine robotics research infrastructure network. This
    network distinguishes the various technical infrastructures for diverse navigation
    beyond marine and in the marine robotic sectors. Since the early ages, underwater
    applications are based on acoustic links for long range communications. However,
    RF and optical waves are capable of supporting large bandwidth and high data rates
    but efficiently attenuated due to the physio-chemical vitality of the marine environment.
    The primary objectives of the project were recently proposed as UNDERWORLD [161]
    to re-evaluate the electromagnetic communication through UWSNs deployment for
    various underwater applications such as navigation, localization, natural disaster,
    detection of coral reefs, and coastal security purposes in real-time scenarios.
    This project aims to enhance industrialization in marine observatory systems,
    naval tactical operations, seaport management infrastructures, and underwater
    environmental monitoring. Moreover, underwater environmental monitoring in an
    aqueous medium is widely deployed with acoustic waves, but these applications
    apply in shallow waters such as rivers, dams, lakes, and remotely coastal areas.
    Throughout this project scheme. Another main contribution of this project is to
    improve the characteristics of antennas for two ways of communication among transceivers.
    Earthquakes, Tsunami, and floods are sudden natural events which occur due to
    an imbalance of water reservoirs and waves (water currents). These events are
    entirely impossible to control or prevent but can be detected earlier by deploying
    the sensors nodes or anchored architecture of UWSNs with the sea bottoms. The
    seismometers are used to sense the unacceptable seismic frequency at a standardized
    scale. These seismometers are highly detectable sensor nodes those capable for
    detecting and recording waves emitted by the most miniature earthquakes. It is
    far expensive to deploy seismometers at the ocean bottom to investigate water
    currents and seismic waves detection. Due to these issues, the novel project scheme
    funded by the EU entitled Ocean-DAS had recently proposed new tools for underwater
    seismology through ocean-bottom distributed acoustic sensors [162]. The main aim
    of Ocean-DAS is to develop a low-cost deployable alternatives for monitoring seismicity
    in remote areas of the oceans. The Ocean-DAS are enabled with the fiber optical
    wires for telecommunication which transforms the data into powerful seismic sensing
    arrays. Through the support of this opto-electronic unit, more than a 50km span
    could be monitored. The most recent project scheme is proposed entitled as Cooperative
    Underwater Surveillance Networks (COUSIN) funded by Engineering and Physical Sciences
    Research Council (EPSRC) [163] during 2021s to 2023s. The project scheme focuses
    on the underwater surveillance system for a specific country or region. The surveillance
    system is investigated for more precise benefits in various underwater applications
    in numerous fields such as pollution monitoring, coastal or harbor securities,
    import and export duties, human trafficking, smuggling, maintaining integrity,
    and detecting attacks on underwater infrastructure. The main expected contribution
    of this project scheme is to track, target and search for suspicious objects,
    and convey information to the base station for further investigation. The detectable
    target through this project scheme could be an artificial object such as UUV,
    surface vehicle, submarine, source of pollution, underwater species, active volcanos,
    oil & gas pipeline repaitment, ice objects, or divers, etc. Furthermore, surveillance
    and underwater monitoring are the main functions through the long-range acoustic
    link. For underwater geographical mapping and target detection, the SONAR waves
    are the key beneficial technologies while over the sea-surface detection, radio
    detection and ranging (RADAR) are the most widely used. The main objective of
    COUSIN is to design a low-cost underwater acoustic network to improve the underwater
    monitoring and surveillance system capabilities. The current ongoing project scheme
    entitled Technologies for Ocean Sensing (TechOceanS) [164] funded by the European
    Commission (EC) and coordinated by the National Oceanography Center, UK. TechOceanS
    is organized by the research group of ten universities in Europe. The oceans are
    affected by human beings by flushing and trashing unwanted decomposable materials
    such as plastics that are threatening to harm underwater species. Due to human
    activities direct and indirect involvement in the underwater environment, the
    ice caps melt, and the water level rises. Therefore, an urgent need to deploy
    an advanced ocean observational technology through resistance to extract the decompose
    plastic materials. At first glance, the project has developed the scheme to monitor
    and observe ocean biology, chemical composition changes, and plastic monitoring
    through underwater vehicles nine pioneering technologies. The proposed novel solution
    by TechnOceanS is comprised of a group of five sensors; the two sensors are used
    for imaging data collection of the specified seabed, marine biology, and plastics.
    A sampler is used to collect thousands of particle samples for further analysis
    and the rest of use for a new artificial intelligence (AI)- based image processing
    method for data compression and information transmission. The most recent proceeding
    project scheme established for Long Distance Underwater Wireless Optical Communication
    System using Visible Light Laser Array with Directivity Control Function (LD-UWC-VLC-LADCF)
    [165], and funded by Japan Society for the Promotion Science (JSPS). The purpose
    of this scheme is to improve the quality of visible light signaling over long
    ranges in the underwater environment. In this research perspective, the main two
    challenges are extending the transmission distance in gigabit-class with high-speed
    UWOC. The first point is the verification of the effect of distance extension
    while multiple visible light laser are propagated propagating in a high turbid
    water medium. Secondly, the construction of a light beam in a particular direction
    through evaluating the experimental data available. TABLE 6 The Latest Underwater
    Communication Project Schemes are Currently Running All Around the World. Additionally,
    the Future Directions and the Most Significant Contribution in the Scientific
    Community, Underwater Applications, and the Results of the Corresponding Project
    Schemes are Summarized SECTION VI. Computational Methods Nowadays, solving complex
    and huge data-based problems are typically possible without a real experimental
    setups. This is achieved through simulation-enabled computer science and engineering
    methodologies. Moreover, computational engineering methods support automaticity,
    design, and optimization of the complex problems. Therefore, the computational
    research methods provide the new advancements investigating the mythologies in
    computing such as algorithms, models, simulations, and system performances in
    order to understand the complexity of social, biological, technological, and everlasting
    patterns and their behaviors [166]. These computational research methodologies
    provide a solution for better understanding of random behavior of the system as
    follows: Automatically categorization and information extraction of the selected
    data-sets; Differentiate a bulk data into a specific group and particular level
    for the analysis; The system design and model of the emergence of new behaviors
    from individual-level interactions; A detailed explanation of emergence of a system
    network; Recognizes and refrigerates the thresholds within a complex system; Classifies
    and finds a the pattern within the massive data-sets for further analysis by using
    other techniques; Identify meaningful structural patterns within the webs of relationships.
    In more detail, computational engineering methodologies are defined as the development
    and exploitation of more realistic computational models. As a result, the computational
    engineering methodology opens new perspectives and challenges of more sophisticated
    key problems of huge data structures. Additionally, computational methodologies
    are numerically mathematical and depends heavily on computer architectural system.
    It means that the numerical efficiency should be achieved by extracting the maximum
    amount of correct information from the minimum number of grid points, as well
    as establishing a linear proportionality between the incoming time and the unknown
    number. Due to this, several computational approaches are studied in this study
    as follows. A. Monte-Carlo Computational Method The probabilistic format of the
    computational method is widely known as the Monte-Carlo simulation. In UWOC, this
    computational method is used to track the number of photons emitted by an optical
    source within the underwater medium. A high bandwidth underwater optical communication
    channel by utilizing Monte-Carlo simulation is widely discussed in [167]. The
    simulation approach of photons propagation is rigorous within turbid medium, in
    a more detailed description, Monte-Carlo simulation computational methods are
    used to provide the specific details of the propagated photons geometry as mentioned
    in [168] and [169]. Generally, the optical signals propagation depends on the
    medium waves. This is an alternative computational approach to eliminate the unbounded
    error growth in co-variance equation computationally as described in [170]. B.
    Numerical Modeling of Wave Propagation As aforementioned, that the optical beam
    spreads in an underwater medium and depends on the water flow (channel conditions).
    The different types of water flow have been categorized and summarized according
    to the flow pattern in [171]. Laminar flow is defined as where the fluid particles
    move along in a well-defined path and each water layer slides smoothly over the
    adjacent layer. While the turbulent flow is defined as the zig-zag flow pattern
    of water particles. The laminar flow changes into turbulent flow if the Reynold’s
    number is more than that 4000. The Reynold’s condition satisfies as laminar flow
    below 2000, otherwise turbulent flow [172]. Due to this, the optical beam propagation
    experiences a huge loss due to turbulence, signal absorption, and scattering by
    the suspended particles within the medium. Therefore, the necessity is to model
    the turbulence channel. Moreover, a numerical method for free surface flow that
    builds for nonlinear shallow water equation and utilizes a non-hydro-static pressure
    term to describe short waves are presented in [173]. C. Beer Lambert’s Law Computational
    methods are employed as the most significant solution for optical signaling in
    underwater mediums. An ordinary simulation method is widely employs for optical
    signaling in an aqueous medium known as Beer Lambert’s law. This law is described
    the optical signal attenuation due to the existence of suspended particles underwater.
    It is mathematically defined as the function of optical received signal power,
    the Euclidean distance apart from the transceivers, and the extinction coefficient
    of the medium. This type of channel model is used for optical signaling for any
    type of water availability, especially, for path loss fading. The mathematical
    expression of Beer Lambert’s law is shown below: P r (λ,d)= P t exp−c(λ)d, (33)
    View Source where P r and P t are denoted as the received and transmitted optical
    signal strength at the receiver and transmitter ends. Also, the extinction coefficient
    c(λ) is the sum of total optical signal absorption and scattering which are the
    optical wavelength dependents. The experimental values of extinction coefficient,
    for the readers references are widely discussed in [5], [82], [84], [86], and
    [174]. Additionally, due to transceivers physical parameters, geometrical losses
    are also considered for diffused LDs and semi-collimated light sources LEDs. Therefore,
    the modified Beer-Lambert law is the function of path loss ( h pl ) and geometrical
    losses ( h gl ) are given as [101], h l ≈ = h pl + h gl , ( D r θ F ) 2 d −2 t
    exp(−c ( D r θ F ) τ d 1−τ t ). (34) View Source The contributed channel condition
    coefficient h l in terms of path loss and geometrical losses are presented in
    (34). In (34), the receiver aperture diameter D r , full-width transmitter beam
    divergence angle θ F , and correction coefficient τ are defined. According to
    [101], the maximum achievable distance between communication nodes to obtain the
    BER performance of the vertically point-point system is given as follows, d= ⎡

    electrical to optical conversion efficiency, and correction coefficient. D. Radiative
    Transfer Differential Theory and Computational Method Radiative transfer theory
    (RTE) deals with computing derivatives of radiometric measures with respect to
    desired visual of geometrical parametrization, and facilitates the gradient-based
    optimization in various applications [175]. Additionally, the RTE is deployable
    in neutron transportation, astrophysics, and biomedical image analysis [175],
    [176]. Furthermore, the energy conservation-based radio transfer theory is used
    to model the optical waves in participating media. For better RTE understanding
    the assumptions are made, if considers the test volume V⊆ R 3 with the corresponding
    boundary ∂V , and the interior radiance field L(s,ω) is defined over the position
    s∈V/∂V , and light-transport directions ω∈ S 2 . Then, the RTE equation given
    as follows [175], L=( K T K C + K S )L+ L (0) , (36) View Source where, K T ,
    K C , and K S are denoted as the transport operator, collision operator, and interfacial
    scattering operator, respectively. Additionally, the Reynolds transport theorem
    is also an alternative method to solve computational problems. The Reynolds theorem
    for f scalar value function is defined for n -dimensional manifold ω parameterized
    with some π∈R as (37). If it is an assumption that Γ(π)⊂V(π) be an (n−1) dimensional
    manifold given by the union of the external boundary ∂V(π) and the internal one
    containing the discontinuous locations of f . Then, Reynold’s theorem could be
    specified as follows [177], ∂ π ( ∫ V(π) fdV(π)) = ∫ V(π) f ˙ dV(π)+ ∫ Γ(π) <n,
    x ˙ >Γ(π). (37) View Source Furthermore, f ˙ := ∂ π , x ˙ := ∂ π x , dV and dΓ

    the dot (inner product between two vectors.) Furthermore, n is the normal direction
    at each x∈Γ(π) . E. The Data Assimilation Algorithms for Numerical Models The
    data assimilation refers to the procedure of incorporating data into a model simulation
    to improve the upcoming predictions. The predictions of the system behavior can
    be defined by the measurement of the physically numerical based model. More specifically,
    the system should be more simplified for a better understanding of computational
    methods. In many applications, the data assimilation approaches are accurate to
    describe the dynamic behavior of the system. Utilizing the data assimilation techniques
    the measurement and model outcomes are used to obtain an optimal estimation of
    the state of the system. However, the main hurdles in advanced data assimilation
    schemes are the bulky computational load that is required for solving a real problem.
    On the other hand, the assimilation algorithm is an essential tool to obtain efficient
    variational data for further analysis. Due to this, More accurate data assimilation
    methods are variational data assimilation and Kalman filtering computational method
    is widely used. Data assimilation for minimization computational method widely
    discussed in [178] as follows, X k+1 =f( X k ,p,k)+B(k,p) u k , X 0 = x 0 (38)
    View Source where X k is the system state, u k is the input of the system, f is
    a nonlinear function, p is a vector containing the uncertain parameters, and B(k)
    is an input matrix. Besides, the Kalman filter assimilation computational method
    could be written as, X k+1 =F(k) X k +B(k) u k +G(k) W k , (39) View Source where
    the Gaussian noise process is denoted by W k with zero mean and covariance matrix
    Q(k) and G(k) is the noise input matrix. SECTION VII. UVLC Channel Modelling Modeling
    of UWOC channel leads to a better understanding of optical signal propagation
    and supports exploring aqueous mediums. UVLC is considered an alternative communication
    media to meet the requirements in high data rate, large bandwidth, and high communication
    speed to deploy in various underwater applications. Moreover, for long ranges
    UVLC communication, the necessity is to design a system for efficient signal transmission.
    Generally, the signal absorption reduces the signal strength that is attenuated
    in the transmitted signal. Despite that, the scattering phenomena is responsible
    for the optical beam deflection from its initial position, this contributes to
    signal fading. As a result, Monte-Carlo simulation is being used, which is an
    alternative approach to deal with the statistical methodology for the evaluation
    of channel characteristics by generating a number of random photons and further
    obtained the simulation performance interaction of each photon within the medium
    [179]. Optical signal propagation is categorized into two main streams based on
    the type of detection techniques. They are: non-coherent intensity modulation
    and direct detection (IM/DD) signal modulation technique. However, the IM/DD is
    generally used as an optical signal modulation scheme to decode information at
    the receiver. In non-coherent systems, the detector directly detects information
    through emitted light. Another aspect of the signal detection technique is the
    coherent detection, where a local oscillator (LO) is being used to mix optical
    signals before detection which improves the receiver sensitivity [180]. In more
    contrast, coherent and heterodyne detection techniques are widely discussed as
    in [29]. A local oscillator uses incoherent detection scheme which comprises of
    the received signal to the carrier beam detected by the photodetector. Furthermore,
    the coherent detection scheme is also sub-categorized into two main classes as
    heterodyne and homodyne detection [21]. The LO operates as the same frequency
    with the optical signal in the homodyne detection scheme, while the frequency
    could be different in the heterodyne detection scheme. In the VLC setup, the system
    consists of an optical transmitter for signal modulation by LED illumination phenomena.
    On the other hand, a receiver enables a photosensitive diode for the decoding
    process from the detected light power. The block diagram consists of a transmitter
    and a receiving system depicted by Fig. 8. The different approaches use to model
    the undersea VLC system. A. Oceanic Turbulence Channel Modeling The most influential
    optical signal phenomenon is channel turbidity. Turbulence occurs due to random
    fluctuation in the refractive index of the water medium caused by the variation
    in temperature and salinity. Therefore, turbulence phenomena affects the performance
    of optical signal propagation in an aqueous medium. The affecting performance
    and channel modeling of highly turbid water mediums are presented in existing
    literature [100], [102], [181]–[183]. The fluctuation in the refractive index
    is directly related to the nature of the water channel as a function of temperature,
    salinity, pressure, and density. Due to increasing underwater depth, the temperature
    decreases and pressure increases; nevertheless, the water is slightly compressible
    affecting highly pressurized and dense water environments. Taking into account
    underwater turbulence, the scintillation index ( σ 2 I ) leads turbidity which
    is the main cause of optical signal fading. In more detail, the broad study of
    modified underwater optical turbulence (UOT) model is investigated mathematically
    by (40), as shown at the bottom of the next page, Show All [184]. As stated UOT
    spectrum model in (40), where κ , ϵ and C 0 , C 1 is defined the magnitude of
    the spatial frequency, dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass
    of fluid and fluid constants, respectively. Moreover, Kolmogorov micro-scale length
    η is represented ratio of kinematic viscosity ( ν ) and ϵ . The dissipation rate
    of mean-squared refractive index χ n , the thermal expansion coefficient α , and
    saline contraction coefficients are given as, χ n = α 2 χ T + β 2 χ S −2αβ χ TS
    . (41) View Source Considering plane and spherical wave models of scintillation
    index ( σ 2 I ) for different Gaussian beams are widely discussed in [185]–[187].
    However, the scintillation index is defined as the variance of the received signal
    normalized intensity I , which is expressed in [8], σ 2 I = ⟨ I 2 ⟩− ⟨I⟩ 2 ⟨I
    ⟩ 2 . (42) View Source As varying scintillation index causes heavy turbulence,
    that can be highly affect of optical signal propagation. It means the more unsatisfactory
    performance of the system and degrades the system efficiency. Various existing
    works are recorded to channel models in weak and heavy turbidity channel conditions.
    In existing research, plenty of statistical channel models under weak turbulence
    intensity fluctuation and mathematically are defined PDFs for turbulence. The
    experimental model under lognormal distribution is mentioned as in [100], [188]–[190].
    Therefore, the probability density function (PDF) of turbulence channel condition
    under lognormal distribution is given as follows, f I (I)= exp(− (ln(I)−2 μ n
    ) 2 8 χ 2 n ) 8π χ 2 n h 2 − − − − − − √ . (43) View Source In spite of strong
    turbulence channel conditions, UVLC channel model into successive j th number
    of water layers, and following Gamma-Gamma (GG) distribution model is proposed
    as in [33] and [114], f I j ( I j )=2 ( α j β j ) ( α j + β j ) 2 Γ( α j )Γ( β

    kind are denoted by Γ(⋅) and K ( α j − β j ) (⋅) , respectively. The PDF in (44),
    for normalization conditions it satisfies the equality of turbulence channel coefficient
    as E{ I J } 2 =1. Besides of it, the scintillation index for GG distribution is
    given as [191], σ 2 I j = 1 α j + 1 β j + 1 α j β j . (45) View Source Furthermore,
    under-consideration of j th vertical water layers, the large and small scale factors
    for the plane wave model are defined by α j and β j respectively. The α j and
    β j can be written as follows [33], [183], α j = β j = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜
    ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0.49 χ 2 I j (1+1.11 χ 12 5 I j ) 7 6 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ −1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ −1

    the scintillation index which is known as Rytov variance [102]. Consequently,

    β k = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0.49 χ 2 I k (1+0.18 d 2 +0.56 χ 12 5 I

    ≫1 depends for large scale cells for plane wave model while χ 2 I k ≪1 for small
    scale cells. However, in (46) and (47) the Rytov variance is modeled [184, Eq.

    Pointing Errors and Non-LOS Communication Link Pointing error is another issue
    in optical signal propagation that contributes to the signal fading in the underwater
    environment. Due to the random water current flow and movement of floating nodes,
    a uniform constant tracking pointing system necessary to maintain for a reliable
    communication link. Generally, the pointing error is defined and considered with
    the two essential categories as bore-sight and jitter [195]. For more detail,
    in [195] the authors are defined the bore-sight determines on a stable displacement
    transceiver (between detector center and the beam center), whereas jitter is the
    random displacement process between of beam center at the detector plane [196].
    Under consideration of Gaussian beam model for jitter phenomenon, if the optical
    beam propagates through the distance z between the source and destination along
    with the collected beam at the detector end with beam radius a . Then, the collected
    power at the receiver is given as [100], [195] [197], h p (R;z)≈ A p exp(− 2 R
    2 Ω 2 zeq ). (51) View Source In (51), R denotes the random radial displacement
    at the receiver that could be further expressed as R= R 2 x + R 2 y − − − − −

    of the collected power is denoted by A p at R=0 . The fraction of the collected

    with pointing error displacement standard deviation at the receiver end is presented
    by ζ= Ω 2 σ s . On the other hand, if neglecting the pointing error, then the
    observation the misalignment of the transceivers is modeled by utilizing the beam
    spread function (BSF) as [85]. SECTION VIII. Modulation, Demodulation, and Channel
    Coding Techniques for UVLC VLC signal modulation is totally different from terrestrial-based
    communication cause of non-encoding features in phase, and amplitude [198]. In
    general, the accomplishment of LEDs in the VLC system has triple features as illumination,
    high-speed data communication, and energy harvesting simultaneously [27]. The
    Maximum Flickering Time-Period (MFTP) of the light should be minimized for the
    minimal flickering phenomena [31]. On the other hand, the dimming process control
    of light supports the potential energy conservation purposes [31]. Generally,
    VLC modulation techniques deploy under IM/DD, and coherent modulation (CM) based
    scheme, which is further classified as a single carrier modulation (SCM), multi-carrier
    modulation (MCM), and color domain-based modulation (CDBM) schemes [3]. The various
    type of VLC modulation schemes are summarized by the Table 7. Moreover, the pictorial
    classification of VLC modulation techniques is depicted by Fig. 9. It is noteworthy
    that IM/DD modulation schemes are less suitable for high-data-rate applications
    [21]. For that reason, there is an alternative option Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM)
    which is used to modulate the intensity of the continuous optical waves and widely
    use for laser beams propagation [199]. Although the CM scheme offers more advantages
    over IM/DD enabled system in detection performance and minimize the background
    noise, the better sensitivity of the receiver, low cost, and complexity to install
    setup [200]. Modulation schemes are the most critical ways to expand bandwidth,
    such as OOK, pulse position modulation (PPM), and pulse width modulation (PMW)
    have advantages regarding system complexity when using to enhance the performance
    of the VLC system. However, the Discrete Multitone (DMT) modulation, OFDM modulation,
    and Carrier-less Amplitude Phase (CAP) modulation have better spectral efficiency
    [27]. TABLE 7 Consider the Underwater Optical Modulation Techniques, the Single
    Carrier Modulation Scheme (SCM), and Color Shift Keying (CSK) are Summarized in
    This Table. The Research Objectives, Design System Model, and Future Directions
    are Also Briefly Described A. Single Carrier Modulation Scheme In SCM, the communication
    setup leads to improve channel capacity. Nevertheless, the system complexity is
    increased due to the cost factor. The IM/DD setups have several benefits as easy
    to install, very cost-effective, and less complex as compared with the coherent
    system. The photo-detectors are used to convert optical signals into electrical
    signals under IM/DD technique. As the dimming process is widely noticed in optical
    signaling consequently, several dimming processes have been proposed in [201].
    Furthermore, the PPM, DMT, and OOK are also proposed to accommodate dimming phenomena
    [202]. Generally, for regular system model design, signal carrier modulation (SCM)
    schemes are widely used. In consideration of SCM- IM/DD, several modulation techniques
    are investigated such as OOK, PAM, variable pulse position modulation (VPPM) and
    differential pulse position modulation (DPPM) pulse position modulation (PPM),
    pulse width modulation (PWM) and color shift keying (CSK), etc., [21], [27] and
    are mentioned in Table 7. B. OOK Modulation Scheme Under Consideration IM/DD IM/DD
    scheme is well known and easy to install, and a cost-effective signal propagation
    scheme. In this scheme, the signals have to propagate through the source directly
    or by the external modulator. Despite the receiver side, the signal information
    is demodulated through the direct detection process; therefore, the whole system
    is named as intensity-modulation & direct-detection. An ordinary process to modulate
    optical signal information through light and the intensity regulated by the OOK
    scheme. The illumination of LEDs are turned “off” and “on” phenomena according
    to the bit-stream as the digital numbers “0” and “1” [27]. Such as the presence
    and absence pulse phenomena of light intensity depending on the bit duration.
    The LEDs are not completely turned off in the “off states”; nevertheless, the
    signal intensity level decreases in this state. The OOK scheme uses and is divided
    into the pulse format with a return to zero (RZ) and without a return to zero
    (NRZ), [29]. In a more vast discussion, the format contains the digital bits “1”
    in NRZ while the RZ format occupies the remaining parts of the bits represented
    by “0”. The performance of the OOK modulation technique severely degrades and
    can be improved by updating the higher modulation schemes as followed in Table
    7. C. Pulse Modulation Schemes Aforementioned, the OOK modulation technique is
    an essential signal modulation scheme that supports low data rates with low performances.
    Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is more tolerant of the effect of the multi-path
    channel as mentioned in [27]. PAM modulation scheme is the process where the message
    is encoded in terms of amplitude of the optical pulse. Despite the PAM scheme,
    OOK is recorded as widely used under consideration of IM/DD optical communication
    scheme because of its simplicity and resilience to the intrinsic nonlinearities
    of laser origin. Even, in pulse position modulation (PPM) scheme, the division
    of symbol k is transmitted into an equal time slot within the 2 M constellation
    symbol M . A single pulse in PPM scheme during each symbol period suffers from
    low data-rate [45]. To cope up with this issue in PPM, a pulse width modulation
    (PWM) scheme is investigated as in [231], where it deals with dimming control
    cause of lower intensity control and varies with the pulse width proportion of
    the instantaneous values of the signals. Therefore, for multi-pulse in each symbol-time
    transmission the multi-pulse modulation (M-PPM) scheme was proposed [29]. On the
    other hand, in [3], authors comprised as PAM required more power for large bandwidth
    while PPM suffers low spectral efficiency. Continuously developing of optical
    pulse modulation schemes, a differential pulse position modulation (DPPM) scheme
    is introduced to improve the overall throughput spectral efficiency of PPM [232].
    However, the DPPM is based on a very short pulse duration width for an alternative
    signal propagation. Due to this, the combination of DPPM and PWM in the form of
    DPWM has achieved a higher bandwidth efficiency than PPM and OOK. The most significant
    advantage of DPWM is that it solves the narrow pulse problem and has low power
    efficiency. To control the brightness of the LED in the PPM scheme, a Variable
    PPM (VPPM) is proposed as in [233]. However, the VPPM combines PWM and 2-PPM,
    which control the brightness and data transmission along with the controlling
    dimming level to flickering position. As a result, the multiple Pulse Position
    Modulation (MPPM) has gained a more power-efficient scheme than OOK, PAM, and
    PPM. Taken into an account of optimum power and bandwidth efficiency, a hybrid
    Multiple Pulse Amplitude and Position Modulation (MPAPM) signal propagation scheme
    is proposed in [234]. However, an Overlapping Pulse Position Modulation (OPPM)
    [235] is proposed for improving bandwidth efficiency and high data-rate in MPPM.
    Utilizing VPPM for data transmission, the system offers complexity; an alternative
    approach, a Variable Rate Multi-pulse Modulation (VR-MPPM) [233], is investigated
    to cope with the complex issues to achieve both data rate and brightness control
    simultaneously. Furthermore, an expurgated PPM (E-PPM) modulation scheme is proposed
    to improve the performance of a peak-power limited M-ary communication system
    mentioned in Table 7. D. Color Domain Based Shift Keying (CSK) Modulation Color
    Phase Shift Keying (CSK) is defined by VLC IEEE 802.15.7 standard to improve system
    performance compared with other modulation schemes [45]. The IEEE standards for
    the CSK scheme are categorized into three sub-categories based on data rates known
    as PHY-I operates 11.67 to 266.6 kb/s, PHY-II operates on 1.25 to 96 Mb/s and
    PHY-III that is operated on 12 to 96 Mb/s [31]. CSK modulation is the color space
    chromaticity dependent on utilizing the three colors intensities as Green, Red,
    and Blue LED of the source. The main principle of multi-color LED is the color
    shift keying where the VLC beam implemented as 4-CSK, 8-CSK, and 16-CSK modulation
    schemes light sources. The 3-Color CSK [210] and 4-CSK modulation schemes are
    proposed based on IEEE 802.15.7 standard [211]. The different CSK modulation schemes
    have been proposed in [236]–[238] and Table 7. E. Coherent & Multi-Carrier Modulation
    Techniques Despite IM/DD modulation scheme, the coherent scheme employs both phase
    and amplitude signals to modulate corresponding information. A local oscillator
    is used to convert the optical signals at the receiver end, which are referred
    to homodyne and hetrodyne detection mechanism. As a result, the coherent modulation
    scheme supports a high spectral efficiency and background noise resistivity but
    more channel complexity. However, multi-carrier modulation schemes are followed
    OFDM, where orthogonal sub-carriers are used as data transmission. A particular
    fading channel is converted into a flat fading channel as in the OFDM technique
    and using as a single tap equalizer. The different types of OFDM-based optical
    modulation schemes are proposed in open literature [239], [240]. The various multi-carrier
    modulation schemes are summarized in Table 7. The signals are converted from parallel
    format into serial ones for demodulation by using IFFT and then further transmitting
    to the LED transmitter. At the receiver end, the signal demodulation process happens
    by photo-diode (PD). Several multi-carrier modulation techniques are discussed
    in further Tables and subsections. DCO-OFDM:- Generally, OFDM uses RF communication
    which cannot be directly accessible to use in VLC because of the real and unipolar
    values of optical signals [241]. Therefore the conversion is needed; firstly,
    the bipolar signals are transformed into unipolar format and then the non-positive
    integers should be clipped. Generally, the RF-OFDM signals are converted into
    optical-OFDM by the Hermitian symmetry method. In contrast, the DC-bias converts
    into bipolar OFDM, which is known as DCO-OFDM. The mathematical expression of
    DC bias is given as [241], B DC =μ E{x(t ) 2 } − − − − − − − √ , (53) View Source
    where DC bias is defined by B DC of 10 log 10 ( μ 2 +1) dB. The proportionality
    constant and standard deviation of unclipped signals are represented by μ and
    E{x(t ) 2 } − − − − − − − √ , respectively. On the other hand, the expression
    for clipping operation can be written as follows [241], x(t)={ x 0 (t), 0, if  x
    0 (t)>0 if  x 0 (t)≤0. View Source The continuous development of LED carries new
    trends in optical communication. It is obvious that in DCO-OFDM, the power efficiency
    decreases while the modulation sequence increases. This makes it less compatible
    with several VLC applications. Therefore, a substitutional modulation technique
    is required. The novel substitutional technique is investigated only heterogeneous
    subcarriers for operation and also removes subcarriers known as ACO-OFDM [213].
    In contrast, the drawback of ACO-OFDM spectral efficiency is that half of DCO-OFDM
    causes half of the subcarriers rejection. PAM-DMT [221] has become an alternative
    methodology based on Fourier transform properties. In PAM-DMT, the real part of
    the signals is ignored while considering the imaginary values of the received
    signals. Moreover, for unipolar OFDM, the Flip-OFDM was also proposed [230]. The
    recently proposed Flip-OFDM technique is classified into two classes. In this
    classification, the second class is the replica of the original one. It means
    both of the classes contain the equivalency under DC bias-based modulation techniques.
    Therefore, in DCO-OFDM, the spectral efficiency falls up to half rather than ACO-OFDM.
    F. Hybrid Modulation Techniques In optical signaling, long distances coverage
    is challenging. For covering, long-range communication hybrid links are the key
    solution approaches for further wireless communication and mentioned in Table
    4 and Table 4. A single LED is used to transmit the signal in the further development
    of hybrid links instead of multiple arrays of LEDs. To deal with the issues in
    hybrid communication, spatial optical OFDM (SO-OFDM) is proposed. The SO-OFDM
    has received better BER performance than DCO-OFDM [241]. On the contrary, the
    reverse polarity optical OFDM (RPO-OFDM) is also introduced to control LED illumination
    in the VLC system [227]. The combined PWM technique deals with the real values
    in optical OFDM to control dimming phenomena in the VLC system. SECTION IX. Optical
    Energy Harvesting (OEH) The integration of IoTs, is a novel approach for wireless
    signaling in an underwater environment through IoUTs [70]. Optical waves can carry
    information and transfer energy simultaneously to power up the batteries of communication
    nodes. Even, to deploy an underwater communication setup is much more challenging
    than terrestrial-based communication. Therefore, the UVLC techniques are the potential
    wireless candidates for communication and energy transmitting media within the
    communication networks. Due to this, simultaneously, light-wave information and
    power transfer (SLIPT) has been proposed as a potential wireless candidate for
    communication and power transmission through optical link connectivity [242].
    Compared with simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT),
    SLIPT performs better in specific channel condition requirements. This section
    provides an overview of SLIPT methodology through time, power, and spatial space
    dependency. Moreover, the LEDs are capable of transmitting signals in underwater
    environments with conveniently low-cost rather than RF signaling [20]. Internet-connected
    devices are the power-hungry tools those need to harvest energy being in an active
    mode. WPT is quite challenging among wireless nodes, specifically underwater.
    Although this, WPT has gained research attention in the most recent years [41],
    [243]–[245]. Initially, the idea of WPT came up during the 1890s [246]. Later
    on, the integration of WPT was triggered by SWIPT, where only electromagnetic
    waves carry information and power in different required application scenarios.
    SWIPT has become a futuristic digital energy transmitting technology in the wireless
    communication domain. However, RF-energy harvesting (RF-EH) systems experienced
    major technical problems due to transceiver circuits and suffered from relatively
    low efficiency. It is noteworthy that EM waves propagate over few meters in the
    underwater environment. Consequently, to get rid of the radiation rate of EM waves,
    it is replaced by VLC enabled light sources such as laser diode and LEDs. A hybrid
    RF and light-wave power transfer scheme with the color diversity of optical beam
    has been recorded in [247]. The authors in [247], are proposed a novel RF-VLC
    ultra-small cell network and the proposed system model consists of multiple terminal
    devices along with an optical angle-diversity transmitter with a multi-antenna
    RF access point. For shallow water communication, the fading of the optical signal
    due to the limited sunlight or background light effect is the leading cause of
    EH harvesting efficiency. SLIPT methodology can be a complementary energy harvesting
    (EH) approach to transfer energy via visible light in IoUT networking system.
    For instance, the RF/VCL hybrid communication and EH scheme is proposed in [248],
    where the authors designed a VLC link to harvest energy at the relay and furthered
    this harvested energy by transferring it with the base station through an RF link.
    However, a more sophisticated optical transceivers setup is required in the SLIPT
    scenario based on modulation and demodulation schemes, including the time, power,
    and space splitting format. A. Switching Technologies As the main concern of the
    SLIPT scenario, the switching technique has played the most significant role in
    transmission power and simultaneously information transmission. Generally, time,
    power, and space switching schemes are proposed in the open literature [249].
    In the time switching aspect, the receiver acts to decode information in the time
    slot t , whether the reaming time slot (1−t) is assigned for the harvesting energy.
    Furthermore, the received signals split into photo-voltaic and photo-conductive
    modes of receiving as well as decoding the signals. In addition, the low-power
    hybrid system can perform the function of switching between two solar cell modes
    in the cooperative communication aspect. While in power splitting mode, the receiving
    terminal self charges and detects the incident light beam information. The light
    beam splits into dual power factors as α and ( 1−α ), respectively. The power
    factor Pα is responsible for EH; else remaining power fraction P(1−α) is assigned
    for information decoding. In this power splitting scenario, the power splitting
    component could function passively; the reason is splitting the incident beam
    divides into two portions. Nevertheless, in this scenario, it is considering n
    th number of transceivers in a communication system and functioning for energy
    harvesting capabilities and information decoding. In this type of system architecture,
    the spatial splitting approach applicable. In this anticipated system design,
    each transmitter node is independent of each others and could transmit the signal
    and energy received by each receiving node. Furthermore, the time switching SPLIT
    approach could be utilized within this scenario for the same receiver, which acts
    as “Energy Harvester” and “Signal Decoder” over different periods. These two switching
    techniques would be beneficial to deploy in critical environments such as undersea
    and underground communication and wireless energy transfer. For long-range communication,
    the UWSNs are deployed within a particular depth in an undersea environment. Being
    in an active mode of sensor networks to replace the batteries and transfer energy
    wirelessly is quite challenging. To cope up with this issue, a novel hybrid SWIPT
    and SLIPT wireless power transfer techniques are investigated [247]. RF and light-wave
    power transfers are complement to each other in their relative profits and losses
    during signal propagation. An alternatively switchable process towards the 5GB
    wireless network to transfer power in shallow waters over moderate depth in underwater
    mediums is summarized in this section. SWIPT and SLIPT are the EH utility process
    where signal energy is converted into usable electric energy. An EH-system harvests
    the energy from nature such as solar energy, wind, rising temperature, and vibrational
    EH approaches are recorded in [250]. As, we are surrounded by an electronic world,
    embedded devices, remote sensors, and low-power electronic devices are necessarily
    required for power transfer and batteries to store the electrical capacity. Due
    to the limitations of the battery lifespan, they should be replaced as per requirement.
    In underwater SLIPT, the signal recognition and simultaneously receiving energy
    is a novel approach amongst researchers. The most significant advantage of the
    EH scheme is the applicability for remote locations and harsh water channel conditions.
    This type of EH technology is cost-effective, improves safety and reliability
    [251]. In the SLIPT scenario, it offers high bandwidth, extremely high speed,
    and energy efficiency. Furthermore, the movement of the renewal traditional EH
    technologies towards to SLIPT is the solution for environmentally friendly technology,
    which belongs to the class of green communication [252]. B. SLIPT in Underwater
    Communication An underwater SLIPT scenario is depicted by Fig. 10. Throughout
    the proposed system model, the received signal splits into two chunks simultaneously,
    which are responsible for energy harvesting and information decoding. At the receiver
    end the received signals are converted into AC and DC components. The AC component
    is responsible for the signal decoding while the DC component uses for the EH
    purposes [253]. According to Fig. 10, in the SLIPT system model, if m(t) represents
    the modulated electrical signal and A denotes the peak amplitude. If, + A I assigns
    for a bit “1” while − A I for “0” in modulation and demodulation of VLC signal.
    In consideration of modulation process to control the optical intensity of LED
    with the DC bias ψ , the peak amplitude for each bit is given as [41], A I ≤min(ψ−
    I L , I H −ψ), (54) View Source where I L and I H are denoted the minimum and
    maximum input bias current. Furthermore, in the point-to-point communication scenario,
    the harvested energy is modified and given by [41], [254], E EH = = f I DC V t
    fTrI P t B V t ln(1+ rIh P t ψ I 0 ), (55) View Source where f , I DC , V t ,
    T , r , P t , and I 0 are defined as the fill factor of solar panel, the DC component
    I DC =rI P t ψ , the thermal voltage, time duration during energy harvesting,
    the photo-detector resistivity, the power component, and the dark saturation current
    of solar panel, respectively. Time-Switching (TS) SLIPT Receiver Architecture
    The TS receiver architecture is a disjoint scheme as well as the splitting factors
    t and (1−t) denoted for the optimization in the SLIPT system. According to the
    splitting factor, the ability to gain the idea of exploit harvested energy with
    adequate BER performance. Moreover, the TS mechanism represents separate two-time
    frames for EH and information decoding (ID). Furthermore, TS can use for only
    one function at a time, energy transfer or receiving signal [253]. The TS-SLIPT
    block diagram architecture under the SPLIT system is depicted by Fig.11. Power-Switching
    (PS) SLIPT Receiver Architecture The PS receiver architecture is another combined
    scheme as received current distributed into two phases. The DC component of the
    current phase uses for EH, while the AC component of the current phase uses for
    information decoding purposes. Compared with the TS-SLIPT scheme, the PS design
    could reach high efficiency in EH at the receiver end. Additionally, the PS-SLIPT
    mechanism works at the same time with different power domains for EH and ID [42].
    Fig.12 shows the block diagram of the PS-SLIPT receiver architecture. C. SLIPT
    and SWIPT Schemes The authors in [42] widely discussed which comprised both of
    futuristic SLIPT and SWIPT schemes. In both schemes, the authors obtained the
    behavior of system BER & outage performances along with amount of harvested energy.
    Therefore, the BER and outage performances in the SLIPT scheme perform better
    than the SWIPT scheme at the consecutive photodetector sensitivity and power splitting
    factors. On the contrary case according to [42], the EH in SWIPT shows superior
    performance rather than indoor enabled SLIPT technology. SECTION X. Hybrid Underwater
    Wireless Communication Optical communication as VLC is a promising complementary
    approach instead of RF and acoustic waves signal transmission in the underwater
    medium over short distances. Enabling next generation of wireless network 5GB
    optical communication technique allows the massive number of connectivity of IoUTs.
    In recent years there is a growing interest in deploying VLC as a communication
    link in underwater integrated with existing RF and acoustic waves. Therefore,
    hybrid RF-VLC and FSO-VLC wireless communication links are proposed and showed
    impressive system performances expect to deploy individual point-to-point or point-to-multi-point
    communication links. A wide detailed summary of various hybrid communication techniques
    are depicted by Fig.1 and Fig.13. In RF-UWOC hybrid communication system [48]
    an electromagnetic link combines with an optical link, while in underwater FSO-VLC
    system [255] enables both of optical links for signal propagation. Additionally,
    a dual-hop acoustic-optical link is widely used for signal propagation in the
    underwater medium over long-ranges [256]. In hybrid underwater communication aspect
    various signal transmission techniques are developed and use to enable with FSO,
    VLC, sonar, and underwater acoustic waves. It is challenging to deploy an optical
    communication hybrid network system towards to 5GB and connecting IoUTs. Optical
    wireless communication link supports highly secure signal propagation media under
    visible light (VL), infra-red (IR), and ultraviolet (UV) frequency bands. Nowadays,
    numerous optical wireless communication systems are being developed under consideration
    above three optical frequency bands. In a hybrid link scenario, RF and acoustic
    waves are not required line-of-sight (LOS) nor short ranges but support high mobility
    and better performance in NLOS conditions. The hybrid approaches are integrated
    with two multi-hops different wireless communication technologies such as RF-VLC
    [257], [258], RF-FSO [47], [48], and PLC-VLC [259], [260] are investigated in
    the open literature to provide various advantages as per requirement and deployment.
    Additionally, a hybrid wireless communication system facilitates the integration
    of multiple wireless carrier candidates to cover long-ranges communication along
    with better system performance that overcome the limitation of an individual technology.
    A. RF/FSO Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link FSO has become an alternative solution
    for a wireless communication system with high bandwidth over long distances. Terrestrial
    FSO is most widely used as a LOS wireless communication approach that operates
    within 850–1550 nm of optical spectrum wavelength. Due to strong channel conditions,
    the FSO links are attenuated by atmospheric conditions, especially atmospheric
    turbulence, fog, snow, and dust limiting channels. Plenty of FSO based applications
    are recorded in open literature as in [171]. Mostly, in the FSO system the channel
    turbulence phenomenon is a highly noticeable event of the fluctuation of the scintillation
    index. The turbulence effect occurs due to the flexibility of refractive index
    variation inhomogeneities in an atmosphere where the temperature and pressure
    fluctuates. RF waves attenuate easily in an underwater environment and propagate
    over short distances. In hybrid communication over long ranges RF waves signify
    as a promising signal transmission technique. Therefore, RF-FSO underwater is
    a potential solution for acquiring high bandwidth over long distances. In this
    section, an RF-FSO hybrid communication system model is proposed to obtain the
    system performance. A source node S communicates with an underwater-based destination
    D through a floating buoy. The floating buoy works as a decode-and-forward (DF)
    relay protocol R and depicted by Fig.13. The source node transmits the RF signals
    with an average signal power P s . Further, the relay receives the transmitted
    signals re-generates then forwards to the destination D through FSO link. In another
    aspect, if we use the AF relay protocol, the relay received a signal copy from
    S and amplifies then forward to D . Additionally, we consider the RF-FSO combination
    follows Rayleigh flat fading and FSO link is experienced by strong turbulence
    channel conditions for communication between R and D . For strong turbulent channel
    conditions, the fading is modeled through Gamma-Gamma distribution. In hybrid
    communication relaying technique has been widely promoted for signal transmission
    over long ranges. Due to the limitation of FSO signaling on terrestrial based
    communication, the channel impairments have to be taken into account. As turbulence
    and pointing errors are the main cause of optical signal fading, the hybrid communication
    link is widely studied in literature and the performance investigated through
    different modulation and demodulation techniques. In an underwater communication
    scenario, optical communication is a permissible communication media for signal
    transmission. Thus, a number of RF-Optical [46]–[48], [50], [51] and acoustic-optical
    [69], [256], [261], [262] hybrid communication systems are investigated. B. RF/VLC
    Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link In optical communication aspect VLC shows an
    impressive performance for signal transmission over short distances. VLC uses
    LED luminaries, which are very cost-effective, easy to install, and 100 Gbps data
    can be achieved. Similarly, VLC also affects by strong channel conditions, especially
    sunlight. VLC integrated with RF and a hybrid RF-VLC combination shows better
    performance in different waters. A dual-hop hybrid RF-VLC underwater communication
    link proposed in [114]. The system model consists of three or more nodes for signal
    transmission where a relay function re-generates or amplifies signal information
    and further communicates with the underwater-based destination. In [114], the
    system model is assumed in half-duplex mode with a single antenna at relay, while
    the nodes are fixed. Moreover, the relay should mount two directional antennas
    in full-duplex mode, where one antenna receives the transmitted signals from source
    and the other antenna towards to the destination for further communication with
    the destination. The BER performance of RF-VLC dual-hop hybrid cooperative communication
    system [257] in different water types under strong channel conditions are depicted
    by Fig.14. C. FSO/VLC Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link The traditional underwater
    communication media is modeled by acoustic waves that supports low data rate and
    bandwidth with high delayed signal propagation. FSO-VLC combination full-fill
    the acceptability of desired communication requirements with a highly achievable
    data rate. This hybrid communication could be operating in half and full-duplex
    mode as both are optical links and sever almost the same channel impairments.
    The high turbulence channel conditions, current water waves, misalignment, and
    physio-chemical properties such as pressure, temperature, and salinity affects
    FSO and VLC links. A hybrid FSO-VLC combination is proposed in the open literature,
    where an AUV communicates with terrestrial based station through a floating buoy
    that functions as a relay to assist received information from the source-based
    station. The BER performance of an investigate FSO/VLC dual-hop hybrid communication
    system [257] in different water types is depicted by Fig.15. D. PLC/VLC Dual-Hop
    Hybrid Communication Link Another approach of hybrid underwater communication
    VLC link combined with power line communication (PLC) technology. A telecommunication
    technology PLC is based on the use of power grids for high-speed information transmission.
    The low transmission speed and poor noise immunity are the bottlenecks of this
    technology. Rather than this, the advent of PLC strengthens digital signal processors
    (DSP), making it possible to use more complex signal modulation methods such as
    OFDM modulation. PLC can be used to create a small base station where the main
    requirements for the network are ease of implementation, device mobility, and
    easy scalability. The small cell base station (CBS), e.g., femtocell access point
    (FAP) are used as a small cellular base station that serves 6–8 users. In hybrid
    PLC-VLC combined communication link a small power grid antenna connects with the
    small base station (SBS) through line cable. The signal is transmitted from SBS
    to the antenna via cable and further this antenna mounts by LEDs for further signal
    transmission to divers or UWSNs in shallow water. E. Optical-Acoustic and RF-Acoustic
    Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link The study of acoustic waves involves the discovery
    and deployment of sound waves transmission in fluid media. Acoustic waves are
    generally defined as mechanical and longitudinal vibrational ripples that can
    travel through solid, liquid, or gas mediums in a wave patterns. Underwater acoustic
    is an alternative signal propagation method of sound in water, especially over
    long ranges undersea. Sound waves are the most effective energy transmission wireless
    carriers that propagate over long distances in the ocean. Moreover, acoustic waves
    can tolerate the pressure and the temperature of the deep oceans. Neither RF nor
    optical waves are suitable for long-range transmissions in an underwater environment
    as acoustic waves [263]. Usually, the speed of acoustic waves is comparably low
    (Approximately 1500 m/s) [74]. Although, according to the layer clarification
    the speed varies in cold water and lower than normal water. Acoustic waves are
    used for long-ranges transmissions approximately up to 15 – 20 km, but these waves
    cannot achieve high bandwidth signals undersea. Due to low frequency, bandwidth,
    speed, and additionally the received signals are delayed at the destination [264],
    [265]. However, the sound waves depend on the compressibility and density of the
    medium. In [266], an acoustic sound speed profile (SSP) system model has been
    proposed for 1 km as follows, c= 1448.96+4.591T−0.591 T 2 +0.00029 T 3 +(1.340−0.01T)(S−35)+0.0163z,
    (56) View Source where the temperature in 0C, salinity in PSU, depth in meters,
    and speed of sound in m/s are denoted by T , S , z , and c , respectively. Sound
    waves propagate according to water current concerning every instant of time. An
    empirical model is described as a function of physical water properties such as
    temperature, salinity, and pressure varies with depth. Stratification of these
    parameters lead to stratification of wave motion, which entails the existence
    of specific profiles. Mackenzie has developed a mathematical formula in applied
    science during 1981s [267]. As already discussed, underwater optical communication
    is an alternative approach that refers to transmit signals in an aqueous medium.
    VLC communication has more superiority in comparison to acoustic waves but over
    short distances. To fulfill the gap of long-range communication, a hybrid optical-acoustic
    communication system is considerable. In this type of system model, the underwater-based
    mobile station transmits the acoustic signals and further convert into optical
    format for decoding purposes at the targeted node. SECTION XI. Underwater Sensor
    Networks Architecture Recently, there have been growing interests in underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). The fundamental source of ocean exploration
    underwater sensor architecture is defined as a group of sensor nodes that are
    established undersea to exchange information wirelessly with the base station
    (BS) and floating vehicles (nodes). The growing interest of UWSNs for a wide variety
    of purposes about oceanography, monitoring marine life, seismic surveillance,
    oil-fields exploration, military applications, and deep-sea activities. In this
    regard, the necessity of UWSNs contributes a significant role in UWC. Generally,
    UWSN nodes are enabled with acoustic and optical links for data transmission within
    various applications. Energy conservation and self battery powered is a critical
    issue in UWSN technology. This survey estimates the target position and improves
    energy efficiency in hibernating and an active mode of underwater sensor nodes
    (USNs). The network of underwater sensors fixed with a certain depth or with the
    bottom of the deep ocean for early detection warning of an earthquake, tectonic
    plate movements, and active volcanos before striking the coastal and residential
    areas. The floating nodes are used to detect ice sheet melting and rising water
    level phenomenon, coral reef, water pollution, and physio-chemical properties
    of water. The development of floating nodes AUV supports to improve the quality
    of geographical mapping and navigation systems in underwater sectors. Localization
    is another significant application of UWSNs for tracking location or Global Positioning
    System (GPS) in harsh water mediums [268]. The integration of sensor nodes architecture
    has permitted to allow communication, localization, and GPS. In an underwater
    environment, navigation and localization are the two most significant challenges
    for mobile robots, floating nodes, and different underwater applications. Aforementioned,
    acoustic and optical signal-based sensor networking systems are the most widely
    used for various underwater applications. Through the proposed underwater applications
    the acoustic and optical transponders are used to navigate an AUV. The sound navigation
    and ranging (SONAR) enabled AUV methodology has been proposed with the two basic
    configurations introduced as side-scan SONAR (SSS) and Forward-Looking SONAR (FLS)
    in [269] and [270]. The above SSS and FLS are used for monitoring marine life
    and detection for underwater environmental changes [271]. While an array of sensor
    nodes with a camera or without a camera can be implemented for long ranges navigation
    and imaging systems [272]. A. Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) SLAM is
    an AUV-enabled imaging technique and an essential solution for mapping unknown
    locations within the unknown environment to develop a consistent geographical
    mapping of an underwater environment [271]. In contrast, the SLAM imaging AUV-based
    technology that supports constructing a 3D image in different color frames is
    widely discussed in [273]. The authors in the above-proposed work defined a color-coding
    representation for the reconstruction of unknown mapping sectors, where each color
    code has its specified distance measurement between AUV and obstacles. The various
    methods are presented in the literature of SLAM to the reconstruction of the unknown
    sectors in underwater environment [271], [274]–[277]. Each method has its inadequacies
    and strengths according to the desired interaction, inspection, and navigation
    implementation. Furthermore, underwater SLAM is differentiated into acoustic-based,
    and vision-based categories [278]. The acoustic-based underwater SLAM is used
    for intense unknown segments, while the vision-based SLAM is suffered from limited
    visibility and background noise by natural sources in shallow waters. Therefore,
    a high-definition FLS SLAM could be a promising alternative solution in geographical
    mapping to mitigate the problematic solution. B. Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network
    UASNs is an approach that supports the exploration of extremely dark and highly
    deep oceans. UASNs deploy for various underwater applications such as for detection
    submarines and unmanned operations for military purposes. The UWSNs architecture
    is categorized into fixed 2D and mobility 3D sensors. In the 3D type of architectural
    sensor system, the motion of nodes controls the internal navigation system. The
    floating nodes are free to move underwater with the drift and unpropelled type
    of portable devices such as unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), AUVs, ROVs, drifters,
    and gliders. The main function of these devices is to collect oceanographic data
    from an aqueous medium. The various types of UWSNs are summarized by Table 8.
    The drifter operates mostly through the ground, which drifts with wind and surface
    waves to acquire the possible measurement of marine sectors, further sharing the
    collected data with the base station through satellite. Moreover, the gliders
    are driven by the buoyant force and connected with the floating buoy or the cluster
    head for sharing collected data. In existing work, there are the two main groups
    of UASNs known as content-based and scheduled-based protocols proposed in [279].
    UASNs are classified into two categories as content-based and scheduled-based
    nodes. The Content-based nodes exchange signals to each other, while scheduled-based
    nodes eliminate the exchange of aggregated data between transmission nodes. Alternatively
    stated content-based nodes do not meet the desired gap and are critically suitable
    for UWC. In contrast, due to high propagation latency and narrow bandwidth, the
    scheduled-based nodes such as TDMA and FDMA are less suitable. However, CDMA is
    a more suitable approach for UAN to be deployed in underwater medium [268]. TABLE
    8 The Various Types of Underwater Sensor Network Nodes (UWSNs) Architectures Established
    in the Open Literature to Cope With Issues of Highly Delay, Low Bandwidth, Heavy
    Turbulence Channel Conditions. The Architectures are Enabled for the Required
    Underwater Applications From Short to Long Ranges C. Architecture of Underwater
    Sensor Network Nodes (UWSNs) UASN is commonly used for underwater exploration
    but quite adequate to meet the demand for real-time streaming and high data rate
    scenario. RF wave-based underwater sensor network nodes (UWRFSNs) are the potential
    approachable technique TO full-fill the requirement of various underwater applications.
    In this section, the discussion is carried out of the different types UWSNs along
    with their deployment challenges. 1D-UWSNs Architecture: The single dimension
    (1D) UWSNs are the self-employed types of deployable networks underwater. In this
    type of sensor network, the individual node is self-configured by itself. In this
    type of architecture, each node has the capability of sensing and it is responsible
    for processing collection data within the remote area [281]. The sensor node could
    be fixed with a seabed or a floating buoy responsible for collecting the useful
    oceanographic data and further shared with the BS. In another scenario, the floating
    buoy could be the buoyant type of node that floats a certain depth underwater
    and then float towards the BS for information transmission. AUVs also function
    as self-configured individual nodes; they can floats at any horizontal and vertical
    depth to sense the data and share it with the onshore data center. The 1D-UWSNs
    type of architecture enables acoustic, EM, and optical communication-based wireless
    signaling technology. The 1D-UWSNs are widely deployable for single-hop communication
    where the nodes directly communicate with the BS; in VLC scenario 1D type of UWSNs
    usable for plenty of underwater applications in shallow waters such as rivers,
    dams, lakes, etc. 2D-UWSNs Architecture: The 2D type of UWSN is referred as a
    group of sensor networks (cluster) where the nodes communicate with the cluster
    head. The fixed or anchored cluster head collects the sensed data from each node
    and further transmits it to the vertical buoyant transceiver of the BS. In 2D-UWSN
    architecture, it is considered that each node communicates with the cluster head
    horizontally and communicates with the vertical buoyant node as well. Thus, this
    type of node architecture is called 2D-UWSNs, based on acoustic, EM, and optical
    waves-based wireless signaling technology for long ranges in an underwater environment.
    In the UVLC scenario, all local and cluster head nodes link and transmit the information
    with the remote station. The 2D type of UWSNs architecture is proposed in [291]
    for the purpose of short-term aquatic exploration applications and extensively
    discussed. The 2D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.1. 3D-UWSN Architecture: The
    3D type of UWSN describes the network architecture where the sensor cluster nodes
    are deployed in different depths in underwater medium. Due to different depths,
    the clusters communication links established are variable in 3D space geometry
    in undersea. The communication link among the sensor nodes would be in three dimensions
    space for the mobility of data transmission. Additionally, in 3D-UWSNs, the cluster
    communicates among the neighboring clusters at varying depths, and the cluster
    network nodes communicate with their cluster head. All the cluster heads collect
    the sensed data by their local sensors and further transmit it to the buoyant
    node or with the BS. The 3D type of UWSNs can be deployed for underwater applications
    requirement based on acoustic, EM, and optical communication [281]. Moreover,
    the 3D underwater sensor network localization has been widely discussed in [282].
    In UVLC enabled sensor network communication, the high probability of real-time
    monitoring and achieving high data rate. The 3D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.1.
    4D-UWSN Architecture: The 4D type of sensor network architectural system is designed
    by combining anchored sensor nodes with the floating or mobile UWSNs nodes at
    different underwater depths. The 4D-UWSN architecture is deployable for long ranges
    communication among the nodes. Mostly, the mobile UWSNs consist of ROVs for the
    data collection from an anchored or fixed nodes at the seabed in varying depth.
    The ROVs can be submersible robots, vehicles, ships, and even submarines. Each
    node can relay information with ROV and depending on the distance between the
    node and ROV. Furthermore, the signal transmission is the distance-dependent between
    underwater sensor nodes and ROV [292]. The 2D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.16.
    SECTION XII. Recent Development of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) The network
    of the internet of underwater things (IoUTs) is a potential novel approach for
    data collection within the underwater environment that has to be transferred with
    the BS for further analysis. IoUTs is a group of wireless network-enabled smart
    devices and could be a wide range of underwater sensor nodes architecture. The
    different types of UWSNs architectures are discussed in the earlier sections for
    various underwater application purposes. The system architecture of IoUT has received
    attention for developing smart ocean and innovative business surrounded by smart
    interconnected underwater water objects [70]. The most widely deployable IoUTs
    are discussed as follow and depicted by Fig.16. A. Sea Gliders and Autonomous
    Underwater Vehicles The Internet-connected devices structure provides a pretty
    reasonable communication bridge among the nodes. For underwater communication
    purposes, wirelessly connected devices are recognized as the internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs). These devices could be identified as network nodes, AUVs, moving
    gliders, ROVs and floating buoys, etc. Whereas sea gliders and AUVs provide the
    measurement of oceanic environment over long-ranges especially for bathymetric
    data collection. The thrust and movement of the sea-gliders are used as an electrically
    driven propellers and are operated by an installed battery that provides upthrust
    with buoyancy for forwarding or upward motion. The AUVs and sea-gliders are designed
    to cover thousands of miles for several months within underwater mediums. These
    devices sink up to 1km from the sea surface due to their energy capacity limits.
    Furthermore, these types of nodes are deployed for oceanographic data collection
    and GPS purposes. An architecture of IoUTs that involves the multiple wave gliders
    for acoustical observation is proposed [293]. The internal sensors of sea-gliders
    determine the direction of vehicle when it dives underwater. The external sensor
    scans the ocean to collect the data. The movement of sea-gliders, AUV, UUV, and
    ROVs, is shown in Fig.16. B. Underwater Animal Telemetry Animal telemetry is another
    effective approach for ocean exploration and uses to observe the marine environment.
    This tagging technology enables us to get to know about the marine life inhabitants
    and their interaction with coastal shelf ecosystem to polar seas and the open
    oceans [294]. Animal telemetry supports observing the exploration summary of the
    vast oceans, underwater environmental changes, and marine pollution. The air-sea
    interface is necessary to understand the observation and oceanic exploration of
    daily water conditions, driving global climate changes, biogeochemical cycle process,
    heavy wind and water currents to exchange the momentum and other micro-particles
    [294]. The various IoUTs such as HFR, satellites, drifters, and autonomous surface
    vehicles (ASVs) are widely used to observe the air-sea interface. To mitigate
    such challenges, the development of a small communicating device that can be mounted
    on the floating seabird back that contained a sensing data unit with a battery
    is capable of measuring the water surface, water currents, and winds over the
    sea [294]–[297]. For more details about animal telemetry, a pictorial view is
    referred to for this approach in Fig.16. C. A Deep Detectable Tsunami Buoy Tsunamis
    and earthquakes are sudden events and highly impossible to control. Nevertheless,
    these events are predictabled by deploying an early detectable device called a
    tsunami buoy. The primary function of a tsunami buoy is the detection and monitoring
    of the high level ocean water waves (Tides). The tsunami events are generated
    by undersea earthquakes that bureau of meteorology confirms. The tsunami buoys
    are deployed for observation and recorded the changes in sea level and bottomless
    oceans. It enhances the capability for early detection warning of tsunamis and
    floods before hitting the land. The buoy splits into two major components: the
    pressure sensor anchored with the sea bead and a surface buoy that floats on the
    water surface. The anchored sensors at the sea-bed are used to measure the changes
    in the height of the water column (the height h of the water column is the function
    of water pressure p as p=ρgh ). In more contrast, the measured water column height
    utilized for communication purposes with the floating buoy (works as a relay)
    through sound waves and further relayed via satellite to the tsunami warning center
    [298]. The function of the tsunami buoy is depicted in Fig.16. D. Underwater Floating
    Drifters Through the immense development of drifters, observing the global ocean
    currents and their effects are the main concerns. Recent advancements of drifters
    support the ocean circulation patterns in real-time monitoring the deployment
    of the drifters possibly in shallow water by a ship or another source. On the
    deployment of the drifter when it floats, the transmitter is activated and starts
    to share the collected oceanographic data with the satellite, this collected data
    is further to transmitted with the offshore BS for analysis. Other inbuilt sensors
    at drifters are responsible for collecting the various types of data such as water
    surface temperature, wind, ocean color, pressure, and salinity [299]. The data
    synchronization with the satellite has been depicted in Fig.16. E. Underwater
    Hydrophones Generally, the signal propagation effects by channel impairments;
    noise is one of signal corrupting factors. The array of hydrophones are designed
    to be deployed for noise detection in an aqueous medium. Also, the hydrophones
    produce a limited voltage signal over high-frequency ranges while receiving the
    underwater sound from any direction. Deployment of an array of hydrophones amplifies
    and records the received noise more precisely. Omni-directional and Hemi-directional
    hydrophones support to collect the sound from a particular direction; it is also
    to track underwater the movement of underwater species. Therefore, hydrophones
    are the fundamental tools for plenty of undersea acoustic applications such as
    Sono-buoys, wired hydrophones, and autonomous hydrophones [287]. In addition,
    the NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under NOAA’s National
    Marine Sanctuaries also frequently uses hydrophones [300]. In addition to that
    NOAA’s PMEL derives a long-term datasets for the global ocean acoustic environment.
    It has been utilized to identify and evaluate acoustic influences of human activities
    and natural disasters such as the eruption of an underwater volcano and glacial
    earthquakes in the marine environment [301]. The deployment of hydrophones in
    the underwater scenario has shown in Fig.16. F. Clod Cards Use the Measurement
    of Water Flow The clod cards are ice-shaped identical trapezoidal geometries and
    made by alabaster or plaster of Paris (gypsum blocks) and utilize to analyze underwater
    flow patterns. The ingredients of clod cards or made by the combination of the
    100ml of freshwater with 80gm plaster of Paris powder manufactured by the Hobby
    Craft Trading limited, Dorest UK [302]. In [302], the clod cards were sanded at
    the bottom of the water bodies to accomplish a consistent weight of 12.5 ± 1.5
    gm. Every individual plaster cube must be glued with the plastic plate size 3×8
    cm with silicone cement in this strategy. To measure the exact water flows analysis,
    the four clod cards established in four cardinal directions in front of their
    faces are fixed to a straight pole for at least 24 hours. The requirement of clod
    cards deployment in predetermined sites for various underwater applications such
    as divers, ROVs, and floating nodes. After a limited and fixed time duration (approximately
    1 to 2 days), the clod cards have to be retrieved, dried at 40 0 C , and reweighed
    to calculate the decay and the strong water flow. Conversely, the exact weight
    loss of the plaster of Paris is determined from each card and sent to the laboratory
    for further analysis. As a result, it can be concluded that the clods who lost
    more weight are exposed to greater water flow than those who lost less weight.
    Accordingly, the cloud card can be used to measure several other essential parameters
    from the ocean. An implementation of a clod card has been depicted in Fig.16.
    G. Satellite Oceanography The weather observational satellite is the most significant
    tool to share constructive information with the base station. Additionally, the
    satellite plays a vital role in ocean observation research and functions as an
    intermediate communication node for information transmission between the underwater
    and offshore base stations. For oceanographic data collection, environmental satellites
    are widely used to capture images and calculate the surface temperature of oceans.
    It is also used to know the water patterns and further shared the collected data
    with the terrestrial-based stations for analysis. For real-time video, steaming
    could be possible by utilizing satellites in different color coding techniques
    for water flow analysis. It supports determining the impact of floods and tsunami
    along the coastal area along with the detection of algal blooms. In the most recent
    years, remote sensing technology-enabled with the satellite that has boosted for
    data synchronization with altimetry (study to measures the height of sea surface),
    scatterometry (study to measures wind speed and direction), as well as the bathymetric
    (study of the ocean floor) approaches. These are the technologies that make the
    smart satellite for ocean observation, monitoring, and GPS. Additionally, to monitor
    early detection warnings to evacuate the coastal area and develop major storms,
    such as hurricanes and tornadoes, geosynchronous environmental satellites are
    being used. The most important information of coral reefs, coastal habitats, and
    similar environments can be analyzed by the satellite photography [303]. In Fig.16,
    an environmental satellite is depicted for ocean mapping. H. Remotely Operated
    Vehicles (ROVs) ROVs are accessed remotely and functioned similarly as a robot.
    This type of node has been designed for underwater exploration and deployment
    for various underwater applications to find the lost ships, repair and monitor
    gas pipelines, habitat mapping, etc. Specifically, the ROVs are equipped with
    sensors and sampling tools for data collection at variable distances from the
    oceans. A network cable is used to detect and observing the objects by illuminating
    the light, establishes a communication link between the base station and floating
    node to controls commands of the proper node movement. The ROV is a well-equipped
    floating vehicle enabled with advanced features that contain a lighting system
    with a camera at the frontal portion for videography to record a better sub-aquatic
    panorama. It is especially utilized in the aquatic medium for the contribution
    of geology education and sea life learning [304]. The exploration and functioning
    of ROV in an underwater medium have shown in Fig.16. SECTION XIII. Integration
    of Advance and Next Generation Communication Technology Currently, with the immense
    enhancement of data traffic in telecommunication industries, a large number of
    regular users have been observed. An alternative communication media has an essential
    role in the wireless networking era to fulfill the requirements of further innovations,
    research, and further development of new emerging communication technologies.
    The development of optical communication applications in visible light has become
    an immense growth in different fields. Nowadays, the trade of VLC applications
    became more reliable and highly efficient in acquiring indoor and outdoor scenarios.
    VLC uses the limited frequency ranges about 430 – 790 THz at the wavelength ranges
    380 – 750 nm. The benefit of this frequency range is the compatibility with the
    human eye with no effect on an electrical circuit. The basic concept in VLC signaling
    is the information modulation happens at the receiver end while demodulation is
    held by a photo-detector and decodes the signal from received information under
    fluctuation of the light intensity. The communication link is enabled with a lighting
    system as LED, which offers a considerable bandwidth with a desirable high data
    rate. Cellular technologies have changed and support improving the system qualities
    and performances. To proliferate smart internet-connected devices, emerging advanced
    future wireless networks play an ample role for an efficient and reliable communication
    link among the network architectural nodes as 5G networks have shown superior
    performances as a key enabling wireless technology. Also, the 5GB and 6G would
    be offered an immense performance while linked with the multiple nodes. The latest
    5GB wireless network would significantly impact various wireless connected applications
    such as intelligent transportation, device-to-device (D2D) communication, underwater
    optical communication, and internet-connected devices. The most recent survey
    on 6G wireless network carried out an outperform study about VLC enabling communication
    signaling through laser and LEDs [305]. A. 5G Networking System in Underwater
    5G wireless communication system has been designed to offer a significant improvement,
    especially for enhancing the system capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy
    efficiency of the communication system. For efficient and reliable wireless communication,
    5G is widely accepted to combine the small cell, picocells, and macrocells [306].
    The commercial use of 5G during 2019s established a collaborative communication
    system on a terrestrial basis, excluding the underwater environmental communication.
    The deployment of a 5G wireless network underwater will be an innovative step
    to improve data extraction from an aqueous medium for further analysis. As being
    improving the system capacity and essential assets of high data rate underwater
    wireless communication technology, optical communication towards 5G is the key
    solution that attracts the scientific community. Although, the most recent experimental
    study and the performance evaluation of 520nm wavelength laser-diode towards 5G
    is presented as [307]. In [307], the authors analyzed the performance of an underwater
    optical system under consideration of varying salinity conditions in pure water.
    Facing these issues, the Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is
    proposed as a novel underwater wireless network candidate towards the next generation
    standard based on multi-branch multi-carrier filter bank in [43]. It is presented
    and generalized the traditional OFDM technique with several advantages as minimal
    peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Minimizing PAPR is one of the key advantage
    features in GFDM over OFDM and a significant parameter to analyze the performance
    characteristics of the communication system [308]. As recorded the limited bandwidth
    in underwater acoustic, OFDM suits for communication purposes. In contrast, OFDM
    offers a profitable integration over single-carrier modulations against the frequency
    selective fading [309]. Therefore, to come up for all these issues, the requirement
    to deploy multi-carrier transmission schemes. GFDM [310] and filter bank multi-carrier
    (FBMC) [311] are proposed the new promising emerging communication techniques
    towards 5G applications. B. Predictable 5G and Beyond (5GB) Networking System
    in Underwater The forthcoming next-generation 5G and beyond (5GB) communication
    will indeed offer numerous advanced services with ultra-high capabilities, an
    extensive number of device connectivity, very ultra-low energy consumption, and
    latency along with ultra-high security, extremely high quality of services (QoS),
    and high-resolution experience (HRE) [312]. The 6G networks are anticipated to
    accommodate and exceeded performance in comparison with 5G. Thus, the exceptionally
    high data will greatly impact networking users and the critical factor for more
    complex future challenges in various sectors such as in healthcare, long-range
    communication, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, underwater communication,
    etc. Though, the prediction to launch the 6G communication system is anticipated
    till 2030s [313]. Indeed, the 6G wireless communication network will provide the
    next level of signal transmission qualitative performance compared with 5G communication.
    The recent advances of and application of optical communication technologies towards
    5G/6G are summarized in detail [314]. An extremely high data rate up to 100Gbps
    by deploying VLC has been confirmed in [315] and [316]. Internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs) is the essential part of an underwater communication system connected
    with a standardized communication network for data extraction in the real-time
    scenario from the underwater environment. The implementation of 6G integrating
    UWC will be a revolutionary step to explore aqueous mediums as IoUTs connected
    with VLC. The most significant aim is predicted to connect underwater-based nodes
    with satellites for global coverage and observation all around the globe. C. Internet
    of Underwater Things (IoUTs) IoUTs refer to internet-connected devices that can
    easily and legitimately retrieve information through cabled or wireless-enabled
    connectivity. UIoTs claims to be an extension and development phase of IoTs, which
    allows the extraction of anonymous information from smart ocean [317]. IoUTs are
    enabled by the most recent developments of AUVs, ROVs, smart underwater sensor
    networks, and routing protocols. The architecture of UIoTs depicted in Fig.1 and
    Fig.13, enable numerous applications in an underwater environment in terms of
    sensing, monitoring, and identify underwater objects. In underwater internet of
    things (UIoTs), the sensor network nodes collect data and communicate with the
    cluster head. Furthermore, the received data has to transmit with a base station
    for subsequent analysis. The IoUTs structure enables the UVLC link to be classified
    into two major categories: horizontal and slant communication systems. Described
    in more detail, the horizontal link has been an extensively focused study on increasing
    data rate and signal propagation length along with reducing underwater turbulence
    effects while slant links formed high depth considering wave height wind speed,
    sea surface slope, and heavy turbulence conditions. On the other hand, in the
    vertical link for high depth, pressure increases up to 10bar for each k th layer
    (each layer for k=10m ) in addition temperature decreases from 250C to freezing
    point, the above matter facts due to varying salinity which affects the refractive
    index. SECTION XIV. Underwater Optical Wireless Network Applications Oceans are
    mysterious and challenging water bodies to explore. Plenty of natural disasters
    such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis occur by imbalanced water
    phenomena that could be observed and monitored by deploying communication links.
    To address the requirement of current emerging underwater applications which have
    been used in the context of rising water level, environmental monitoring, marine
    life, early detection tsunami, oil and gas rigs exploration, volcanic eruptions,
    coastal securities, and sliding tectonic plates, jointly with various hybrid wireless
    communication systems. Moreover, undersea wireless communication over long distances,
    UWSN plays an essential role in data transmission. The traditional acoustic modems
    are widely used in long-range UWC, whether low speed (approximately 1500 m/s)
    in such complexity of water channel conditions [318]. In more contrast, for high
    depth, the floating nodes AUVs, and UAVs are used to transfer information from
    source to destination. RF waves transmission show poor performance in an underwater
    environment cause the EM waves propagation depend on the intrinsic properties
    of the channel. Contrarily, the water medium has more density, permittivity, and
    higher electrical conductivity than air. Therefore, RF waves easily attenuate
    when propagating over successive distances [94]. For such transmission scenarios,
    a high data rate cooperative dual-hop RF-UVLC and FSO/UVLC systems are needed
    to be deployed [48], [180] [319]. As, VLC provides a high capacity of data rate
    over moderate distances, an acceptable wireless media for underwater mapping,
    and real-time video streaming with high resolution and various UVLC applications
    as follows. A. Ocean Floor Bathymetry The study of exploring the ocean floor is
    referred to the depths and shape of the underwater terrain [320], as stated bathymetry
    is the most significant investigation that deploys in numerous underwater applications.
    Additionally, the collection of geographical and oceanographic data analysis updates
    of weather and natural hazards on our earth. The massive water reservoirs are
    still unmapped, unexplored, and unobserved sectors. Only a very few oceanic portions
    have been mapped systematically by direct measurement [127]. The rest of the unexplored
    fraction of oceans are predicted by the satellite altimeter data, which is the
    approximated estimation structure of the seabed. A newly sounding technique is
    proposed that supports measuring ocean depth over less than 18% of the seafloor
    resolution about 1km [321]. Furthermore, the two most significant seafloor mapping
    techniques are proposed as Single Beam Echo-Sounders (SBES) [127], [322] and Multi-beam
    Echo-Sounders (MBES) [127], [323], respectively. The use of the two-way travel
    time of sound waves methodologies are used for measurement sea depth directly,
    where the sound waves strike with the seabed. On the other hand, in the MBES system,
    the enabled fan generates sound waves for further data collection. These sound
    waves are responsible for re-echoing signals generated in areas of the strait
    perpendicular to that fan, leading to the ocean floor mapping. Therefore, the
    established system receives hundreds of beams capable of mapping the narrow sectors
    up to 150 degrees. B. Underwater Environmental Exploration and Monitoring Most
    of the underwater environmental monitoring applications are related explicitly
    to observing manual and habitable activities in the oceanic environment. By deploying
    the UWSNs, the water pollution, water flows, and lives could be monitored. Additionally,
    the tectonic plate movement, underwater thunderstorms, earthquakes, and new formation
    of lands due to the eruption of volcanoes (the lava plays a significant role in
    forming a chunk of the island, etc.) being monitored. The floating nodes at different
    depths can observe and collect data of the 3D geometry of open oceans and terrains
    as human beings are highly interested in exploring the underwater environment
    since their existence. The scientific community is a witness in the exploration
    of less than 5% of oceans. A vast number of underwater applications are immersed
    by floating nodes as AUVs, ROVs, and UUVs for monitoring and observing the marine
    lives along with the three-dimensional geographical data within real-time scenario
    [283]. The study of monitoring water quality, pollution, impurities underwater
    is more challenging. Various water samples are being used to monitor water quality
    regarding the pH level, oxygen ( O 2 ), and ammonium nitrate ( N H 3 ). Moreover,
    the underwater monitoring also includes water macrophytes or hydrophytes, marine
    species, coral reefs, and algae for further analysis. In more contrast, environmental
    monitoring is also a fundamental approach through IoUT enabled applications which
    include the physio-chemical properties of water such as pressure, temperature,
    and variation in underwater are the main concerns [324]. The continuous monitoring
    of underwater helps to check remotely the pH water level. The water pollution
    monitoring is also substantial for the ecological system, especially for undersea
    species. IoUT provides an opportunity to explore the bottomless underwater reservoirs
    to discover lost human civilizations and lost treasure. Moreover, to identify
    the roughness of the seafloor, natural minerals, oil, and gas treasures. Many
    lost-treasure discoveries were made through the IoUTs. C. Navigation & Surveillance
    Oceans are highly complex and unguided water bodies which are 95% unexplored in
    scientific research. As a result, underwater navigation is more complicated than
    terrestrial basis. UWSNs are appropriate and the most suitable technological approach
    that supports navigation in hulking aqueous mediums. Especially, for navigation
    the 3D underwater sensor network (USN) localization system is investigated in
    [282]. In [282], the authors propose the superiority of 3D Underwater Sensor Positioning
    (USP) systematic planning, which is beneficial for improving localization capabilities
    over existing 3D sensor architectures with predictable, balanced communication
    underwater. An AUV-assisted localization scenario of USNs roaming across the underwater
    sensor fields is presented in [325]. A wide range of localization of acoustic
    network nodes in the underwater medium is summarized in open literature as in
    [326]–[332]. Since optical communication is a novel technique to implement the
    localization and navigation purposes. Therefore, the authors in [333] investigated
    the connectivity of underwater wireless optical sensor networks (UWOSNs) as the
    influential factor to the system performance. Most recently, an extensive study
    based on received signal strength to the centralized localization scheme is proposed
    in [13]. Counterpart surveillance is a more efficient tool for node detection
    for military purposes or coastal securities. AUVs are used as emerging communication
    nodes for surveillance and retrieving information for defense operations. A most
    recent survey summarized the AUV capabilities for underwater communication in
    [271]. The authors in [271] are widely discussed the possible underwater application
    through AUV such as signal transmission, localization, and navigation purposes
    where the RF waves are incapable of retrieving the digital information. D. Naval-Mine
    Reconnaissance As we know that underwater environments are highly deepest and
    massive water reservoirs, countless mines in oceans could be found by deploying
    UWSNs connecting with ships safe voyage or floating and operational activities.
    A recent work is proposed to design an underwater mine detection system in [334].
    The authors have suggested a model minefield that includes the type of mines to
    be detected and mine-clearing operations by deploying the sonar waves in the various
    depth of the oceanic environment. Another impressive work in the open literature,
    where the authors have proposed the detection of underwater mines in real-time
    scenarios [335]. In [335], an AUV floats at different depths with sonar waves
    transmission along with a camera for real-time observation. Naval mines are also
    a real threat to maritime and naval tactical operations. Underwater-based mines
    hide or buried by the high altitude of tides and water currents, even covered
    by muddy soil at the sea bottom [336]. In most of the conditions, the naval mines
    are undetectable by low-frequency ranges. To cope with this issue, the challenge
    is that a high-frequency range of sonar should be mounted through an AUV to detect
    or bathymetric data of naval mines. For instance, the ECA Group deals with the
    issues within an innovative technological solution to perform complex missions
    in hostile or harsh environments [336]. According to SOACYS, the first prototype
    in the form of a 5 to 40m longship is used to collect oceanic data 1 Teabyte within
    2400km of survey lines [337]. This small ship prototype is used for various applications
    such as UneXploded Ordnance (UXO), debris, boulders, pipelines/cables, marine
    archeology, sedimentary studies, etc. E. Border & Coastal Securities The border
    and coastal securities applications are mainly used to observe unwanted activities
    in coastal areas such as entry port security, land border security, and maritime
    border security. Taking account of these issues, USWNs an emerging technique for
    various military operations and are used for military communication purposes.
    These integral networking signals have a key role in providing such facilities
    to the military as surveillance, intelligence, localization, targeting positions,
    and tracking nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. A high capacity command
    control communication system of ASELSAN is used to enhance situational awareness,
    accurate decision making, and faster response qualities in coastal and border
    security system solutions [338]. F. Seismic Monitoring and Ocean Sampling The
    oceans are extremely large water reservoirs that change over the time. The sensor
    nodes are the main advantageous communication networking tools for sampling and
    observing the underwater environment, collecting oceanographic data, and transmitting
    signals to the source (e.g., base stations, etc.). The floating sensor nodes could
    be deployed at high depth for ocean mapping and underwater sampling activities.
    Furthermore, earthquakes, tsunami, and floods are sudden and unexpected events
    that cause major catastrophy worldwide. Sudden slip of bedrock causes seismic
    waves that shake the ground. UWSNs are dedicated to monitoring seismic activities
    and recording data for early detection warning [339]. G. Future Direction UVLC
    has drawn attention to the futuristic deployment of UWC, which opens the doors
    of advanced wireless communication systems towards 5GB networking system in the
    nearest future. Currently, it is possible to transmit the data at high speed as
    well as the wireless energy transfer through the illumination phenomena of LEDs.
    UVLC has a fruitful future perspectives due to the wide range of popularity of
    LEDs all around the world [42]. Therefore, UVLC has shown potential acceptability
    for next-generation 5GB networking systems for further developments in the digital
    wireless generation of communication phase. LEDs are very cost-effective optical
    signaling elements that have more superiority over traditional wireless communication
    media. The light spectrum of the optical beam visible light and LED illumination
    is a comfortable illusion for aquatic species. Therefore, the essentiality for
    promising extensive research is required for more advanced, very cost-effective
    light-emitting and photon receiving detectors. The less expensive, tiny in size,
    less power consumption, and high compatibility with neighboring optical network
    UVLC claim the most significant wireless carriers. The traditional acoustic and
    RF wireless candidates are lagging behind for underwater signaling with low data-rate
    (few kbps); therefore UVLC fills the gap (Mbps to Gbps data transmission rates)
    of desired communication. In more contrast, the IoUT networks support the mobility
    of the devices in a very divisive medium within 3D channel coverage. Plenty of
    UWC applications enabled with ROVs, UUVs, and AUVs are widely employable with
    VLC format. The hybrid communication systems with 5GB networks are capable of
    connecting an enormous number of devices on terrestrial to underwater-based internet
    connecting things for further exploration of unguided oceanic sectors. The predictable
    scenario is establishing the underwater environment of the satellite becoming
    a universal digital communication sphere. As a substitute, UVLC supports high
    data rates (3Gb/s DMT VLC transmissions) [340] over short distances with low latency.
    SECTION XV. Conclusion UVLC approach builds up a wireless connection between terrestrial
    and floating nodes in an underwater environment. The possible solution to cope
    with the challenges and affecting factors of signal propagation are widely studied
    in this research. UVLC has become the most significant trade for signaling in
    aqueous mediums towards the futuristic 5GB wireless networking systems. The most
    recent advances through the current project schemes all around the globe to enhance
    the interest in marine industries along with various underwater applications are
    the main perspectives. The UVLC technological critics of signal propagation and
    channel impairments are the main issues due to the various types of underwater-based
    hybrid communication scenarios are summarized in this paper. Additionally, the
    architectural design of UWNs with higher modulation techniques is quite challenging
    to deploy over long-range communication in marine industries. Due to this, the
    different types of hybrid communication approaches are investigated according
    to requirements and geographical environments. The IoUTs play an ample role as
    a backbone in communication among transceivers. In the IoUT networks, the modems
    may contain some advanced signal tools for the purpose of achieving reliable high-data
    rates with diminishing influential factors such as noise and channel impairments
    in the correspondence of physical layers. This study contributes the solution
    of various range of channel impairment challenges and provides an overview of
    the latest projects schemes along with the future perspectives towards the 5GB
    networking system in this particular domain. Authors Figures References Citations

    Metrics Abstract: The emergence of a new breed of smart applications requires
    middleware platforms that enable the rapid development of IoT-based solutions,
    which can be hosted partially in fog nodes, as well as in a traditional cloud
    datacenter. Currently, there is no scalable de facto open IoT platform but the
    European Commission is pushing FIWARE to fill this gap. We analyzed the performance
    of FIWARE under different platform configurations comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only
    scenarios for precision irrigation in smart farming. Our results reveal interesting
    and non-intuitive findings, such as that fog computing does not always improve
    the overall system performance and in some cases it even makes it worse. Also,
    the network between the farm and the cloud datacenter causes some unexpected differences
    between different scenarios. Published in: 2018 23rd Conference of Open Innovations

    content Abstract In this paper, we design and implement an Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based platform for developing cities using environmental sensing as a driving
    application. Since ubiquitous and free WiFi access is not available in most developing
    cities, IoT deployments must leverage 3G cellular connections that are metered
    and expensive. In order to best utilize the limited 3G data plan, we propose two
    adaptation strategies to drive sensing and data collection. The first technique
    is an infrastructure-level adaptation approach where we adjust sensing intervals
    of periodic sensors so that the data volume remains bounded within the allocated
    data budget. The second approach is at the information-level where application-specific
    analytics are deployed on-board devices. This use case focuses on multimedia sensors
    that process captured raw media data to lower volume semantic data that is communicated.
    We implement the two adaptation strategies on the EnviroSCALE (Environmental Sensing
    and Community Alert Network) platform, which is an inexpensive Raspberry Pi based
    environmental sensing system that employs air quality sensors and periodically
    publishes sensor data over a 3G connection with a limited data plan. We outline
    our deployment experience of EnviroSCALE in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh,
    particularly in the direction of infrastructure-level adaptation. For information-level
    adaptation, our testbed experiment results demonstrate the practicality of adaptive
    sensing and triggering rich sensing analytics via user-specified criteria over
    budgeted 3G connections. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    monitoring 1. Introduction The emerging trend to incorporate Internet of Things
    (IoT) based smart devices and sensors to instrument communities and cities around
    the world has enhanced environmental awareness in urban regions. New smart city
    applications aim to monitor environmental conditions to ensure health and safety
    of the public at large. For example, effectively monitoring and managing air quality
    is an age-old problem that is becoming more important with increasing urbanization.
    In one study, World Health Organization (WHO) reported that global urban air pollution
    was increased by 8% during the period 2008–2013 [75]. Rise in pollution levels
    has catastrophic consequences to the environment - awareness of air quality can
    help individuals take measures to improve health awareness. In practice, however,
    the ability to gather environmental information in cities and communities at finer
    levels of temporal and spatial granularity is limited because of high deployment
    costs and maintenance overheads. The issue is further aggravated in developing
    nations such as Bangladesh, where it is not always possible to deploy permanent
    sensors due to lack of reliable, cheap and ubiquitous WiFi connectivity nationwide.
    The presence of low-cost sensing (in-situ and mobile) with improved connectivity
    options are required to make such services accessible to a larger community who
    can subscribe to receive the associated information. While some countries in South
    Asia (e.g., Bangladesh) are ahead in terms of 3G cellular provisioning [52], exploiting
    3G connectivity for continuous and autonomous real time sensing with IoT platforms
    can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose to develop inexpensive
    air quality monitoring solutions to accurately gather and communicate information
    to cloud platforms where the information can be further analyzed and acted upon.
    Due to the dynamic nature of the environment and phenomena being monitored (e.g.,
    toxic plumes in a fire), the proposed schemes must be inherently adaptive. We
    have developed a combined hardware/software platform that includes off-the-shelf
    sensors and compute platform (Raspberry Pi), along with a modular software stack
    to collect and upload data to the cloud. In particular, our work is an extension
    of an IoT based sensing platform SCALE (currently used for public safety applications),
    developed at UC Irvine [6]. SCALE was a low cost IoT platform without any data
    budget consideration, whereas we design our software to work with both cellular
    and WiFi connection with a data budget constraint. We construct an air quality
    measuring box, EnviroSCALE, with a suitable set of sensors for collecting environmental
    sensing data and uploading them over a cellular connection. Another adaptation
    strategy is to enable simple IoT analytics on board and send lower-volume processed
    information over the limited communication networks. We refer to this as information-level
    adaptation in this work. In particular, we employ container-based middleware to
    support a more flexible deployment of the EnviroSCALE IoT platform, where analytics
    can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner based on the type of information processing
    needed. With the ability to process sensor data on-board, we can now deploy richer
    sensing modalities such as video and audio sensing. Our work attempts to add intelligence
    in the IoT platform to automatically activate a range of multimedia sensors, such
    as microphones and cameras, for a more comprehensive analysis. We note that these
    multimedia sensors generate a large volume of data that can overwhelm the constrained
    data connections. Our strategy is to adaptively deploy media analytics on the
    devices colocated or close to the media sensors. Containers, fortunately, allow
    us to package the rich sensing analytics, along with any associated software dependencies,
    for easy deployment. The container based approach enables multiple usage scenarios
    to be configured and reconfigured. We list sample scenarios below: • Air quality
    sensors may report high PM 2.5 pollutants, and activate cameras and rich sensing
    analytics to identify the pollution sources (such as garbage, construction sites,
    and others). • Gas sensors may detect the existence of toxic or flammable gas,
    and activate cameras to identify and alert the persons in the affected zone. •
    Microphone arrays may report gunshots, and activate cameras for collecting evidence
    and locate the suspects. In this paper, we build a prototype system to explore
    the need for adaptation and demonstrate the practicality of our container-based
    approach for IoT deployments. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 surveys the literature. The EnviroSCALE prototype is detailed in Section
    3. Section 4 formulates and solves the adaptation problems to meet the data plan
    budget. This is followed by the evaluations reported in Section 5. Section 6 concludes
    the article. 2. Related work The uprising trend in Internet of Things has inspired
    researchers around the world to devise various solutions using IoT. Various application
    scenarios, architectural elements and future directions in IoT are presented in
    [19]. The application scenarios are extent from home to community and national
    level. IoT based smart home automation. Home automation solutions are available
    in literature [33], [55], [58], which include Raspberry Pi (RPi) based monitoring
    and access control system for smart home [13], [56]. Vujović and Maksimović [74]
    identified RPi as a potential sensor web node for home automation. In [32], an
    IoT based smart parking system for smart community was implemented. Environmental
    condition monitoring possibilities were addressed in the contributions of [31].
    A dedicated IoT-based family robot based was implemented in [38]. Raspberry Pi
    for surveillance purpose is used in the works of [68]. Smart agriculture. IoT
    solutions are not limited to smart homes. Possibilities of smart agriculture based
    on IoT and cloud computing was studied in [18], [65], [80]. In [4], authors discussed
    development of smart devices to solve security and monitoring problems for agriculture.
    An autonomous percipient irrigation system was developed in [27] using Raspberry
    Pi. Another Raspberry Pi based solution for Green IoT Agriculture and healthcare
    was proposed in [50]. An intelligent agriculture management information system
    based on IoT was designed in [76]. Healthcare. Healthcare is another area which
    experienced IoT development. In [28], authors made a comprehensive study on IoT
    for healthcare. Being easy to interface with health monitoring devices, Raspberry
    Pi is popular for healthcare based IoT solutions. IoT based patient monitoring
    systems were fashioned in [21], [35], [36]. IoT based biometrics have also gained
    popularity in recent times [69]. The works of [16] uses KVM virtualization in
    industrial applications. Environment monitoring. Several recent efforts focus
    on the use of IoT solutions for environment monitoring. Among these, there are
    solutions to monitor water quality in real time [73], smart environment monitoring
    devices [26], IoT based urban climate monitoring systems [70]. IoT enabled air
    quality monitoring system was developed in [3]. All these four solutions [3],
    [26], [70], [73] were based on Raspberry Pi. A basic architecture and process
    for distributed air quality monitoring is discussed in [72]. Air Quality Egg [14]
    is a community driven sensing network hosted on Xively IoT platform that is similar
    to our hosting process. Among the commercially available air monitoring devices,
    AirBeam [1] is a wearable mapping, graphing, and crowdsourcing platform, and Awair
    [2] focuses on indoor air quality measurement. The use of Raspberry Pi as the
    core module in IoT system has its own benefits, as seen in and highlighted in
    [40]. It compares Raspberry Pi based device with other devices, and points out
    its flexibility in use and its ability to house a large number of external peripherals.
    These attributes make Raspberry Pi particularly suitable for use in air quality
    monitoring application. Another air quality monitoring IoT system that uses MQTT
    to measure and report humidity, carbon dioxide, dust, and air pressure is discussed
    in [37]. This system is installed in India and uses IoT IBM BlueMix, which is
    a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) provided mainly to enterprises. Another air quality
    monitoring IoT system that uses MQTT to measure and report humidity, carbon dioxide,
    dust, and air pressure is discussed in [37]. These IoT based solutions are plain
    implementations and do not consider any strategy to narrow the data volume or
    employ any virtualization technique. Safe and smart community. Besides other possible
    IoT based solutions in various scenarios, a keen and promising area to explore
    is community wellness. The Safe Community Awareness and Alerting Network (SCALE)
    [6] platform is an IoT system created in the context of the SmartAmerica Challenge
    effort to aid public and personal safety using inexpensive off-the-shelf IoT devices.
    SCALE supported data exchange between IoT content producers and consumers using
    a Pub/Sub architecture through the use of lightweight M2M (machine to machine)
    protocols such as MQTT. SCALE2 enhanced the basic SCALE platform with resilience
    capabilities including multiple network [61] capabilities. Similar smart community
    efforts around the world have gained popularity in recent years. For example,
    the Padova Smart City [78] implements techniques to collect temperature, humidity
    and light sensitivity data and store them in an HTTP-CoAP proxy server. AQBox
    [22], an earlier version of EnviroSCALE, illustrates the promise of off-the-shelf
    sensors for air quality monitoring. U-Sense [8] is a low-cost sensing system using
    sensors and wireless access point to upload data. Raspberry Pi as the core module
    in IoT system. The use of Raspberry Pi as the core module in IoT system has its
    own benefits, as seen highlighted in [40]. It compares Raspberry Pi based device
    with other devices, and points out its use in flexibility and its ability to house
    a large number of external peripherals make it suitable for use in air quality
    monitoring application. Among the previously mentioned solutions, most of them
    were implemented using Raspberry Pi [3], [13], [19], [20], [21], [26], [27], [32],
    [33], [35], [36], [38], [50], [55], [56], [58], [62], [69], [70], [73], [74].
    In [79], authors explored IoT applications using Raspberry Pi thoroughly. The
    works of [20] explained with examples how to implement IoT devices using RPi.
    Choice of RPi is also popular for building middleware [7], [49]. The necessity
    of a IoT middleware platform for managing distributed source of streams is recognised
    and discussed in breadth in [66]. The framework they propose to bridge the gap
    in the lack of availability of IoT middleware uses TensorFlow as computing module
    and Raspberry Pi to run the smart home applications to validate their architecture.
    A scalable and low cost MQTT broker and implemented using RPi was proposed in
    [30]. In [39], authors propose an architecture for IoT as a service and implemented
    so using RPi. Being so popular among IoT researchers and easy to use, EnviroSCALE
    was also built using RPi. 3G as IoT gateway. Having RPi as the base hardware,
    the choice for IoT gateway can both be WiFi and 2G/3G networks. 3G network has
    been identified as one of the promising IoT gateways in literature [12], [19],
    [82]. The works of [25] proposed an IoT framework that makes use of 3G networks
    for connectivity. Implementation of IoT solutions in various areas using 3G is
    also popular [15], [17], [29], [41], [57]. Although these use 3G for connecting
    to the Internet, they do no consider constraints due to the expensive 3G data.
    Container based virtualizations. With rise in IoT devices and envisioning that
    everything will eventually be connected to the Internet, container based virtualizations
    have been gaining its popularity for providing lightweight services. In [45],
    the authors compare virtual machines with lightweight virtualization technologies,
    and present three usage scenarios in smart cities. The authors of [11] explore
    container-based virtualization on smart objects for IoT Cloud scenarios. In [48],
    the authors develop a container-based platform that deploys several smart-car
    applications on Raspberry Pis. The deployment on in-vehicle networks improves
    the efficiency of the resources allocation. Morabito et al. [46] adopt two different
    lightweight virtualization technologies on a real IoT testbed to quantify the
    performance with and without the virtualization overhead. In [67], authors propose
    a container-based resource allocation scheme. In [53], a container-based PaaS
    architecture for RPi clusters was proposed. The works of [10] presented a three-layer
    container-based architecture. A new concept of Software Defined IoT Units was
    introduced [51] to provision container-based IoT cloud systems. Morabito et al.
    [47] implement a lightweight gateway using Raspberry Pi. The gateway contains
    two modules: northbound and southbound, for higher flexibility. The northbound
    module communicates over the Internet and the southbound module communicates with
    the sensors. Yin et al. [77] employ container based virtualization with task-scheduling
    algorithm and reallocation mechanism to mitigate the problems caused by devices
    failure and task delays. Brost et al. [9] leverage the isolated execution supports
    of containers to realize a secure architecture. Dynamic application deployment
    on IoT devices utilizing lightweight virtualization methods are gaining popularity
    [5], [44], [53], [54], [64]. Various container technologies are also evaluated
    in literature [42], [43]. With container-based virtualization, we could build
    process fast and easily to manage resources and diverse services on heterogeneous
    device. Most important, the overheads such as CPU utilization, power consumption,
    and the latency significantly decrease. Our earlier work [24], [60] advocates
    container based smart city platforms, that leverage centralized controllers for
    resource allocation. In the current work, we demonstrate the utility of automated
    rich sensing and associated analytics triggered by sensor readings. Adaptive operations
    in IoT. Several IoT systems focus on adapting operation based on ‘power’ very
    similar to the adaptivity of budget we are employing in this paper. In [81], a
    low power wide area network is implemented. AdaM is an adaptive monitoring framework
    for IoT devices [59]. In [34], the authors devised an adaptive rule based IoT
    engine for health data acquisition. An adaptive lossless entropy compressor was
    proposed in [71]. None of these techniques use virtualization. The key innovation
    of our work is to design a system that considers data plan constraints, focusing
    specifically on 3G cellular networks. The idea is to employ dynamic adaptation
    to collect samples from the sensors, without losing information content. This
    adaptation is essential to support resource provisioning for community IoT systems,
    where there are frequent changes in the sensing and communication contexts. The
    various adaptation techniques we will explore to enhance QoS and performance in
    such settings include support for layered virtualization images for reduced network
    overhead and event-driven application deployment. 3. EnviroSCALE: IoT platform
    for environmental monitoring We first describe the two adaptation strategies.
    We then describe in detail the physical sensors based EnviroSCALE box and then
    the container-based analytic modules and their deployment and management. 3.1.
    Overview of the EnviroSCALE prototype EnviroSCALE is a multi-sensor IoT platform
    that is designed for measuring environmental pollution through a series of gas,
    dust, air quality sensors. The platform is constructed to be deployed outdoor
    where WiFi connections may not be available, hence it uses 3G cellular connections
    to upload sensor data to the cloud. Since 3G connections are metered and have
    usually fixed data budget (dictated by the associated data plans), the platform
    needs to operate in a budget-aware fashion and needs to shape its data traffic
    matching the data budget by adjusting sampling frequencies of on-board sensors
    or data pruning (if required). Our first version of EnviroSCALE, namely EnviroSCALE
    box, contained only a set of physical sensors that mostly generated time-series
    scalar data. EnviroSCALE box only had infrastructure-level adaptations. Later
    on, we augmented the platform so that it can make rich sensemaking that can involve
    multi-media sensors, such as camera and microphones. The augmented version supports
    both infrastructure- and information-level adaptations. For example, whenever
    a gas sensor detects a poisonous gas exceeding a certain level, it can trigger
    a camera to capture images and detect if there is any human in the area so that
    she can be alerted. This kind of event detection needs data from multimedia sensors
    which are much larger than other sensors, say gas sensors. To accommodate sensors
    with large values, we instrumented EnviroSCALE with the capability of deploying
    rich sensing analytic close to the multimedia sensors. This enables the platform
    to send processed results instead of raw multimedia data over the constrained
    data connections. Since these analytics are application specific and may need
    to perform rich but arbitrary computation on sensor data, they are hosted through
    containers. These container-backed analytic modules effectively function as virtual
    sensors in the platform and generate event data, which are then uploaded over
    the constrained 3G connections. In this way, we do reduce the sensor data amount
    more aggressively while supporting comprehensive event detection. For the point
    of deploying the containers for these analytics, There are multiple ways to so.
    Mature or stable analytics modules can be shipped with the SD cards for Raspberry
    Pis. For experimental or new analytics modules, administrators may go to the proximity
    of Raspberry PIs and push the containers over short-range wireless networks, such
    as WiFi Direct. In the case of urgent, such as security, updates, the containers
    can be downloaded through 3G downlinks during the off-peak time. In the rest of
    the article, we assume that the containers are preloaded on Raspberry PIs before
    being launched. 3.2. EnviroSCALE box We give the schematic of the box in Fig.
    1. The basic platform is designed using a Raspberry Pi for control and sensing
    tasks and an Arduino Nano for additional sensing tasks. The MQ series gas sensors
    are connected to the analog input pins of Arduino Nano. The platform uses three
    gas sensors: MQ−4 for detecting combustible gases, MQ−6 for butane and LPG, and
    MQ−135 for measuring air quality (sensitive to benzene, alcohol, smoke, ammonia,
    sulfide, etc.). Two digital sensors: DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor and the
    Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F dust sensor are interfaced through the digital input pins of
    Arduino Nano. The platform also has a GPS receiver (GlobalSat BU−353S4), an HSPA
    + 3G cellular model (Huawei E303) and a WiFi dongle (D-Link), all connected via
    the USB port. The RPi runs on an 8 GB microSD card loaded with a standard Linux
    image and the SCALE software stack. The whole setup, when deployed outdoors, is
    powered by an external battery of 19,200 mAh capacity. Fig. 2 is an image of our
    the initial EnviroSCALE prototype. Download : Download high-res image (260KB)

    Fig. 2. Photos of our EnviroSCALE box. The software stack of the EnviroSCALE box
    includes a sensing and computation module, an upload module and a data publishing
    module (MQTT broker). A key adaptation feature in the prototype software stack
    is the adjustment of data capture parameters. During operation, the sensing and
    computation module adjusts the sampling intervals of sensors to ensure that the
    platform operates under the constrained data connection without loss of significant
    sensor information. This adjustment is done dynamically to adaptively change the
    sampling rate based on the constrained data connection. The module reads the connected
    sensors, converts the sensor data into a valid representation, and inserts them
    into an in-memory queue. An upload routine is invoked periodically to upload data
    from the queue (using the MQTT protocol to an MQTT sever). The upload routine
    also handles data coming from the virtual sensors (i.e., analytic modules) and
    shape the traffic to fit in the data budget (which we describe in the next section).
    As an effort to reduce data volume even more, the upload routine ties together
    data entries into a bundle and encodes them into a binary payload instead of using
    verbatim XML or JSON format, which are arguably expensive in terms of byte usage
    over a constrained 3G data plan. A central server is maintained that collects
    these encoded payloads, decodes them and publishes them back in a self-descriptive
    JSON format under a suitable MQTT topic name so that other users can consume the
    published sensor data. Any device that can be connected to the MQTT broker can
    subscribe to the topic to consume the sensor data. 3.3. Container-based analytics
    for rich sensemaking As we argued, EnviroSCALE hosts analytic modules running
    on containers to make rich sensemaking, such as event detection. Doing so, however,
    is no easy task, because the IoT platform is resource constrained, and the resource
    consumption must be carefully monitored, managed, and planned. To this end, we
    propose a centralized management platform for rich sensing analytic, as illustrated
    in Fig. 3, which contains a server on the left and multiple IoT devices on the
    right. In addition to the EnviroSCALE box, we also adopt Docker containers for
    dynamic deployments of rich sensing analytic and Kubernetes for management of
    multiple IoT devices that are heterogeneous in capabilities and locations. We
    assume near-by IoT devices communicate via short-range wireless networks. Next,
    we briefly introduce Docker containers and Kubernetes. Download : Download high-res
    image (207KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Container-based IoT
    platform for rich analytic. Docker containers enable us to package rich sensing
    analytic along with its dependencies, such as run-time libraries and configurations
    into Docker images. Docker provides tools to simplify the process of creating,
    deploying, and launching these Docker images on heterogeneous IoT devices. Docker
    containers provide some protections via isolation similar to virtual machines,
    but docker containers do not contain complete operating systems, and thus incur
    less overhead. Moreover, multiple docker containers may share the same underlying
    Linux kernel for faster response time. Kubernetes provides tools to deploy, manage,
    and migrate rich sensing analytic as container images. It adopts client-server
    model, where multiple IoT devices are connected to a server and the clients periodically
    report the resource levels of the IoT devices to the server. Then, the Kubernetes
    server instructs the clients to launch appropriate Docker images on the IoT devices
    at the right locations. The problem of disseminating the Docker images over constrained
    data connections can be partially solved by the image pools, which are caches
    of Docker images. That is, a Docker image is sent to an IoT device only once,
    even if it is launched multiple times. Moreover, Docker images have layered structures,
    and thus several images may share the same lower layers. 4. Adaptive sensemaking
    under budgeted data plans In this section, we first give the architecture of EnviroSCALE.
    We then present the two adaptation strategies. 4.1. Architecture of EnviroSCALE
    Fig. 4 present the architecture of the EnviroSCALE prototype, which consists of
    physical sensors, virtual sensors, and event-generator. The physical and virtual
    sensors generate periodic sensor readings, while the event-generators produce
    event data aperiodically, more precisely whenever an event is detected. The readings,
    in most cases, are real-valued numbers obtained from the sensor at a particular
    time and location. Hence, all sensors readings, called samples, are timestamped
    and geotagged with latitude and longitude values obtained from the GPS. Compared
    to physical sensors, the virtual sensors and event generators are realized as
    analytic logics packaged in containers, so as to extract the more condense information
    out of the physical sensor readings. These containers are preloaded on Raspberry
    Pi, and then dynamically launched and teared down following the sensing demands
    and available resources. The core of EnviroSCALE is an Uploader Handler that determines:
    (i) the upload frequency of individual sensors and (ii) whether to launch or tear
    down containers (of virtual sensors and event-generators) under the constraint
    of 3G wireless bandwidth. The later decisions on which containers to launch or
    tear down are associated with some overhead and thus are longer-term decisions;
    while the former decisions distribute the data budget in real time, in order to
    provide as frequent sensor readings as possible. Notice that event-generators
    produce aperiodic sensor readings, which are transmitted once in a while and thus
    have the highest priority. The residue data budget (with size of aperiodic sensor
    readings deducted) is allocated among the physical and virtual sensors. Download

    Architecture of EnviroSCALE. As the platform deploys multiple sensors and each
    sensor may have a different degree of temporal sensitivity to their readings,
    they all may not be sampled at the same periodic interval, rather at different
    intervals. For example, LPG sensors can measure the level of LPG in air in every
    10 seconds (because it may change suddenly) whereas the dust level can be observed
    in every minute (as it may remain fairly constant in a certain area). These intervals
    are called the sampling intervals of the sensors (or sampling frequency is expressed
    in Hertz, the reciprocal of the intervals). Sensor readings also have a certain
    size per sample (in bytes). The sampling frequencies together with the sample
    sizes determine the overall data volume of operation. It can be argued that the
    overall volume of data that can be sent over a 3G connection is limited and is
    usually dictated by a data plan. A data plan is a contract between the 3G operator
    and a user restricting how much data the user can send over an extended period
    of time. For example, a 10MB per week data plan limits sending (and receiving)
    a total of 10 MB over a week period. Typically, it is up to the user to decide
    how to use this allocated amount; she may prefer to use up the entire 10 MB in
    first hour or first day or save progressively to use it throughout the whole week.
    Although a data plan is usually accounted for both uploading and downloading bytes,
    in our case we assume the data plan is for upload bytes as the upload traffic
    dominates in our platform. Given a certain data plan, it can happen that the total
    volume of data generated by all sensors when configured to run at their specified
    frequencies may exceed the data budget. In that, the frequencies of different
    sensors need to be adjusted: more precisely frequencies are adjusted to lower
    values. The adjusted frequencies are referred to as operating frequency per sensor.
    Given a data plan, the central question of the upload handler is as how to choose
    sampling frequencies for sensors so that the overall data generated during the
    data plan duration remains bounded with the data plan budget. We describe this
    next. 4.2. Handling data uploads under constrained data plans The data characteristics
    of each sensor i, (both physical and virtual) are described by three parameters
    as shown in Fig. 4: (Fi, si, wi), where Fi is the sampling frequency (and is the
    sampling interval), si be the size of each reading (we assume all readings from
    a given sensors are of equal sizes) and wi is a weight denoting the degree of
    importance of its samples, which can be specified by the application or can be
    derived from the sensor readings themselves. The weights also indicate the degree
    of sensitivity to the adjustment to their requested frequencies (if ever needs
    to be done by the upload handler). The aperiodic event-generators, however, do
    not have periods (hence sampling frequencies), instead they send data as events
    get detected. Since every data sending operation over 3G has an overhead, it would
    not be wise to communicate every reading as and when they are obtained. Instead,
    we accumulate readings for a certain duration and upload them as a bundle. The
    length of this interval, which we refer to as upload interval, should be small
    enough to ensure that we do not lose the timeliness of the sensed data and large
    enough to amortize the cost of additional transmission overhead while uploading
    this information using 3G networks. Given a data plan and an upload interval,
    the question becomes one of how to choose sampling frequency or intervals for
    sensors so that the overall data generated during the data plan duration remains
    bounded with the data plan budget. Let tuple (M, D) denote a data plan that enables
    uploading M bytes of data for a duration of D seconds and T be the upload interval.
    We split the entire data budget, D, equally across all the upload events. That
    means, the platform can upload at most ρ × T bytes at every upload interval, where
    is the upload rate (measured in bytes/sec). This definition of ρ, however, gives
    only the initial value of ρ as it changes throughout the operation depending on
    the total remaining budget. At every upload event, sensor readings are accumulated
    since the last upload event and the accumulated bytes are uploaded with an additional
    overhead of α bytes. This overhead is fixed for a data packet sent via network
    channel, in other words, it is the per packet protocol overhead. Therefore, the
    following constraint should hold for a platform with k sensors: (1) which can
    be reduced to: (2) Let so we have: (3) Writing in terms of sampling frequency,
    it becomes: (4) Therefore, the budgeted operation over 3G requires us to adjust
    the values of Fi so that the above constraint holds. If the constraint holds,
    that means the sensors can operate in their specified frequency and no adjustment
    to their frequencies are required. Otherwise, an adjustment is made. Let fi be
    the operating frequency of sensor i (instead of its specified Fi) so that total
    data volume remains bounded. Obviously, fi is strictly less than Fi for at least
    one sensor if not all. Since we intended to best utilize the data budget, we may
    want the constraint 4 to hold with equality, which gives: (5) As the sampling
    frequencies are adjusted, we define a loss function, Li(fi), which gives the perceived
    loss in sensor readings whenever the sensor’s frequency is reduce from the base
    frequency Fi. Technically, this loss function is a convex function over the difference
    between fi and Fi (the value of loss increases as the difference grows). The function
    can even be different across different sensors. We, nonetheless, assume a generic
    function: . Our goal is to choose fi so that the overall weighted loss over all
    sensors is minimized. We have: (6) The strategy we adopt to find the local minima
    is based on Lagrange multiplier. Introducing Lagrange multiplier, we have (7)
    We are to find fi’s and λ so as to minimize . Differentiating with respect to
    fi and λ gives: (8) (9) Plugging in the defined loss function and its derivative,
    we get the following solution for fi’s: (10) where Given (Fi, wi, si) triples
    per sensor, the upload handler computes the operating frequencies, fi, using Eq.
    (10). If we denote as the amount by which the data volume exceeds budget (A) when
    the sensors operate in their base frequencies, we have: (11) As we see from the
    above expression, frequency adjustment is done only when Δ is +ve, that is, data
    budget is exceeded by the total volume of data. If Δ is zero or negative, no adjustment
    is required and the sensors operate in their base frequency (Fi). Once the operating
    frequencies for both physical and virtual sensors are determined, now the question
    is how the upload handler realizes these frequencies in action. For the physical
    sensors, the platform would ultimately sample the sensors at those frequencies,
    that is, it would take periodic sensor readings at an interval of . For virtual
    sensors, however, this cannot be made because they operate inside a container
    and their operating frequencies can be hardly changed. Instead, the upload handler
    would take all readings at an interval but prune some data points (so as to match
    data volume with that of fi). Two options can be tried in this regard: • Each
    data reading reported from the virtual sensor may contain a measure of importance
    with it depending on the application specific value assigned to the reading. One
    way to measure this importance is to calculate how different a reading is from
    its previous measurements. When the system runs under fi < Fi, it keeps only readings
    with higher importance level and drops the lower valued ones. • When the system
    cannot find the less important data to prune or there is no important level assigned
    to the readings, the handler randomly drops incoming data items with probability
    which shapes the frequency from Fi to fi, which in turn would meet the budget.
    While the upload handler shapes incoming data received from both the physical
    and virtual sensors by adjusting their operating frequencies, what remains is
    to describe how it handles data coming from the aperiodic event-generators. Event-generators
    produce data occasionally and the generated data is immediately pushed to the
    upload queue (being ready to be uploaded in the next upload event). Once uploaded,
    the handler deducts the total volume of data uploaded from the remaining data
    plan budget and updates data upload rate, ρ, for the next upload event as follows
    (if budget and duration still remain): Alternative solutions for fi There can
    be occasions when the base frequencies of sensors, Fi, (as well as weights, wi)
    may be unknown, especially for the physical sensors. In that case, we cannot solve
    Eq. (6) to find fi. Instead, we are simply left with the constraint: which can
    have a generalized solution of the form: for suitably define weights where . In
    that, operating frequencies are given by: (12) We apply two simple approaches
    to determine weights to adapt data collection based on plan budgets: • Equal weights:
    In this, we assume all ωi’s are equal. Hence, and . • Proportional weights: Each
    sensor can be assigned an application specific “value” based on the importance
    of the sampling interval for a particular sensor: higher value means higher sampling
    frequency, that is, lower sampling interval. This value can be derived from the
    samples themselves as well. For example, samples showing lower degree of variance
    can be sampled at a lower frequency (i.e., at a higher time interval) and high
    variation in samples results in shorter interval. To this end, we use the co-efficient
    of variation (cv), of samples as a way of measuring ωi. Hence, ωi’s are given
    by: (13) where μi and σi are the mean and the standard deviation of sensor readings
    as observed before the current upload event. Putting ωi in Eq. (12) gives operating
    frequency fi. 4.3. Deployment and activation of container-driven analytics To
    dig useful information from multimedia data, we leverage the container technology
    running with diverse analytics to realize it. The analytics are launched in periodical
    or aperiodical ways. E.g., air pollution analytics may update pollution heatmaps
    every 10 s. In contrast to air pollution, some emergent events, such as fire fighting
    event are launched in aperiodical way. There are two possible ways to launch the
    analytics: (i) launching the analytics on a cloud server, which receives sensing
    data (image) from data originates (Raspberry Pis) for further analyzing or (ii)
    launching the analytics on Raspberry Pis and send analyzed results to the cloud
    server. Sending images to the cloud server consumes large amount of network resources,
    while launching all the analytics on Raspberry Pi suffers from limited resource
    budgets, such as RAM. Hence, we formulate our information-level adaptation problem
    to minimize the overall network consumption with RAM and network budgets. We formulate
    the problem as a ILP problem, as illustrated in formulation (14). This problem
    will be solved in every T ’tes. The decision variable is ai, which is a boolean
    value to decide whether we launch analytics i. Every analytic has its desired
    frequency Fi. Moreover, Z(i, ai) gives consumed network traffic of launching i
    or sending data to the cloud without launching i, where i ∈ J and J is a set of
    analytics. The objective function Eq. (14a) minimizes overall network traffic.
    Eq. (14b) ensures that the total consumed bandwidth is smaller than the network
    budget (rate*T) of our 3G cellular networks. Eq. (14c) ensures that the consumed
    RAM resources of launched analytics are smaller than the total remaining RAM budgets
    (S) of the devices connected through the same 3G networks. (14a) (14b) (14c) (14d)
    5. Experimental results We conducted three sets of experiments with EnviroSCALE.
    The first set of experiments utilized the real hardware setup deployed in diverse
    settings in a real city - Dhaka, Bangladesh; air quality data was collected under
    different scenarios and conditions. The second set of experimental results are
    derived from a simulation-based study where we analyze our proposed adaptive sampling
    techniques under various parameters. The third set of results correspond to deployment
    of container-based analytics and an application usecase of on-demand activation
    of analytics. 5.1. Data collection from EnviroSCALE deployment We deployed EnviroSCALE
    at different places of Dhaka and collected air quality data. We tried to validate
    our data collected from different contexts. For instance, we compared two datasets
    of methane concentration readings, one collected in indoor setup in a regular
    day and the other one was collected from a roadside with considerable amount of
    cow excretion, a large source of methane. Fig. 5a shows the histograms of these
    two, and it shows that in the later one, methane concentration shows a higher
    value, which should actually be the case. Fig. 5b and 5 c show comparisons between
    CO2 and dust sensor readings in different scenarios. Download : Download high-res

    from the EnviroSCALE setup. 5.2. Analysis of different adaptation techniques Now
    we present the comparison of the three adaptive sampling approaches. We wrote
    a custom trace-driven and message-level simulator to model the scenario we worked
    in, namely generating samples from sensors (actually replay of earlier recorded
    data), enforcing a certain data plan. The simulator mimics EnviroSCALE by taking
    the data plan (D, M) as its configuration. It can be configured to imitate variable
    number of periodic sensors (both physical and virtual), and aperiodic event-generators.
    In the experiments, both physical and virtual sensors use data traces from previous
    deployments for generating sensor readings. Aperiodic events happen as a Poison
    process with a certain rate where each event has a certain size. Table 2 shows
    a set of important simulation settings. Each simulation runs for 500 s with an
    upload interval of 50 s. The detailed simulation scenario along with the simulator
    code and data trace is publicly available here [63]. Table 1. List of sensors

    aperiodic 2048 Aperiodic Event-Triggered Due to the adjustment of sampling frequencies,
    the sensor data streams that are eventually uploaded differ from the original
    trace. In fact, the uploaded data stream may contain less number of data points
    from the original data stream . We are interested to see to what extent these
    two streams vary. Fig. 6 shows how the two streams are constructed and compared.
    When a given sensor reading is not uploaded—which we referred to as being missed
    in the reconstructed stream—the missing value is estimated by linear interpolation
    from the two nearby uploaded readings as shown in Fig. 6. The difference between
    these two values is an error. In particular, we compute the relative errors across
    all missing values and take its average. We refer to this quantity as Mean Absolute
    Percentage Error (MAPE), which is defined as: (15) where Tri and Rci denote the
    true and interpolated value respectively and N is the total number of missing
    points. Obviously, if all data points are uploaded, MAPE becomes zero, otherwise
    it takes a positive value: higher value indicating higher degree of error. Download

    Errors are measured from the trace and the reconstructed data points. We compute
    and compare results for three frequency adaption techniques. One technique is
    the one that adjusts the specified (i.e., base) frequencies of periodic sensors
    using Eq. (11). The other two techniques are due to Eq. (12) with “equal” and
    “proportional” weights. The results for comparing the trace of Dust with the collected
    samples are presented in Fig. 7. The reason for choosing Dust sensor is simply
    because data collected from this show the highest variation; and therefore this
    sensor is particularly more important than others. It is clear that “Specified
    frequency” method gives the least error. Among the other two, “Equal weights”
    is the better one; as we had already investigated in our earlier works. Download

    Effect of D on MAPE calculated from Dust. The reason behind “Specified frequency”
    approach performing better than the other two is investigated in Fig. 8. This
    illustrates the frequencies that were employed to sample the Dust sensor over
    the runtime. The frequency chosen by “Specified frequency” approach is static,
    and does not change. This is because the base frequencies of the sensors given
    in the simulation setting do not overflow the data budget, and therefore the stable
    frequency of 5 Hz is used throughout the entire time. On the other hand, the other
    two approaches do not care for base frequency, rather try to maximize bytes used
    (of course, by keeping within the data plan). Therefore, the frequencies given
    by these are not so stable over time. Although the other two are often able to
    operate with higher frequencies (compared to “Specified frequency”), the moments
    when the frequency is lower contributes to the comparatively larger error. Download

    Change of the sampling period over running time for the three approaches (D =
    200 Kbytes). It is important to note that these frequencies that were configured
    into the simulator were calculated by analyzing the data trace. We collected samples
    from trace using various sampling frequencies, and found that 5 Hz is convincingly
    fast enough for resulting in very low error. Thus, “Specified frequency” approach,
    with this little analysis, brings about a priori knowledge of the previously collected
    data into the whole adaptive environment, and performs better. We also outlined
    similar plots for this approach, in this case, forcing it to adjust its frequencies
    by allowing it a lighter data plan. Due to the light data budget, the initial
    frequencies are lower, but quickly rises close to the base frequency. For the
    heavier data plan, on the other case, the base frequencies do not overflow the
    budget, and thus the base frequencies are used through and through. Of course,
    this means sampling at a speed slower than we are capable of, thus resulting in
    lower utilization (Fig. 10). Then again, operating in base frequencies is exactly
    the goal of this adaptive sampling scheme after all. Download : Download high-res

    from various runs. Finally, we present Utilization, defined as ratio of bytes
    actually used, to bytes installed in the data plan (D), in Fig. 10. The purpose
    of this study is to assess if our methods are in fact capable of operating within
    the data plan, or they exceed it. Utilization for “Equal weights” and “Proportional
    weights” both exhibit an utilization close to 100, whereas “Specified frequency”
    shows a lower value for two cases. For the lower utilizations, the frequencies
    are not challenged by the data plan, and therefore the base frequencies are maintained
    altogether, resulting in lower utilization. We conclude this section by pointing
    out that for some cases, the utilization is more than 100%, thus exceeds the data
    plan. However, the extra usage is at most 5% and therefore, considered tolerable.
    5.3. Optimal information-level adaptation We optimally solve our information-level
    adaptation problem in Eq. (14) using CPLEX, which is referred to OPT. Moreover,
    we implement two baseline algorithms, called ALL and NONE for comparisons. The
    ALL algorithm launches all the on-board analytics, which minimizes the network
    consumption without considering the RAM budget. The NONE algorithm analyzes everything
    in the cloud, which consumes the network data plan budget the most. In our experiments,
    we vary the number of analytics |J|={5, 10, 15, 20, 25}, where 20 is the default
    setting. In each run, the analytics are randomly selected from two sample analytic
    applications implemented by us: sound recognizer and object detector. The sound
    recognizer is a periodic analytics application and the object detector is an aperiodic
    analytics application. We set the 3G bandwidth to 2 Mbps and T to 10 min, so that
    the network resource budget is rate  × T=2 Mbps × 10 Min. The frequency of periodic
    analytic (sound recognizer) is while the event generation frequency of the aperiodic
    analytic (object detection) is randomly generated with a mean of 1/T. We conduct
    a measurement study to measure the required network resources of the analytics
    for every analyzing task with/without launching the containers on the Raspberry
    Pi. The measurement results are reported in Table 3. We use the system model derived
    by Hong et al. [23] to model the RAM resource consumptions of our analytics. The
    RAM budget S={1,2,4,8} GB, where 8 is the default setting. We vary the values
    of D and S and conduct our experiments 5 times. We report the average results
    with 95% confidence intervals whenever applicable. Table 3. The network resource
    requirements of the analytics with/without launching the analytics on Raspberry
    Pis. Empty Cell With Without Sound Recognizer 708 B 61 KB Object Detector 709
    B 194 KB Fig. 11 shows that compared to the NONE algorithm, our OPT algorithm
    saves significant amount of network resources. Moreover, when the number of analytics
    is smaller than 15, our OPT algorithm achieves the same performance as the ALL
    algorithm. This however does not mean that the ALL algorithm outperforms our OPT
    algorithm, as explained by Fig. 12. This figure shows that the ALL algorithm does
    not carefully consider the RAM budget. When the number of analytic is greater
    than 15, the ALL algorithm overloads the Raspberry Pi, rendering the solution
    impractical. Fig. 13 reports the network resource consumptions under different
    RAM budgets. It shows that while the RAM budget is increased, we can save more
    and more network resources. We note that we do not include the ALL algorithm in
    Fig. 13 because it does not comply with the RAM budgets. Download : Download high-res

    on-demand person detection As a proof of concept, we implement a person detector
    on our platform for real experiments, as illustrated in Fig. 14. We use an Intel
    i5 Ubuntu box installed with Kubernetes as our Central Server. The IoT end devices
    have Raspberry Pi 3 as the base hardware, installed with Kubernetes, Docker, and
    EnviroSCALE. EnviroSCALE monitors air for toxic or flammable gases and once detected,
    it notifies the Central Server to deploy an analytic Docker image that would activate
    a camera, capture photos and analyze the captured images to see if there is any
    human present in the scene (who may be exposed to the gas and should be warned
    right away). Fig. 14 shows a sample detected person. The person detector adopts
    OpenCV library for processing images, uses TensorFlow framework for detecting
    the person and is packaged into a layered Docker container image. The base-image
    layer includes system software and libraries; and the analytic layer includes
    the analytic application. Through this case study, we demonstrate the practicality
    of our multi-sensor IoT platform: instead of sending an H.264 video sequence to
    the cloud for analysis, our platform only sends the image with the detected person.
    Throughout our experiments, an average of  ∼ 150 times of data amount reduction
    is observed. Download : Download high-res image (311KB) Download : Download full-size

    We study the problem of adaptive sensemaking with IoT devices over constrained
    data connections, especially under limited 3G data plans. We start with an adaptation
    approach where sensor readings are down-sampled based on the data budget. We further
    consider a more general container based rich sensing analytic platform, in which
    containers with specific sensing analytics are automatically activated once being
    triggered by some sensor readings. We demonstrate the feasibility of the usage
    scenarios on a platform built upon Docker and Kubernetes. We show that our approaches
    reduce data volumes befitting to limited data plans over 3G and are applicable,
    in general, to IoT platforms with constrained data connections. Acknowledgment

    \ to the ongoing domestic and international\nlockdown for COVID-19. Many have\
    \ already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the\nCorona era.\
    \ Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and\
    \ agriculture,\nthere are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The\
    \ roles of modern technology, the\nInternet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic\nprosperity in the post-COVID-19\
    \ economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by\n2050 to meet global\
    \ food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic\n\
    and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving\
    \ food production\nand distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and\
    \ addressing the double burden of\nmalnutrition. As the world’s population is\
    \ growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s\npopulation reaches 9.6\
    \ billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,\n\
    technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced.\
    \ The urban\nsmart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production,\
    \ which can be introduced at\nany adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in\
    \ vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the\
    \ concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity\nas well as\
    \ its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and\
    \ beneﬁts. This\nreview has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations\
    \ in the development of the\nsystem, vertical farming management, and modern technologies\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: automation; smart vertical farming; sensors; Internet of\
    \ Things; urban farming\n1. Introduction\nIn the 21st century, urbanization will\
    \ be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion\nby 2050. 67.2% or 6.5\
    \ billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this\ngrowing,\
    \ increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand\n\
    needs to rise by 70% [2,3]. Rapid changes in urban built-up areas and skylines\
    \ in providing\nbuildings and infrastructures to cater to the city center’s larger\
    \ population have altered the\nurban climate into unhealthy living conditions.\
    \ This situation threatens the demand for\nthe basic needs of urban dwellers for\
    \ a livable urban living environment. Furthermore, a\nlarger urban population\
    \ also demands a fresh and good quality food supply [4]. Urban\nsmart vertical\
    \ farming (USVF) is one of the potential solutions to help societies meet this\n\
    elevated demand without additional farmland [5–7]. Figure 1 shows the statistical\
    \ data\nabout the use of vertical farming (VF) market in the world 2019 and 2025\
    \ respectively. In\nrecent years, the global VF market has been increasing steadily\
    \ as population sizes grow\nand urban living becomes more common in urban cities.\
    \ The VF industry reached some\n$4.4 billion in 2019, but the market size is estimated\
    \ to rise to $15.7 billion by 2025. The\nopportunity to utilize vertical space\

    \ plays a vital role in every ﬁeld of life. Some examples are\nmanufacturing,\
    \ transportation, agriculture, utilities, defense, facility operation [16,17].\
    \ The\nbeneﬁts of automation can be applied in water and wastewater, oil and gas,\
    \ electric power\nand telecommunication systems. Automation is generally used\
    \ in many ﬁelds because it\nreduces human effort, is easy to handle, and is more\
    \ effective and efﬁcient. By the name of\nagriculture, farm automation can automate\
    \ most of the agriculture ﬁelds’ processes, such\nas controlling watering systems\
    \ or ﬂow control and moisture control [18,19]. Similarly, it\ncan build a robot/drone\
    \ for spraying pesticides and plowing [20]. Harvesting machinery\nis also used\
    \ for such purposes: a user-friendly farm automation system, easy user control\n\
    for a layman, control water, plant health condition, and crop production [21].\n\
    In terms of human health, the World Health Organization estimates that more than\n\
    half of the world’s farms still use untreated animal waste as fertilizer, which\
    \ attracts ﬂies\nand may contain weed seeds or diseases that can be transmitted\
    \ to plants. VF has the ability\nto produce crops throughout the year, with greater\
    \ control over food safety and biosecurity,\nwhile also lowering inputs such as\
    \ water, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers [7]. Food\nprotection is a major\
    \ concern of our day, as there have been several incidents of events\naround the\
    \ world resulting in food recalls due to bacterial infectious diseases, resulting\n\
    in billion-dollar losses. After the crop has been picked, the washing of ﬁeld-grown\
    \ items\nposes a further risk of infection from various bacteria and pathogens.\
    \ This stage, on the\nother hand, has the potential to contaminate the entire\
    \ manufacturing process [22]. While\nthe whole world is badly affected by COVID-19,\
    \ the terrible clutches of natural disasters\nstill plague many people worldwide.\
    \ All scientists’ projections show that the number and\nseverity of climate-related\
    \ disasters are increasing due to climate change, which is cutting\noff the COVID\
    \ virus infection and public health response in the wake of the epidemic. The\n\

    \ the features of the 21st century will be deforestation,\nbiodiversity loss,\
    \ climate chaos, and global epidemics; COVID-19 might be the latest\nmanifestation\
    \ of this, which has pointed to the horrible meaning of ‘global economy crisis\n\
    emergency’. Since COVID-19 will have a long-term impact, now is the time to prepare\
    \ to\nintroduce USVF.\nUSVF should become an opportunity for urban dwellers to\
    \ producing their food,\ndespite the limited agricultural land in the city center.\
    \ Integration of any available potential\nspaces inside and outside the building\
    \ by adaptive reuse and retroﬁt as part of the urban\nfarming (UF) technology\
    \ should be taken seriously and fully utilized. The design should\nconsider less\
    \ human intervention in operation due to the hectic life of urbanites. An appli-\n\
    cation of the Internet of things (IoT) can be incorporated into monitoring and\
    \ controlling in\nthe USVF system [23,24]. Thus, the UF technology can have bigger\
    \ involvement and contri-\nbution of urban dwellers. Besides producing their foods,\
    \ it contributes to the improvement\nin a healthy living environment and on urban\
    \ microclimate. UF offers an once-in-a-lifetime\nchance to grow food on already\
    \ built soil, maximize domestic food production, and reduce\nfood travel distances.\n\
    This study will include an in-depth examination of the philosophy of USVF as a\
    \ means\nof enhancing efﬁciency, including its forms, topologies, technologies,\
    \ control structures,\nsocial acceptance, and beneﬁts. This review concentrated\
    \ on a variety of issues, challenges,\nand recommendations related to the system’s\
    \ growth, vertical farming management, and\nmodern technology approach. The importance\
    \ of USVF how it plays a vital role in the\neconomy serve as the starting point\
    \ for this review. As the world’s population is growing\nday by day, there is\
    \ a need to modify those orthodox agriculture methods to fulﬁll the\nincreasing\
    \ demand for food. This modiﬁcation can be done by automating the agriculture\n\
    farm. This idea of agriculture farm automation wants to control water consumption,\
    \ the\nmoisture level of soil and water ﬂow, topologies, technologies, control\
    \ systems, social\nacceptance and enables an agricultural business to be more\
    \ productive, efﬁcient and\nproﬁtable.\n2. Types, General Structure and Materials\
    \ of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through\
    \ which large quantities of food\ncrops and medicinal plants can be produced in\
    \ a very small space only with the help of\nadvanced technology [25].\n2.1. Types\
    \ of Vertical Farm\nVF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world\
    \ and each way is so\ntechnologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize\
    \ agriculture [26]. The following\nsection represents a few types of VF utilized\
    \ for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,\ndiversifying, and improving in the\
    \ future of agriculture [7].\n2.1.1. Hydroponics\nHydroponics is a system that\
    \ can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,\nthis system has gained\
    \ popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation\nbarring soil.\
    \ Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is\
    \ often\nirrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like\
    \ cocopeat and is\nfed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain\
    \ plant growth. Hydroponic\nstructures use 60–70% much less water than regular\
    \ conventional agriculture [28,29]. In\nthis method, the plant roots are immersed\
    \ in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant\ninstead of the soil, in\
    \ which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.\nFigure\
    \ 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF\n\
    provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive\
    \ use\nof water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried\

    Lighting plays an important role in making food for a crop in VF [53]. In the\
    \ VF\nsystem, since the trees are one on top of the other, sunlight cannot reach\
    \ the trees in the\nmiddle of the day. However, to solve this problem, the trees\
    \ should be kept in a place\nwhere they get enough sunlight at the beginning of\
    \ the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The\nconventional light-emitting diode\
    \ (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,\nmaking an indoor agriculture\
    \ system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least\naround 50–60% [54,55].\
    \ The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure\nsodium, to overcome\
    \ such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors\nindicated\
    \ the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF\
    \ in\nterms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.\nPlants\
    \ require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a\nwavelength\
    \ of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural\n\
    light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would\
    \ assist plants\nin growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light\
    \ to produce a reddish purple\ncolor. The perfect color combination for plants\
    \ and vegetables has been determined to be\nblue and red. This composition is\
    \ ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination\nof 23% blue and 77%\
    \ red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].\n2.3.3. Solar PV\nSolar\
    \ PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such\
    \ as\nrooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar\
    \ which is available\nin the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts\
    \ up in the VF by photosynthetic\nactive radiation, and it is not enough Solar\
    \ power must be collected by a collection of\nmirrors from the city’s structures\
    \ to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].\nAs a result, VF is\
    \ looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.\n2.3.4.\
    \ Water\nIn agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The\
    \ use of agricultural\nwater makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The\
    \ study in [61] addressed a VF\ntechnology that requires 70% less water and the\
    \ amount of water required is also recyclable.\nHistorically, users of traditional\
    \ agricultural systems were expected to manually check the\nwater level in their\
    \ water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of\nwater, which\
    \ ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated\n\
    that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater\
    \ in\nthe smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the\
    \ authors indicated\nthrough the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70%\
    \ in VF, while the hydroponics\ntechnique still using 70% water. Water automation\
    \ systems can be used in VF technologies\nto reduce human effort and error. Additionally,\
    \ users can use an Android program to turn\non and off the water pump. This is\
    \ an effective and cost-effective method of minimizing\nwater waste and human\
    \ labor. Additionally, [62] addressed an integrated device built on\nan Android\
    \ application that controls and tests the water pump and water level in smart\n\

    \ [82]. These methods are less accurate than the \ndirect method but are less\

    \ to measure acidity, power of hydrogen\nvalue, and alkalinity of substances.\
    \ The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the industry,\nagriculture, manufacturing,\
    \ pharmaceutical, etc. [21,84,85]. In [84,86], the authors indicated\nusing a\
    \ pH sensor to ﬁnd the nutrient level of agriculture soil that connects to the\
    \ Arduino\nmicrocontroller, reducing fertilizers used in smart agriculture. The\
    \ authors also addressed\npH sensors to collect and monitor real data from different\
    \ soil of SF, which save to cloud\nserver. However, the unnecessary growth of\
    \ the plant in the agriculture farm does not\ngrow well for crops. Therefore,\
    \ to overcome such a problem, pH sensor plays a vital role\nin SF.\nSensor of\
    \ Electrical Conductivity\nThe electrical conductivity sensor is largely used\
    \ in SF to measure the soil solute\nconcentration [87,88]. However, there are\
    \ still some limitations to use it properly in the SF.\nIn [88], the authors addressed\
    \ the soil contains some water and salt that harmful to grow\nup crops, which\
    \ can measure using an electrical conductivity sensor based on Faraday’s\nlaw.\
    \ The study in [89] showed an electrical conductivity sensor used to overcome\
    \ soil\nlimitations, such as measuring soil pore water, reducing cost and saving\
    \ working time.\nTemperature Sensor\nUsually, temperature sensors are used to\
    \ measure soil temperature in the farm\nplant [90,91]. The work in [90] indicated\
    \ the importance of plant growth based on tem-\nperature control processes such\
    \ as photosynthesis, transpiration, absorption. In [92], the\nauthors proposed\
    \ an aeroponic system in agriculture, which indicated plant growth and\ndevelopment\
    \ through temperature. Therefore, the temperature sensor plays an important\n\
    role to measure soil temperature, which increases the efﬁciency of plant growth\
    \ and more\ncrops.\nElectromagnetic Sensor\nElectromagnetic sensors calculate\
    \ the potential of soil particles to conduct or produce\nelectrical charge using\
    \ electric circuits [73,93]. As these sensors are used, the soil is now an\nelectromagnetic\
    \ loop, and any changes in local conditions have an instant impact on the\noutput\
    \ captured by a data acquisition system. In [93], the authors indicated electromagnetic\n\
    sensors for soil measure have become smaller, more rugged, faster, more accurate,\
    \ more\nenergy-efﬁcient, wireless, and smarter.\n3.3. Smartphone Sensor Technologies\
    \ in Smart Farming\nTelecommunications advances are allowing the rapid and more\
    \ reliable delivery of\nsensed data on a global scale. A sensor is a device that\
    \ detects and reacts to an electri-\ncal signal. Traditional phone sensing systems\
    \ need additional infrastructure, which is\nunaffordable to the majority of consumers.\
    \ Smartphones have advanced at a breakneck\npace in recent years, and they have\
    \ evolved into an integral part of everyday life. The\nsensors embedded in them\
    \ allow a variety of mobile application, which are assisting and\ntransforming\
    \ our way of life. Mobile sensors technology can enhance UF by improving\nconnectivity,\
    \ increasing the ﬂow of information, ensuring traceability for large buyers, and\n\
    creating economic opportunities [94,95]. This section illustrates concepts of\
    \ mobile sensors\ntechnology in SF that are currently using in the smartphone\
    \ and comparison among several\nresearch outcomes.\nSensors are a tool that measures\
    \ a physical amount and converts to a signal which\ncan be read and utilized by\
    \ other devices. Most of the mobile sensors are equipped on\nsmartphones. Numerous\
    \ forms of sensors are available nowadays, and several common\nsmartphones include\
    \ accelerometers, GPS, illumination sensors, temperature sensors, gy-\nroscope,\
    \ and barometer. These sensors evolved into a high-quality database for tracking\n\
    many facets of a user’s everyday activities. Three types of sensors are installed\
    \ in smart-\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n13 of 40\nphones: motion sensors, ambient\
    \ sensors, and location sensors [94]. The following Table 1\nsummarizes and illustrates\
    \ a set of popular sensors found in today’s mainstream smart-\nphones. The ﬁrst\
    \ category, motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity\nsensors,\
    \ and rotational vector sensors, provides acceleration force and rotational force\
    \ mea-\nsurements. Environmental sensors, on the other hand, provide observations\
    \ of the ambient\nenvironment. This includes measuring the ambient air temperature\
    \ with a thermometer\nand the atmospheric pressure with a barometer, as well as\
    \ lighting with a photometer. Place\nsensors, on the other hand, provide information\
    \ about the physical location of the system.\nMagnetometers, GPS, and orientation\
    \ sensors are examples of location sensors [94].\nTable 1. Familiar smartphone\

    \ are largely used in the SF to predict and assist with necessary\nmaintenance\
    \ [96,97]. The study reported in [96] presented accelerometer sensor plays an\n\
    important role in monitoring the conventional use of equipment in the SF. In [98],\
    \ the\nauthors indicated accelerometer sensors detect running components or motor’s\
    \ health\nconditions through motion, speed, vibration inconsistencies. Therefore,\
    \ users can easily\ntrack the component health condition using an android application\

    \ of conservation of angular momentum\nto determine or retain orientation. Nowadays,\
    \ gyroscope sensors are used in a variety of\nareas, including science ﬁction\
    \ and mobile devices [94,99]. In [94], the authors indicated a\ngyroscope sensors\
    \ application to detect conventional equipment rotation in SF using an\nandroid\
    \ phone. However, the drawback of this gyroscope sensors application in smart\
    \ VF\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n14 of 40\ndifﬁcult to implement in terms of\
    \ requiring a complex mathematical model to conducts a\nsignal.\n3.3.3. Light\
    \ Sensor\nThe term “smart agriculture techniques” refers to the practice of using\
    \ a sensor system\nto regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light\
    \ sensor is a semiconductor chip\nthat detects the presence or absence of light\
    \ and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,\nand phototransistors are all examples\
    \ of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial\nlighting as a suitable\
    \ option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy\nplant\
    \ in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF\
    \ fault\nﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the\
    \ fault and On/OFF\nartiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android\
    \ phone application which reduces\nthe human effort and optimize cost [102].\n\
    3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor\nBasically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to\
    \ measure the direction of the workers,\nsuch as walk forwards, walk backward,\
    \ run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the\nsensors by mobile phone which\
    \ help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have\na deeper, richer knowledge\
    \ about their farms [94].\n3.3.5. Proximity Sensor\nThe proximity sensors utilize\
    \ to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].\nIn [71], the authors\
    \ usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source\nmeasured\
    \ by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors\
    \ are\nutilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to\
    \ reduce human effort,\nmeasure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh\
    \ environmental conditions. How-\never, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect\
    \ only the metallic target, and the operation\nrange also limited.\n3.3.6. Humidity\
    \ Sensor\nNowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF\
    \ [104,105].\nThe work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role\
    \ in SF, such as tracking\nthe water level of plants, environmental monitoring,\
    \ which suitable time for proper crop\nselection. The authors also indicated the\
    \ humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at\nmeasure bio-interface. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges still occur for the awareness of capable\nand wide-scale manufacture\
    \ of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.\nIn [106], the\
    \ authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture\nfarming\
    \ by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic\n\
    structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback\
    \ of this\nmetal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a\
    \ narrow sensing range.\n3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor\nThe carbon-based sensor has\
    \ many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The\ncarbon-based structures\
    \ used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-\nmond (ND),\
    \ fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,\n\
    mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,\n\
    and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described\
    \ in [107],\nexhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized.\
    \ Carbon nanostructures\nhave grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due\
    \ to their promising structure,\nwhich enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation.\
    \ The high surface-to-volume ratio and\nhollow composition make this material\
    \ suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The\nidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),\ncarbon monoxide (CO),\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and\nmethane, is\
    \ one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n15 of 40\nThe special properties of nanomaterials,\
    \ such as their compact scale, large surface area, and\nreactivity, make them\
    \ ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily\nused in\
    \ agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor\n\
    diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation\n\
    of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption\
    \ and\ndegradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants\
    \ from\nsamples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary\
    \ to remove toxins\nfrom various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary\
    \ to control pollution\nlevels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create\
    \ novel, highly effective biochemi-\ncal sensors for the detection of chemical\
    \ compounds at extremely low concentrations in\na variety of environments. In\
    \ [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials\nwill account for\
    \ 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives\n\
    and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy,\
    \ and this\nsection will highlight some interesting methods.\n3.4. Sensors Technology\
    \ in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops\nThe proper growth of\
    \ plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart\nVF. The\
    \ economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,\n\
    there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants,\
    \ such as crop life,\nnutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113].\
    \ Therefore, monitoring the\nhealth condition of each plant of agriculture farming\
    \ is essential [114]. Therefore, different\ntypes of sensors utilize to overcome\
    \ such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of\nthe method used for crop\
    \ health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model\nsensors in\
    \ SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application\
    \ in\nSF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy,\
    \ monitoring\nand detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of\
    \ crop and tracking leaf\ndamage from the insect.\nTable 2. Review of methods\

    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n17 of 40\nIn [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot\
    \ SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30\nsensors in farming applications because of cheap,\
    \ easy to manage, and potential versatility\nto count faster crop damage accuracy.\
    \ The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL\nT2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors\
    \ in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop\ngrowth. However,\
    \ these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not\nperforming\
    \ well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable\n\
    lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum\n\
    cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in\
    \ SF\napplications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments\
    \ with\nstrong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable\
    \ for VF applications.\nThe study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution\
    \ and Raspberry Pi camera sensors\nin agriculture applications to diagnose the\
    \ nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from\ninsects. It is suitable in VF\
    \ terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous\nact without\
    \ damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance\n\
    sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant\
    \ growth. The\nsensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust\
    \ real data in a short time,\nand strong controlling capability. In [125,137],\
    \ the authors reported an inverted microscope\nand plant village sensors in SF\
    \ application to automatically monitor health conditions in\nplants, which is\
    \ easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors\nin [138–140]\
    \ reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam\nsensors in\
    \ agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment\n\
    and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy\n\
    required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore,\
    \ to\novercome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.\nThe study\
    \ in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture\napplication\
    \ for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically\n\
    in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency\
    \ still\nvery poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216,\
    \ and MV-\nVDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops\
    \ such as apple,\ncarrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high\
    \ efﬁciency, low cost, and high\nprecision for the overall system compared to\
    \ conventional methods. However, the main\nlimitations are its monitoring accuracy,\
    \ such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of\ncrops. In [129,131,132],\
    \ the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and\nSONY DSC-W530 sensors\
    \ in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,\npotatoes.\
    \ Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large\n\
    accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed\
    \ an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with geolocation, a UAV platform equipped,\
    \ quadrotor\nUAV-RGB, senseFly eBee with RGB and CIR sensors in agriculture application\
    \ to detect\nheight, biomass automatically of crop plants. Therefore, the main\
    \ advantage of such sensors\nin SF is that they are stable, perform well, have\
    \ small defects, are easy to adapt to new\ntechnology, and they have a simple\
    \ operation.\nFigure 11 shows the smartphone applications in agriculture and the\

    4. IoT Framework on Smart Farming\nWith the development of technology and knowledge-science,\
    \ human thought-\nconsciousness is developing. As a result, everything is changing.\
    \ The revolutionary\ndevelopment of life and human thought in the world over the\
    \ last few decades is far more\nexemplary than the changes in the previous few\
    \ centuries. The transformation of the\nagricultural sector, like all other sectors,\
    \ is much more pronounced. Information-driven\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n19\
    \ of 40\nadvances, when all is said in done, are rapidly progressing with the\
    \ improvement of the IoT\nand may turn into a signiﬁcant piece of things to come\
    \ of farming [146–148]. All modern\nmethods are now being followed to ensure more\
    \ production on less land to meet the needs\nof the age, for example, IoT technology\
    \ in USVF. In [149–151], the authors proposed an IoT\na very modern technology\
    \ in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as\nlacking water,\
    \ crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such\n\
    issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling\
    \ the\natmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study\
    \ also indicated\nIoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop\
    \ production.\nFigure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF\
    \ framework consists\nof six interconnected sub-systems: a physical layer, network\
    \ layer, middleware layer,\nservice layer, analytics layer, and user experience\
    \ layer [154–156]. The physical layer\nof SF is consists of various types of components\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, controllers,\nswitches, network gateways, routers,\
    \ etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer\nwhich plays an important\
    \ role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well\nas other operations\
    \ of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is\ncapable\
    \ of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in\
    \ VF.\nThe network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which\
    \ is important for\nsending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application\
    \ layer. The network\nlayer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces\
    \ for associating the weeding\nmachine, food harvester, and for correspondence\
    \ of machines and sensors with cloud\nframeworks. However, the challenge of the\
    \ network layer in SF where IoT generated a\nhuge amount of data is not only the\
    \ reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction\nof network efﬁciency\
    \ [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to\nboost IoT\
    \ security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware\
    \ acts\nas device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability,\
    \ and surveillance\nrelevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization\
    \ layer and network\nlayer which are capable of handling information and gives\
    \ a combination for connection\nbetween these layers. However, the middleware\
    \ layer includes safe and sensitive data\nstorage, and data transfer over wireless\
    \ is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT\ncloud support service layer assumes\
    \ a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) to\
    \ farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,\ncrop\
    \ health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are\
    \ cleared to\nencourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation\
    \ [21,68,161]. The\nanalytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for\
    \ crop production investigation\nyield efﬁciency based on environment condition.\
    \ Another sensor-based IoT system for\nthe analytics layer was presented in [162],\
    \ which ensures crop implement fragmentation,\ncompression, and a reassembly mechanism.\
    \ However, the main drawback of the analytics\nlayer in SF since its direct use\
    \ on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The\nuser experience\
    \ layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such\nas\
    \ crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation.\
    \ IoT plays\na vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall\
    \ situation of VF yield\ncondition by different sensors. However, the main challenges\
    \ still most of the IoT sensors\npower by the battery. Therefore, to overcome\
    \ these issues, energy harvesting technology\ncan be utilized to replace batteries.\n\

    \ which is very helpful in remote areas.\nPiezoelectric buzzer\n[193]\nA piezoelectric\
    \ buzzer is one kind of sensor when sound is appalled, and it produces voltage.\
    \ They are utilized in many ﬁelds such as\nenergy harvesting, low power sensors,\
    \ and also SF. Its application in SF to run low-power sensors reduces the dependency\
    \ on the battery.\nElectronic speed control\n[21,194]\nConventional electronic\
    \ speed controllers in farming control room temperature, motor speed and regulate\
    \ the motor voltage. Using this\ndevice in modern farming plays an important role\
    \ in terms of its large energy efﬁciency, less pollution, stability.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n27 of 40\nAgriculture operates somewhat differently today than\
    \ it did a few decades before,\nprimarily due to technical advancements such as\
    \ sensors, processors, robots, and informa-\ntion technology. Agriculture now\
    \ routinely makes use of emerging technology, including\nrobotics, temperature\
    \ and moisture sensors, aerial photography, and GPS. These advanced\ntechnologies,\
    \ precision agriculture, and robotic systems allow businesses to operate more\n\
    proﬁtably, efﬁciently, safely, and sustainably. The primary objective of the Internet\
    \ of things\nis to create a vast network by integrating various sensor devices\
    \ such as GPS, remote\nsensing (RS), radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), laser\
    \ scanners, and networks in or-\nder to comprehend the knowledge exchange of global\
    \ things. IoT can refer to millions\nof networked embedded smart devices capable\
    \ of accumulating data about themselves,\ntheir world, and other connected smart\
    \ devices and linking this data to other devices and\nsystems through the ubiquitous\
    \ Internet [195].\nAmbient daylight, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and humidity\
    \ are all control-\nlable parameters of vertical farming. In addition to the vertical\
    \ columns, the ambient\nparameters must be controlled for each stack, necessitating\
    \ the use of a separate collection\nof sensors for each vertical stack. These\
    \ sensors produce a large amount of data, necessitat-\ning the use of an effective\
    \ data management system. Numerous automation techniques\nare used to maximize\
    \ resource use, including the integration of actuation by automated\nirrigation\
    \ systems, as well as wireless monitoring via IoT in the VF, which is capable\
    \ of\nmanaging sensor data effectively, identifying duplicate sensor readings,\
    \ and visualizing it\nthrough web-based applications.\n4.5. Secure Cloud on Smart\
    \ Vertical Farming System\nThe growth of a country’s population and massive industrial\
    \ development, mainly in\nurban areas, lead to a variety of urbanization problems,\
    \ including housing, food demands,\nschooling, health, and poverty. A new farming\
    \ technique that utilizes minimal land\narea while producing a large crop with\
    \ a secure aspect is highly desired. In [196], the\nauthors addressed a two-factor\
    \ authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security\nmeasures. Since\
    \ the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system\ncommunicates\
    \ over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this\nhydroponic\
    \ system would be installed inside the user’s house, this electronic gadget\n\
    will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer\
    \ to the\nInternet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility\
    \ of data leakage\nand sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system\
    \ through access codes\ngenerated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application\
    \ for access veriﬁcation.\nFigure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart\
    \ using a 2FA mechanism. It starts\nwith the device module’s controller demanding\
    \ permission to send and receive data over\nthe network via the ThingsSentral-based\
    \ web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based\nIoT device network founded\
    \ by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,\nprogram, and portal\
    \ access code to the TS web service, the controller initiates the ﬁrst\nauthentication\
    \ order. If the codes are valid, TS will send another authentication order.\n\
    The second authentication process generates a request for veriﬁcation and notiﬁcation\
    \ to\nthe customer with a phone app that they must authenticate a request before\
    \ the farming\nmodule can continue operating. The user will authenticate the order\
    \ if approved, at which\npoint TS will allow the remainder of the procedure before\
    \ the controller explicitly stops\nit. If the customer fails to authenticate,\
    \ the whole system is aborted, and the hydroponics\nmodule controller is informed\
    \ of the request’s denial.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n28 of 40\nElectronics\

    \ of Urban Farming\nThe study in [197] addressed as far as a social responsibility\
    \ of USVF contributes more\nin terms of reducing pollution, produce clean air\
    \ and fresh food without using artiﬁcial\nfertilizer. The authors in [198] indicated\
    \ USVF totally brings new technology to produce\nmore food using less water, without\
    \ soil which falls a very good impact on society. In [199],\nthe authors reviewed\
    \ 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity\nin an urban\
    \ area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over\n\
    80% of the occupants favored VF on the rooftop of the building in terms of sufﬁcient\
    \ light\nfacility, clean air, low pollution, environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts,\
    \ fresh food, easy to\nmonitor, simple maintenance, etc. Moreover, the greater\
    \ part of the respondents was eager\nto purchase agricultural items. The study\
    \ also reported in [199] presented a lack of food\ninsecurity produced from VF\
    \ of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban\nareas. The work\
    \ in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared\nwith\
    \ the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the\
    \ effect of\nrising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop\
    \ a seven-story building\nin Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt.\
    \ In [202], the authors measured the\npollution level, crop production costs,\
    \ and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.\nTherefore, a USVF is\
    \ required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,\nsufﬁcient\
    \ food production, various type of crop production all season.\nAdvantages of\
    \ Urban Smart Vertical Farming\nDue to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced\
    \ to achieve food security in\nan urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in\
    \ expanding crop production and adding\nto maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of\
    \ rising food inside the urban area can be helpful\necologically, socially, and\
    \ monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety\nworldwide\
    \ [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise\n\
    aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for\
    \ the future,\nconservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality\
    \ produce, and halting mass\nextinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed\
    \ that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing\npolluted carbon-di-oxide from the air\
    \ and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,\nenvironmentally friendly,\
    \ helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it\nhas a fair\
    \ weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses\
    \ in\nthe city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air\
    \ ﬁltration by absorbing\ndust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed\
    \ beneﬁts of these USVF include\nprotection from weather-related problems, utilize\
    \ technologies and devices, helps in air\nﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round\
    \ production, huge food production within a small\narea of land.\nIn [206], the\
    \ authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-\n\
    ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure\
    \ from\na weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods\
    \ year-round.\nThe study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables,\
    \ strawberries can\nproduce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms\
    \ of crops could be sold in\nthe same infrastructures, they will not need to be\
    \ transported between production and sale.\nTherefore, USVF provides less spoilage,\
    \ reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than\nconventional farming encounters.\
    \ The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate\nand make a new job opportunity\
    \ for urban people who have less education and low expe-\nrience. The study reported\
    \ in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop\nproduction, such\
    \ as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,\n\
    manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth.\
    \ The authors\nalso indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production,\
    \ which can save 50%\nlesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The\
    \ study in [44] also reported\ndelivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable\
    \ and farmers do not need much focus\non soil and plant during growing.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n30 of 40\nBringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely\
    \ improves the quality of the\nurban environment, which is the main goal of urban\
    \ VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also\nexpected to provide environmental beneﬁts\
    \ to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban\nthermal performance and air quality\
    \ reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling\nloads. Despite providing\
    \ food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a\nconducive\
    \ and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such\n\
    as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to\
    \ marketability\nwith high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact\
    \ on the application of UF\nin the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and\
    \ effective extension services based on\nthe needs of all classes of growers so\
    \ that they can make the best use of their resources and\ncontribute to sustainable\
    \ agricultural and socio-economic development.\n6. Issues and Challenges\nVF technology\
    \ plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of\nthe\
    \ world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges\n\
    due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy\
    \ reliance and\nutilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented\
    \ in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],\nthe authors reported VF technology would be gradually\
    \ becoming a non-proﬁt industry if\nnot focus on addressing the current issues\
    \ such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a\nresult, current farming is heading\
    \ for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack\nof signiﬁcant\
    \ response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs\n\
    and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment,\
    \ smart\ntechnology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem\
    \ to be viable enough\nto meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop\
    \ production is considered to be\nvery risky due to the prevalence of diseases\
    \ and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.\nOther than that, equipment location,\
    \ space, and environmental issues have to be taken\nseriously depending on VF’s\
    \ design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape\nconsiderations such\
    \ as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as\nthe spacing\
    \ between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for\n\
    example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers\
    \ or fruit\nplants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their\
    \ heat management\ncharacteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated\
    \ by VF in order to minimize\nany possible adverse effect on development, while\
    \ allowing for adequate air circulation and\nventilation. It is crucial to keep\
    \ in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques\nmay be safer to eat\
    \ than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the\ngrowing\
    \ phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the\n\
    nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities\
    \ such\nas sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks.\
    \ Thus, food safety\nmanagement methods such as hazard analysis critical control\
    \ point analysis, as well as food\nsafety assessment and testing, are critical\
    \ in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.\n7. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\
    USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be\
    \ open\nto the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and\
    \ in turn use growing\nconvenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review\
    \ considers the diverse ways of\nhow a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and\
    \ built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The\ncontinuous ﬂow of real data accrued\
    \ from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF\nis analyzed, and suitable\
    \ actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only\na few are being\
    \ utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of\n\
    smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.\n\
    The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of the\nstate-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used\
    \ hardware, plat-\nforms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their\
    \ applicability to the proposed\nsolution. AI and image processing techniques\
    \ have become more prevalent in recent work\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n31 of\
    \ 40\nto develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications\
    \ for SF,\nthe most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements\
    \ in technical\napplications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple\
    \ sensors in networks\nquickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the\
    \ rapid growth of IoT projects,\nespecially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n\
    Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along\
    \ with\nthe various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable\
    \ for the research. This\npaper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology,\
    \ and hardware components\nsuitable for monitoring and controlling water level,\
    \ crop health condition, moisture of soil,\nproduction of yield and environment.\
    \ The paper has also focused on a comprehensive\nexplanation of USVF technologies,\
    \ monitor and control operation, smart automation,\nstructure, materials, social\
    \ acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.\nFinally, the\
    \ study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that\nreduces\
    \ human intervention to a minimum.\nThe review has proposed some signiﬁcant and\
    \ selective suggestions for the further\ntechnological developments of USVF based\
    \ on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint\nfrom the reviewed literature. Some\
    \ possible improvements have been addressed in this\nreview below:\n•\nFocusing\
    \ on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-\n\
    ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the\
    \ year,\nwith greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on\
    \ imported\nvegetables.\n•\nEnhance the user control panel for non-technical users\
    \ who use SF. As a result, it is\npreferable to develop a user-friendly interface\
    \ for powerful applications in a control\npanel and based on user experience.\n\
    •\nAppropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned\
    \ land\ncultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world.\
    \ Adequate\nstrategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address\
    \ this problem.\n•\nBy combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing,\
    \ a decision support\nframework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic\
    \ yield estimation in\ncrop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention,\
    \ and irregular growth.\n•\nRemote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must\
    \ be built in such a way that au-\ntomated planting machines can plate farmers\
    \ more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud\nmonitoring and remote multi-device visualization\
    \ have advanced to the point where\noperators/owners can track real-time manipulation.\n\
    •\nHaving a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to\
    \ improve\nthe farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of\
    \ the majority of IoT\nsystems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing\
    \ over a wide range of\nsensor data sources.\n•\nUse big data analytics to address\
    \ disease management problems across many crops\nand to create a consolidated\
    \ farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale\nagriculture.\n•\n\
    Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent\n\
    on big data analytics.\n•\nProvide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic\
    \ service for farmers.\n•\nAnalyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big\
    \ data modeling and a supply\nchain management framework.\n•\nAnalytics can provide\
    \ farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of\nagricultural products,\
    \ thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.\n•\nDevelop a\
    \ smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,\n\
    and time.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n32 of 40\n•\nCreate a warning system, as\
    \ most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer\nof critical events.\n\
    •\nEstablish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.\n\
    Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of\
    \ water\nand electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make\
    \ use of real-time\nweather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption\
    \ and prevent excessive\nirrigation.\n•\nDevice security is a critical issue.\
    \ Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to\nbolster the protection of the\
    \ affordable indoor hydroponic system.\n•\nAdditional research should be conducted\
    \ on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or\npH. Knowing how resistant plants\
    \ are too extreme pH levels enables device designers\nto create solutions that\
    \ handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.\n•\nDrone based pesticide sprayer can\
    \ be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and\nfertilizers to get better\
    \ quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the\nfarmers to spray\
    \ pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.\n•\nFor a smart storage\
    \ house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can\nautomatically\
    \ turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches\nthe temperature\
    \ danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is\nbetween 41\
    \ and 135 degrees for height.\n•\nFor water and food control for cattle, we can\
    \ use conveyor belts to automatically\nsupply food to cattle.\n•\nIncrease in\
    \ monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming\nsystem\
    \ to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.\n•\nWe can install a biogas\
    \ plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements\nand to fully use\
    \ the waste materials of cattle.\n•\nWe can also install a circuit to automatically\
    \ get the power meter reading and electricity\nbills on our cell phone and hence\
    \ get up to date about the power consumption of\nUSVF.\n•\nAtmospheric pollutants\
    \ due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect\non the plants,\
    \ therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution\nremoval\
    \ and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.\n\
    •\nfsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air\
    \ pol-\nlution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and\
    \ quantifying\npolluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide\

    Metrics and citations Figures and tables Abstract The Internet of things (IoT)
    is the next technological revolution that includes many industries and applications.
    IoT can offer solutions for many problems. However, it requires many skills from
    different disciplines that current electrical and computer engineers lack. In
    order to encourage the seamless internalization of the IoT and the technologies
    it supports, a new method should be considered in training electrical and computer
    engineers. The new methods should focus on applications and projects that involve
    the use of components such as hardware, software, and cloud platforms that are
    available in the market rather than class oriented theories. In this study, we
    introduce a methodology for teaching an IoT systems course that will encourage
    students to study how to develop and accomplish IoT applications in real time,
    at a reasonable cost, and for general use rather than meeting the detailed needs
    of one merchant. We exploit universally available open source software and cloud
    platforms to enhance teaching IoT course. The proposed course is taught at the
    undergraduate level in the computer engineering departments of Kocaeli and Sakarya
    Universities in Turkey. The results show that the designed method can have a constructive
    influence on the progress of computer engineering education by timely and positive
    assistance in educating the new IoT engineers. Introduction In today’s highly
    technological world, the Internet of things (IoT) is one of the most popular topics
    associated with life in smart cities.1 Exploiting intelligent objects for smart
    city facilities can enhance the growth of smart cities, smart connectivity, smart
    monitoring, smart agriculture, etc. IoT is an interdisciplinary engineering area
    that incorporates sensing, networking, computing, and controlling the abilities
    related to smart objects to initiate progress and meet significant challenges.2
    Typically, IoT technology has four fundamental requirements. It needs (i) a common
    interpretation of the status of users and devices, (ii) software architectures
    and communication networks to route and transmit connected knowledge to places
    where it can be best utilized, (iii) analytical tools to extract autonomous and
    smart behavior, and (iv) hardware devices that can carry out all these operations
    in real time.3 When these four, major demands are in place, smart connectivity
    and background-aware computation can be achieved. Due to the growth of wireless
    connectivity, IoT, wearable computing, and embedded sensor technologies, producing
    massive amounts of data, big data, and cloud computing concepts focus on the IoT.4,5
    Accordingly, IoT systems can be regarded as an engineering discipline that integrates
    traditional computer engineering and modern information technology engineering.
    Thus, computer engineering solutions have a primary function in the improvement
    of IoT solutions, and computer engineers suggest new ideas for increasing the
    value of IoT technology.6,7 The ubiquitous use of IoT technology and the growing
    market demand for it have inspired new IoT experts to explore ways to maximize
    it. However, in the education sector, little attention has been paid to educating
    the next generation of IoT experts. Some of the fundamental barriers to educating
    IoT experts include designing an IoT education curriculum and choosing a practical
    way to teach IoT courses.8–10 This study proposes a method for designing a real-time
    IoT systems course in computer engineering education at the undergraduate level.
    The proposed course consists of real-time experiments and term projects. It was
    offered by the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Computer and Information
    Sciences, of Kocaeli University and Sakarya University, respectively. This course
    covered the following topics; a theoretical background of IoT such as the general
    view of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) versus IoT, IoT business models and application
    fields, IoT cloud platforms, IoT communication and enabling technologies such
    as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Z-Wave, ANT/ANT+, Wi-Fi and
    ESP8266, and cellular networks, IoT communication protocols such as REpresentational
    State Transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP),
    and Data Distribution Service (DDS), and big data in IoT and cloud computing.
    The undergraduate students then applied this academic background to develop and
    conduct real-time IoT experiments. The 10 required laboratory experiments were
    designed to provide the students with real-time system practice related to IoT
    devices and cloud platforms. The laboratory experiments utilized appropriate real-time
    system explanations to guide students between IoT technology and real-time applications.
    The contributions of the proposed course are that it provides students with an
    opportunity to gain high-level skills, enhance their knowledge about a wide range
    of advances in IoT technology, and implement strategies to develop their own IoT
    system solutions in real time. The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
    the upcoming section introduces an overview of current research publications regarding
    education on IoT technologies. Next section describes the IoT systems course strategy,
    adopted by the learning results of the course and laboratory experiments. Further,
    we define the implementation of the term project activities in IoT system course.
    Subsequently, an evaluation and assessment of the designed IoT system course are
    presented. The implications and conclusions of the study are discussed in the
    last section. Related work IoT refers to the network of electronic devices of
    variable sizes that exploit the Internet for communication by using different
    protocols, domains, medium, and applications.11 The IoT is a new paradigm of communication
    that requires objects to be enabled with microcontrollers, transceivers, and protocol
    stacks for communication2,12,22,28 Statistics show that the number of IoT devices
    increases annually; i.e. it is anticipated that in 2020, the number of IoT devices
    will range between 50 and 100 billion.13 Moreover, it is anticipated that more
    than $300 billion will be generated by IoT products and services in 2020.9 IoT
    devices will be integral to the Internet and will change our way of living significantly.
    Accordingly, the global demand for IoT experts rises annually, and it is anticipated
    to reach 4.5 million by 2020.14 IoT systems require a combination of different
    programming languages and protocols.15 Generally, there are three IoT components,
    which enable the implementation IoT systems such as (i) hardware like sensors,
    (ii) middleware for storage, computing, and data analytics, (iii) presentation
    components for visualization and interpretation.16 Although the IoT industry is
    growing fast, the remarkable effort is prompted by the market needs. Efficient
    utilization of IoT technology can mitigate problems such as home automation and
    smart farming, thereby minimizing energy consumption.17 Moreover, IoT has great
    potential to unlock new applications for smart cities considering the current
    ubiquitous Internet access.1 Therefore, educating young engineers about designing
    and implementing IoT systems is very important. Furthermore, IoT engineers require
    broad knowledge and educational skills than current engineers because of IoT systems
    complexity.15 Educational challenges prompted by IoT technology include curricula
    redefinition, means of transferring knowledge, etc. Several research publications
    address the problem of designing an IoT system course considering different approaches
    as follows. Corno et al.15 presented a novel course on educating IoT professionals
    named the Ambient Intelligence course. The course equips students with the necessary
    skills required to address IoT challenges by teaching them multidisciplinary concepts
    available in IoT technology. The quest for course design for IoT technology is
    presented in Jeong et al.9 wherein the authors use the laboratory of things (LoT)
    platform. This course enables students to develop applications for real life efficiently
    using LoT. Voas et al.18 outlined the relationship between different concepts
    such as security, network, database systems, hardware, and software in IoT technology.
    An active learning course for IoT has been suggested in Raikar et al.8 wherein
    the focus is on the identification and addressing the fundamental challenges of
    teaching IoT course. These are (i) identification of course content and selection
    of the level at which IoT course should be taught, and (ii) how to involve students
    in the learning process considering the fact that IoT course requires theoretical
    and practical aspects. A practice-oriented approach is adopted by Raikar et al.8
    to teach students the designing of IoT applications and services. This is achieved
    by identifying and solving real-world problems. The importance and effectiveness
    of learning through practical in IoT are observed in Sim and Choi10 and Corno
    and de Russis.19 The design of a new curriculum for Industrial Internet of Things
    (IIoT) is investigated in Watteyne et al.20 The focus of this study is to exploit
    IPv6 over the time slotted channel hopping (6TiSCH) stack in teaching students
    IIoT requirements. A film scene interdisciplinary course is introduced in Hwang
    et al.,21 focusing on training students to understand the critical functions of
    IoT and develop IoT applications. The effectiveness of the course suggested in
    Hwang et al.21 is measured through qualitative and quantitative analysis. Unlike
    existing research publications, this study presents an IoT course design with
    real-time laboratory experiments and terms projects. To the authors’ knowledge,
    this is the first research publication that addresses this problem considering
    this approach. With this study, students can use multiple technologies (at least
    three different IoT cloud platforms, different object “phones, Arduino, embedded
    system, etc.”) to develop the IoT application. The IoT systems course and laboratory
    experiments The IoT systems course is a three-credit course planned for senior-level
    undergraduate students. It includes two hours class session every week. The course
    is designed to offer an introduction to the IoT technology, increase the students’
    understanding of basic networking concepts, and software development techniques.
    Moreover, the course enables students to understand how different technologies
    are combined to produce complete IoT systems. The goal of the laboratory experiments
    and term projects is to reinforce the students’ comprehension of academic materials.
    The proposed IoT system course consists of 12 topics. The IoT systems course assembly,
    content, estimated result, and time provided for each topic are presented in Table
    1. In addition, the course is intended for IT engineers, and students must meet
    specific prerequisites to enroll such as basic knowledge of software programming,
    network management, embedded systems, and the IoT. A theoretical understanding
    of big data and cloud platforms is also mandatory. Table 1. IoT course assembly,

    communication Introduction to Firebase cloud platform with MIT App Inventor 2
    In this experiment, basic concepts in cloud platform are presented to students
    in a mobile application environment through the observation of data sent, data
    receive, and notification. A mobile application with Firebase database cloud platform
    is designed using MIT App Inventor26 as shown in Figure 1. This mobile application
    stores and retrieves a text value to and from the Firebase database when the read
    or write button is pressed. Students create projects in Firebase cloud platform
    and MIT App Inventor 2. Experiment 1 MIT App inventor blocks are depicted in Figure
    2. The experiment is based on the observation of these blocks; students are also
    required to develop their application that is connected with Firebase database.
    The benefit of using the MIT App Inventor environment to teach students the fundamental
    concepts is double. Firstly, students understand the use of necessary components
    that are commonly used in the IoT systems in order to constitute IoT systems.
    Secondly, students concentrate on IoT systems instead of the difficulties of android
    programming. Figure 1. Application scenario of experiment 1. Figure 2. Application
    implemented with MIT App Inventor 2 blocks interface. Understanding BLE Beacon
    in IoT systems The primary target of this experiment is to teach students a typical
    BLE application in IoT systems and its properties. Students understand how to
    generate Beacon frames and how to capture these frames with mobile phone-based
    application. A mobile phone application presented in Figure 3 can be used for
    observing BLE address, Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), and received signal
    strength indicator (RSSI). The analysis of the BLE technology is first performed
    by a BLE beacon, which is in the range of mobile phones Bluetooth. When the scan
    button is pressed, the phone turns on its Bluetooth, scanning Bluetooth devices
    in the environment. When the beacon devices list button is clicked, the search
    signal devices are listed. Connect button displays the medium access control (MAC)
    address, UUID, and RSSI information of the beacon device in the Beacon Information
    field. Moreover, a notification is shown when the connection is established. The
    click button disconnects the Bluetooth connection from the BLE beacon. This experiment
    is suitable for students who need to learn the use of MIT App Inventor BLE extension
    alongside the BLE Beacon. Figure 3. Example scenario of understanding BLE beacon
    detection. Who are lucky people? Use of BLE, Cloud, and mobile application Bluetooth
    low energy module, mobile phones, and cloud platforms are some of the primary
    hardware components that are widely used in IoT systems. Training their functionalities
    and appearances is the key target of this experiment. Students build a real-time
    scenario to realize the behavior of each of these components. In this experiment,
    the students use Beacon, Firebase, MIT App Inventor 2, MIT App Inventor 2 Companion,
    BLE extension for MIT App Inventor 2 technologies and devices. All instructions
    are uploaded by students with an experiment document. When the mobile application
    user enters the coverage area of the Beacon, this application connects the beacon
    device and receives a welcome notification message. Then, the mobile user connects
    to the database provided by the Firebase cloud platform, reads the “number” value
    that holds the number of users, and writes it back by increasing the value to
    the database using the written MIT App Inventor blocks as shown in Figure 4. If
    the number of users reaches a certain value, which is selected to be three in
    this experiment, the user is assumed as a lucky user, and feedback is given with
    a specific picture notification. In this experiment, students can see the MAC
    address of BLE device using Beacon manager program which is available on play
    store. In the final section of the experiment, a real-time scenario in which all
    components stated above is used. Figure 4. Application implemented with MIT App
    Inventor 2 blocks interface. NFC read-and-write process: Real-time contactless
    payment application Most numbers of smartphones have NFC, which is short-range
    wireless technology. NFC has made many applications such as contactless payment,
    public transportation payment systems, input/output control system, etc. NFC cards
    can be read-only, readable, and writable. Teaching and prototyping NFC functionalities
    on the real-time application are the core objective of this experiment. This experiment
    consists of a mobile application that can be called contactless payment, a readable
    and writable NFC card, which charges the desired payment and decreases its value
    in each reading and Firebase cloud platform keeps the number value up to date.
    Figure 5 depicts the experiment scenario with real-time interaction between the
    experiment components. Since the NFC add-on is a component that is not seen directly
    on the screen, it appears under the screen under nonvisible components in the
    designer page as shown in Figure 6. The application has three basic parts: writing
    data to NFC tag (credit charge), reading NFC tag (decrease and update credit),
    and Firebase cloud (update user information). First, the user can enter the charge
    value in the “Please enter the quantity you want to charge” text box field for
    loading credit. Then, when the download button is pressed, Button 1, click operations
    are performed. The value in the textbox is transferred to the global credit variable,
    followed by the NFC write operation set.NearField1.TextToWrite. During the write
    operation, ReadMode is false. Finally, NearField1.TagWritten status occurs when
    the write operation is complete. Then ReadMode is true for reading and credit
    charged is displayed. Figure 5. Application scenario of experiment 4 with the
    mobile application, cloud platform, and NFC card. Figure 6. Application implemented
    with MIT App Inventor 2 blocks interface. Mobile IoT button application with ESP8266
    Wi-Fi-integrated Wemos D1 mini The target of this experiment is to inform students
    how IoT devices receive requests from cloud platforms in order to interact with
    the mobile application. A mobile application programmed with MIT App Inventor
    and Wemos D1 mini with LED connection structure depicted in Figure 7. These two
    components are connected by Wi-Fi technology to the Firebase cloud platform in
    this laboratory experiment. Students are asked to change the status of the LED
    via the mobile application. This experiment teaches and tests students’ ability
    to use the open source Arduino software (IDE)27 in order to experience the ESP8266
    Wi-Fi module. Students use the instructions provided to define the ESP8266 module
    in the Arduino IDE environment, to add Firebase libraries to the Arduino application,
    to build and install the created projects. The attention of the previous experiments
    has been to explain students the use of numerous IoT components. This experiment
    teaches students how to use the supplied components in order to examine the basic
    request methods of IoT in a realistic scenario. In the final section of the experiment,
    when the switch on button is clicked, “true” is entered in the Led folder, which
    is created in the Firebase platform, and when the switch off button is clicked,
    “false” information is transmitted. Moreover, according to the button pressed
    on the label part, turn on or turn off information appears. Figure 7. System architecture
    and components used in experiment IV. Temperature monitoring with ThingSpeak cloud
    platform The IoT course laboratory experiment 6 introduces the ThingSpeak cloud
    platform and implements the communication between Wemos D1 mini and ThingSpeak
    database as shown in Figure 8. In this context, reading through the LM35 temperature
    sensor specification is an option. We design an application that monitors data
    with ThingSpeak, mainly focusing on the GET method on Arduino IDE. The procedure
    is as follows: Step 1. Students are first asked to open a new channel to monitor
    the environment temperature in real time. Step 2. Students need to get information
    to write and read the API key. Step 3. Students are asked to create GET method
    on Arduino IDE as “GET/update?key=Write Api Key&Field Name=”. Step 4. Students
    need to compile and load the Arduino code with wireless local area network (WLAN)
    service set identifier (SSID) and password information on the Wemos D1 mini. Step
    5. Final phase of the experiment is to test the system using ThingSpeak cloud
    platform graphical user interface. Figure 8. Final setup and components for experiment
    V. Real-time temperature monitoring with android programming This experiment allows
    students to use Firebase to test mobile apps, which are created with Atom and
    PlatformIO aiming at helping students to identify the difference between the MIT
    App Inventor 2 and Android programming. Atom is a text editor to write the Arduino
    codes. PlatformIO provides an open source environment for IoT system development.
    Students are required to follow the procedure of this experiment as follows. Step
    1. Students create a Firebase project with Firebase URL and database API key.
    Step 2. Students create a new PlatformIO project with Arduino framework. To use
    Firebase, students need to copy the lib folder in the project file to the https://github.com/firebase/firebase-arduino
    link. After connecting the D2 port of the Wemos D1 mini to the DHT22 sensor, the
    Arduino code is connected with WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD. Step 3. The Firebase
    connection is made with the values FIREBASE_HOST and FIREBASE_AUTH. Example application
    code which is presented to the student as a laboratory manual is shown in Figure
    9. Step 4. Once these steps are completed, the mobile application is created by
    the students to provide the connection of the IoT system designed in this experiment.
    Students are then instructed to set up Gradle. This platform is a general purpose
    build management system based on Groovy and Kotlin. The following line should
    be added to the permission file to enable the application to connect to the internet
    using Gradle. Later, Gradle files are configured for Android dependencies. Lastly,
    students implement to link to the Firebase on creating and override in database
    methods as: <uses-permission android:name=“android.permission.INTERNET”/> Figure
    9. Arduino example code written by PlatformIO for experiment VI. ThingSpeak communication
    between IoT device and GSM (SIM900) module This experiment allows students to
    collect environment temperature and humidity data, and send text messages through
    mobile phone. Students use GGS01-GSM/GPS Arduino-based GSM-GPS shield, Arduino
    MEGA, DHT11 sensor, Arduino IDE, and ThingSpeak components to build a real-time
    IoT system. This GPRS-based IoT device transmits the message using the onboard
    SIM900 GSM module. The first step of this application is to plug the GSM shield
    and connect the sensor to the Arduino MEGA device. Afterward, students add Arduino
    GSM shield library and select this device on Arduino IDE. Then, students write
    Arduino code for the transfer of both temperature and humidity information to
    ThingSpeak platform. Students need to write codes with the AT commands for the
    methods for transmitting both temperature and humidity data to ThingSpeak, the
    specification, identification data rate, and so on of the GSM Shield. For example,
    the following commands used students for this experiment would configure the basic
    settings for GSM-GPS shield shown in Figure 10. Figure 10. Arduino example code
    written by Arduino IDE for experiment VII. IoT application with MQTT protocol
    using Adafruit The resilience of IoT networks strongly depends on communication
    technologies and protocols. MQTT is a telemetry messaging protocol based on broadcast
    and subscribe methods. This protocol is most commonly used to communicate between
    M2M systems. Unlike the existing protocols, it is more lightweight and can be
    easily used in many platforms. This experiment describes the MQTT protocol by
    depicting it in terms of publish and subscribe methods. It considers the Adafruit
    cloud platform and provides the details of communication between Wemos D1 mini
    and Adafruit MQTT library as shown in Figure 11. In this experiment, students
    use the Wemos D1 Mini IoT device with the ESP8266 module to transmit the ambient
    temperature information from the LM35 sensor to the Adafruit IoT platform with
    the MQTT protocol. The first step is to add the Wemos D1 device with ESP8266 to
    the Arduino IDE. In the next step, students add the relevant library to the Arduino
    IDE application using the add ZIP library option to communicate with the Adafruit
    IoT Platform using the MQTT communication protocol. Then, to create the Adafruit.io
    dashboard that provides MQTT communication protocol support, students follow the
    steps, which are adding blocks for chart or slider and creating Adafruit input-output
    (AIO) key. Finally, students can compile the code that includes the ESP8266 Wi-Fi
    library file, setup function, wireless networking information, MQTT server connection
    setup, Adafruit MQTT connection setup, feed settings for publish and subscribe,
    variable, and pin definitions. Figure 11. MQTT protocol system architecture used
    in experiment VIII. IoT application with CoAP protocol CoAP is an application
    layer protocol designed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This protocol’s
    primary duty is working on devices with limited resources and network bandwidth.
    CoAP works on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to keep the design simple. It provides
    data transmission from the M2M. The target of this experiment is to understand
    the influence of CoAP protocol on IoT system performance through examining messages
    between CoAP server and client by the tools provided by the Visual Studio. Wemos
    D1 mini is assumed to run as CoAP client. Implementation of the CoAP server is
    the main responsibilities of students. This server is implemented by the console
    application created by Visual Studio. CoAP.NET is added to the project from the
    NuGet package manager. After creating a resource that identifies CoAP packages,
    the main code can activate the resource. CoAP protocol application scenario includes
    the CoAP server and client is presented in Figure 12. Students can implement and
    understand this protocol clearly by examining energy consumption and throughput.
    In this experiment, the temperature is determined using the Wemos D1 mini and
    LM35 sensor as in experiment 9. However, in this experiment, a computer that serves
    as a CoAP server is added. Adding the Wemos D1 device with ESP8266 to the Arduino
    IDE and loading the CoAP library to the Arduino IDE are the basic steps of this
    experiment. To open the library as an application, students can click New> Examples>
    Esp-CoAP Simple library> coapclient. This client example is used to generate a
    CoAP client in the IoT device. Figure 12. COAP protocol IoT application system
    architecture. Implementation of the term project activities IoT system term projects
    enable students’ improvement and assessment. Table 3 shows IoT course term project
    schedule. Students are allowed to select a project subject related to the defined
    equipment list, and technological requirement as indicated in Table 4. Each term
    project subject must be accepted by the course instructor considering the recent
    trend in IoT systems. Upon successful completion of the laboratory experiments
    and class lectures, students can have used to the laboratory equipment for an
    additional amount of time in order to conclude their projects on schedule. The
    business model of IoT systems (Canvas), IoT communication technologies (RFID,
    NFC, BLE, Wi-Fi, GSM, 3G), IoT cloud platforms (Firebase, ThingSpeak, Samsung
    Artık, Adafruit), IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, light), IoT communication

    Raspberry Pi board and ESP8266 module are used as the main network server and
    communicate with the primary server, respectively. The ultrasonic sensor is generated
    a real-time event for this system. Project-2: To adjust the brightness on the
    red green blue (RGB) led according to the values taken from the light sensor according
    to the light intensity in the real environment. At the same time, the temperature
    and humidity values obtained from the DHT11 sensor using the MQTT protocol are
    published on the Adafruit.io using the MQTT broker. Moreover, all sensor values
    are displayed on the phone using the mobile phone application, which subscribes
    on Adafruit.io using the broker. Project-3: To measure and investigate temperature,
    pressure, and humidity in real time, and to generate alerts using mobile communication
    technology in case of crossover of these parameters beyond their predefined values.
    The data from the sensors are transferred to the virtual server via the ESP8266
    module in real time. The data from the PHP server of the virtual server are logged
    in MySQL and checked instantly. When the alarm condition occurs, the virtual server
    uses GGS01-GSM/GPS Arduino-based GSM-GPS module to alert the user with a text
    message. Project-4: To show an economical and easy way of using an embedded system
    based irrigation system. The data received from the humidity sensors, which are
    periodically recorded in the Firebase cloud platform via the NodeMCU, ensure that
    the soil is sufficiently watered by opening the water flow valve when it reaches
    the specified threshold value. Project-5: To monitor and control sensors and actuators
    for smart home systems. With the developed mobile application, the Led Open button
    is pressed; the message that the related led is be opened and published by the
    MQTT protocol. The Arduino-based device that subscribes to this broadcast opens
    the LED that is connected to the output port. Similarly, the LED can be switched
    off. In addition, the ambient temperature is determined by the LM35 sensor. The
    temperature information can be monitored in real time on the telephone on which
    the application is subscribed. Project-6: To design a mobile application for monitoring
    ambient parameters. Real-time data from the DHT22 sensor are sent to the Firebase
    platform via the ESP8266 module and displayed at the real-time in the Android
    app which is developed with Atom and PlatformIO. Project-7: To develop the smart
    health platform prototype that activates monitoring of heart rate and inter-beat
    interval for several topics. Real-time data from the pulse sensor are sent to
    the ThingSpeak via the Wemos D1 module. With this project, students demonstrate
    the potential realization of mass monitoring of biomedical data that is interested
    in the IoT and cyber-physical systems. Project-8: To implement the real-time alert
    system prototype ESP8266-based Wi-Fi module NodeMCU (12E). Four sensors, which
    are temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11), the pressure sensor (BMP180), raindrop
    module, and light-dependent resistor (LDR), are connected to the NodeMCU. When
    these values exceed a threshold limit, an e-mail and a Tweet message are issued
    to alert the owner of the system to take necessary precautions. Project-9: This
    project supposes a prototype for applying the IoT to smart traffic systems. The
    smart traffic system is applied using roadside units (RSU) with roughness monitoring,
    vehicles with environmental sensors and a database for data transfer through different
    platforms. The traffic system informs users about the road condition, i.e. wet,
    dry, snowy, or icy by using the developed friction monitoring units. Project-10:
    To develop a novel garage door gate prototype for opening the gate automatically.
    The system consists of two Bluetooth modules for car and gate operations. It shows
    the current station of the door using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module at the ThingSpeak
    platform. When the vehicle defined in the system is within recognizable proximity,
    the two Bluetooth modules communicate with each other, and the door opens automatically.
    A total of 20 groups finished the course term projects and presented in the class.
    Figure 13 depicts samples of some of the presented projects. At the end of the
    course, a term project showcase event was conducted. Three project groups won
    awards in the showcase affair. The first, the second, and the third prizes were

    the IoT systems course falls into two steps. In the first step, students are requested
    to fill out a survey on their opinions, experiences, and evaluations. The second
    step considers the improvement of student learning and the developed application
    performance. In the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years, approximately 400
    students have been enrolled in the IoT and the IoT and application courses at
    the computer engineering programs of Kocaeli and Sakarya Universities to evaluate
    the designing of the IoT systems course. Table 5 presents the survey of students’
    response results with the mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ). The first group
    of survey questions is getting feedback for theoretical concept knowledge of IoT
    systems. Seven questions of this group are responded with generally positive results,
    whereby the mean is four and, the standard deviation of less than one. To compare
    the results of the pre- and post-courses knowledge, we have asked an overall question
    for this group. The mean pre-course result of this question is 2.18 of 5, with
    a standard deviation of 1.12 and 95% confidence interval. Contrarily, the mean
    post-course result is 4.23 of 5, with a standard deviation of 0.86 and 95% confidence
    interval. The second group of survey questions indicates student’s practical experience
    in IoT systems. The students have graded mean 4.57 and 3.56 for questions 9 and
    14 with the highest mean and lowest mean values, respectively. In evaluating practical
    experience on IoT systems, the mean pre-course results is 1.1, standard deviation
    is 1.5, and 95% confidence interval. Contrarily, the mean post-course results
    is 3.96, the standard deviation is 0.73, and 95% confidence interval. An average
    evaluation that students achieved on the pre-course are 1.94 of 5, with a standard
    deviation of 1.34 and 95% confidence interval. An average evaluation that students
    achieved on the post-course are 4.15 of 5, with a standard deviation of 0.84,
    and 95% confidence interval. According to the results of the survey, the proposed
    course has a significant effect when compared with the pre-course. Table 5. IoT

    and their real-time application development using different kinds of IoT components,
    such as sensors, embedded system cards, cloud platforms, software toolkits, etc.
    The IoT system course seeks to: (i) introduce students to recent trends in real-time
    IoT systems and their application areas, (ii) implement real-time IoT systems
    by using different IoT components and programming via mobile application software
    platforms, (iii) require students to design and implement real-time IoT systems,
    and (iv) familiarize students with real-time IoT engineering problems. The proposed
    IoT system course consists of 12 main topics, which are supported by 10 real-time
    IoT applications. Students enrolled in the IoT system course work in groups to
    complete a term project. The designed course was successfully offered at Kocaeli
    University and Sakarya University in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, respectively. Students
    who attended this course found it very motivating, beneficial, and easy to learn.
    Consequently, a large number of engineering students became familiar with the
    field of real-time IoT systems. This course also provides students with the skills
    they need to develop technologies that can influence the IoT technology. Declaration

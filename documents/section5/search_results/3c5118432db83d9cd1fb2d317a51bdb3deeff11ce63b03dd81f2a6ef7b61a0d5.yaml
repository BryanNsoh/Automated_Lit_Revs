    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\
    \ yield via cloud dashboards for\nfarmers. A schematic of the digital twin concept\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\

    \ of products (e.g., farm machinery) re-\nquires (I) geometric (e.g., size, shape)\
    \ and physical properties of an object, (II) in the\ndetailed information of the\
    \ product which can illustrate dynamic processing of the object,\n(III) integration\
    \ of geometric, physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin ap-\nproaches\
    \ make it possible to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery\n\
    that would yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efﬁciencies.\n\
    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be mod-\neled in digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors\
    \ on energy consumption can\nalso be explored there [62]. In the agricultural\
    \ context, ref. [40] reported that a commercially\navailable digital twin platform\
    \ for agricultural machinery is able to track the machines\nin real-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efﬁciency of crop management,\nand trajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the speciﬁc conditions of the farm. It has also\n\
    been reported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training of\
    \ unskilled\nharvester operators and lead to high macro-economic beneﬁts [63].\n\
    Within the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important technology\
    \ in crop\nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization and has\
    \ been drawing more\nattention in recent years. To optimize the robotic application\
    \ process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efﬁciency of the product,\
    \ the digital twin concepts can be used for\nvirtualization of the robot environment\
    \ by introducing a remote operating system [64].\nBy providing simulation and\
    \ remote operation possibilities and modeling various inter-\nactions between\
    \ robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\nand\
    \ ﬂexibility may enhance, and the ﬁnal product cost may decline. Ref. [65] analyzed\n\
    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Metrics Abstract: IoT systems use sensors to collect data from smart environments
    and manage resources through data analysis. An IoT system deals with many connected
    devices with different network and hardware constraints in a real-world scenario.
    An IoT system needs to handle low-latency data analysis, security threats, internal
    vulnerabilities, and network disconnections, which cause data loss and incorrect
    decisions. Trustworthiness (also known as dependability) provides various features
    for an IoT end-to-end data flow, such as resilience, security, availability, reliability,
    scalability, maintainability, heterogeneity, hardware resources management, fault
    management policies, and data quality. This paper presents a survey on trustworthiness
    and dependability in IoT systems and proposes the Trustworthiness for IoT Framework
    (TW-IoT) to provide trustworthiness at the data level for mist and fog-based IoT
    systems. The TW-IoT framework provides data trustworthiness to ensure a continuous
    and uninterrupted operation of IoT data flow. We also discuss challenges and trade-offs
    related to data trustworthiness in IoT. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT computing continuum.

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is a networked system with billions
    of connected physical devices (sensors and actuators) transmitting and receiving
    data in a given context application [1]–[3]. IoT systems can monitor water distribution
    and irrigation in agriculture, reduces logistics costs, monitor patient health
    in a hospital, or optimize vehicle traffic through smart traffic lights [4]–[7].
    Therefore, an IoT system grants services to smart scenarios in different contexts,
    efficiently managing hardware, software, and communication resources to reduce
    costs in specific domains. In IoT, dealing with vulnerabilities of a vast number
    of heterogeneous and hardware-constrained devices is a challenge [4], [8]. Trustworthiness
    enhances IoT system features to handle several system challenges. However, there
    is no consensus in the literature about the definition of trustworthiness, as
    some research lines limit this concept to security scope handling only malicious
    attacks [9], [10]. Risks and threats for IoT systems involve malicious attacks
    by external agents and system threats such as faults, vulnerabilities, or unexpected
    system behaviors. Trustworthiness and dependability [11], [12] are similar concepts.
    They include requirements of system availability, reliability, scalability, maintainability,
    heterogeneity, data quality, hardware resources, security, agility in the response
    time, and system and network resilience [13]. A way to enforce trustworthiness
    requirements in IoT systems is using fog computing because it allows real-time
    data analysis at the edge [14]–[17]. Fog computing does not limit data analysis
    to a centralized cloud server. Fog enables local data analysis at the network
    edge [18], [19], reducing the network throughput and the need for data processing
    in a cloud [20], as well as allowing faster decision-making at the edge [19],
    [21]–[23]. However, even a fog-based IoT system has trustworthiness challenges,
    considering mechanisms to manage the IoT devices’ data flow and the network, memory,
    and energy consumption constraints [8], [24], [25]. This paper presents a research
    overview of IoT trustworthiness to identify problems, challenges, approaches,
    solutions, and technologies. We identify gaps and challenges about trustworthiness
    in IoT systems and also propose the Trustworthiness for IoT Framework (TW-IoT).
    Based on mist [26] and fog computing, TW-IoT provides trustworthiness from a data
    flow perspective throughout different IoT stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud).
    The main contributions of this paper are (i) to clarify concepts, characteristics,
    and gaps about trustworthiness in IoT systems, (ii) to propose the TW-IoT framework
    that contains a set of techniques and mechanisms for ensuring trustworthiness
    in the development of an IoT system based on mist and fog computing, (iii) to
    propose a data flow for each IoT stage (thing, mist, fog, and cloud), using the
    TW-IoT framework, (iv) to expose some trade-offs among trustworthiness mechanisms
    for the IoT data flow and finally, (v) to present the challenges related to trustworthiness
    in IoT systems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
    defines a fog-based IoT system architecture, Section III contextualizes concepts
    of trustworthiness, dependability, and data trustworthiness, Section IV presents
    this paper adopted terminologies, and Section V describes the trustworthiness
    related studies. Section VI introduces the TW-IoT framework for data trustworthiness
    in IoT systems based on mist and fog computing. Section VII exemplifies TW-IoT
    mechanisms for IoT data flow stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud), and Section
    VIII explains trade-offs between these mechanisms. Section IX discusses the lessons
    learned and challenges, and finally, Section X presents conclusions and future
    work. SECTION II. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT Computing Continuum The Internet of
    Things (IoT) connects billions of embedded devices (sensors and actuators), transmitting
    and receiving data in a network [1], [27]. Through Internet, sensors send data
    to be processed and analyzed in a cloud server, whose results can generate instructions
    to actuators. Fig. 1 describes the underlying IoT Computing Continuum [28], providing
    the rationale for analyzing the trustworthiness concept, based on four processing
    stages: thing, mist, fog, and cloud. FIGURE 1. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT computing
    continuum. Show All A. Thing Stage The Thing stage contains the physical devices:
    sensors and actuators. Sensors gather data from a specific environment, sending
    them to the Mist stage and beyond. After it, the IoT system uses data fusion or
    different models (e.g., machine/deep learning) according to a specific application
    [29]. As a result, the model generates a decision and sends it back to actuators
    in the Thing stage as commands to change the environment accordingly (e.g., turn
    on/ off some equipment). B. Mist Stage The mist processing stage is closer to
    sensors [30], playing the role of a specific fog node deployed in the field, providing
    direct support for the communication of sensors and actuators with the Internet.
    Mist computing is a subset of fog computing, running on constrained resource equipment,
    such as single-board computers [31], [32]. A mist node significant function is
    behaving as a radio gateway for sensors and actuators, as defined by RFC 8376
    [33]. Also, it can store, preprocess, and analyze data in a distributed fashion
    over multiple nodes. For that reason, one of the mist computing benefits is to
    improve the system scalability, as it may help increase the autonomy of devices
    closer to the edge [26]. C. Fog Stage Fog computing addresses new challenges related
    to the massive amount of data generated by the increasing use of IoT systems [16],
    [18], [20]. Fog computing supports a virtualized computing platform that offers
    processing, storage, and communication services between devices, users, and the
    cloud datacenter [34]. The main goals of fog computing are (i) decreasing latency
    for real-time services negatively affected by the long physical distance between
    devices and cloud data centers, (ii) enabling system load-balance at the edge
    and reducing processing in the cloud, and (iii) decreasing data traffic between
    the edge and the network core as the system does not need to send all data to
    the cloud. Similarly to a cloud service, a fog node can store data and process
    models such as machine learning or data fusion algorithms to forecast certain
    behaviors or make decisions. However, there are significant differences between
    cloud and fog, such as the limited availability of computing resources, the security
    policies, and the hardware performance (memory and processing) [16], [35]. Fog
    is not a mandatory stage in IoT systems. However, its potential benefits may be
    worth it, such as reduced response times at the edge and more robust network resilience
    [36]. Local data processing also prevents sending irrelevant data to the cloud
    [22] by analyzing sensor data locally [20]. D. Cloud Stage Cloud computing has
    data processing high performance because it provides hardware resources in a scalable
    approach through cloud services virtualization [37]. A cloud service customer
    can execute multiple processes on a large scale since the cloud provides distributed
    hardware resources on demand for these processes [38]. The cloud plays a crucial
    role in any IoT system. Theoretically, the cloud stage is not needed because everything
    can be processed at an edge, e.g., in a farm office for smart agriculture. However,
    in practice, the cloud’s resources, robustness, and reliability, either public
    or private, are unavoidable characteristics. SECTION III. Trustworthiness and
    Related Paradigms In this section, we explain the concepts of trustworthiness,
    dependability, and data trustworthiness. A. Trustworthiness and Dependability
    Trustworthiness allows the uninterrupted continuity of system services [39]. In
    other words, a trustworthy (dependable) system should adapt and tolerate vulnerabilities
    throughout its life cycle [40]. The trustworthiness definition consists of system
    requirements concerning multiple aspects, such as security, resilience, availability,
    reliability, scalability, maintainability, heterogeneity, data quality, hardware
    resources, and fault management policies [13]. Some authors limit the trustworthiness
    concept as dealing with system security only [9], [41]. However, throughout this
    paper, trustworthiness and dependability are equivalent concepts [11], [12]. Trustworthiness
    is not only associated with failures in the system security level (by attacks)
    but also with general system vulnerabilities [13], [42]–[44]. Therefore, we consider
    the concepts of trustworthiness and dependability as synonyms, even though there
    is no consensus in the community [11], [12]. IoT critical systems need to deal
    with privacy, heterogeneity, and data analysis from billions of devices [45] in
    real-time, as well as system failures and real-time decision-making [45], [46].
    Consequently, trustworthiness is essential in these IoT environments [47]–[50].
    B. Data Trustworthiness Trustworthiness is not limited only to enhance the system
    at the software/hardware level but also to improve the system at the data level
    [44], [51]. An IoT system that collects data in an environment must ensure the
    data trustworthiness, verifying if that data contains relevant information to
    the application domain. Data trustworthiness needs to ensure data veracity, according
    to the IoT system context [52], [53]. For example, supposing the IoT system collects
    data from tropical weather. In that case, the IoT system must verify the data
    behavior, referring to these climate conditions. Otherwise, in future data analysis,
    the IoT system may not respond correctly, making wrong decisions, causing a vulnerability
    at the data level. In an IoT system, ensuring data trustworthiness also means
    ensuring resilient data flow. Therefore, the data trustworthiness consists of
    maintaining data flow continuity and trusted system decisions [44], [53]. SECTION
    IV. Adopted Terminologies We adopt terminologies in this paper as the IoT system
    concepts, IoT smart service, IoT smart application, context, and a mechanism in
    our proposal called the integration of smart everything (explained in Section
    VII). We refer to the system context as circumstance or condition related to external
    or internal variations in an IoT system environment [17], [54], [55], as the weather
    temperature, energy consumption, soil moisture, or wind velocity measurement variations.
    An IoT smart service contains smart applications. For example, a smart service
    refers to smart farming, smart mobility, or smart hospital service. At the same
    time, a smart application corresponds to applications of these smart services.
    Thus, a smart farming service contains smart applications like smart irrigation,
    smart water management, smart pest control, and a smart monitoring crop growth
    application. The IoT system represents the entire hardware and software system,
    which contains IoT smart services and, consequently, IoT smart applications. An
    ideal IoT system has multiple smart services connected by the mechanism that we
    call smart everything. SECTION V. Trustworthiness Related Studies We searched
    studies that explicitly use concepts and definitions of trustworthiness and dependability
    with the following combination of terms: dependability and IoT, trustworthiness
    and IoT, trustworthy IoT. We searched papers in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library,
    Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Springer Link. We also examined the abstracts
    of the articles. For the survey scope, we found a total of 57 studies related
    to dependability and trustworthiness. We perceived that 56 investigations refer
    to IoT, fog, or edge computing. We also observed that one study only focusing
    mainly on physical devices (sensors and actuators). We identified 24 papers referring
    only to trustworthiness, 27 to dependability, and six mentioned both terms (TABLE
    1). TABLE 1 Topics Per Paper A. Related Studies Categories We classify 57 studies
    related to dependability and trustworthiness: 18 present conceptual studies, 10
    introduce a framework, 10 describe a mathematical investigation, eight present
    a performance analysis, six report algorithms or techniques, three show an architectural
    approach, and two focus on hardware related issues (Fig. 2). FIGURE 2. Related
    studies categories. Show All 1) Conceptual Regarding studies that present definitions
    on dependability and trustworthiness, some papers explore the state of the art
    and definitions [9], [42], [43], [56]–[63]. We also found surveys on trustworthiness
    [64]–[68] and dependability [69] and a systematic literature review (SLR) on dependability
    [70]. 2) Framework Design Some papers propose a framework for resource management
    in fog/cloud [71], other propose a framework for trust management for IoT devices
    [51], [72], [73], and fog nodes [74]. Also, some papers focus on security issues
    [10], [75]–[77] or fault recovery [78]. 3) Mathematical Approach Among research
    on IoT dependability, we found five studies that present mathematical approaches
    to measuring system reliability and availability [79]–[83]. In contrast, two others
    propose a calculus to estimate a confidence score to sensors [41], [84], and users
    [85]. We also found a proposal for an optimization approach for some dependability
    characteristics [86] and a theoretical approach based on Markov models to deal
    with vulnerabilities in a healthcare system [87]. 4) Performance Analysis Among
    the papers reporting a performance evaluation, some analyze trustworthiness by
    energy consumption [88]–[90], evaluate protocols [91], and communication interfaces
    [92]. Two papers compare different machine learning techniques for malicious data
    detection [93], [94], and another one compares machine learning techniques for
    data (image) reconstruction [95]. 5) Algorithms/Techniques We identified papers
    that propose techniques or algorithms to improve dependability characteristics
    [39], [96]–[98], or techniques related to trust management mechanisms [99], [100].
    6) Architectural Approach We found three studies that propose architectural approaches:
    an architectural approach for a gateway that provides security to an IoT system
    [101]; a conceptual architecture for data provenance [102]; a standards-oriented
    approach [103]. 7) Hardware Design We found two studies that propose solutions
    at the hardware level, dealing with system cryptography [104], and with limited
    computational resources in IoT focused on device memory constraints [105]. B.
    Trustworthiness Features We consider the following set of features describes the
    trustworthiness concept: security (integrity, confidentiality, availability, and
    authenticity), system and network resilience, data quality (and semantic integrity),
    system availability, system reliability, scalability, maintainability, survivability,
    heterogeneity, IoT constraints (latency, memory, processing power, energy consumption),
    fault management and redundancy (see TABLE 2). TABLE 2 Trustworthiness Features
    in Related Work 1) Security Data security is a feature for ensuring the IoT system
    trustworthiness [64], [88], [106]. A secure system needs to provide data integrity,
    authenticity, confidentiality to protect data from malicious attacks or not authorized
    access [107]. As shown in TABLE 2, we observed that security is the most mentioned
    feature of an IoT system’s trustworthiness. The main security features that we
    found as follows: Integrity: refers to data content preservation, ensuring that
    data is not corrupted or altered by a malicious user or software. Integrity is
    strongly associated with IoT system trustworthiness because fraudulent data turns
    the system no longer reliable [64] since it makes wrong decisions [66]. Authenticity:
    IoT data is authentic when it comes from a source that is a trusted part of the
    system [104], [107]. Unknown sensors can transmit non-authentic data with information
    that differs from the application context [97]. One way to deal with unreliable
    sensors in IoT is through the traceability of transmitted data [73] or by verifying
    the behavior of network sensors’ energy consumption [84]. When there is a lack
    of data authenticity, integrity is not necessarily compromised, as the data is
    not corrupted or altered but fabricated. Therefore, a trustworthy IoT system must
    deal with mechanisms to verify data authenticity. Confidentiality: ensures that
    third parties have no access to IoT devices’ data by packet interception [65].
    Consequently, the IoT system must restrict data access via encryption mechanisms
    and access validation policies [64]. Availability: from the security viewpoint,
    availability deals with interruptions [9], [104] caused by attacks such as denial
    of service (DoS), for example. However, the availability concept has a broader
    scope. A system can stop working even without any external attack but due to other
    vulnerabilities. 2) Resilience Resilience of a computer system is part of the
    trustworthiness concept [94]. It includes the ability to deal with system failures.
    Thus, a resilient system can prevent, tolerate, mitigate, remove, and predict
    failures [108], [109]. In a system with devices connected to a network, resilience
    is responsible for maintaining or recovering the communication service between
    devices, regardless of network failures [110], [111]. The concept of resilience
    is the system’s ability to resist failures [112] using recoverability (survivability),
    adaptability, and the capacity to manage failures [13]. Network, hardware, or
    software vulnerabilities can interrupt a system service, so the system must react
    to these failures when they occur. However, there are computing costs to support
    system resilience [113]. The system requires resources to recover from a failure,
    to solve or mitigate a threat, reducing or compromising the system performance.
    A resilient IoT system must deal with resource constraints (network, battery,
    memory, and processing capacity limitations) because IoT devices must react to
    failures as quickly as possible. After all, operations must occur in real-time
    [69]. A resilient fog-based IoT system data flow must prevent data losses caused
    by the network connection failure between mist/fog components. The fog also needs
    to deal with data loss due to low storage capacity in mist/fog nodes memory [111].
    A relevant resilience challenge deals with network disconnection between components
    of different IoT stages, such as thing, mist, fog, or cloud [16], [114]–[121].
    Therefore, it is necessary to establish mechanisms to ensure resilience to fog-based
    IoT systems for data transmission [16], [122], such as fault management mechanisms
    for IoT nodes [16]. A resilient system must provide security and fault management
    mechanisms. The survivability concept offers the system’s continuity through fault
    recovery techniques, which recovery techniques are one of the fault management
    features. Moreover, redundancy is a technique that the system uses to recover
    from a failure. 3) Fault Management In computer systems, a failure represents
    an unexpected behavior. In the IoT data domain, it is possible to exemplify some
    of these behaviors as data integrity loss due to semantic/syntactic vulnerabilities,
    packet loss due to network interference or connection loss between fog nodes [70],
    and data loss caused by network exhaustion or device memory overflow. The literature
    categorizes fault management into four main aspects: fault detection, fault prediction,
    fault recovery (or mitigation), and fault prevention: Fault detection: fault detection
    in IoT is the verification of unexpected behavior using, for example, statistical
    analysis or machine learning methods [69]. IoT makes it possible to detect sensor
    failures, for example, by monitoring data values coming, such as the detection
    of outliers [97]. Fault prediction: consists of predicting the fault occurrence.
    In IoT, the most common method for predicting a fault is through probabilistic
    models or data regression techniques. Fault recovery or mitigation: A way of recovering
    from a failure in IoT is, for example, using load balancing between nodes to mitigate
    service discontinuation [74]. Some studies also deal with IoT fault recovery by
    using redundancy techniques [58]. Fault prevention: When the system predicts a
    fault (perceive the fault condition before it occurs), the system can perform
    mechanisms to prevent a failure (which refers to the system’s inability to operate).
    Redundancy is an example of a mechanism for fault prevention by replicating data
    from a fog node to other fog nodes. 4) Survivability Survivability is part of
    the concept of resilience and represents a system’s ability to survive attacks,
    failures, or degradation [13], [61]. In the fog computing scope, survivability
    maintains the data flow continuity between the IoT stages (from the thing stage
    until the cloud stage). This feature uses some mechanisms to increase an IoT system’s
    ability to survive vulnerabilities, such as data replication or fault management
    mechanisms. Also, fog-based IoT systems can rely on load balancing. In the fog
    node’s imminent resource exhaustion, the fog can transfer its workload to other
    nodes [74]. An open issue related to survivability is data loss [16], which can
    occur by an eventual disconnection between IoT stages, such as between fog and
    cloud. After a disconnection, when the connection returns, the data not sent to
    the cloud is not necessarily immediately transmitted, causing a data flow gap
    between fog and cloud. Therefore, IoT stages must store data temporarily during
    disconnections and transmit it to the next stage when the connection is active
    again. Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) is a mechanism that deals with data loss
    due to network disconnections [123] and can be used together with fog-based IoT
    systems [124]–[128]. However, these proposals only focus on delay or packet loss,
    disregarding the solution impact on fog resources. Besides, the DTN design does
    not deal with IoT trustworthiness requirements. 5) Redundancy Redundancy increases
    IoT systems’ reliability and availability [58] by replicating data from one node
    to other nodes. When, for example, a fog node A fails, the system continues to
    operate if other fog nodes B and C have a data copy from the failed fog node A.
    Redundancy is not limited to providing system data replication. It also includes
    connection replication using different communication technology on the same IoT
    device [82], [83]. For example, in case of a connection failure in the LPWAN interface,
    the device may use a Wi-Fi or 4G connection to reestablish communication with
    other nodes [92]. 6) Data Quality/Semantic Integrity Data quality is related to
    the IoT system context, and it directly impacts the solution decisions. The system
    context refers to a circumstance or condition related to external or internal
    variations in an IoT system environment [17], [54], [55], as the weather temperature,
    energy consumption, soil moisture, or wind velocity measurement variations. Assuring
    data quality involves verifying whether the gathered data represents the actual
    system context [51], which means that semantic data integrity is essential in
    assessing data quality [129]. For example, in an environment where the climate
    is always humid, data with a dry climate’s characteristics is likely wrong. As
    the IoT system context directly impacts the actuators’ actions, maintaining data
    quality ensures data trustworthiness [51]. The IoT system can verify data trust
    by the data type, system behavior, and context. Therefore, an IoT system previously
    needs to know the context and problem domain to provide trustworthy data analysis
    [129]. An IoT system needs to use meaningful data for decision-making [130], which
    means that part of the initial data processing must identify and remove data outliers.
    However, in cases of fake or manipulated data, it is necessary to observe whether
    the data comes from unreliable sensors [65], [95]. A data filter can solve this
    problem [97] since fake data can compromise future system actions. 7) System Availability
    Availability ensures that the IoT system continues operating as long as possible.
    There are methods to keep the system available, like managing hardware redundancy
    [63], [82], and maintaining a fault management mechanism [58]. Some IoT applications
    are latency-sensitive and, consequently, require low latency for transmitting
    packets between IoT stages. Therefore, these systems are always available when
    it performs all actions in real-time [60]. System availability is a metric that
    indicates the operation system probability until it begins a failure state (Equation
    1) [131]. Therefore, availability is given by the MTTF (mean time to failure)
    divided by MTTF + MTTR (mean time to repair). Availability= MTTF MTTF+MTTR (1)
    View Source 8) System Reliability Reliability, as well as availability, is a relevant
    metric to ensure IoT trustworthiness. However, it is worth empathizing that both
    concepts differ since availability demands the whole system to be continuously
    available, while reliability refers to system operations’ confidence [63]. Thus,
    reliability can be measured by the probability that a system will behave as expected
    for a specific time interval (t). We measure the reliability by the MTBF (mean
    time between failures) metric if the system has some fault recovery mechanism.
    However, we measure the reliability by the MTTF (mean time to failure) if there
    is no recovery mechanism. For calculation, the first case we consider λ=1 / MTBF
    and for the second λ=1 / MTTF. Thus, we describe reliability by Equation (2),
    where R (t) is the reliability function of time t, and λ is the miss rate [132].
    R(t)= e −λt (2) View Source 9) Scalability In a scenario with thousands or millions
    of sensors, IoT systems must satisfy the scalability demand to sustain a massive
    data transmission, storage, and analysis in real-time [15], [19]. A trustworthy
    system must be scalable because poor system performance and slow data analysis
    can result in delayed and, consequently, wrong decisions. Besides, with imprecise
    choices, the system harms data trustworthiness. The scalability feature implies
    providing more computing resources to the IoT system [63]. In a fog-based IoT
    system, nodes can become computationally saturated because, in a real scenario,
    the fog is responsible for dealing with thousands of devices [60]. Therefore,
    the scalable deployment of fog computing systems requires the necessary hardware
    infrastructure. The IoT system is more trustworthy with thousands of sensors because
    it stores more information, allowing it to make more precise decisions based on
    the gathered data. However, a system with many sensors demands additional security,
    network, and resilience requirements. Maintain a scalable and continuous data
    flow requires communication resilience between the IoT stages (mist-mist, mist-fog,
    fog-fog, and fog-cloud) [24], [122]. 10) Heterogeneity A real IoT system scenario
    comprises several heterogeneous communications and device technologies [27]. IoT
    communication protocols provide interaction between different devices because
    IoT devices have different hardware technologies and cannot understand each other.
    Multiple protocols differ in terms of packet formats and communication technologies,
    and not all protocols can support every IoT system [133]. Furthermore, dealing
    with heterogeneity is an essential trustworthiness issue. LPWAN (low power wide
    area network) technologies provide long transmission ranges, low energy consumption,
    and low bandwidth. LPWAN is an attractive technology for IoT systems that send
    a few dozens of bytes every couple of minutes or hours [134], [135]. LoRaWAN,
    Sigfox, and NB-IoT are LPWAN technologies leading this front [27], [136]. There
    are other technologies for IoT system communications, as Bluetooth [133], Zigbee
    [137], and Z-Wave [138]. The IoT developer can also adopt IEEE 802.11 standards
    (Wi-Fi), transmitting over short-range distances by devices with no battery constraints
    [133]. IoT system trustworthiness solves the interconnection problems between
    heterogeneous devices. The massive number of highly heterogenous devices can increase
    communication faults in IoT infrastructures [69]. Hence, the system must support
    interoperability [76], allowing intercommunication between applications and devices
    for every connected node [20]. 11) Quality of Service (QOS) IoT systems, based
    on fog or not, must process data from thousands of sensors in real-time. Therefore,
    there is a concern with network latency in sending data from a stage to another
    since a long packet delay can impair critical decisions ’ agility and correctness.
    There is also a data loss problem caused by low-quality network connection [89]
    or caused by a disconnection between IoT stages. Some IoT latency-sensitive systems
    do not accept packet delay or packet loss problems [50]. These circumstances only
    contribute to generating undesirable behavior, affecting the system’s trustworthiness.
    As previously mentioned, trustworthiness also deals with the choice of communication
    technologies. There may be interference between specific transmission protocol
    frequencies or range restrictions between devices [133], [136]. For example, for
    the Zigbee technology [137], the transmission distance range is lower than the
    LoRaWAN range [136]. 12) Memory Capacity Maintaining all system data stored is
    a way to ensure IoT data trustworthiness [56]. However, IoT devices frequently
    suffer from primary memory constraints. Keeping data in an IoT device for an indefinite
    time has a high cost. If we suppose a fog node that loses the cloud connection
    but continues to receive data from sensors and stores the data until the Internet
    connectivity returns, the storage memory can overflow. In this case, data fusion
    is a way to reduce these costs, joining consecutive stored data [105]. 13) Energy
    Consumption Most IoT devices have little autonomy due to limited battery [88],
    [59]. The impact of this constraint can reflect in (i) faults of data gathering
    whenever a sensor runs out of battery [89], (ii) storage gaps in a data time series,
    and (iii) wrong data analysis, since the gap in time series, harms the data analysis,
    and consequently untrusty decisions. Therefore, data trustworthiness needs to
    consider the device’s energy consumption. In smart farming, energy harvesting
    is a feasible solution for device battery constraints, such as photovoltaic cells
    [139]. However, this strategy does not work for all scenarios. For this reason,
    a relevant research challenge is reducing energy consumption in IoT devices [140],
    [141]. 14) Processing Power One critical aspect of IoT systems design and development
    is the limited devices processing power capacity [59]. Therefore, it is crucial
    to consider the processing constraints, especially for mist and fog nodes, since
    they are, to a great extent, responsible for ensuring trustworthiness. In latency-sensitive
    IoT systems, some scenarios require real-time data processing [56], and the processing
    power directly impacts a system execution time (see Equation 3) [131]. Many IoT
    operations are related to fault detection, data redundancy, or load balancing.
    Therefore, IoT processing power is a concern to provide trustworthiness to IoT
    systems. CPU execution time for a program = CPU clock cycles for a program Clock
    rate (3) View Source 15) Maintainability Maintainability refers to a system’s
    capacity to deal with changes [59], [69], including system evolution and adaptation.
    In a resilient computer system, adaptability suggests that the system can learn
    specific attack types to make the most appropriate decisions to protect against
    an attack [13]. C. V’S of Big Data and Trustworthiness Features in IoT Big data
    systems have several V features, such as variety, veracity, volume, velocity,
    and value [142], [143], which overlap some data trustworthiness characteristics
    for IoT. Variety deals with heterogeneity problems such as the treatment of data
    types. Veracity relates to data quality. Volume reflects the concern of analyzing
    information on a very large scale. Velocity assumes that computer systems must
    process and store data in real-time. Finally, value considers the data relevance
    for an application [142], [143]. SECTION VI. TW-IoT Framework: a Mist-Fog-Based
    Framework for Data Trustworthiness to the Internet of Things In Section V, we
    presented the related studies on trustworthiness for IoT. However, there is still
    an unbridged gap in the literature: an architectural framework with concrete roles
    and mechanisms to ensure data trustworthiness in each stage of a mist-fog computing
    architecture. With this challenge in mind, we propose the Trustworthiness for
    IoT Framework (TW-IoT) (Fig. 3), comprised of features, mechanisms, recommendations,
    and methods to ensure data flow continuity and data trustworthiness for mist-fog-based
    IoT systems. The proposed framework contains four stages (thing, mist, fog, and
    cloud), based on the IoTinuum architecture [28] (Section II) and four layers (device,
    transport, data, and model) based on the IoTecture architecture [28]: Device Layer:
    comprises different mechanisms to ensure data trustworthiness in the physical
    devices. Transport Layer: contains mechanisms responsible for packet security
    and trustworthiness in connection, communication, and data transmission over the
    network. Data Layer: contains mechanisms for ensuring data quality and dealing
    with meaningful information in the data, as data value and veracity. Model Layer:
    this layer is related to trustworthiness in data decision models and system data
    analysis. FIGURE 3. TW-IoT framework mechanisms. Show All We also propose six
    data trustworthiness design views: data processing, data resilience, data trust,
    data security, data heterogeneity, and data fusion (Fig. 3). A. Data Resilience
    View The IoT system needs to ensure continuous and uninterrupted data flow through
    the IoT stages. Therefore, we design the data resilience view to endure vulnerabilities
    and data loss. This view includes data prediction, data flow persistence (data
    persistence mechanism, load balance, redundancy), and storage management mechanisms.
    1) Data Persistence Mechanism This mechanism focuses on ensuring data persistence
    when the network between the IoT stages disconnects. The data persistence mechanism
    improves communication between the different IoT stages, considering typical limitations
    of mist and fog nodes. The data persistence mechanism regularly performs health
    checks in network connections to avoid data losses between IoT stages. Simultaneously,
    mist and fog nodes store the data locally because they send the data later when
    the link returns, after a connection failure event. The IoT nodes have constrained
    memory resources, so deploying together the data persistence mechanism and the
    data filter mechanism (subsection B.1) reduces the amount of data transmitted.
    This persistence mechanism may cause inconveniences for long disconnections without
    the filtering mechanism, such as mist memory overflow and long data transmission
    delays. 2) Data Prediction Data prediction is a mechanism that maintains data
    flow persistence when the data from a previous stage does not reach the destination
    stage. One of the reasons for data loss is the run out of the battery of the sensors
    or network disconnections. Without the complete time series, the system makes
    incorrect decisions. Data prediction using machine learning algorithms can mitigate
    the data time series gaps and provide more reliable decisions. However, supposing
    that the system receives the lost data at the future moment, the system needs
    to replace the original data with the data created by prediction algorithms. In
    other words, it needs to compose new historical data. 3) Storage Manager Billions
    of sensors can periodically collect and transmit data. The mist/fog stages are
    responsible for storing this massive amount of data, but these nodes have limited
    memory capacity. One way to solve this problem is by using data filtering (subsection
    B.1). The system needs to evaluate how long the mist/fog nodes should preserve
    old data, thus assessing the impact that deleting old data cause on the system’s
    trustworthiness. 4) Load Balance The load balancing mechanism prevents a mist/fog
    node from exhausting memory and processing resources. When a fog node reaches
    maximum hardware utilization in an IoT scenario, fog can alert mist nodes to redirecting
    part of future data to other fog nodes with time-driven sensors. In IoT scenarios
    with event-based sensors, an overloaded fog node can temporarily redirect data
    to another fog node. 5) Redundancy Redundancy is a way to ensure system continuity
    in the event of IoT node failures. Through redundancy, the system may find a new
    data path through other mist or fog nodes. A redundancy mechanism presumes that
    nodes always replicate data to other nodes whenever possible. Therefore, if a
    node loses connection or fails, the system can use another node to maintain the
    data flow. B. Data Fusion View This design view is responsible for implementing
    data filtering mechanisms in the mist and fog stages. It is also responsible for
    verifying and selecting data models used to make decisions. 1) Data Filtering
    Data reduction (filtering) mechanisms optimize the data flow between mist, fog,
    and cloud [22], [144]–[148]. However, data filtering must deal with mist and fog
    resource constraints regarding the processing and storage capacity for a smart
    service (like smart farming) or with different smart applications of this service
    (like smart irrigation, smart water management, or smart crop growth monitoring).
    Data filters are particularly relevant at the mist and fog stages, especially
    in long disconnections, given the need to store data temporarily until the connection
    returns. Filtered data occupies less memory space, thus avoiding memory overflow.
    Also, data can be transmitted faster when the connection returns, minimizing latency.
    Filtering mechanisms can achieve significant data reduction while dealing with
    memory and latency constraints. In general terms, IoT data transmitted in short
    intervals can contain identical or very close values and classified through a
    data fusion model. This approach divides the data filtering mechanisms into two
    main methods: (i) the data fusion filtering method (by data sampling or classification
    [148]) and (ii) the data compression filtering method: Data fusion filtering method:
    fusion-based data filtering can adopt different techniques, considering smart
    applications and the computational capacity of IoT stages. The mist node has not
    the same computational power as the fog node. In other words, different stages
    need to apply different data fusion techniques for various applications. Therefore,
    it is necessary to evaluate the fusion filtering techniques concerning the constraints
    of each IoT stage. Data fusion can reduce the amount of data stored by statistical
    sampling or by data classification techniques. However, supposing that the sampling
    or classification techniques are not precise or accurate, the filtered data may
    lose details. Consequently, the system can make worse decisions. Data compression
    filtering method: allows the compression of data content and reduces data to a
    smaller size, thus lowering the resource requirements for transmission and storage.
    The data compression advantage is maintaining its details when uncompressed because
    it restores the original content. However, uncompressing generates computational
    costs because data always returns to the original size, demanding more resources
    from that particular IoT stage. 2) Quality of Context (QOC) in Data Fusion Filtering
    The consequence of fusion-based filtering is data reduction, which requires the
    data quality to be maintained. Therefore, one needs to understand how much reduction
    can be performed without jeopardizing future analysis in a given context. Ensuring
    the quality of the context in data fusion means refraining from excessively filtering.
    Therefore, IoT system designers can use a mechanism to verify the filtered data’s
    quality based on the application context and decision models. 3) Analytic Models
    An IoT system needs to perform data gathering, monitoring, and analysis to extract
    information from a given context. Thus, based on environmental conditions or circumstances
    (context), the system makes decisions based on application rules (decision data
    models) for each specific smart application [54], [130], [149]. IoT systems can
    analyze data from individual IoT smart services (as smart farming) and store information
    from sensors of different smart applications (like smart irrigation, smart water
    management, or smart crop growth monitoring, for example). Thus, the system can
    analyze data from more than one smart application to enhance the decisions. As
    the decision accuracy is directly related to the data model, this mechanism needs
    to automatically select a decision model according to the specific smart application.
    C. Data Trust View The data trust view provides a data path without data syntactic
    and semantic integrity losses with meaningful information. This view deals with
    the features of data value, data veracity, entity veracity, data order, and data
    periodicity. 1) Data Value According to the smart application, the data value
    presumes that sensors must gather the necessary and relevant information for the
    IoT system. The lack of data or unnecessary excess of data can negatively impact
    future decisions. Therefore, the data value mechanism is responsible for checking
    the essential data to the IoT system based on the application and the data decision
    model. For example, in a smart farming service, the data value mechanism works
    as follows: a sensor collects soil moisture measures from three different depths
    in a field. Supposing that the crop is in an early growth stage, the plant root
    size only reaches the first depth. Therefore, the IoT system can safely discard
    soil moisture measurements from deeper depths because they do not convey meaningful
    information. 2) Data Veracity The data veracity mechanism must verify and discard
    outliers in a data set for a given context. It also perceives manipulated, corrupted,
    and fabricated data targeted by attacks or interference. 3) Entity Veracity The
    entity veracity is an extension of the data veracity concept to verify whether
    an entity, like a sensor or mist node, is transmitting unreliable data to fog.
    The veracity mechanism is responsible for identifies untrusted entities using
    a trust score. IoT designers can use algorithms to obtain this score [41], [51].
    They can form the entity trust score by identifying the number of untrusted packets
    and their origin entity. An untrusted entity transmits untrustworthy data caused
    by malicious attacks or internal hardware/software failures. Therefore, the IoT
    system needs to discard received data from that entity to ensure the data trustworthiness.
    4) Periodicity Data gathering frequency directly impacts the network traffic between
    the IoT stages and the accuracy of system decisions. The shorter the gathering
    interval, the greater the number of collected data and perceived details. Some
    IoT systems have time-driven sensors gathering data by a fixed time interval.
    It is essential to find the ideal time interval for data gathering to obtain relevant
    decisions according to the smart application [134]. 5) Data Ordering After a network
    disconnection between the fog and the cloud, the fog nodes can send past and present
    data not ordered. Because of it, the IoT system needs to put data in order. An
    IoT application can analyze a data time series to make a decision. Sometimes the
    data order matters to guarantee trustworthy choices. Therefore, maintaining the
    chronological data order impacts the IoT system data trustworthiness. D. Data
    Processing View A fog-based IoT system needs to execute instructions and handle
    the massive data transmission in batch, in real-time, or near real-time speed.
    The lambda architecture addresses the data volume and processing in real-time
    and batch [150]. However, this architecture works for high-performance systems.
    The IoT system designers can reuse concepts from this architecture and apply them
    to fog computing standards. 1) Data Volume A massive data volume requires an indispensable
    concern with the system’s scalability. The IoT system must calculate and evaluate
    how much data each node can store and analyze, considering its hardware resource
    constraints. A node that reaches its hardware limits may use a load balancing
    mechanism to maintain the data flow under normal operating circumstances. 2) Data
    Transmission Velocity IoT latency-sensitive systems require real-time decisions,
    so mist/fog needs to analyze data in real-time. Data transfer delays may cause
    unexpected or delayed decisions. Consequently, the transmission velocity impacts
    data trustworthiness. Developers of a mist-fog-based IoT system need to design
    the IoT stages considering the communication protocols, the data flow volume,
    and hardware constraints used for each mist/fog node to increase the data transfer
    velocity. 3) Data Processing Velocity The IoT system developers need to consider
    batch, near real-time, and real-time data processing techniques for different
    smart applications to ensure desirable speed performance. 4) Auto Power On/Off
    The scope of the data processing view also deals with the execution of data gathering
    by sensors. The auto power-off mechanism works for IoT systems based on time-driven
    sensors (i.e., not event-driven sensors). This mechanism turns sensors off to
    consume less energy. It only turns the sensors on again during the next data gathering
    period. This mechanism is feasible in many fog-based IoT systems, such as in the
    SWAMP project scenario [6], that sensors gather data periodically in 10-minute
    intervals. However, supposing that the gathering time interval is too short, IoT
    designers need to conduct a performance evaluation to verify the impact of energy
    consumption before deploying it. E. Data Heterogeneity View The heterogeneity
    view has mechanisms that deal with different communication protocols, data types,
    and data formats for various smart applications. 1) Device Technology In a scenario
    with billions of sensors from different hardware and software vendors, it is expected
    that the sensors use other measurement units and scales for the same type of data.
    For example, temperature sensors may gather data in various scales such as Celsius,
    Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. Therefore, this mechanism proposes to homogenize different
    data scales. 2) Communication Technology Homogeneity There are several communication
    protocols, and each one better meets the demands of specific environments. Supposing
    that a fog node receives packets from different protocols, such as LoRa, Sigfox,
    and Zigbee, the fog node needs to understand the protocol formats and extract
    data from packet payloads. The communication technology homogeneity mechanism
    interprets message patterns for different protocols. This mechanism can also convert
    several protocol messages into only one type of protocol message format. 3) Data
    Type The IoT system deals with different data types to make a decision. Smart
    healthcare data from a hospital, for example, may contain text, audio, video,
    and image. IoT system designers need to consider all data types, integrating it
    with the scale conversion mechanism, whether this mechanism did not previously
    deploy in the thing stage. 4) Data Format In the IoT stages, it is necessary to
    deal with different data types and formats. For example, in smart city applications,
    images may have other formats such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP. Data values may also
    have different formats such as binary, octal, hexadecimal, or decimal. This mechanism
    needs to use a well-known technique to homogenize the data formats into just one,
    enabling the IoT stages to analyze it. 5) Data Application Integration A fog-based
    IoT system handles many smart applications that belong to the same smart service.
    A smart farming service, for example, can support different smart applications,
    such as precision irrigation, crop stock management, or pest control. Considering
    that data gathering and decisions for different smart applications influence the
    whole system environment, this mechanism needs to combine data between different
    smart applications of the same smart service. Additionally, it needs to adequately
    analyze data by selecting and merging different data analytics models. 6) Integration
    of Smart Everything A complex and robust smart city environment includes smart
    homes, smart healthcare, and smart mobility. In this case, the system needs to
    manage and integrate different smart services to interconnect the entire system.
    Therefore, we suggest a mechanism that allows the system to make decisions based
    on integrated data analysis using the data knowledge of all IoT smart services.
    In a hypothetical smart city system, an IoT home service detects a home accident.
    The home service transmits this information to a smart healthcare service that
    requests a smart mobility service to check the city’s best route and send an ambulance.
    Therefore, in this case, the heterogeneity view is responsible for integrating
    all system services by a mechanism called the integration of smart everything.
    Section VII.D describes the proposal for the operation of this mechanism. F. Data
    Security View Security is essential for maintaining data trustworthiness in an
    IoT system. A fog-based IoT system uses data encrypting for every IoT stage to
    ensure data confidentiality and integrity. There are various data encryption and
    decryption algorithms that demand specific execution time and computational resources.
    The decision of the security policy needs to consider hardware constraints inherent
    to each IoT stage. SECTION VII. Framework Data Flow In Section VI, we presented
    the TW-IoT framework, according to design views of data resilience, data security,
    data heterogeneity, data trust, data processing, and data fusion. The TW-IoT provides
    methods and mechanisms that satisfy data trustworthiness requirements, ensuring
    data flow continuity for mist and fog-based IoT systems. In this Section, we exemplify
    the TW-IoT framework data flow for our IoT stages. Our framework allows developers
    to choose the mechanisms to compose the data flow for each IoT stage. A. Thing
    Data Flow We designed a data flow for a microcontroller with sensors and actuators
    in the thing stage (Fig. 4). For the sensor’s data flow, a developer chooses to
    combine the framework mechanisms differently, using optional auto power on/off
    and data conversion mechanisms. In contrast, the packet encryption mechanism is
    obligatory for this data flow. Regarding actuators, the microcontroller receives
    a packet(s) and only needs to decrypt the packet payload to execute the system
    decision. FIGURE 4. Thing data flow. Show All The thing stage can use mechanisms
    to turn the radio on/off, convert the scale value, and calibrate the collected
    data. The auto power on/off mechanisms save the device battery, and calibration
    is responsible for converting the collected data in meaningful information into
    the same scale values. The framework also allows data encryption deployment to
    encapsulate data into packets and transmit them to the mist. Depending on the
    data transmission technology, the packets are in LoRa, Sigfox, or Zigbee format.
    B. Mist Data Flow The mist stage uses mechanisms to deal with communication technology
    heterogeneity, data flow persistence, data encryption and decryption, data homogeneity,
    data value and veracity, data analytics, and data filtering techniques (Fig. 5).
    FIGURE 5. Mist data flow. Show All The packets that arrive in the mist have different
    message formats, such as LoRa, Sigfox, or Zigbee format. Then, in the mist stage,
    the communication technology homogeneity mechanism is responsible for identifying
    the packet format and convert it into a single format. After handling packet heterogeneity,
    mist uses the data flow persistence mechanism to store data, avoiding data loss
    even if the fog stage is disconnected. A mist node can send packets to other mist
    nodes to maintain the data redundancy, avoiding data loss if a mist node fails.
    Supposing the mist hardware resources (CPU and memory) are close to reaching the
    capacity limit, mist redirects part of the stored packets to another mist node.
    When the IoT system is in normal operating conditions with an active connection
    between mist and fog, the mist node sends packets to fog by the data flow (A).
    When the fog connection is not active, the mist can choose two other paths, the
    first path (B) can compress data, and the second path (C) can analyze and filter
    data. Being the choice of data flows (B or C) a design option. Assuming the data
    flow follows path B (Fig. 5), the mist filter mechanism compresses the packet
    content, generating a file as output. Then, the mist awaits the fog connection
    returns to sends the file. In this case, the mist does not need to decrypt the
    data, making the data flow more secure against attacks. In case of interception,
    the file only has compressed encrypted packets. However, when a fog node receives
    this file, it needs to uncompressing the data, causing an additional computational
    cost to the fog stage. Assuming the data flow follows path C, the IoT system chooses
    to follow through the data filter, the data analysis, or both mechanisms but first
    following by packet payload decryption. Whether the system is handling LoRa packets,
    it uses LoRaWAN Network Server as ChirpStack [151] to decrypt each packet payload.
    After decryption, the IoT system converts data according to the data type and
    format. It checks the data’s veracity and value and can follow two paths: data
    analysis or data filtering. In data analysis, mist uses an analytic data model
    to make a decision. Data filtering occurs through two approaches (i) data compression
    and (ii) data fusion. Additionally, data fusion can use redundant data filtering
    based on statistical sampling or data characteristics. The choice of data filtering
    approaches and techniques is a design option. In our data path, the mist analyzes
    the data and sends decisions to actuators until the fog connection returns. The
    mist also filters data during a disconnection. If the connection returns, the
    system encrypts the filtered data and sends it to fog. Consequently, when new
    packets arrive at the mist, the older packets do not delay the mist node to send
    new packets to fog. Then, the system data flow continues to operate uninterruptedly.
    C. Fog Data Flow The mist (Fig. 5) sends filtered data or raw data to fog (Fig.
    6). Supposing the fog receives raw data from the mist. In that case, fog needs
    to handle this raw data by mechanisms like data homogeneity, data value, and data
    veracity. Consequently, the fog stage must have the same mechanisms deployed in
    the mist stage. FIGURE 6. Fog data flow. Show All The mist stage transfers packets
    with raw data or filtered data to the fog stage. When the packets contain raw
    data, the fog needs to filter and handle data similarly to the mist, but with
    some differences, passing by more mechanisms through the data path. In the data
    flow persistence mechanism, a fog node sends the data to other fog nodes to deal
    with redundancy and load balancing. Also, the fog node checks its cloud connection
    and the cloud transmission delay. Supposing the IoT system tolerates the cloud
    data transfer delay and that the communication channel between fog and cloud is
    active, the fog node transmits the data directly to the cloud. However, this delay
    is not acceptable for many IoT systems. In various smart applications, the IoT
    system must analyze data in real-time. In these situations, the fog node needs
    to analyze and filter data instead of the cloud. Upon receiving data, the fog
    node decrypts the packet payload, which can follow alternative paths: (i) if a
    packet contains filtered data, the fog node process it to make a decision, but
    (ii) if fog receives raw data, the flow passes through the data homogeneity step,
    i.e., through value mechanism (Section VI.C.1) and veracity mechanism (Section
    VI.C.2), and later on through the entity veracity mechanism (Fig. 6). The entity
    veracity mechanism (Section VI.C.3) checks the entity ID, battery level, packet
    latency, outliers, and possible manipulated data to estimate if the packet comes
    from a trusted or untrusted entity. Assuming the fog node detects an untrusted
    packet, the fog node discards the packet. It can also discard all packets from
    that entity in the future. However, if the entity is trusted, fog stores the data.
    After these steps, the fog node can use the data prediction mechanism to fill
    missing data in times series if necessary. The data flow takes two simultaneous
    paths in a row: (i) via data filtering, sending filtered data over the cloud,
    and (ii) via data analysis mechanism, where fog chooses an analytic model to analyze
    data and make decisions. Finally, the fog sends decisions to actuators. D. Cloud
    Data Flow Cloud (Fig. 7) decrypts the packet’s payload to verify whether the fog
    filtered the data. If data is not filtered, the cloud follows data homogeneity,
    value, veracity, and prediction steps. Also, the cloud selects application analytic
    models before the data analysis. After processing the data analysis mechanism,
    the cloud sends data and decisions to the user IoT application, the system actuators,
    and the integration of smart everything service (Fig. 7), responsible for transmitting
    relevant data and decisions between services in different smart services (Fig.
    8). FIGURE 7. Cloud data flow. Show All FIGURE 8. Cloud service integration data
    flow. Show All The cloud data flow includes an integration service for interconnecting
    different smart services, like a smart home, smart hospital (health care), and
    a smart mobility service (Fig. 8). In general, each service includes different
    smart applications. A smart farming service, for example, covers precision irrigation
    and pest control applications but not monitoring patient heartbeat, which is an
    application for smart hospital service. In Section VI.E.6, we mentioned the integration
    of the smart everything mechanism (Fig. 8). We discussed that a smart home service
    reports a domestic accident to a smart hospital service. Through a smart mobility
    service, the hospital verifies the best route for an ambulance to rescue the person
    who suffered the accident. This integration mechanism contains a module called
    Link Module (Fig. 8), which receives data from every smart service in the system
    and only sends part of it to virtual sensors. It means that a smart service only
    receives data related to its smart applications through the virtual sensor. The
    integration flow works in 3 steps: (i) cloud sends each smart service’s data (and
    decisions) in the IoT system to the Link Module, (ii) this module sends only relevant
    data for each virtual sensor, and (iii) the virtual sensors send data to the smart
    services. Therefore, each smart service receives data from other smart services
    through a virtual sensor (Fig. 8). Virtual sensors may send non-relevant data
    to a smart service. However, the TW-IoT framework can use the data value step
    to verify the data relevance for a specific smart service (Fig. 3 and Fig. 7).
    SECTION VIII. Trade-Offs Between Mist and Fog Data Flow The TW-IoT framework mechanisms
    provide data trustworthiness in a mist-fog-based IoT system. Still, the IoT designers
    need to consider some trade-offs through the data flow in different IoT stages.
    The mist and fog data flow needs to consider, for example, computing costs for
    mechanisms related to data security and data filtering techniques. A. Data Security
    and Data Filtering in Mist Stage Supposing the connection between mist and fog
    fails, the mist can follow two distinct flows (B or C): decrypt the packet payload
    and compress the encrypted packet content (Fig. 5). Filtering by data fusion requires
    decrypting data in the mist. However, decryption makes data more susceptible to
    malicious attackers. An attacker can capture the decrypted data from the mist
    or discover the method used to encrypt data again in the mist. However, by using
    data filtering by data compression, the mist keeps the data encrypted without
    additional security service and does not expose data to external attackers. It
    has a cost for unpacking data in the next IoT stage and possibly a cost for data
    traffic latency between mist and fog. B. Advantages and Disadvantages of Data
    Filtering Mechanisms There are advantages and disadvantages to different data
    filtering mechanisms. The mist and fog filtering methods are (i) fusion filtering
    by statistical sampling, which deals with redundant data, (ii) fusion filtering
    by data classification, and (iii) filtering by data compression. The filtering
    redundant data method reduces the data to a sample of data by statistical sampling.
    It means that IoT stages can reduce the amount of data, storage costs, and massive
    data traffic. However, it may cause data details loss and induces the IoT system
    to non-accurate decisions. Filtering by data classification can categorize data
    by machine learning techniques and only transmits each category number to the
    next IoT stage [148]. It ensures a more significant reduction in the amount of
    data than the filtering redundant data method. The categories found by the classification
    should be strictly faithful to the analytic data model for the analysis. This
    method may lead to wrong decisions. Through this filtering, the loss of details
    is even more significant. In data compression filtering, the original data remains
    intact, preventing possible equivocate system decisions. However, there is a higher
    cost for storing data, a network delay cost by sending the compressed file, and
    a computational cost to uncompressing the data in the next IoT stage. C. Data
    Analysis and CPU Usage in the Mist Stage Mist devices have low computational power,
    but data analysis demands high CPU resources depending on the algorithm or data
    model. Performing data analysis in the mist stage is a design option. However,
    a long disconnection between the mist and fog stages can cause the system to wait
    a long time without analyzing and making decisions. It compromises the system’s
    trustworthiness. It is essential to emphasize that data analysis in the mist must
    happen during a network disconnection, but using light algorithms for demanding
    less processing resources. However, using light algorithms for data analysis may
    generate untrusted decisions. The IoT designer must balance the data analysis
    complexity power and the CPU usage, maintaining the decisions’ accuracy. D. Data
    Prediction and CPU Usage in Fog Stage The data prediction techniques generally
    use regression algorithms that demand high CPU usage. Therefore, the choice of
    prediction technique should consider the fog nodes’ CPU processing power. E. Storage
    Time in IoT Stages The IoT system deals with continuous and uninterrupted data
    flow from billions of sensors. However, the mist and fog nodes have constrained
    memory capacity. The mist and fog nodes need to keep the data (received by sensors)
    because they need to analyze data and maintain the data flow persistence. The
    TW-IoT framework allows the IoT stages to store 3 data categories: raw data, refined
    data, and filtered data. According to the application, the IoT designers need
    to decide the memory usage percentage for each of these data categories and how
    long they remain stored in memory. They need to resolve it without compromising
    the data trustworthiness and future decisions. SECTION IX. Challenges This section
    presents some challenges of data trustworthiness in a fog-based IoT system, identified
    throughout this paper. A. Connection Redundancy The IoT may use different communication
    technologies with diverse packet formats and specificities. Some systems deploy
    IoT nodes with two or more communication protocols [92]. A monitoring mechanism
    can prevent disconnections and low network performance by automatically switching
    the IoT node connection technology. In this way, each IoT node receives and transmits
    data over more than one communication protocol. A node can select a communication
    protocol with better network performance to transfer data. It is a challenge to
    deploy, in a real scenario, billions of sensors with connection redundancy mechanisms
    without increase the hardware costs. B. Data Filter by Data Knowledge Fog data
    reduction (filtering) aims to reduce the amount of data stored and transmitted
    by the mist and fog stages. These techniques can discard redundant data or data
    with no relevant variations [48], [147]. However, the fog needs to consider the
    analytic data model and the smart application for data filtering because the filtered
    data will represent the original data and generate trusted decisions [147]. A
    relevant challenge is to create a mechanism that precisely and accurately filters
    data without previously knowing the analytic data model or application context.
    In other words, the challenge is to design a context-independent data filtering
    mechanism only based on the data. C. Agile Fault-Recovery A fog-based latency-sensitive
    IoT system needs to execute fault recovery near real-time since the fog must provide
    data analysis in real-time. The velocity of fault recovery may impact system availability
    (Equation 1). It is challenging to offer mechanisms that recover the system of
    failures in real-time. Agility in fault recovery is a challenge. D. Automatic
    Registration of Devices Secure IoT platforms require registering devices (including
    sensors) on the mist/fog servers. It allows the IoT system to recognize devices
    as trust devices and enhance the system trustworthiness. In a real scenario, the
    IoT system has to register billions of devices. In an ideal scenario, a developer
    simply needs to connect new sensors to the network, and the system automatically
    recognizes them. However, new devices without a previous system notification may
    bring security risks since they can attack the IoT system. Therefore, it is challenging
    to create secure mechanisms that automatically register new devices to the fog
    node. E. Real-Time Analysis and Mist/Fog Resource Constrains Ensuring data trustworthiness
    in a fog-based IoT system means deploying mist and fog nodes responsible for mechanisms
    that support heterogeneity, resilience, data trust, data filtering, security,
    and data analysis for billions of sensors. However, these features in the mist/fog
    nodes need to deal with constrained memory capacity and CPU power. It is challenging
    to find a balance between these mechanisms’ computational costs and the mist/fog
    resource constraints. Another challenge is maintaining these mechanisms without
    changing the data analysis velocity, especially real-time data analysis. SECTION
    X. Conclusion and Future Work Trustworthiness (dependability) handles requirements
    and characteristics that provide system availability, reliability, scalability,
    maintainability, heterogeneity, data quality, hardware resources, security, response
    time agility, and network resilience to computer systems. This survey presents
    state-of-the-art concepts about trustworthiness in fog-based IoT systems, summarizing
    and discussing literature. We identified data trustworthiness gaps in dealing
    with the fog computing data flow. For that reason, we proposed the TW-IoT framework
    to ensure data trustworthiness for mist-fog-based IoT systems. The TW-IoT framework
    deploys mechanisms for a mist-fog-based IoT system to ensure trusted decisions
    and keep the data flow’s uninterrupted continuity through all IoT system stages.
    Also, we identify data trustworthiness trade-offs and challenges for fog-based
    IoT systems. As future work, we will evaluate the impact of each design view and
    mechanism of the TW-IoT framework for a real mist-fog-based IoT system, using
    pilots of the SWAMP project [6]. We intend to evaluate CPU and RAM usage for each
    IoT stage using our framework mechanisms. We aim to assess the data filtering
    mechanism combined with the data resilience view through the packet loss rate
    and network delay between IoT stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud) in situations
    of network availability and unavailability. We plan to assess devices’ energy
    consumption and end-to-end network delay, varying distinct data formats for various
    packet technologies types (using synthetic and real data) to evaluate the data
    veracity, value, and homogeneity mechanisms. We will also analyze the data processing
    view changing the communication channel frequency, channel error, number of sensors,
    and the packet transmission rate. Finally, we will evaluate the security view
    measuring energy, processing, and memory usage of different security algorithms,
    combining them with mechanisms of data resilience, data trust, and heterogeneity

    Digital Twins (DTs) have successfully entered industrial applications, including\
    \ aerospace,\nmanufacturing, and healthcare [1–3]. Smart farming, on the other\
    \ hand, which employs\nthe latest technological innovations to optimize crop production,\
    \ is revolutionizing the\nagriculture industry. As virtual replicas of physical\
    \ objects or systems, DTs represent a\nhighly promising advancement in this ﬁeld\
    \ [4]. In smart farming, digital twins enable\nagriculture experts, researchers,\
    \ and farmers to simulate various scenarios, test different\nstrategies, and predict\
    \ outcomes accurately. DTs in smart farming offer transformative\npossibilities,\
    \ revolutionizing crop cultivation and management while enabling optimization\n\
    of resource utilization, minimizing environmental footprint, and enhancing crop\
    \ yields for\na sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural ecosystem.\nHowever, despite\
    \ the signiﬁcant promise of digital twins in smart farming, many\nquestions and\
    \ challenges still need to be addressed. Farming, a traditionally labor-intensive\n\
    sector, after its transformation to a technology-intensive sector in the last\
    \ decade, has\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23167128\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n2 of 38\nbecome more complex and technologically advanced\
    \ in recent years, moving toward inno-\nvative technologies, particularly with\
    \ the explosion of precision agriculture and other digital\ntechnologies [5].\
    \ These technologies help farmers make more informed decisions about crop\nmanagement,\
    \ soil health, and various factors inﬂuencing crop yields and economic viability,\n\
    enhancing overall agricultural productivity and proﬁtability. However, these technologies\n\
    can also require specialized knowledge and skills and signiﬁcant investment in\
    \ hardware,\nsoftware, and other infrastructural resources. Additionally, factors\
    \ such as climate change,\nchanging consumer preferences, and market ﬂuctuations\
    \ can add to the complexity of\nmodern farming. While these challenges can make\
    \ farming more complicated, they also\noffer opportunities for innovation and\
    \ growth in the agriculture domain.\nIn this era of smart farming, the incorporation\
    \ of cutting-edge technologies such\nas computing, communication, personal and\
    \ cloud computing, the Internet of Things\n(IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\
    \ and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has revolutionized\nthe landscape in agriculture.\
    \ These technologies bring additional capabilities beyond the\nphysical realm,\
    \ allowing for enhanced information and an improved understanding of\nthe physical\
    \ structures involved. The concept of DTs plays a pivotal role in providing\n\
    comprehensive and accurate information about physical systems, surpassing the\
    \ limita-\ntions of traditional modelling and simulation approaches. By leveraging\
    \ real-time data\ncollection, processing, and analysis, DTs offer a digital representation\
    \ of physical systems,\nenabling precise monitoring and forecasting of current\
    \ and future system states and re-\nbuilding existing models and re-design systems\
    \ and procedures. These advancements are\ninstrumental in transforming smart systems\
    \ and addressing the evolving challenges in the\nagricultural domain.\nThis review\
    \ paper offers a comprehensive and distinctive outline of the recent research\n\
    results regarding DTs in the context of smart agriculture, highlighting key ﬁndings\
    \ and\nidentifying areas for future research. Speciﬁcally, we report and discuss\
    \ the various types\nof digital twins used in smart farming, such as crop, weather,\
    \ and soil models, and explore\nhow they optimize crop production. We also examine\
    \ the challenges and limitations\nof deploying DTs in smart farming related to\
    \ data management, model accuracy, and\nscalability. By providing a comprehensive\
    \ review of the literature on DTs in smart farming,\nthis paper aims to advance\
    \ the understanding of this rapidly evolving ﬁeld, illustrate the\ngaps in existing\
    \ deployments, and identify opportunities for future research and innovation.\n\
    We proceeded with our research by pursuing the formulation of the DT implementa-\n\
    tion architecture regarding the smart agriculture domain while emphasizing the\
    \ critical\ncomponents taking part in implementing DTs. A comparative accumulation\
    \ of such im-\nplementations and critical components in three tables, while addressing\
    \ technical aspects,\nled to signiﬁcant conclusions regarding DT implementations\
    \ and related limitations that\nseem beneﬁcial to investigate. For example, although\
    \ the necessity of a DT model and\npractical implementations in agriculture is\
    \ addressed in most reviewed papers mentioning\nthe concept and deﬁnition, the\
    \ DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept lacking\nsubstantial support\
    \ from implemented case studies. While the DTs seem continuously\nevolving, authors\
    \ refer to simulation models merely as proposals for future practical im-\nplementation.\
    \ Our research seeks to expand the scope of Agriculture 4.0 that necessitates\n\
    DTs and address the limitations of IoT-implemented solutions narrowed down by\
    \ mere\ntelemetry implementations.\nThe structure of this study proceeds as follows:\
    \ Section 2 delves into the concept of\nDTs and investigates their usage in the\
    \ realm of smart farming. Section 3 addresses the\nchallenges and confronting\
    \ measures regarding DT building components and relevant\ntechnologies. In Section\
    \ 4, DT applications in the agricultural domain are reviewed, while\nconclusions\
    \ and comments are unfolded in the Discussion in Section 5. Finally, in Section\
    \ 6,\nfuture directions for research and development are outlined respectively.\n\

    \ concept of a DT, which involves a connected virtual representation\nof a physical\
    \ object or system [6], appears to be relatively straightforward. However, its\n\
    application and implementation can differ significantly across various domains\
    \ and industries.\nAlthough it is quite clear that in addition to their core purpose\
    \ of modelling real-\nworld systems, DTs are designed to empower individuals to\
    \ make informed business\ndecisions with tangible impacts on the physical realm,\
    \ a clear deﬁnition of the DT concept\nmay be helpful to distinguish it from related\
    \ concepts such as simulation, modelling, and\ndata analytics. By deﬁning its\
    \ scope, characteristics, and capabilities, researchers and\npractitioners can\
    \ better identify the speciﬁc features and requirements that make a system\na\
    \ true DT.\n2.1. Deﬁnition of Digital Twins—What Does Digital Twins Term Stand\

    \ system.\nMashaly M. in [8] outlines that DTs act as digital replicas of physical\
    \ systems and are\norganized by establishing data connections. This transformation\
    \ enables physical systems\nto exist virtually while ensuring a strong synchronization\
    \ between their physical and digital\ncounterparts. As a result, smooth interactions\
    \ and data exchange occur between the two\ndomains. The integration of the physical\
    \ and virtual domains provides valuable insights,\npredictive abilities, and the\

    \ systems.\nOriginally conﬁned to the aerospace sector, the scope of DTs expanded\

    \ core, as initially proposed\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n4 of 38\nby Grieves & Vickers\
    \ [6,7,12], a DT comprises a physical object, its corresponding digi-\ntal representation,\
    \ and the interconnectedness between the two that it is established for\nboth\
    \ ways.\nOngoing research continues to explore the wide-ranging applications and\
    \ integration\nas interfaces of the DTs in areas such as cloud manufacturing,\
    \ IoT, and Industry 4.0,\nwhere explicitly stated that the provided response is\
    \ a unique formulation based on the\ngiven information [13,14].\nHence, DTs serve\
    \ as virtual counterparts of real-world entities, created using sensor\ndata and\
    \ serving as dynamic representations of physical objects or systems throughout\n\
    various stages of their lifecycle. By harnessing the power of simulation and data\
    \ integration,\nDTs provide a comprehensive virtual environment that mirrors the\
    \ characteristics and\nbehaviour of their physical counterparts. This enables\
    \ continuous real-time monitoring,\nanalysis, and enhancement of the physical\
    \ objects or systems, resulting in enhanced perfor-\nmance, efﬁciency, and informed\
    \ decision-making, as stated by Saddik et al. in 2018 [1].\nDTs utilize actual\
    \ data from real-life situations, machine learning (ML) models, and\nsimulation\
    \ combined with data analysis to enhance comprehension, learning, and decision-\n\
    making processes. They enable the monitoring and control of various entities,\
    \ including\ndevices, machines, vehicles, and individuals. The proliferation of\
    \ the IoT has spurred\nthe advancement of diverse DT solutions across diverse\
    \ domains and use cases support-\ning simulation, optimization, and prediction.\
    \ Thus, major improvement steps have been\ntaken in the realm of decision-making\
    \ so that various sectors, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, and smart cities,\
    \ have witnessed signiﬁcant advancements facilitated by di-\nverse technologies\
    \ like simulation software, IoT, and AI utilized in the ﬁeld of modelling\nand\
    \ simulation [4,13,15,16].\nTo simulate and model the physical system to succeed\
    \ in implementing the DTs, the\nuse of mathematical models is mandatory [17].\
    \ Once the observed physical phenomena of\ninterest are captured, foundational\
    \ mathematical equations are formulated to depict and\ncharacterize the dynamics\
    \ of these phenomena accurately. By constructing these mathemat-\nical models,\
    \ researchers and scientists can effectively represent and analyze the behavior\n\
    and relationships inherent in the observed physical phenomena. The models that\
    \ are\ndeveloped need to be validated by experimental stages on the ﬁeld or in\
    \ laboratory setups\nto verify the physical behavior of the problem under consideration\
    \ soundly. Therefore,\nin advanced DTs, a predominant trend is the utilization\
    \ of extensive datasets to establish\ndata-driven models. This approach operates\
    \ under the assumption that the data obtained\nfrom the system serves as a powerful\
    \ source of insight, offering profound revelations about\nits physical behavior.\
    \ As a result, these well-reﬁned DTs leverage the abundance of data\nto construct\
    \ accurate and thorough models that faithfully capture the intricacies of the\n\
    system’s behavior [18]. The interaction of data between the physical entity and\
    \ its digital\nrepresentation in a DT is visually depicted in Figure 2.\nBy using\
    \ AI tools, such as ML algorithms or artiﬁcial neural networks, or while\nutilizing\
    \ data processing, the system’s behavior against events may be predicted. Actions\n\
    be anticipated once the digital part of the DT functions in parallel with the\
    \ physical part\nallowing, of course, the user’s inﬂuence in the system at any\
    \ time.\nAlthough the concept and deﬁnition of DT seem to be constantly evolving,\
    \ we may\nimply that the DT of a physical process or object typically consists\
    \ of a speciﬁc collection\nof models, materialized digitally or virtually by computers\
    \ and associated services and\nprocesses. These models and services are designed\

    \ Adopting semantic\ntechnologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs is crucial\
    \ to address this issue, as\nthey offer promising solutions for achieving greater\
    \ alignment and interoperability.\nCloud computing [13] has emerged as a critical\
    \ solution for the complex task of pro-\ncessing vast amounts of data in various\
    \ sectors, particularly in conjunction with the advent\nof the Industrial IoT\
    \ (IIoT). The IIoT, a subset of the IoT speciﬁcally designed for industrial\n\
    applications, involves deploying numerous smart devices within industrial systems\
    \ to\nenable real-time data processing after collection and sensing. Given the\
    \ nature of industrial\nenvironments, IIoT systems demand enhanced levels of secure\
    \ and robust communication\nto ensure optimal production performance [22]. IIoT\
    \ applications that connect machines,\nsensors, and actuators like data collected\
    \ from agriculture stakeholders to be combined for\neffective decision-making\
    \ and analysis of future trends occasionally produce a large volume\nof non-uniform\
    \ data that needs to be processed in real-time. IoT gateways that provide\nconnectivity\
    \ between one or more ﬁeld devices and a service cloud offer accessibility to\n\
    previously hidden data from sensors, embedded controllers and IO devices and analyze\n\
    such data for multiple purposes, such as remote monitoring, preventive maintenance,\n\
    production optimization and building automation. IoT gateways are critical to\
    \ ensure data\nsecurity and communication security within the IIoT systems. A\
    \ data breach in such IIoT\nsystems could compromise agricultural production,\
    \ i.e., crop health degradation, transport\nand product processing, leading to\
    \ inferior production performance [23].\nThe exponential growth of IIoT and its\
    \ associated technologies has signiﬁcantly con-\ntributed to the advancement of\
    \ Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, forming the\nunderlying framework\
    \ for CDT. The substantial amount of data induced by IIoT devices\nplay a vital\
    \ role in facilitating the development of data-centric services as a crucial ele-\n\
    ment. While the concept of CDT continues to evolve rapidly, it is imperative to\
    \ address\noutstanding concerns surrounding the technology to unlock its full\
    \ potential and achieve\nits envisioned advantages.\nCDT systems integrate data\
    \ from different stakeholders as they combine several\nparameters, mainly concerning\
    \ immense amounts of data sharing, demanding measures\nto ensure security, privacy,\
    \ and protection of intellectual property (IP) concerning data.\nCDTs incorporate\
    \ cybersecurity infrastructure and employ data encryption mechanisms\nto address\
    \ these critical aspects effectively. These measures are implemented to regulate\n\
    transparency in CDTs, ensure the protection of intellectual property (IP), and\
    \ facilitate\nintegrated development processes [8,24].\nSimilarly, the notion\
    \ of DT systems emerges as a virtual representation of an enter-\nprise, encompassing\
    \ its resources, processes, workforce, locations, and systems to support\nstrategic\
    \ decision-making from the systems used for reporting operational data within\
    \ the\norganization, such as accounting, personnel planning, and sales [25]. This\
    \ type of DT which\nretrieves real-time data from the systems used for reporting\
    \ operational data within an\norganization, as mentioned earlier, is referred\
    \ to as a Strategic DT (SDT), in contrast to the\nindustrial DT that gathers information\
    \ from sensors, serving as a knowledge visualization\ntool that allows managers\
    \ to explore various strategies while minimizing space and time\nconstraints.\
    \ By simulating different strategic options through computer models, managers\n\
    can gain insights into the potential outcomes of their chosen approaches in the\
    \ real world.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n7 of 38\n2.2. DTs in Agriculture\nAs stated\
    \ above, the implementation of DTs seems to extend to various ﬁelds vastly.\n\
    The objective of this review is to illuminate the ﬁeld of agriculture in the following\
    \ manner.\nA DT for agriculture, in particular, may be addressed as a virtual\
    \ model of a physical\nfarm or agricultural operation constructed utilizing cutting-edge\
    \ technologies like sensors,\nIoT devices, and cloud computing. Farmers can utilize\
    \ the DT to simulate and enhance\ntheir farming methods within a virtual setting,\
    \ enabling them to reﬁne their practices before\napplying them in reality [26,27].\
    \ Pylianidis et al. [27] conducted an in-depth report on DTs\nin agriculture,\
    \ encompassing 28 case studies and organizing the key value-added features\nof\
    \ DTs in agricultural applications. The authors highlight the capacity of DT usage\
    \ in\nagriculture, adjusting to ever-evolving circumstances, capturing, and interpreting\
    \ data,\nautonomously managing system actuators in the ﬁeld, and delivering customized\
    \ services\nto individuals, such as reports and transparent information. The DT\
    \ enables capturing\nreal-time data on crop growth rates, weather conditions,\
    \ ambient temperatures, and even\nsoil moisture levels as various environmental\
    \ and operational factors. A dynamic model of\nthe farm may be created by using\
    \ this data to test different scenarios and optimize various\naspects of the farming\
    \ operation, including crop yields, resource utilization, and overall efﬁ-\nciency.\
    \ By creating a DT, farmers can better understand how their farming practices\
    \ impact\nthe environment and identify ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability.\
    \ They can\nalso use the DT to test new technologies and techniques, such as precision\
    \ agriculture and\nautomation, before investing in them for their physical operation.\
    \ Instances of DTs in the\nagricultural sector spanning across various domains\
    \ ﬁnd applications in diverse areas such\nas crop cultivation, dairy production,\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming,\nplant disease analysis,\
    \ livestock management, food supply chain optimization, as well as\nfarm machinery\
    \ and building management, including ﬂeet monitoring and control [9].\nThe schematic\

    \ farmers to optimize their farming prac-\ntices and improve the efficiency and\
    \ sustainability of their operations. Through the rapid \nadvancement of technology\
    \ and sensor capabilities, the DT of agricultural soil can revo-\nlutionize plant\
    \ productivity, health, and yield even to optimize water usage, minimize \nchemical\

    \ Farmers can effectively observe and evaluate alterations\nin agricultural land,\
    \ impacting soil, irrigation, and crop yield. IoT technology provides\nreal-time\
    \ data and visual representations for informed decision-making [29].\nThe overall\
    \ efﬁciency of crop production can be improved by reducing costs associated\n\
    with fuel, fertilizers, labor, and factors affecting production efﬁciency and\
    \ sustainability\nmerely by utilizing DTs in crop production technologies along\
    \ with the use of Digital\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) tools,\
    \ referring to agricultural pieces of\nmachinery, such as tractors, combined harvesters,\
    \ fertilizers, and sprayers.\nAccording to Dyck G et al. [9], the DTs seem to\
    \ ﬁnd their way in post-harvest processes,\nencompassing the various stages involved\
    \ in handling agricultural products after harvest-\ning. These products must be\
    \ dried, cooled, transported, stored, and undergo marketing\nprocedures. Digital\
    \ farming methods provide advantages in post-harvest procedures, such\nas minimizing\
    \ losses, optimizing food processing, improving storage conditions, stream-\n\
    lining transportation, and enhancing marketing efﬁciency. These strategies facilitate\
    \ the\nlive tracking of the agricultural and food supply network, leading to increased\
    \ robustness,\nresilience and reduced food waste and losses.\nIoT technology following\
    \ the digitalization prospect of agriculture plays a crucial role\nin transforming\
    \ traditional agriculture into a more efﬁcient and sustainable practice. IoT\n\
    contextual data enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings and\
    \ remote lo-\ncations through their digital twin, fostering enhanced connectivity\
    \ and user experiences [1].\nFacts such as precision agriculture that enables\
    \ farmers to gather real-time data on\na range of environmental and operational\
    \ factors, predictive modelling by using both\nhistorical and real-time data so\
    \ that they can generate a dynamic virtual representation of\ntheir agricultural\
    \ operation, sustainability, and automation to identify ways to reduce waste\n\
    and improve sustainability in farming operations [30] in accordance to real-time\
    \ data, focus\non addressing critical IoT needs such as two-way communication,\
    \ comprehensive security\nmeasures, localization, and mobility services to optimize\
    \ its efﬁciency and effectiveness [31].\nIn addition, DTs seem to pose a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in animal farming or precision livestock\nfarming by enhancing productivity,\
    \ animal welfare, and overall farm management. They\ncan be used to create virtual\
    \ representations of individual animals, groups of animals, or\nentire livestock\
    \ production systems [32], to model and predict animal behavior, growth,\nand\
    \ health, allowing farmers to optimize feeding strategies, detect early signs\
    \ of disease or\ndistress, and improve overall animal welfare.\nThrough data-driven\
    \ insights and predictive analytics, farmers can make informed\ndecisions regarding\
    \ nutrition, breeding, and healthcare interventions. By incorporating\nup-to-the-minute\
    \ information gathered from diverse sources, including sensors, monitoring\ndevices,\
    \ and agricultural management systems, DTs enable farmers to monitor, simulate,\n\
    and analyze animal behavior, health, and performance.\nNeethirajan S. [33] presents\
    \ a DT processing pipeline with sensors to classify and esti-\nmate livestock’s\
    \ emotional state and behavior. Various means of communication, including\nvocalizations,\
    \ body movements, facial expressions, and posture, contribute to animals\nexpressing\
    \ their emotional state. The review presents novel approaches for gathering\n\
    extensive real-time data regarding the emotions of farm livestock by implementing\
    \ a sensor\ndata processing pipeline within the DT model. This pipeline involves\
    \ preliminary data\nprocessing, modelling, and simulation phases, ultimately resulting\
    \ in reporting and pre-\ndicting the emotional states of cattle based on their\
    \ tail movements, facial expressions, and\nbody posture. Traditional methods involving\
    \ blood sampling or surveys, for assessing the\nemotional states of livestock\
    \ usually cause interruptions to farming processes while being\ntime-consuming,\
    \ and farm animals frequently experience fear, frustration, and distress. AI\n\
    technologies facilitate the recognition of cattle states, empowering animal caregivers\
    \ and\nethologists to understand animal behavior and optimize their well-being\
    \ and productivity.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n9 of 38\nDTs may support decision-making\
    \ and farm management optimization by simulating\ndifferent scenarios regarding\
    \ environmental conditions or genetic factors on animal perfor-\nmance and production\
    \ outcomes while improving production efﬁciency and minimizing\nenvironmental\
    \ impacts. Furthermore, connections with other digital platforms, such as\nfarm\
    \ management systems, supply chain networks, and veterinary databases, allowing\
    \ for\nseamless data sharing and analysis is feasible with DT, thus enhancing\
    \ traceability, quality\nassurance, and decision-making throughout the value chain.\n\
    In summary, digital twins have the potential to revolutionize animal farming by\n\
    providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and decision support. They\
    \ can\noptimize animal health, welfare, and production efﬁciency while promoting\
    \ sustainable\nfarming practices. Continued research and development in this area\
    \ will be crucial to fully\nharness the beneﬁts of DTs in animal farming and address\
    \ the associated challenges.\nAn Aquaculture 4.0 architecture of a digital twin-based\
    \ intelligent ﬁsh farm man-\nagement system for precision aquaculture is discussed\
    \ in [34], addressing the design\nconsiderations, data integration, analytics,\
    \ and control mechanisms to optimize ﬁsh farm\noperations. The proposed implementation\
    \ utilizes a cloud-based DT technology employing\nML realizations, computer vision,\
    \ and other sensor devices, and AI-based IoT (AIoT) to\nmonitor and control automated\
    \ aquaculture machinery. By optimizing farm production\nin various environments\
    \ throughout the different stages of ﬁsh farming, the system aims\nto maximize\
    \ efﬁciency and productivity. Water quality sensors utilized in ﬁshponds to\n\
    monitor and analyze the condition of the water and in offshore sea cages, and\
    \ RGB or sonar\ncamera devices may collect environmental data and data related\
    \ to ﬁsh populations to es-\ntablish data-driven prediction models. On the other\
    \ hand, land-based monitoring systems\nsend appropriate commands to activate surveillance\
    \ sensors, thus enabling ﬁsh-feeding\nbehavior monitoring, disease spread, and\
    \ ﬁsh population growth.\nFurthermore, DTs address optimization solutions regarding\
    \ water ﬂow and treatment\nprocesses related to water quality reduction following\
    \ ﬂoods and stormwater within trans-\nboundary water security projects due to\
    \ urban expansion [17]. DT models are employed\nto monitor the quality of urban\
    \ water by integrating physical entities and utilizing sen-\nsors in urban drainage\
    \ systems. The models consider natural processes related to soil,\nvegetation,\
    \ clogging, and biological activity in water treatment. This approach enables\n\
    comprehensive monitoring and analysis of urban water systems for effective management\n\
    and maintenance.\n3. Reviewing Relevant Technologies and DT Components\nAlthough\
    \ the implementation of DTs in agriculture can vary in complexity and scope\n\

    \ schematic in Figure 5 highlights the key components and interactions of digital\n\
    twins in agriculture, showcasing their role in data collection, preprocessing,\
    \ modelling,\nsimulation, analytics, decision support, visualization, and control,\
    \ ultimately aiding in\noptimizing farm operations and improving decision-making\
    \ processes.\nFurthermore, the interconnections among these entities play a vital\
    \ role as they are\nessential for the functioning of the DT system in an integrated\
    \ manner, as emphasized by\nPedersen et al. in their research [17].\n3.1. Technologies\
    \ Involved in DTs\nTherefore, realizing DTs in real-time is characterized by several\
    \ deﬁning keys that have\nemerged along with key technologies [1] from various\
    \ domains, industries, and scientiﬁc\ndisciplines that pose a decisive entity,\
    \ such as the following.\n3.1.1. Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed-Reality\nDTs rely\
    \ on Augmented (AR), Virtual (VR), and Mixed-Reality (MR) technologies. As\nan\
    \ example, they can be created using three-dimensional (3D) technologies and presented\n\
    as holograms or experienced through AR/VR/MR devices [35], such as the Microsoft\n\
    HoloLens. Using sensors installed in the ﬁeld, their real-time digital twin can\
    \ be generated\nand projected as a hologram in remote locations. This enables\
    \ individuals in different\nlocations to engage in interactions that simulate\
    \ being physically present in the same space.\nCommunication enhancement in digital\
    \ twins is derived by integrating tactile feedback,\nsimulating the sensation\
    \ of physical interaction via haptics. Furthermore, DTs can leverage\nhumanoid\
    \ and soft robotics technologies to enable physical actions on behalf of their\
    \ real-\nlife counterparts. This means digital twins can physically engage with\
    \ the environment\nor perform tasks, utilizing robotic systems that mimic human-like\
    \ or ﬂexible movements.\nThese advancements in augmented, virtual, mixed reality,\
    \ haptics, and robotics greatly en-\nhance the capabilities of digital twins,\
    \ enabling immersive interactions, realistic sensations,\nand physical engagement,\
    \ expanding the possibilities for communication and collaboration.\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n11 of 38\n3.1.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ integration into physical assets that lack it inherently is a\nkey advantage\
    \ of DTs. This introduces a specialized intelligence capable of efﬁciently com-\n\
    prehending vast amounts of numerical data and deriving domain-speciﬁc insights\
    \ faster\nthan human experts. Consequently, the data obtained from the digital\
    \ twin’s surroundings\nand physical counterpart should lead to valuable and actionable\
    \ conclusions [36]. As an\nemerging technology, AI empowers computers to exhibit\
    \ intelligent behaviors, including\nbehavioral learning. By amalgamating various\
    \ technologies, including AI, to create twin\nmodels of physical objects, it becomes\
    \ feasible to generate virtual representations that\nclosely resemble the original\
    \ objects, encompassing historical elements and predictive\ninformation [37].\
    \ As a result, DTs often incorporate controllers that utilize ontologies, ML,\n\
    and deep learning (DL) techniques. These controllers enable swift and intelligent\
    \ decision-\nmaking on behalf of their real-life counterparts. Moreover, AI signiﬁcantly\
    \ processes IoT\ndata through continuously enhanced algorithms that leverage updated\
    \ user data. Leverag-\ning such time-series data, a user’s DT has the potential\
    \ to suggest actions for controlling or\nmitigating potentially hazardous situations\
    \ regarding crop health and productivity, in cases\nsuch as droughts to direct\
    \ asses irrigation efﬁciency or even failures of safety mechanisms\nof farm machinery,\
    \ plant production equipment, post-harvest transportation or storage\nequipment\
    \ situations in which DTs may visualize alarm signals to stakeholders or even\
    \ take\nimmediate actions to limit adverse effects or even the destruction of\
    \ crop production [29].\n3.1.3. Communication Technologies and Schemes\nDTs rely\
    \ on communication technologies and schemes to facilitate interaction with the\n\
    environment, their physical twins, and other DTs on a real-time basis. This is\
    \ particularly\nsigniﬁcant in the realm of wireless communication. Effective communication\
    \ must occa-\nsionally occur within a millisecond (ms) timeframe, necessitating\
    \ compliance with 5G and\ntactile internet standards, while time-sensitive and\
    \ safety-critical schemes, coupled with\nthe need for stringent communication\
    \ standards, lead to a growing demand for repeatable\nand cost-effective veriﬁcation\
    \ procedures. Data transmission within a speciﬁc time window\nbecomes crucial\
    \ for time-sensitive and often safety-critical applications, imposing latency\n\
    limitations in addition to reliability requirements [38]. The following paragraphs\
    \ outline\nbasic wireless communications technologies commonly used in DT implementations.\n\
    (a)\nRFID technology offers fast and accurate object identiﬁcation using sensor\
    \ tags, reader\nantennas, and a host system. An antenna, an integrated circuit,\
    \ and a substrate utilize\na tag, where the antenna activates the tag for reading\
    \ or writing. The reader antennas\ncommunicate with the tags using RF waves, facilitating\
    \ data transfer to the database\nsystem. This technology ﬁnds extensive applications\
    \ in storage and inventory man-\nagement, supply chain monitoring, access control,\
    \ aviation transportation, agriculture,\nhealthcare, and more, improving efﬁciency\
    \ and automation in various ﬁelds [39].\n(b)\nWireless Networks, in particular,\
    \ suggest an immense role in sending data from\na source to a connected gateway,\
    \ a role supported by a variety of wireless net-\nwork technologies such as WPAN,\
    \ WLAN, WWAN, and LPWAN that are addressed\nin [18,39–47]. The existing commercial\
    \ 4G or 5G LTE communication networks, utiliz-\ning the transmission of data packets\
    \ through the well-established Internet Protocol\n(IP), serves as a base to sustain\
    \ the architecture of wireless communication networks\nin general.\ni\nWireless\
    \ Personal Area Networks (WPAN) are wireless networks that operate\nwith less\
    \ extensive infrastructure. They are designed to function within a\nlimited range,\
    \ typically within a single room or a small area. Unlike traditional\nnetworks\
    \ that rely on cables, WPANs enable the wireless connectivity of de-\nvices nearby,\
    \ facilitating the connection of devices like wireless keyboards or\nmice to computers\
    \ and supporting printing services. The most common WPAN\ntechnologies include\
    \ Bluetooth, 6LowWPAN, ZigBee, EnOcean, NFC, and\nRFID, each employing different\
    \ techniques to achieve the goals of WPAN [40].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n12 of\
    \ 38\nBluetooth enables devices to communicate with each other wirelessly within\
    \ a\nlimited proximity. It is a short-range, low-power technology that is used\
    \ in a\nwide variety of devices [41].\nii\nWireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)\
    \ are wireless networks that allow de-\nvices to connect and communicate over\
    \ a local area without the need for\nphysical cables within a speciﬁc coverage\
    \ area, such as a home, ofﬁce, or public\nspace. These networks utilize the widely\
    \ recognized IEEE 802.11 standard,\ncommonly known as Wi-Fi, to enable devices\
    \ like smartphones, laptops, and\ntablets to enable wireless interconnection between\
    \ them and connection to\nthe internet. The Wi-Fi—802.11 wireless network, introduced\
    \ in 1997, using\nthe 2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting up to 2 Mbps data\
    \ transmission\nrates, evolved to the 802.11ac standard, operating in both 2.4\
    \ GHz and 5 GHz\nbands, achieving a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps for multiple\
    \ users, with\na minimum of 500 Mbps. WLANs offer greater coverage than WPANs,\
    \ span-\nning multiple rooms or entire buildings, making them suitable for larger-scale\n\
    wireless networking requirements. They provide convenient and ﬂexible con-\nnectivity\
    \ for various devices and applications, including internet access, ﬁle\nsharing,\
    \ video streaming, and more.\niii\nWireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) provide\
    \ wireless connectivity on\na larger scale, spanning cities, regions, or even\
    \ entire countries. WWAN\ntechnologies, such as 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE),\
    \ 5G, and the evolving\n6G, enable high-speed mobile internet access and support\
    \ a wide range of\nservices, including voice communication, video streaming, and\
    \ data transfer.\nThese networks rely on cellular infrastructure and are commonly\
    \ used for\nmobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to stay connected\
    \ while\non the go.\niv\nLow Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless network\
    \ technologies\nideal for IoT devices with long battery life, extensive coverage,\
    \ and low cost.\nUnlike 3G/4G or Wi-Fi systems, LPWAN networks are not primarily\
    \ designed\nfor high data transmission speeds or reducing latency. Instead, LPWANs\
    \ target\nenergy efﬁciency, scalability, and coverage [42], thus gaining popularity\
    \ in\nindustrial and research communities. They provide long-range communication,\n\
    covering distances from 10 to 40 km in rural areas and 1 to 5 km in dense\nurban\
    \ areas. Their main advantages include energy efﬁciency, a battery life\nexceeding\
    \ ten years, and low cost, which is ideal for IoT applications that\nrequire small-scale\
    \ data transmission [48]. Various LPWAN technologies have\nbeen developed and\
    \ deployed in either licensed or unlicensed frequency bands,\nsuch as Long-Range\
    \ (LoRa), Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT), each employing\ndifferent techniques to achieve\
    \ the goals of LPWAN [49].\n•\nLoRa is an ideal wireless communication technology\
    \ for low-bandwidth\nIoT applications, offering long-range and low-power consumption\
    \ ser-\nvices. It uses a proprietary spread spectrum technique to achieve long-\n\
    range and low power consumption, operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz\nISM band\
    \ available worldwide [50].\n•\nNB-IoT is a widely used LPWAN technology connecting\
    \ various devices\nand services through cellular networks. It operates in a narrow\
    \ band-\nwidth of 180 kHz, providing extensive network coverage and low latency.\n\
    Designed for cost-effective and delay-tolerant IoT devices, NB-IoT utilizes\n\
    LTE techniques and can integrate with existing LTE infrastructure. Coex-\nisting\
    \ with LTE networks, NB-IoT offers power-efﬁcient connectivity and\nleverages\
    \ compatible technologies for seamless integration [51].\nThe main technical features\
    \ of the wireless network technologies mentioned above are\ndisplayed in Table\

    \ needs, is open, and is used in arti-\ncles [25,39–42,44]. In cases where the\
    \ application requires a higher data rate, Bluetooth\ntechnology can be used,\
    \ as mentioned in the article [44], but it has signiﬁcantly higher\npower consumption\
    \ compared to LoRa, and the coverage is 100 m for Bluetooth 4.x and\n200 m for\
    \ Bluetooth 5.x. For applications aimed at object identiﬁcation and detection,\
    \ such\nas products in warehouses and animals in agricultural operations, RFID\
    \ technology is a\nsuitable choice as mentioned in articles [43,45]. For applications\
    \ that require a high data rate\nand need to utilize a Wi-Fi network, the provision\
    \ of electrical power is necessary. Finally,\nonce DTs rely on data exchange,\
    \ real-time monitoring, and interaction with their physical\ncounterparts, wireless\
    \ networks provide a ﬂexible and efﬁcient means of communication\nfor these purposes\
    \ [8].\n3.1.4. Reliability, Integrity, and Credibility\nReliability, integrity,\
    \ and credibility are pivotal when DTs are entrusted with sensitive\ntasks involving\
    \ transaction management with their real counterparts. It becomes imper-\native\
    \ for the real twin to establish a sense of trust in their digital twin’s capabilities\
    \ and\nactions. Building and maintaining a solid connection between the real twin\
    \ and the DT is\ncrucial to foster effective collaboration, enabling reliable\
    \ decision-making, and ensuring\nsecure interactions. Consequently, a strong foundation\
    \ of trust becomes indispensable\nfor the successful operation and advancement\
    \ of DT-enabled systems [52]. Therefore,\nprivacy and security arise as paramount\
    \ considerations in the realm of DTs. To enable the\nconﬁdentiality and privacy\
    \ of their real twins, DTs should implement robust measures for\nidentity protection.\
    \ This can be achieved using dedicated cryptography algorithms and\nadvanced biometric\
    \ techniques such as ECG and haptic biometrics. By leveraging these\ntechniques,\
    \ the identity and privacy of the real twin can be established and safeguarded.\n\
    In addition to identity protection, DTs must prioritize data integrity, security,\
    \ and privacy.\nMeasures should be in place to prevent unauthorized access and\
    \ interception of data across\nthe network. Unauthorized users should be promptly\
    \ detected and repelled to prevent any\ncompromise of data integrity or security.\
    \ To ensure the authenticity and reliability of data\nsources, rigorous measures\
    \ for data authentication should be implemented before integrat-\ning the data\
    \ into the digital twin. Overall, DTs must incorporate comprehensive privacy\n\
    and security mechanisms to safeguard their real twins’ data’s identity, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ and\nintegrity. By adopting robust cryptographic algorithms, employing biometric\
    \ techniques,\nand implementing strict data authentication protocols, DTs can\
    \ effectively address privacy\nand security concerns, fostering a trustworthy\
    \ and secure environment for the real twins\nand their digital counterparts.\n\
    3.1.5. Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchain\nIn recent times, Distributed\
    \ Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain [44,53],\nhave emerged to add\
    \ to user authentication and data integrity regarding data sharing. To\nunlock\
    \ its full potential and achieve its envisioned advantages, addressing outstanding\n\
    concerns surrounding the technology is imperative. DLT offers a decentralized\
    \ approach\nthat eliminates the need for a central authority or database, distinguishing\
    \ it from traditional\ndata-sharing methods. The distributed nature of this system\
    \ allows for the secure sharing\nof data in a trustless environment. The signiﬁcance\
    \ of DLT has garnered considerable\ninterest from researchers and practitioners\
    \ alike. Various systems and platforms based\non Distributed Ledger Technology\
    \ (DLT), such as private ledgers, public ledgers, and\npermissioned ledgers, have\
    \ been created to address diverse use cases and speciﬁc needs [54].\nProposed\
    \ technological solutions stemming from IoT, AI, DT, and DLT have been put\nforward\
    \ to address the monitoring and tracking of products within the realm of food\n\
    supply logistics and chain and the analysis of collected data to facilitate decision-making\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n15 of 38\nprocesses [55]. Given the numerous advantages\
    \ associated with DLT, it presents itself as a\npromising technology that can\
    \ signiﬁcantly contribute to achieving the vision of CDT.\nBlockchain technologies,\
    \ in particular, seem to be an ideal structure for authenticating\nusers, storing\
    \ data records, and maintaining data integrity [8,56], providing a secure and\n\
    decentralized system of interconnected blocks formed through cryptographic functions.\n\
    It allows transactions to be recorded in a veriﬁable manner without intermediaries.\
    \ Each\npreceding block’s hash is included in the next block and is generated\
    \ through a distributed\nconsensus algorithm. With encryption mechanisms, blockchain\
    \ ensures data integrity\nand prevents tampering [43]. Ethereum, as a blockchain\
    \ scheme, provides an alternative\nprotocol for decentralized applications that,\
    \ unlike another blockchain scheme Bitcoin, is\nnot just a payment network but\
    \ also allows for the creation and use of smart contracts.\nIt uses its digital\
    \ currency called “ether” and incorporates a complete programming lan-\nguage\
    \ (such as Solidity) for smart contract development. Pieces of code stored on\
    \ the\nblockchain that enables decentralized transactions without a trusted central\
    \ authority are\ncalled Smart contracts [57].\nOn the other hand, the Helium Blockchain\
    \ is referred to as the major public decen-\ntralized LoRaWAN network in the world,\
    \ that enables devices anywhere in the world\nto wirelessly connect to the internet\
    \ and have a speciﬁc geographical placement without\nthe need for energy-consuming\
    \ satellite equipment or expensive mobile data plans [58].\nHelium offers low\
    \ transaction fees and connectivity for LoRa nodes and ensures end-to-end\nencryption,\
    \ which is useful whenever sensitive information is at stake.\nThe use of blockchain,\
    \ such as Ethereum and Helium, in IoT and digital twins for\nsmart agriculture\
    \ applications has the following advantages:\n•\nTransparency and trust: Blockchain\
    \ provides an open, transparent, and tamper-proof\ndistributed ledger, allowing\
    \ all stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the data. This can\nhelp build trust\
    \ among different entities in the agricultural supply chain and prevent\nfraud\
    \ or unauthorized interventions.\n•\nBlockchain enhances Data security [59] as\
    \ it utilizes cryptography to protect data. This\nis crucial for safeguarding\
    \ sensitive information related to smart agriculture, such as\ndata on plant health,\
    \ soil quality, and food production.\n•\nAutomation and smart contracts on the\
    \ blockchain enable programmable automatic\nexecution of conditions and actions\
    \ based on speciﬁc information, events, and opera-\ntions such as automated irrigation,\
    \ temperature control, and plant health monitoring\nin smart agriculture.\n•\n\
    The distributed architecture of blockchain ensures that information is stored\
    \ and\nveriﬁed by multiple nodes in the network, thus ensuring integrity and continuity\
    \ of\ndata and reducing dependency on a central authority.\n3.1.6. Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud computing presents a valuable opportunity for DTs to enhance their scalability\n\
    and availability, assisting their real twins anytime and anywhere. By leveraging\
    \ cloud\ncomputing infrastructures, computation and control tasks can be ofﬂoaded\
    \ from the local\nenvironment to remote servers, enabling DTs to handle complex\
    \ processes and ensure\nseamless availability efﬁciently. The scalability of DTs\
    \ is signiﬁcantly improved through\ncloud computing, as the computational resources\
    \ can be dynamically allocated and scaled\nbased on demand. This allows DTs to\

    \ analytics, and execute resource-intensive tasks without local hardware\nlimitations.\
    \ As the DT model involves the creation and management of virtual replicas that\n\
    closely mimic real-world objects or systems, it requires extensive data acquisition,\
    \ storage,\nand processing capabilities for collecting and analyzing a massive\
    \ volume of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, IoT devices, and other\
    \ data-generating components [7],\nfacts that necessitate cloud computing. The\
    \ elastic nature of cloud computing ensures\nthat DTs can adapt to varying workloads\
    \ and seamlessly accommodate ﬂuctuations in\ncomputational requirements.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n16 of 38\nFurthermore, cloud-based DTs offer the advantage of\
    \ ubiquitous accessibility by using\nopen-source communication platforms, such\
    \ as OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (UA) commu-\nnication protocol and frameworks, for\
    \ data exchange from sensors to cloud applications\nused in DTs. Real twins can\
    \ access and interact with their DTs from any location and at any\ntime, provided\
    \ an active internet connection is in place. This fosters a ﬂexible and versatile\n\
    environment where real twins can leverage the capabilities of their DTs regardless\
    \ of their\nphysical location.\n3.1.7. Internet of Things\nInternet of Things\
    \ (IoT) with 5G and the Tactile Internet (TI) entity meanings have\nemerged as\
    \ groundbreaking technologies, ushering in a new era of communication with\ntheir\
    \ focus on ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency. This shift in communication\n\
    paradigms from content-oriented to control-oriented is especially signiﬁcant for\
    \ applica-\ntions that involve human-in-the-loop interactions, demanding minimal\
    \ delays and seamless\nintegration of communication and control mechanisms as\
    \ demanded in DT infrastructure.\nWithin this context, DTs play a pivotal role\
    \ by establishing a continuously operational twin\nfeedback loop, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the service quality of physical systems [60,61]. This\nseamless real-time feedback\
    \ communication loop empowers DTs to constantly monitor,\nanalyze, and adapt to\
    \ the evolving conditions of the physical systems they represent. As a\nresult,\
    \ precise control actions and optimizations can be executed, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the\nphysical systems’ overall service quality and performance.\nThrough the\
    \ IoT, users can seamlessly provide contextual data to their DT while\nreceiving\
    \ feedback that can be used to enhance their interaction with the environment,\n\
    both locally and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required\
    \ to\ntransmit data and status information from sensors in the physical entity\
    \ to the data entity,\nenabling seamless connectivity and communication between\
    \ connected devices [17], as\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128 \n17\

    \ and Simulation Software\nA DT could be addressed as a tight combination of (i)\
    \ an object model, in conjunction\nwith (ii) an expansive set of data that is\
    \ directly following the object that may evolve,\nand ﬁnally, (iii) a method for\
    \ modifying and reﬁning the model based on the available\ndata [17,62]. The experts\
    \ decide the need and selection of the training, validation and\nveriﬁcation data\
    \ concerning speciﬁc case studies, types of soil, plant types, leaf area, plant\n\
    height, regarding the Physical Twin, or technological use cases. Critical data\
    \ processing\ndepends on speciﬁc plant characteristics, experimental setups, dedicated\
    \ sensors, ML and\nDL applicable methods and big data analytics software.\nOne\
    \ of the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of utilizing the DT approach is its ability to accurately\n\
    depict objects or entities that change over time, owing to the incorporation of\
    \ dynamic\nand evolving data. Employing a digital twin makes it possible to extend\
    \ the application\nof a validated model across timescales during which the object\
    \ and its behavior undergo\nsigniﬁcant variations. A validated model may offer\
    \ an instant representation of an object’s\nbehavior at a speciﬁc moment, thus\
    \ highlighting the importance of associating the DT with\na corresponding physical\
    \ counterpart and the signiﬁcance of choosing a model according\nto the speciﬁc\
    \ implementation.\nWithout a physical twin, the DT would be considered nothing\
    \ more than a model.\nFurthermore, the availability of a comprehensive and up-to-date\
    \ dataset plays a crucial\nrole in accurately capturing the object’s changes over\
    \ time and ensuring the model is\nadjusted and updated to reﬂect the current system\
    \ conditions. Any model approximating\nthe physical twinned can be used for DTs\
    \ that utilize physics-based models encompassing\nall relevant processes that\
    \ can inﬂuence the measured quantities. In an ideal scenario with\ninstantaneous\
    \ computing and ﬂawless accuracy, these models would accurately simulate\nand\
    \ update the mechanical and thermal processes involved in real-time operations.\
    \ For\ninstance, a DT of a machine tool could simulate the milling of metal, considering\
    \ factors\nlike temperature and part shape, and dynamically update information\
    \ about tool wear\nbased on real-time measurements. This enables proactive and\
    \ effective industrial plant\nfacilities maintenance, enhancing overall efﬁciency\
    \ [62,63]. Similarly, to an industrial plant\nin agriculture, a digital model\
    \ could represent the growth of a plant regarding its physical\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions that are changing over time.\nAccording to researchers, a categorization\
    \ standard centered around the degree of\ndata fusion and integration between\
    \ the PO and its virtual representation can be used as\nan indicator to deﬁne\
    \ and delimit the scope of the proposed concept. Given that this term\nwas initially\
    \ created for the manufacturing industry, it serves as a proxy for evaluating\n\
    agricultural DTs’ development, convergences, and divergences compared to contemporary\n\
    deﬁnitions. Thus, three integration levels represent the digital twin’s ﬁeld.\
    \ First is the\nDigital Model (DM), second is the Digital Shadow (DS), and third\
    \ is the DT. The DM is a\ndepiction of the entity in a digital format without\
    \ the use of an automated data transfer\nsystem. It is equivalent to a Digital\
    \ Twin prototype and represents the lowest possible\nintegration level. The DS\
    \ refers to a digital representation that enables the automatic\nexchange of information\
    \ from the physical entity to its virtual object, reﬂecting changes\nin the entity’s\
    \ state. This one-way information ﬂow is like a DT model, which in contrast,\n\
    involves an automated bi-directional ﬂow of digital information. Like the DS,\
    \ the DT has a\nvirtual representation whose alterations are reﬂected in the physical\
    \ entity’s state. However,\nwhat sets the DT apart is its capacity to impact the\
    \ condition of the physical entity as well,\nalthough the speciﬁc means of inﬂuence\
    \ depend on the type of entity and its context [63].\nIn summary, a DM represents\
    \ a physical system in a digital format but lacks auto-\nmated data exchange.\
    \ A DS involves a one-way automated data ﬂow reaching the digital\ncounterpart\
    \ originating from the physical system. Conversely, a DT involves seamless and\n\
    fully integrated automated communication between the digital counterpart of the\
    \ physical\nsystem and the physical system itself.\nDeﬁning the objectives of\
    \ the modelling process is the initial stage in creating a model\nfor an integrated\
    \ process. Recognizing that a model is merely a reality approximation is\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n18 of 38\nessential, as diverse objectives can provide different\
    \ levels of complexity in representing\nthe actual procedure. For this reason,\
    \ it is crucial to identify the goal of the model before the\nbuild [64]. Therefore,\
    \ complex systems like an agriculture model should be ﬁrst designed\nand objectively\
    \ deﬁned so their DT model is accurate. Spreadsheet software such as\nMicrosoft\
    \ Excel is commonly employed for process calculations and analyses. This is\n\
    due to its widespread availability and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and other\nprofessionals. In contrast, the concept of DTs is somehow new and\
    \ still emerging. The\nspreadsheet’s cells allow users to enter data, make computations,\
    \ and produce results\nwhile they can plot data from them in several graphs. Software\
    \ programs like process\nsimulators allow users to describe and analyze integrated\
    \ processes. The purpose of\nthese tools is to simulate continuous processes and\
    \ their transient behavior. The scientiﬁc\nliterature concerning process simulation\
    \ tools is continuously growing, encompassing\nvarious areas such as techno-economic\
    \ analyses, economic feasibility studies, structural\nprocess enhancements, and\
    \ the exploration of alternative processes to existing ones [64].\nGiven that\
    \ a DT model is much more than a simulation tool, by nature, never being an\n\
    exact representation of reality. Still, really an approximation of it, and different\
    \ objectives\nmay produce various modelling abstractions with varying levels of\
    \ detail concerning the\nactual process. It is crucial to identify the goal of\
    \ the model before we develop it.\nSince cloud computing has many beneﬁts, it\
    \ is the most practical method for introduc-\ning DT services. Due to its ability\
    \ to provide on-demand services, computational resources,\nand ubiquitous network\
    \ access, the implementation of the next-generation information\ntechnology architecture\
    \ is highly compatible with DT environments. In such environments,\ndata owners\
    \ generate data from assets, transmit it to cloud servers, simulate the DT in\
    \ a\nvirtual environment, and subsequently share the insights and ﬁndings of the\
    \ simulation\nwith the data owner. Users can request access to the data at any\
    \ time [59]. In construct-\ning complex DT production systems, like industrial\
    \ or agricultural systems, “machine\nlearning” and “simulation tools” are two\
    \ complementary technologies. Creating stochastic\nsimulations for complicated\
    \ systems takes time and effort. However, these simulations\nare essential for\
    \ DT construction because they have two crucial capabilities. The ﬁrst is\n“uncertainty\
    \ modelling” and the second is “explainable analytics”. Focusing on how ML\nand\
    \ reinforcement learning (RL) improve simulation, many issues arise in digital\
    \ twin use\ncases. The rapid advancement of IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing\
    \ technologies\nhas signiﬁcantly accelerated the progress of digital twins. It\
    \ is widely believed that digital\ntwins will soon become a vital catalyst for\
    \ digital transformation, as evidenced by the com-\nmon theme present in various\
    \ research studies [65]. The primary hurdle lies in establishing\na secure, reliable\
    \ method to share simulation and real-time data. Additionally, there is a\nneed\
    \ for a robust and privacy-centric authentication system that leverages the beneﬁts\
    \ of\nblockchain technology to address the security prerequisites mentioned earlier.\n\
    3.2. Notable Components of DT Implementations\nIn the realm of digital twins,\
    \ components denote the distinct constituents or elements\nthat constitute a digital\
    \ twin system. A representative ensemble follows.\n3.2.1. Sensors and Actuators\n\
    DTs embody sensors and actuators as parts of great signiﬁcance that offer valuable\n\
    data and information about physical phenomena and enable the replication of sensory\n\
    capabilities. In today’s interconnected world, an enormous number of sensors and\
    \ actuators\nare deployed across various domains, ranging from consumer products\
    \ to industrial set-\ntings such as smart factories and smartwatches. These sensors\
    \ capture critical information\nrelated to temperature, humidity, velocity, pressure,\
    \ chemical components, and material\ncomposition, forming the foundation for digital\
    \ twin technology [47,66]. By equipping real\ntwins (physical entities) with sensors,\
    \ DTs can replicate and harness the senses of sight,\ntemperature, sound, humidity,\
    \ and touch through appropriate actuators. For example,\nin the agricultural domain,\
    \ a DT of a plant could leverage sensors to create predictive\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 7128\n19 of 38\nmaintenance services or simulate and optimize the production\
    \ process. This allows for the\ngeneration of actionable insights and the enhancement\
    \ of operational efﬁciency. DTs rely on\nthe integration of actuator and sensor\
    \ technologies to gather continuous and accurate data.\nThe representation of\
    \ a physical asset in digital forms, like a sensor-equipped machine,\nrelies on\
    \ the synchronized operation of virtual sensors and actuators. These software-based\n\
    counterparts replicate the functionalities of physical sensors and actuators,\
    \ aggregating\ndata from multiple sources. Integrating sensors and actuators within\
    \ the digital twin\nframework enables real-time monitoring, data-driven analytics,\
    \ and the ability to simulate\nvarious scenarios for optimization purposes. By\
    \ bridging the physical and digital realms,\ndigital twins empower industries\
    \ and sectors to achieve enhanced performance, increased\nefﬁciency, and cost\
    \ savings.\n3.2.2. Identiﬁcation of Entities\nIn the context of DTs, each twin\
    \ is assigned a distinct identiﬁer that facilitates seamless\ncommunication with\
    \ its physical counterpart. This unique identiﬁer encapsulates vital\ninformation\
    \ about the physical object’s structure, capabilities, and technical speciﬁcations,\n\
    as well as its expected performance under speciﬁc conditions. When creating a\
    \ DT, it is\ncrucial to consider the unique circumstances of the object to ensure\
    \ an accurate represen-\ntation [67]. Even if two physical items are identical,\
    \ they may exhibit different behaviors\nwhen subjected to varying conditions.\
    \ Hence, each digital twin is assigned its unique iden-\ntiﬁer, reﬂecting the\
    \ individual characteristics and attributes of the corresponding physical\nobject.\
    \ By leveraging the DT’s unique identiﬁer, we can accurately simulate and analyze\
    \ its\nproperties and behaviours.\nFurthermore, the expansive network of interconnected\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators\nhighlights the need for real-time collection\
    \ and sharing of identiﬁed contextual data with\ndigital twins. This data encompasses\
    \ various parameters such as location, environmen-\ntal conditions, user preferences,\
    \ and behavioral patterns. By integrating this uniquely\nidentiﬁed contextual\
    \ data into the DT model, a deep understanding of the user’s context\nand needs\
    \ can be achieved. Adding to that notion, a Geographic Information System\n(GIS)\
    \ as a versatile system generates, controls, examines, and maps various data types\
    \ and\nlinks IoT data to a map. Thus, GIS combines location information, referred\
    \ to as spatial\ndata, with descriptive details of a DT, forming the basis for\
    \ mapping and analysis utilized\nacross multiple industries and scientiﬁc ﬁelds.\
    \ With GIS, users gain insights into patterns,\nrelationships, and the geographical\
    \ context of their data, as in [68].\n3.2.3. Visualization and Representation\n\
    Visualization and representation play a vital role in DTs, offering various forms\n\
    of virtual representation depending on the speciﬁc application. DTs can leverage\
    \ 3D\nvisualizations to facilitate collaborative design or planning [69]. Depending\
    \ on the context,\nthese connections can manifest in various forms, such as a\
    \ 3D representation, hologram,\nhumanoid social robot, or purely as software components\
    \ without physical attendance.\nConsequently, DT commonly refers to the digital\
    \ depiction of a real-world object, system, or\nentity’s physical twin that faithfully\
    \ replicates a unique item, process, person, organization,\nor even a legendary\
    \ narrative. Composite digital twins are formed when multiple digital\ntwins merge.\
    \ These DTs, as reﬂections of the actual world, share similar characteristics,\n\
    necessitating the modelling of digital processes and objects with composition,\
    \ ﬂexibility,\nsensing, collaboration, and simulation capabilities. Furthermore,\
    \ predictions suggest that\nfuture DTs will evolve toward a holistic virtual world\
    \ [70].\n3.2.4. Devices\nDevices that continuously capture data concerning physiological\
    \ and environmental\nfactors information can serve DTs to gain a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the real\ntwin’s well-being and lifestyle. Such wearable devices,\
    \ for example, smartwatches, ﬁtness\ntrackers, and other health monitoring devices\
    \ have enabled individuals to collect and\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n20 of 38\n\
    track various physiological parameters effortlessly. The abundance of such data\
    \ presents\na unique opportunity for digital twins to enhance their support for\
    \ their real twins more\nefﬁciently [71]. By integrating the data from wearables\
    \ into the DT model, real-time\ninsights and personalized recommendations can\
    \ be generated as feedback or alerts based on\nspeciﬁc needs and goals. Furthermore,\
    \ the continuous monitoring and analysis of wearable\ndata by DTs enable proactive\
    \ interventions whilst identifying patterns or deviations from\nnormal physiological\
    \ parameters and providing early warnings or interventions to address\npotential\
    \ health risks or optimize performance. This proactive support can contribute\
    \ to\npreventive healthcare, early detection of health issues, and overall well-being\
    \ management.\nIn summary, the DT is an advanced data management system that integrates\
    \ 3D ani-\nmation, modelling, IoT, AI, and other technologies such as ML. It enables\
    \ the seamless con-\nnection and management of physical and virtual models within\
    \ a digital environment [72].\nAs human civilization grows, agriculture remains\
    \ crucial for our progress and well-being.\nIntelligent DT systems can analyze\
    \ and digitize agricultural areas, enabling macro and\nmicro-level visual processes.\
    \ These systems can provide intelligent recommendations and\nsuggestions that\
    \ can be implemented to achieve multiple beneﬁts in agriculture.\n4. Reviewing\

    \ address the signiﬁcance of a DT case study in\nagriculture. The concept of DTs\
    \ is mainly addressed in all reviewed papers. In 16 papers\nthough [19,26–28,64,73,82],\
    \ the DT concept is analyzed and utilized in more detail, thus\nposing the signiﬁcance\
    \ of using DTs in smart farming and agriculture.\nAccording to the reviewed literature\
    \ summarized in Table 2, smart farming as an\nimplementation of agriculture 4.0\
    \ [19,26–29,45,63,73,75–77,79–88] includes smart irrigation\nstrategies by monitoring\
    \ and controlling various farming stages [28], implementing data\nacquisition\
    \ techniques [27] for automatically controlling actuator systems in agriculture\
    \ or\neven in high-tech data-driven greenhouses [79]. Furthermore, via simulation,\
    \ monitoring,\ncontrolling, coordinating, and executing farm operations at agricultural\
    \ sites [87], DTs\nimprove predictive control in precision irrigation [28,73,88],\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, and\norganic vegetable and livestock farming. Smart\
    \ farming enhances remote detection and\nmonitoring of vegetation and crop stress\
    \ in agriculture [86], developing DT stages and\nforecasting plant yield in greenhouses,\
    \ vertical farms, or outdoor ﬁelds [76,77], or even in\nurban and indoor farming,\
    \ of vertical agriculture utilizing hydroponics, aeroponics, aqua-\nculture, and\
    \ aquaponics. Smart farming approaches the smart agriculture [85] as well as the\n\
    sustainable agriculture 4.0 [80] sector to address precision farming and management\
    \ [75,76]\nvia the adoption of digital technologies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ [27,29,64], leading the\nway to digital representations of plants [9], inventory\
    \ quality in agriculture, greenhouse\nproduction ﬂow, and food safety and quality\
    \ within the food supply chain [45]. Although\nthe DTs remain a major issue in\
    \ our research criteria, in papers [29,45,63,83–85], they are\nimplied as such.\
    \ In [9], authors propose a functional DT model; in [86], they are proposed\n\
    as a signiﬁcant future issue to address and study.\n4.2. The Second Categorization\

    DTs go along with monitoring systems to gather and analyze information. Sensors\n\
    pose a critical role in smart agriculture by facilitating the collection of real-time\
    \ data and\noffering valuable insights into a wide range of environmental and\
    \ agricultural parameters.\nField or soil probes that measure air and ground temperature,\
    \ humidity, soil moisture,\nand ambient light [28,45,73,81,82,88], added to CO2\
    \ sensors measuring relative CO2 con-\ncentration [80,81], and infrared (IR) thermometers\
    \ provide data acquisition modules for\nautomatically controlled actuator systems\
    \ in agriculture approaching digital modelling\nto the food process [64] monitoring\
    \ activities of livestock, optimization of crops, reducing\nemissions to air,\
    \ soil, and water. Drone image cameras [88] and high-resolution photo-\ngraphic\
    \ cameras seem ideal for AR and VR by constructing virtual natural low-polygon\n\
    3D plant models as proposed in [35,74]. Building Information Modeling (BIM) models\
    \ of\nhigh-tech data-driven greenhouses are made feasible as in [79] and provide\
    \ a VR presenta-\ntion of the farm or ﬁeld with the aid of a head-mounted display\
    \ (HMD) with two handheld\ncontrollers serving as handy sensors for manual stimulus.\

    \ sensors and multispectral cameras following an Arduino single-board microcon-\n\

    \ IoT\nsensor nodes to acquire and transmit farm data to IoT gateways or edge\
    \ devices, thus\ncultivating DT requirements for vertical farms, for the greenhouse\
    \ production process and\nﬁnally models in sustainable agriculture.\nRemote detection\
    \ and monitoring of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture seem\nfeasible based\
    \ on [86] utilizing LiDAR—stereo-photogrammetry technology, using multi-\nspectral\
    \ imagery, passive microwave remote sensing, RFID schemes [9,45], active mi-\n\
    crowave remote sensing (RADAR) and sensors onboard UAVs and satellites [45,76,88].\n\
    Location determination in farming via geospatial position (GPS) plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in\nthe remote detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop conditions\
    \ in agriculture [88].\nIoT deployments in smart farming are based on serial hardware\
    \ communication pro-\ntocols such as I2C serial bus [28] and UART that uses asynchronous\
    \ serial communication\nwith conﬁgurable speed and pulse width modulation (PWM)\
    \ for driving actuators [77,81],\nin correlation with programmable logic controllers\
    \ (PLC) for data recording [29], monitor-\ning, and optimization aided occasionally\
    \ by fuzzy interference systems (FIS) [73].\nThe decision-making and actions once\
    \ undertaken by the farmers now have given\nway to data-driven agricultural decision-making,\
    \ i.e., assisting them to undertake informed\ndecisions related to planting, fertilization,\
    \ pest control, harvesting, and overall farm man-\nagement. Likewise, derived\
    \ from the smart water management project (SWAMP) [28,73,75]\na hands-on approach\
    \ is being utilized to develop a precision irrigation platform based on\nIoT technology\
    \ for smart water management, distributed in Brazil, Italy, and Spain.\n4.3. The\
    \ Third Categorization of Research Literature That Is Related to Speciﬁc Technical\n\
    Research Aspects\nDTs use software to create, operate, and interact with their\
    \ physical counterparts. The\nsoftware component of a DT enables the collection,\
    \ processing, and analysis of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, actuators,\
    \ and other connected devices.\nIn [28,77], the high-level programming language\
    \ Python is used for software develop-\nment, scripting, and data analysis, serving\
    \ the purposes of DT applications, implementing\nthe Arduino IDE platform, and\
    \ exploiting the Debian Buster OS to produce a plant simula-\ntion model. Likewise,\
    \ RPi software for the Raspberry Pi platform is used with goal-oriented\nrequirement\
    \ language (GRL) for modelling [80]. We should point out the use of an open\n\
    standard ﬁle format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is used in [73] for\
    \ data repre-\nsentation and communication between systems and is widely adopted\
    \ and supported by\nvarious programming languages and platforms. Speciﬁc software\
    \ packages are utilized\nfor constructing 3D plant models, such as Unreal Engine\
    \ 5, Reality Capture, Photoshop,\nMesh Model Construction, Autodesk, Maya [74],\
    \ Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology, and\nReality [35]. Other speciﬁc software\
    \ packages serving, for example, the construction of\na DT ﬂowsheet model as in\
    \ [64] found in the researched literature are the Aspen Plus\nand Aspen HYSYS\
    \ from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD from\nChemstations,\
    \ Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte, NC,\nUSA),\
    \ ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group plc.\n\
    Simulation software was employed in this study [28] to generate a virtual setting\
    \ for\nan irrigation system’s digital twin, incorporating a plant simulation model.\n\
    As previously mentioned, in [73], Siemens’s industrial plant simulation software\n\
    was used, and in [74], the Virtual UCF Arboretum Application (V1.0) was developed\n\
    with virtual plant datasets, plant inventories, VR headsets leading to an AR Holodeck\
    \ by\nmultiple captured images taken in 3D space and an AR perpetual garden App.\n\
    In [75], a linear model of plant growth is proposed utilizing a wheat multi-agent\n\
    planning module close enough to the implied structure modelling simulation in\
    \ [29],\nvirtual models are used during the usage phase in [84], an earth system\
    \ model in [78], a\nfarm is represented in 3D in [81], the concept of the DT model\
    \ via data-driven modelling is\nassessed [63]. In [76], the authors imply that\
    \ a software package was developed containing\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n29 of 38\n\
    an ontology editor, a DT editor, multi-agent planning module for creating a prototype\
    \ of\nan intelligent plant DT system in Java whilst AR implementations to save\
    \ BIM model ﬁles\nin Film box (.FBX) in [79] by using Unity game engine to provide\
    \ 3D modelling software.\nFurther authors in [9] confronted post-harvest models\
    \ by discrete event simulation such as\ndrying, adding to the simulation models\
    \ for blending and ﬂow DT models [82,83] that rely\nheavily on available real-time\
    \ data a ﬂow for continuous adaption and learning. Finally, DT\nmodelling implies\
    \ simulation, analysis, and prediction [88] that may assess the modelling\nand\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, pollution challenges,\
    \ soil\nagents (hydrological models, soil data), and crop agents\nTable 4 summarises\

    Structure\nmodelling\nsimulation\nOn the other hand, AI, ML, and DL algorithms\
    \ seem to be a major issue in [45,63,83,87,88],\nleading to Big Data analytics\
    \ [82] to describe DT modelling that relies heavily on real-time\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n31 of 38\navailable data ﬂow. The immense amount of data is stored\
    \ in databases such as Mongo\nDB [28,73], Draco, My-SQL [28,73], and SQLite [80,81],\
    \ besides using Excel CSV ﬁles for\nretrieving height values [79] or generally\
    \ mentioned Knowledge bases as in [75] leading to\ncloud big data manipulation\
    \ schemes in [45,81,85]. Major cloud computing platforms such\nas Alibaba Cloud,\
    \ Amazon web services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, and Microsoft Azure\nare examples\
    \ of cloud computing services provided by leading technology companies that\n\
    serve the DT idea, as seen in [87].\nCloud IoT service broker agents come into\
    \ place as a software component or intermedi-\nary that facilitates the interaction\
    \ between cloud service consumers (users or organizations)\nand cloud service\
    \ providers like FIWARE. In [28,73], FIWARE cloud applications are ex-\nploited,\
    \ adding to IoT broker and IoT agents to facilitate cloud management of context\n\
    information. The procedure includes converting various communication protocols\
    \ into a\nshared base protocol and incorporating intelligent functionality through\
    \ the processing,\nanalysing, and visualising of contextual data. FIWARE generally\
    \ is used as an open-\nsource platform to provide a standardized framework and\
    \ a set of reusable components for\nbuilding smart applications and services in\
    \ the context of the IoT and Future Internet (FI)\ndomains. It aims to simplify\
    \ the development of innovative and interoperable solutions\nby offering a collection\
    \ of open APIs, data models, and software tools that facilitate the\ndevelopment\
    \ of smart applications and services.\nA fuzzy inference system enhances adaptive\
    \ and learning capabilities. It handles\nnonlinear and complex relationships between\
    \ variables, as in [73], in addition to Siemens\nindustrial plant simulation software\
    \ for plant simulation model production with a weather\nstation. In [67,79], the\
    \ Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application is used instead of other\ndedicated\
    \ software such as Geo-Soft-Core, a Geoscientiﬁc Software & Code Repository\n\
    hosted at the archive DIGITAL.CSIC in [78] or Java ontology editor to elaborate\
    \ a DT\neditor in [75,76].\nLastly, wireless network communication technologies\
    \ are addressed in the research\nliterature. Initially, the wired networking technology\
    \ Ethernet is mentioned in [28,73,77],\nwhile the wireless networking technologies\
    \ such as Wi-Fi are mentioned in [35,45,74,77,87],\nLoRaWAN in [45,73], mobile\
    \ or cellular in [45,74,87] and generally mentioned as mandatory\nin [29,82].\
    \ Bluetooth, RFID, and NB-IoT are exploited in [85].\n5. Discussion\nA ﬁrst attempt\
    \ to comment on speciﬁc aspects of the reviewed literature has been done\nin Section\
    \ 2. In total, 14 journal articles or conference papers, including a published\
    \ book,\npropose case studies that support the idea of DT implementation in agriculture,\
    \ contrary to\nthe rest published review papers that sufﬁce to merely describe\
    \ the topic and record the\nachievements of the scientiﬁc community referring\
    \ to it.\nIt is interesting to point out that three (3) relevant case study conference\
    \ papers and a\npublished book, added to nine (9) journal articles, seem to slightly\
    \ overcome the amount\nof the 12 review papers in a total of 26 articles. The\
    \ limited practical application of digital\ntwin technologies is obvious, even\
    \ stated in the literature by the authors.\nEven though [9,86,87] are review papers,\
    \ the authors either describe the necessity of a\nDT model as in [9] for the agriculture\
    \ supply chain management domain, even addressing\nsensors such as level, ﬂow,\
    \ identiﬁcation sensors, RFID or DNA tags, or highlight the need\nfor future study\
    \ on DT models as in [86] making use of remote detection and monitoring\nschemes,\
    \ LiDAR sensors, passive microwave sensing devices, RADARs or even sensors\nonboard\
    \ UAVs and satellites, for monitoring, controlling, coordinating, and executing\
    \ farm\noperations at agricultural sites by IoT sensor nodes as in [87].\nThe\
    \ signiﬁcance of using Sensors as part of a dynamic IoT control-oriented mechanism\n\
    as demanded in DT infrastructure should be acknowledged as in [35,73,74,77,79–81,87,88]\n\
    where soil probes, drone image cameras, multispectral and photographic cameras,\
    \ IR\nthermometers, mini-LiDAR sensors, a mesh of sensors measuring temperature,\
    \ humidity,\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n32 of 38\nluminosity, and relative CO2 concentration,\
    \ and air velocity are addressed as essential\nelements to materialize relevant\
    \ IoT platforms accordingly.\nIn [28,73,75,88], the SWAMP IoT-based smart water\
    \ management platform is men-\ntioned. In [19,26], the IoT scheme is merely addressed,\
    \ and in the journal [82], IoT is only\nmentioned as well in the review papers\
    \ [63,85,87], where the IoT is stated as a promising\nconcept. The fact that in\
    \ [73] an OPC UA server is recommended for implementation,\nin [77] an Arduino\
    \ single-board computer is used as well as the Raspberry Pi-3 platform as\nin\
    \ [80,81] in a total of 14 articles that either describe the use of IoT platforms\
    \ or vaguely\npresent a case study project [9,19,26,28,35,64,74–77,79–82] means\
    \ that the practical imple-\nmentation of IoT platforms is quite limited for the\
    \ time being.\nThe necessary software to operate such platforms is focused on\
    \ Python [28,77], ded-\nicated FIS, Json, FIWARE Cygnus connector, IoT Agent,\
    \ OPC agent [73], RPi in [77,80],\nArduino IDE n [77] relevant to the case studies\
    \ previously mentioned. These make use\nof Ethernet communication technologies\
    \ [28,73,77], LoRa [73], and Wi-Fi, [77] in addition\nto [35,74] that make use\
    \ of Wi-Fi and mobile LTE [74] communication technologies that\nfacilitate near\
    \ real-time interaction with the environment.\nThe concept and deﬁnition of DT\
    \ seem to be continuously evolving, but in general,\nit refers to a speciﬁc collection\
    \ of digitally or virtually materialized models that represent\na physical process\
    \ or object. These models are used for simulation and future behavior\nforecasting,\
    \ guiding the feedback loop from the Actuators and Control node to the Physical\n\
    entity, as profoundly visualized in Figures 3–5. The ongoing feedback loop between\
    \ the\nphysical farm and the DT is imperative to update the DT model to optimize\
    \ and enhance\nperformance and efﬁciency.\nSeveral attempts have been made in\
    \ this direction. In the reviews [9,29,63,83,86], the\nconcept of the DT model\
    \ is proposed merely as an evolving concept without an imple-\nmented case study.\
    \ Simulation models [83], referring to data-driven modelling, discrete\nevent\
    \ simulation blending and ﬂow models [9], and structure modelling simulation and\n\
    future multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g., SCOPE) with dynamic crop\
    \ growth\nmodels for agroecosystems DTs [86] are described merely as proposals\
    \ giving way to future\npractical implementations. On the other hand, in [28],\
    \ simulation software utilizing a\nsimple plant simulation model is employed to\
    \ create a virtual environment for an irrigation\nsystem’s digital twin. In [73],\
    \ the Siemens industrial plant simulation software for the\ndata model is used,\
    \ a model of the Earth system is mentioned in [78], a 3D representation\nof a\
    \ farm in [81], while in [82] it continuous adaption and learning procedure of\
    \ the DT\nmodelling is mentioned as a need that relies heavily on available data.\
    \ A more concise\nproposal to the origin of the holistic DT modelling and simulation\
    \ concept appears in [76],\nwhere a prototype of an intelligent plant DT system\
    \ in Java claimed to be developed, includ-\ning an ontology editor, a digital\
    \ twin editor, and a multi-agent planning module. In [88],\nsimulation, analysis,\
    \ and prediction are addressed by making progress in implementing\nmodelling and\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and pollution\
    \ chal-\nlenges, making efforts to develop plant modelling with soil agents (hydrological\
    \ models,\nsoil data), crop agents and predictive control models, where the adjustment\
    \ of control\nprocesses such as heating and ventilation is automated based on\
    \ short-term temperature\npredictions, ensuring efﬁcient regulation, as an IoT\
    \ derivative scheme.\nA ﬂowsheet model is proposed taking advantage of the widespread\
    \ spreadsheet\napplications of Microsoft Excel in [64] to tamper with simulation\
    \ software such as Aspen\nPlus and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington,\
    \ MA, USA), ChemCAD\nfrom Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design\
    \ from Honeywell (Charlotte,\nNC, USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France)\
    \ and PRO/II from AVEVA Group\nplc, merely to implement a digital modelling approach\
    \ to food processing.\nSpreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel to retrieve\
    \ height values of plants in high-\ntech data-driven greenhouses are used in [79],\
    \ a fact that proves that process calculations\nand analyses may be conducted\
    \ using popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n\
    33 of 38\ndue to its wide accessibility and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and professionals\nfrom various ﬁelds.\nEnhanced 3D modelling software derived\
    \ from the game industry, i.e., Unity game en-\ngine dictates BIM models in Film\
    \ box (.FBX) format to aid realistic VR/AR representations\nof greenhouses, providing\
    \ a promising realistic overview of a Smart Agriculture imple-\nmentation. Virtual\
    \ representation is accomplished via Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture,\nPhotoshop,\
    \ Autodesk, and Maya software platforms to construct Mesh models of Plant\nDatasets\
    \ for Virtual UCF Arboretum Applications, plant inventories, and AR Perpetual\n\
    Garden App. as in [74]. These plant datasets are derived from multiple captured\
    \ images\nin 3D space and incorporate VR headsets aided by GIS and AR Holodeck\
    \ software. Ad-\nditionally, Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology and Reality are\
    \ used for 3D plant models\noffering a linear plant growth model [35] to descriptively\
    \ sufﬁce the wheat multi-agent\nplanning module. Using multiple captured images\
    \ taken in 3D space to support the AR\nPerpetual Garden App, they produce botanically\
    \ correct plant models for use in museums\nand for educational purposes. A promising\
    \ perspective, if by any chance associated with\nthe essential elements of the\
    \ holistic DT scheme, could be capturing real-time data on\nvarious environmental\
    \ and operational factors via communication technologies leading to\na dynamic\
    \ 3D model of a farm entity.\nBesides the 3D representation of DT models, IoT\
    \ Dashboards [87], such as Grafana in\nparticular [28,73] for real-time data presentation\
    \ and analysis or even GUI prototypes [81],\nare proposed, although used on a\
    \ small scale for facilitating near real-time interaction of\nDTs with the environment.\
    \ To reliably transfer and manage data, Blockchain is used, even\non a smaller\
    \ scale, as in [45,87], while Big Data Analytics, as in [82], AI and ML methods\n\
    that enable data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making based on large\
    \ datasets,\nare addressed in [45,63,82,83,86,88]. Cloud-based data analytics\
    \ pose a major issue for\nthe advent of smart agriculture as claimed in [45,85,87],\
    \ not to omit the signiﬁcance of\ndatabases such Mongo DB, Draco, My-SQL as used\
    \ in [28,73] or SQLite in [80], and Cloud\ncomputing service providers such as\
    \ Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Microsoft\nAzure and Google Cloud platform\
    \ [87].\nVarious factors, with technical hurdles being the primary challenge,\
    \ seem to be step-\nping behind to allow even further the adoption of the DT technologies.\
    \ It is essential\nto meticulously design and clearly deﬁne intricate agricultural\
    \ systems to guarantee the\naccuracy of their corresponding DT models.\n6. Future\
    \ Directions\nOnce addressing a DT as a tight combination of an object model,\
    \ in conjunction with\nexpansive sets of data that directly follow the object\
    \ that may evolve and continually modify\nand adapt the model based on the available\
    \ data, it is made clear that future research should\nbe realized to overcome\
    \ the current profound lack of reference models and case studies\naccordingly.\
    \ That could serve as a direct guidance for DT research and development.\nTo broaden\
    \ the aspect of Agriculture 4.0 that needs DTs and overcome the limitations\n\
    of mere telemetry narrowed down by IoT schemes implemented till now, further research\n\
    in implementations using DT modelling, 3D visualization, and simulation schemes\
    \ tar-\ngeting virtual nature applications aided by AR, VR, and GIS information\
    \ systems should\nbe realized.\nFurther research into the holistic model perception\
    \ of plant DTs to overcome the focus\nmerely on the phenotype of plants could\
    \ vastly support DT research. We can pursue\nenhancing the accuracy of depicting\
    \ real-world farms, plants, and crops in the digital realm\nby combining non-georeferenced\
    \ visualizations, like gaming engines, with geospatially\nreferenced 3D geo visualizations.\n\
    Implementing additional case studies of digital twins that adhere to the mentioned\n\
    principles can address challenges related to reliable aggregating and handling\
    \ of data\nfrom diverse sources, integrating multiple streams of information,\
    \ and employing ad-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n34 of 38\nvanced computational methods\
    \ for data processing and analysis, which could enhance the\nunderstanding of\
    \ the subject and aid further studies.\nFurther decommissioning of data in the\
    \ future resulting from search—Tables 1–3\nmight be promising. The diverse and\
    \ abundant potential advantages of DTs in agriculture\ncreate anticipation for\
    \ the future evolution of this technology and its profound impact on\nthe farming\
    \ sector.\nWe aspire for our work to inspire fellow researchers to explore the\
    \ application of DTs\nin agriculture even further.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ \n \n \nABSTRACT \n \nProximal remote sensing is a cutting-edge technology that\
    \ has emerged as a powerful tool in \nprecision agriculture and environmental\
    \ monitoring. By capturing high-resolution data from a close \nrange, it provides\
    \ valuable insights into crop health, soil conditions, and ecosystem dynamics.\
    \ This \npaper explores the applications, advantages, and limitations of proximal\
    \ remote sensing, focusing \non its use in precision agriculture and environmental\
    \ management. The applications of proximal \nremote sensing in precision agriculture\
    \ include crop monitoring, disease detection, and resource \nReview Article \n\

    \ it aids in habitat mapping, biodiversity assessment, \nand environmental impact\
    \ analysis. The advantages of proximal remote sensing lie in its high \nspatial\
    \ resolution, real-time data acquisition, and flexibility in sensor selection.\
    \ However, limitations \nsuch as limited coverage area and skill requirements\
    \ need to be considered. The future \nperspectives of proximal remote sensing\
    \ encompass advancements in sensor technology, \nautomation, integration with\
    \ other technologies, and enhanced data storage and analysis. By \nleveraging\
    \ these advancements, proximal remote sensing can contribute to more sustainable\
    \ \npractices and informed decision-making for a better and resilient future.\

    \ significant attention \nworldwide, including in India, where it holds \nimmense\
    \ potential for precision agriculture and \nenvironmental \nmonitoring \n[1].\
    \ \nThe \nunique \nagricultural landscape, diverse ecosystems, and \ngrowing environmental\
    \ concerns in India make \nproximal remote sensing particularly relevant and \n\
    impactful [2]. \n \nIndia, with its vast agricultural sector and large \npopulation\
    \ \ndependent \non \nagriculture \nfor \nlivelihood, \nfaces \nnumerous \nchallenges\
    \ \nin \noptimizing \ncrop \nproduction, \nresource \nmanagement, and environmental\
    \ sustainability \n[3]. The conventional methods of monitoring crop \nhealth,\
    \ \nsoil \nconditions, \nand \nenvironmental \nparameters often lack the necessary\
    \ precision \nand timeliness required for effective decision-\nmaking. Proximal\
    \ remote sensing offers a \nsolution by facilitating real-time data acquisition,\
    \ \nenabling farmers, researchers, and policymakers \nto make informed choices\
    \ and take timely actions \n[4]. \n \nIn the Indian context, researchers and scientists\
    \ \nhave recognized the potential of proximal remote \nsensing and have undertaken\
    \ numerous studies \nto explore its applications and benefits. For \ninstance,\
    \ \nin \nprecision \nagriculture, \nproximal \nremote sensing techniques have\
    \ been used to \nmonitor crop growth, detect plant diseases, \nassess \nnutrient\
    \ \ndeficiencies, \nand \noptimize \nirrigation practices [5]. By capturing detailed\
    \ \ninformation about the spatial and temporal \nvariations within fields, proximal\
    \ remote sensing \nhelps farmers make targeted interventions, \nreducing input\
    \ costs and improving crop yield [6]. \n \nEnvironmental monitoring and management\
    \ is \nanother critical area where proximal remote \nsensing offers substantial\
    \ advantages in India. \nWith its rich biodiversity, fragile ecosystems, and \n\
    mounting environmental challenges, the need for \naccurate and timely information\
    \ is paramount [7]. \nProximal remote sensing has been successfully \nemployed\
    \ for mapping habitats, assessing \nvegetation dynamics, monitoring forest cover\
    \ \nchanges, and identifying areas of environmental \ndegradation \n[8]. \nSuch\
    \ \ninformation \naids \npolicymakers and conservationists in designing \neffective\
    \ strategies for ecosystem preservation \nand restoration. \n \nWhile proximal\
    \ remote sensing holds great \npromise, it is essential to understand its \nlimitations\
    \ and address the unique challenges \npresent in the Indian context. Factors such\
    \ as \nvarying soil types, cropping patterns, socio-\neconomic conditions, and\
    \ diverse agro-climatic \nzones require careful consideration [9]. The cost-\n\
    effectiveness, \nscalability, \ndata \nprocessing \ncapabilities, and skill requirements\
    \ of proximal \nremote sensing techniques also need to be \nevaluated \nin \n\
    the \nIndian \nagricultural \nand \nenvironmental management context [10]. \n\
    \ \nTherefore, this paper aims to provide an in-depth \nexploration of the applications,\

    \ \nPROXIMAL \nREMOTE SENSING \n \nProximal remote sensing is a dynamic and \n\
    evolving field that has revolutionized the way we \ncollect and analyze data for\
    \ various applications, \nparticularly \nin \nprecision \nagriculture \nand \n\
    environmental monitoring. In the Indian context, \nproximal remote sensing has\
    \ gained significant \nattention and has been applied in various \ndomains, including\
    \ agriculture and environmental \nmonitoring. Researchers in India have explored\
    \ \nthe use of proximal remote sensing techniques to \naddress the specific challenges\
    \ faced by the \ncountry. This innovative approach involves the \nuse of specialized\
    \ sensors and instruments to \ncapture high-resolution data from a close range,\
    \ \nproviding detailed insights into the target area's \ncharacteristics and conditions.\
    \ Let's explore the \nkey components and techniques involved in \nproximal remote\
    \ sensing and how they contribute \nto a deeper understanding of our surroundings.\
    \ \n \n2.1 Sensor Technology \n \nAt the heart of proximal remote sensing lies\
    \ the \nuse of advanced sensor technology. These \nsensors are designed to capture\
    \ specific types of \ndata, such as multispectral or hyperspectral \nimaging,\
    \ \nLiDAR, \nthermal \nimaging, \nor \nelectromagnetic radiation. Each type of\
    \ sensor \nhas its unique capabilities and applications \n(Table 1). In the Indian\
    \ context, researchers have \nexplored the use of these sensors for various \n\
    purposes. [11] conducted a case study in \nGujarat, India, utilizing proximal\
    \ remote sensing \nsensors \nfor \ncrop \nhealth \nassessment \nand \nmanagement.\
    \ The study showcased the potential \nof \nthese \nsensors \nin \nproviding \n\
    valuable \ninformation for effective crop management \npractices. \n \n2.2 Platforms\
    \ \n \nProximal remote sensing can be conducted using \nvarious platforms, depending\
    \ on the specific \nrequirements of the application. In India, ground-\nbased\
    \ platforms are commonly used for proximal \nremote \nsensing. \nThese \nplatforms\
    \ \ninvolve \nmounting the sensors on vehicles, carts, or \nhandheld devices,\
    \ allowing for data collection at \na close proximity to the target area. Additionally,\
    \ \nUAVs have gained popularity in India for \nproximal remote sensing applications.\
    \ [12] \nconducted a study in India using UAVs equipped \nwith proximal remote\
    \ sensing sensors for crop \nhealth assessment. The study highlighted the \nadvantages\
    \ of using UAVs for capturing high-\nresolution data over large agricultural areas.\
    \ \n \n2.3 Data Analysis and Interpretation \n \nOnce the data is collected, it\

    \ \n \nThe significance of Precision Agriculture (PA) \nhas gained widespread\
    \ recognition as a crucial \ncontributor \nto \ncrop \nproduction \ntechnology\
    \ \nworldwide \n[13]. \nHowever, \nits \npractical \nimplementation has been limited\
    \ to large-scale \nfarms thus far [14]. PA is built upon an innovative \nsystems\
    \ \napproach \nthat \nrelies \non \nvarious \nfundamental technologies, including\
    \ Geographic \nInformation System (GIS), Global Positioning \nSystem (GPS), computer\
    \ modeling, ground-\nbased/airborne/satellite remote sensing, variable \nrate\
    \ technology, and advanced information \nprocessing [15] (Fig. 2). These technologies\
    \ \nenable timely in-season and between-season \ncrop management. The implementation\
    \ of PA \ninvolves three primary steps: (1) gathering \ninformation on variability,\
    \ (2) processing and \nanalyzing the gathered information to evaluate its \nsignificance,\
    \ and (3) implementing changes in \ninput management. PA follows a cyclical process\
    \ \nthat becomes more refined with each year of \nusage by farm operators. Consequently,\
    \ each of \nthe three general steps may take several months \nto years to collectively\
    \ establish a stable and \nworkable structure, which remains open to \nfurther\
    \ amendments and refinements [16]. The \nimportance of PA emerged during the era\
    \ of \nagricultural mechanization in the 20th century, \ndriven by economic pressures\
    \ to apply uniform \nagronomic practices across large fields. PA \noffers a means\
    \ to automate Site-Specific \nManagement \n(SSM) \nthrough \ninformation \ntechnology,\
    \ thereby making SSM feasible in \ncommercial agriculture [17]. \n \nProximal\
    \ remote sensing has revolutionized \nprecision \nagriculture \nby \nproviding\
    \ \nvaluable \ninsights into crop health, soil conditions, and \nresource \nmanagement.\
    \ \nThe \ndetailed \ndata \ncollected through proximal remote sensing \ntechnologies\
    \ enables farmers and agronomists to \nmake informed decisions, optimize productivity,\
    \ \nand minimize environmental impact. Let's delve \ninto the specific applications\
    \ of proximal remote \nsensing in precision agriculture: \n \n3.1 Plant Health\
    \ Assessment \n \nProximal remote sensing plays a critical role in \nassessing\
    \ the health and vigor of crops. By \ncapturing \nhigh-resolution \ndata \non\
    \ \nplant \nparameters such as chlorophyll content, leaf area \nindex, and vegetation\
    \ indices (e.g., NDVI - \nNormalized \nDifference \nVegetation \nIndex), \nfarmers\
    \ can monitor plant health and detect early \nsigns of stress, diseases, or nutrient\
    \ deficiencies \n[18-20]. This information helps them identify \nspecific areas\
    \ within a field that require attention, \nenabling targeted interventions such\
    \ as adjusting \nirrigation, nutrient application, or implementing \npest control\
    \ measures [21-23]. \n \n3.2 Soil Moisture Monitoring \n \nEfficient water management\
    \ is essential for \nsustainable agriculture. Proximal remote sensing \nallows\
    \ farmers to monitor soil moisture levels \nacross their fields with high spatial\
    \ resolution \n \n \n \n \nVerma et al.; J. Exp. Agric. Int., vol. 45, no. 8,\
    \ pp. 162-176, 2023; Article no.JEAI.101915 \n \n \n \n166 \n \n[24,25]. By deploying\
    \ sensors that measure soil \nmoisture content, farmers can obtain real-time \n\
    data on soil moisture variations [26,27]. This \ninformation enables them to optimize\
    \ irrigation \npractices, ensuring that water is applied precisely \nwhere and\
    \ when it is needed [28,29]. By avoiding \nover- or under-irrigation, farmers\
    \ can conserve \nwater resources, minimize energy costs, and \nimprove crop yields\
    \ [30,31]. \n \n3.3 Nutrient Management \n \nProximal remote sensing aids in precise\
    \ nutrient \nmanagement by providing insights into nutrient \ndistribution and\
    \ uptake within fields [32,33]. By \nanalyzing data on vegetation indices and\
    \ nutrient \ncontent, farmers can identify areas with nutrient \ndeficiencies\
    \ or imbalances. This information \nguides them in applying fertilizers in a targeted\
    \ \nmanner, adjusting nutrient rates based on \nspecific field conditions [34,35].\
    \ This approach, \nknown as variable rate application, optimizes \nnutrient utilization,\
    \ minimizes waste, and reduces \nthe risk of environmental pollution [36]. Proximal\
    \ \nremote sensing also enables farmers to assess \nthe effectiveness of their\
    \ nutrient management \nstrategies and make data-driven adjustments for \nimproved\
    \ crop nutrition [37,38]. \n \n3.4 Weed and Pest Detection \n \nEarly detection\
    \ of weeds and pests is crucial for \neffective crop protection [39-41]. Weeds\
    \ are most \nsevere and widespread biological constraints to \ncrop production\
    \ [42-44]. Proximal remote sensing \nprovides a means to detect and monitor the\
    \ \npresence of weeds and pest infestations in a \ntimely manner [45-47]. By analyzing\
    \ high-\nresolution imagery, farmers can identify areas of \nthe field where weed\
    \ growth is prevalent or \nwhere pests have infiltrated [48]. This information\
    \ \nenables them to implement targeted weed \ncontrol measures, such as spot spraying\
    \ or \nmechanical removal, and take appropriate pest \nmanagement \nactions, \n\
    such \nas \nreleasing \nbeneficial insects or applying targeted pesticides \n\
    [49]. By accurately identifying and addressing \nweed and pest issues, farmers\
    \ can minimize \nyield losses and reduce the reliance on broad-\nspectrum chemicals\
    \ [50,51]. \n \n3.5 Crop Yield Estimation and Harvest \nPlanning \n \nProximal\
    \ remote sensing contributes to accurate \ncrop yield estimation and facilitates\
    \ effective \nharvest planning. By combining data on plant \nhealth, canopy density,\
    \ and biomass, farmers \ncan estimate crop yields with greater precision \n[52].\
    \ This information helps them optimize \nharvest timing and allocate resources\
    \ efficiently, \nincluding labor and storage facilities [53]. \nAccurate yield\
    \ estimation aids in crop marketing \nand financial planning, allowing farmers\
    \ to make \ninformed \ndecisions \nregarding \nmarket \nopportunities, storage\
    \ capacities, and post-\nharvest handling requirements. \n \n3.6 Precision Irrigation\
    \ and Variable Rate \nApplication \n \nProximal remote sensing enables precision\
    \ \nirrigation and variable rate application of inputs. \nBy analyzing data on\
    \ soil moisture levels, plant \nwater stress, and canopy evapotranspiration, \n\
    farmers can determine precise irrigation needs \nand deliver water in the right\
    \ amounts and at the \nright time [54,55]. This approach maximizes \nwater-use\
    \ efficiency, conserves resources, and \nminimizes the risk of over- or under-irrigation.\
    \ \nSimilarly, by integrating proximal remote sensing \ndata with information\
    \ on soil fertility, crop growth, \nand pest pressure, farmers can apply inputs\
    \ such \nas fertilizers, pesticides, and growth regulators at \nvariable rates\
    \ [56,57]. This targeted approach \noptimizes resource allocation, reduces input\
    \ \nwaste, and improves overall crop performance \n[58]. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Crop\

    \ plays a crucial role in \nenvironmental monitoring and management, \noffering\
    \ valuable insights into ecosystems, land-\nuse \nchanges, \nhabitat \nconservation,\
    \ \nand \nenvironmental hazards [59,60]. By capturing \nhigh-resolution data from\
    \ a close range, this \ntechnology provides detailed information that is \nessential\
    \ for informed decision-making and \neffective environmental stewardship [61].\
    \ Let's \nexplore the diverse applications of proximal \nremote sensing in environmental\
    \ monitoring and \nmanagement: \n \n4.1 Ecosystem Health Assessment \n \nProximal\
    \ \nremote \nsensing \nenables \nthe \nassessment \nof \necosystem \nhealth \n\
    and \nbiodiversity. By capturing data on vegetation \nindices, \nspecies \ncomposition,\
    \ \nand \nhabitat \ncharacteristics, researchers and conservationists \ncan evaluate\
    \ the overall health and functioning of \necosystems [62]. This information helps\
    \ identify \nareas of concern, such as habitat fragmentation, \ninvasive species\
    \ encroachment, or degradation \ndue to human activities. Proximal remote sensing\
    \ \naids in monitoring changes in vegetation cover, \nidentifying \ncritical \n\
    habitats, \nand \ntracking \necological indicators to inform conservation \nstrategies\
    \ and protect biodiversity [63]. \n \n4.2 Land-use and Land Cover Mapping \n \n\
    Accurate land-use and land cover mapping is \nessential for effective land management\
    \ and \nplanning. Proximal remote sensing provides \ndetailed \ndata \non \nthe\
    \ \ndistribution \nand \ncharacteristics of different land cover types, \nincluding\
    \ forests, wetlands, agricultural areas, \nurban settlements, and water bodies\
    \ [64]. This \ninformation aids in monitoring land-use changes, \ndetecting deforestation,\
    \ urban expansion, and \nencroachment into sensitive areas. Proximal \nremote\
    \ sensing helps policymakers and land \nmanagers make informed decisions regarding\
    \ \nland \nallocation, \nconservation \nefforts, \nand \nsustainable development\
    \ practices [65]. \n \n4.3 Forest Monitoring and Management \n \nForests \nplay\
    \ \na \nvital \nrole \nin \nmaintaining \nbiodiversity, \ncarbon \nsequestration,\
    \ \nand \necosystem services. Proximal remote sensing \ntechniques, such as LiDAR\
    \ and hyperspectral \nimaging, enable detailed forest monitoring and \nmanagement.\
    \ By capturing three-dimensional \ninformation on forest structure, biomass, and\
    \ \ncanopy density, researchers can estimate carbon \nstocks, assess tree health,\
    \ and identify areas \nsusceptible to disturbances such as pest \noutbreaks or\
    \ wildfires [66]. Proximal remote \nsensing also aids in monitoring illegal logging\
    \ \nactivities, guiding reforestation efforts, and \nimplementing sustainable\
    \ forest management \npractices [67]. \n \n4.4 Water Resource Management \n \n\
    Proximal \nremote \nsensing \nprovides \ncritical \ninformation for water resource\
    \ management and \nmonitoring aquatic ecosystems. By capturing \ndata on water\
    \ quality parameters, such as \nturbidity, \nchlorophyll-a \nconcentration, \n\
    and \ntemperature, researchers can assess the health \nand pollution levels of\
    \ water bodies [68]. \nProximal remote sensing aids in detecting \nharmful algal\
    \ blooms, identifying sources of \npollution, and monitoring changes in aquatic\
    \ \nhabitats. This \ninformation guides decision-\nmaking related to water treatment,\
    \ pollution \ncontrol, and the conservation of sensitive aquatic \necosystems.\
    \ \n \n4.5 Disaster Management \n \nProximal remote sensing contributes to effective\
    \ \ndisaster management by providing real-time data \nand actionable insights\
    \ during emergencies. For \ninstance, during natural disasters such as floods,\
    \ \nhurricanes, or earthquakes, proximal remote \nsensing can assess the extent\
    \ of damage, \nidentify areas at risk, and aid in search and \nrescue operations\
    \ [69]. The technology can also \nmonitor \npost-disaster \nrecovery, \nassess\
    \ \ninfrastructure damage, and support decision-\nmaking regarding reconstruction\
    \ efforts. Proximal \nremote sensing helps authorities respond swiftly \nand efficiently\
    \ to mitigate the impacts of disasters \nand protect vulnerable communities [70].\

    \ a significant role \nin environmental impact assessments for various \ndevelopment\
    \ \nprojects. \nBy \ncapturing \nhigh-\nresolution data on the target area and\

    \ \nremote \nsensing \noffers \nnumerous \nadvantages that have made it a valuable\
    \ tool in \nvarious fields. However, like any technology, it \nalso has certain\
    \ limitations to consider. Let's \ndelve into the advantages and limitations of\
    \ \nproximal remote sensing: \n \n5.1 Advantages \n \nHigh Spatial Resolution:\
    \ Proximal remote \nsensing allows data collection from a close \nrange, resulting\
    \ in high spatial resolution. This \ncapability enables the capture of detailed\
    \ \ninformation about the target area, such as fine-\nscale features, small objects,\
    \ or subtle changes \nin the environment. High spatial resolution \nenhances the\
    \ accuracy and precision of data \nanalysis, supporting more informed decision-\n\
    making [71]. \n \nReal-time Data Acquisition: Proximal remote \nsensing provides\
    \ real-time data acquisition, \nallowing for immediate analysis and response.\
    \ \nThis feature is particularly beneficial in time-\nsensitive \napplications,\
    \ \nsuch \nas \ndisaster \nmanagement, where timely information is crucial \n\
    for effective decision-making and response \nplanning [72]. Real-time data also\
    \ enables \ndynamic monitoring of changing environmental \nconditions, facilitating\
    \ adaptive management \nstrategies. \n \nImproved Data Accuracy: With proximal\
    \ remote \nsensing, data can be collected using specialized \nsensors tailored\
    \ to specific applications. These \nsensors are often calibrated and validated\
    \ for \naccurate measurements in controlled conditions. \nAs a result, the data\
    \ obtained through proximal \nremote sensing tends to have higher accuracy \n\
    compared to data acquired through other remote \nsensing platforms. \n \nFlexibility\
    \ \nin \nSensor \nSelection: Proximal \nremote sensing offers flexibility in choosing\
    \ \nsensor types based on the specific requirements \nof the application. Various\
    \ sensors, such as \nmultispectral, hyperspectral, LiDAR, or thermal \nsensors,\
    \ can be employed to capture different \ntypes of data. This flexibility allows\
    \ for the \ncustomization of data collection approaches, \noptimizing \nthe \n\
    information \nobtained \nand \nsupporting diverse applications [73]. \n \nTargeted\
    \ Data Collection: With proximal remote \nsensing, data collection can be targeted\
    \ to \nspecific areas of interest within a larger region. \nThis \nselective \n\
    approach \nminimizes \ndata \nredundancy and reduces the need for extensive \n\
    data storage and processing. Targeted data \ncollection \nis \nparticularly \n\
    advantageous \nin \nresource-constrained situations, where efficient \nuse of\
    \ resources is crucial [74]. \n \nInteroperability \nwith \nGround-based \nMeasurements:\
    \ Proximal remote sensing can \nbe seamlessly integrated with ground-based \n\
    measurements and observations. Researchers \ncan combine proximal remote sensing\
    \ data with \nfield measurements, such as soil samples or \nground truth observations,\
    \ to enhance the \naccuracy and reliability of their analyses. This \nintegration\
    \ of different data sources leads to a \nmore comprehensive understanding of the\
    \ target \narea. \n \nAccessibility and Cost-effectiveness: Proximal \nremote\
    \ sensing is often more accessible and \ncost-effective compared to traditional\
    \ remote \nsensing techniques. Ground-based platforms, \nsuch as handheld devices\
    \ or unmanned aerial \nvehicles (UAVs), offer greater accessibility and \noperational\
    \ flexibility. UAVs, in particular, have \nbecome more affordable and user-friendly,\
    \ \nallowing for efficient data collection over smaller \nto medium-sized areas\
    \ [75]. This accessibility \nand cost-effectiveness have facilitated the wider\
    \ \nadoption of proximal remote sensing in various \nsectors. \n \nReal-time Monitoring\
    \ and Instant Feedback: \nProximal remote sensing enables real-time \nmonitoring\
    \ and immediate feedback, as data can \nbe collected, processed, and analyzed\
    \ quickly. \nThis feature is particularly useful in applications \nsuch as precision\
    \ agriculture, where farmers can \nobtain instant information about the health\
    \ and \nnutrient status of crops, allowing them to make \ntimely \ndecisions \n\
    and \noptimize \nresource \nallocation. \n \n5.2 Limitations \n \nLimited Coverage\
    \ \nArea: Proximal remote \nsensing typically covers a smaller area compared \n\
    to satellite-based remote sensing. Ground-based \nplatforms and UAVs have range\
    \ limitations, \nrequiring additional efforts for data integration to \n \n \n\

    \ that can affect data collection. \nAdverse weather conditions, such as rain,\
    \ fog, or \nhigh winds, can impact data quality and limit data \ncollection opportunities\
    \ [77]. In dense vegetation \nor \nrugged \nterrains, \nobstacles \nand \nlimited\
    \ \naccessibility may pose challenges for deploying \nsensors or capturing data\
    \ from desired locations. \n  \nInvasive Data Collection: Proximal remote \nsensing\
    \ often involves placing sensors in close \nproximity to the target, which may\
    \ require \nphysical access to the site. This can be \nchallenging or even impossible\
    \ in certain \nenvironments or situations, such as inaccessible \nterrain, \n\
    hazardous \nlocations, \nor \nprivate \nproperties. Invasive data collection may\
    \ also \ndisturb the target area or interfere with the \nnatural processes being\
    \ studied. \n \nSkill and Expertise Requirements: Proximal \nremote sensing requires\
    \ skilled operators who \nare proficient in operating the sensors, data \ncollection\
    \ \nplatforms, \nand \ndata \nprocessing \nsoftware. Proper training and expertise\
    \ are \nnecessary to ensure accurate data collection, \nprocessing, and interpretation.\
    \ The need for \nskilled personnel can be a limitation, especially in \nregions\
    \ or sectors with limited technical capacity \nor resources for training [78].\
    \ \n \nEquipment and Maintenance Costs: Proximal \nremote sensing often involves\
    \ the use of \nspecialized equipment, such as sensors, UAVs, \nor data processing\
    \ software, which can be costly. \nAdditionally, regular maintenance and calibration\
    \ \nof equipment are essential to ensure data \naccuracy and reliability. The\
    \ initial investment \nand ongoing maintenance costs can pose \nfinancial challenges,\
    \ particularly for smaller \norganizations or resource-constrained regions \n\
    [79]. \n \nTime-consuming Data Acquisition: Proximal \nremote sensing requires\
    \ the positioning of \nsensors and the collection of data from specific \nlocations.\
    \ This process can be time-consuming, \nespecially when studying larger areas\
    \ or multiple \ntargets. The need to set up and move sensors \nwithin the proximal\
    \ area may result in slower \ndata collection compared to satellite or aircraft-\n\
    based remote sensing, which can acquire data \nover larger regions simultaneously.\
    \ \n \nSensor Limitations: The choice of sensors for \nproximal remote sensing\
    \ is critical, as different \nsensors have specific strengths and limitations.\
    \ \nFor \nexample, \nsome \nsensors \nmay \nhave \nconstraints related to data\
    \ quality, sensitivity, or \nspectral range. It is important to carefully select\
    \ \nthe appropriate sensor for the desired application \nand ensure that its limitations\
    \ do not compromise \nthe accuracy or relevance of the collected data. \n \nData\
    \ Processing and Analysis: The large \nvolume of data collected through proximal\
    \ \nremote sensing requires efficient processing and \nanalysis techniques. Data\
    \ processing, image \nstitching, and analysis can be time-consuming \nand \ncomputationally\
    \ \nintensive. \nAdequate \ncomputational resources and expertise in data \nanalysis\
    \ are necessary to derive meaningful \ninsights from the collected data.  \n \n\
    Cost Implications: While proximal remote \nsensing \ncan \nbe \ncost-effective\
    \ \nfor \ncertain \napplications, it may require initial investments in \nequipment,\
    \ sensor calibration, and maintenance. \nDepending on the desired level of accuracy\
    \ and \nprecision, the cost of high-quality proximal \nremote sensing equipment\
    \ can be significant. \nAdditionally, specialized training and expertise \nmay\
    \ be necessary to operate the equipment and \nanalyze the collected data effectively,\
    \ further \nadding to the overall costs. \n \n6. FUTURE \nPERSPECTIVES \nOF \n\
    PROXIMAL REMOTE SENSING \n \nProximal remote sensing is a rapidly advancing \n\
    field with immense potential for the future. As \ntechnology \ncontinues \nto\

    \ of proximal remote sensing are \nexpected to expand further. Here are some key\
    \ \nfuture perspectives for proximal remote sensing: \n \nAdvanced Sensor Technology:\
    \ The future will \nwitness advancements in sensor technology. \nThis will lead\
    \ to the development of more \nsophisticated and specialized sensors. These \n\
    sensors will offer improved capabilities for data \ncollection, such as higher\
    \ spectral resolution, \nenhanced sensitivity, and increased spatial \ncoverage.\
    \ Advancements in sensor technology \nwill enable more precise and comprehensive\
    \ \ndata acquisition, facilitating more accurate and \ndetailed analysis of target\
    \ areas. \n \n \n \n \nVerma et al.; J. Exp. Agric. Int., vol. 45, no. 8, pp.\

    \ Intelligence: The \nintegration \nof \nautomation \nand \nartificial \nintelligence\
    \ \n(AI) \nwill \nrevolutionize \nproximal \nremote sensing. AI algorithms can\
    \ automate data \nprocessing, analysis, and interpretation, reducing \nthe reliance\
    \ on manual intervention [80]. Machine \nlearning techniques will enable the development\
    \ \nof predictive models, classification algorithms, \nand anomaly detection systems,\
    \ enhancing the \nefficiency \nand \naccuracy of data analysis. \nAutomation and\
    \ AI will streamline workflows, \nsave time, and enable real-time decision-making\
    \ \n[81,82]. \n \nReal-time Data processing and Analytics: \nFuture developments\
    \ may focus on improving \nthe speed and efficiency of data processing and \n\
    analytics for proximal remote sensing. Real-time \nprocessing capabilities would\
    \ allow for immediate \nfeedback and decision-making, enabling users to \nrespond\
    \ quickly to changing conditions or events. \nAdvanced algorithms and machine\
    \ learning \ntechniques could be employed to automate data \nanalysis, \nextract\
    \ \nvaluable \ninformation, \nand \nprovide actionable insights in real-time.\
    \ \n \nMiniaturization \nand \nPortability: \nThe \nminiaturization of sensors\
    \ and the development \nof lightweight, portable devices will make \nproximal\
    \ remote sensing more accessible and \nuser-friendly. Smaller and more compact\
    \ sensor \nsystems will enable data collection in challenging \nterrains, confined\
    \ spaces, or remote locations. \nPortable proximal remote sensing platforms, \n\
    such as handheld devices or backpack-mounted \nsystems, will facilitate data collection\
    \ by field \nresearchers, \nenvironmentalists, \nand \nfirst \nresponders, enabling\
    \ rapid and on-site data \nanalysis [83,84]. \n \nIntegration with Other Technologies:\
    \ Proximal \nremote sensing will be integrated with other \nemerging \ntechnologies\
    \ \nto \nenhance \nits \ncapabilities. For example, the integration of \nproximal\
    \ remote sensing with unmanned aerial \nvehicles (UAVs) or drones will enable\
    \ efficient \nand widespread data collection over larger areas. \nThe combination\
    \ of proximal remote sensing with \nInternet of Things (IoT) devices will allow\
    \ for real-\ntime \ndata \nstreaming \nand \nmonitoring \nof \nenvironmental \n\
    parameters. \nIntegration \nwith \nsatellite-based remote sensing will enable\
    \ the \nfusion of data from different scales, providing a \nmore comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the \nEarth's surface [85,86]. \n \nEnhanced Data Storage and\
    \ Transmission: As \ndata \nvolumes \ncontinue \nto \nincrease, \nadvancements\
    \ in data storage and transmission \ntechnologies will be essential. More efficient\
    \ data \ncompression algorithms, cloud-based storage \nsolutions, and high-speed\
    \ data transmission \nnetworks will enable seamless data transfer and \nstorage.\
    \ This will facilitate the management of \nlarge-scale proximal remote sensing\
    \ datasets \nand enable easy access to historical data for \nlong-term environmental\
    \ monitoring and trend \nanalysis [87,88]. \n \nFusion of Proximal and Remote\
    \ Sensing \nData: The integration of proximal and remote \nsensing data holds\
    \ significant potential for \ncomprehensive \nand \nmulti-scale \nanalysis. \n\
    Combining data from proximal sensors with data \nacquired through satellite or\
    \ airborne platforms \ncan provide a more holistic understanding of the \ntarget\
    \ area, enabling a deeper exploration of \nspatial patterns, temporal dynamics,\
    \ and process \ninteractions. This fusion of data would contribute \nto more accurate\
    \ and robust interpretations, \nparticularly \nfor \napplications \nsuch \nas\
    \ \nenvironmental monitoring, precision agriculture, \nand infrastructure assessment.\
    \ \n \nExpanded \nApplications: \nProximal \nremote \nsensing will find new and\
    \ expanded applications \nacross various sectors. It will play a significant \n\
    role in precision agriculture, enabling farmers to \noptimize \nresource \nmanagement,\
    \ \nenhance \nproductivity, and promote sustainable practices. \nIn \nurban \n\
    planning \nand \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment, proximal remote sensing will aid\
    \ in \nland-use \nmapping, \nmonitoring \nconstruction \nactivities, and assessing\
    \ environmental impacts \n[89,90]. In ecological research and conservation, \n\
    it will contribute to habitat mapping, biodiversity \nassessment, and monitoring\
    \ of endangered \nspecies. The applications of proximal remote \nsensing in disaster\
    \ management, climate change \nmonitoring, and public health surveillance are\
    \ \nalso expected to grow [91,92]. \n \nEnhanced Spectral and Spatial Capabilities:\
    \ \nFuture developments may focus on enhancing \nthe spectral and spatial capabilities\
    \ of proximal \nremote sensing sensors. Improvements in sensor \ntechnology could\
    \ enable the capture of a wider \nrange of spectral bands, including the utilization\
    \ \nof hyperspectral or multispectral sensors for \nmore detailed and precise\
    \ data acquisition. \nSimilarly, advancements in spatial resolution \ncould allow\
    \ for even finer-scale measurements, \n \n \n \n \nVerma et al.; J. Exp. Agric.\

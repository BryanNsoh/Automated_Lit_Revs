    Abstract: Despite the perception people may have regarding the agricultural process,
    the reality is that today''s agriculture industry is data-centered, precise, and
    smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) based technologies
    redesigned almost every industry including “smart agriculture” which moved the
    industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary changes
    are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities along
    a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless sensors
    and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced when integrating
    this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices and communication
    techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture applications
    are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture application,
    like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection are
    listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages, from
    sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore,
    the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable
    applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    I. Introduction To improve the agricultural yield with fewer resources and labor
    efforts, substantial innovations have been made throughout human history. Nevertheless,
    the high population rate never let the demand and supply match during all these
    times. According to the forecasted figures, in 2050, the world population is expected
    to touch 9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 25% from the current figure
    [1]. Almost the entire mentioned rise of population is forecasted to occur among
    the developing countries [2]. On the other side, the trend of urbanization is
    forecasted to continue at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world’s population
    predicted to be urban until 2050 (currently 49%) [3]. Furthermore, income levels
    will be multiples of what they are now, which will drive the food demand further,
    especially in developing countries. As a result, these nations will be more careful
    about their diet and food quality; hence, consumer preferences can move from wheat
    and grains to legumes and, later, to meat. In order to feed this larger, more
    urban, and richer population, food production should double by 2050 [4], [5].
    Particularly, the current figure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production
    should touch approximately 3 billion tons, and the annual meat production should
    increase by more than 200 million tons to fulfill the demand of 470 million tons
    [6], [7]. Not only for food, but crop production is becoming equally critical
    for industry; indeed crops like cotton, rubber, and gum are playing important
    roles in the economies of many nations. Furthermore, the food-crops-based bioenergy
    market started to increase recently. Even before a decade, only the production
    of ethanol utilized 110 million tons of coarse grains (approximately 10% of the
    world production) [7], [8]. Due to the rising utilization of food crops for bio-fuel
    production, bio-energy, and other industrial usages, food security is at stake.
    These demands are resulting in a further increase of the pressure on already scarce
    agricultural resources. Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the earth’s surface
    is suitable for agriculture uses due to various limitations, like temperature,
    climate, topography, and soil quality, and even most of the suitable areas are
    not homogenous. When zooming the versatilities of landscapes and plant types,
    many new differences start to emerge that can be difficult to quantify. Moreover,
    the available agricultural land is further shaped by political and economic factors,
    like land and climate patterns and population density, while rapid urbanization
    is constantly posing threats to the availability of arable land. Over the past
    decades, the total agriculture land utilized for food production has experienced
    a decline [9]. In 1991, the total arable area for food production was 19.5 million
    square miles (39.47% of the world’s land area), which was reduced to approximately
    18.6 million square miles (37.73% of the world’s land area) in 2013 [10]. As such,
    the gap between demand and supply of food is becoming more significant and alarming
    with the passage of time. Further examination showed that every crop field has
    different characteristics that can be measured separately in terms of both quality
    and quantity. Critical characteristics, like soil type, nutrient presence, flow
    of irrigation, pest resistance, etc., define its suitability and capability for
    a specific crop. In most of situations, the differentiations of characteristics
    can exist within a single crop field, even if the same crop is being cultivated
    in entire farm; hence, site-specific analyses are required for optimal yield production.
    Further, adding the dimension of time, specific crops in the same field rotate
    season-to-season and biologically reach different stages of their cycle within
    a year in areas where locational and temporal differences result in specific growth
    requirements to optimize the crop production. To respond to these demands with
    a range of issues, farmers need new technology-based methods to produce more from
    less land and with fewer hands. Considering the standard farming procedures, farmers
    need to visit the agriculture sites frequently throughout the crop life to have
    a better idea about the crop conditions. For this, the need of smart agriculture
    arises, as 70% of farming time is spent monitoring and understanding the crop
    states instead of doing actual field work [11]. Considering the vastness of the
    agriculture industry, it incredibly demands for technological and precise solutions
    with the aim of sustainability while leaving minimum environmental impact. Recent
    sensing and communication technologies provide a true remote “eye in the field”
    ability in which farmers can observe happenings in the field without being in
    the field. Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation. Timely reporting using a range of sensors makes the entire operation
    not only smart but also cost effective due to its precise monitoring capabilities.
    Variety of autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and satellites
    currently complement agriculture equipment. Sensors can be installed and start
    collecting data in a short time, which is then available online for further analyses
    nearly immediately. Sensor technology offers crop and site-specific agriculture,
    as it supports precise data collection of every site. Recently, the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is beginning to impact a wide array of sectors and industries, ranging from
    manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agriculture industry,
    in order to reduce inefficiencies and improve the performance across all markets
    [12]–[16]. If looking closely, one feels that the current applications are only
    scratching the surface and that the real impact of IoT and its uses are not yet
    witnessed. Still, considering this progress, especially in the near past, we can
    predict that IoT technologies are going to play a key role in various applications
    of the agriculture sector. This is because of the capabilities offered by IoT,
    including the basic communication infrastructure (used to connect the smart objects—from
    sensors, vehicles, to user mobile devices—using the Internet) and range of services,
    such as local or remote data acquisition, cloud-based intelligent information
    analysis and decision making, user interfacing, and agriculture operation automation.
    Such capabilities can revolutionize the agriculture industry which probably one
    of most inefficient sectors of our economic value chain today. To summarize this
    discussion, figure 1 provides the main drivers of technology, while figure 2 highlights
    the major hurdles of technology implementation in smart agriculture. FIGURE 1.
    Key drivers of technology in agriculture industry. Show All FIGURE 2. Major hurdle’s
    in technology implementation for smart agriculture. Show All Researchers and engineers
    around the globe are proposing different methods and architectures and based on
    that suggesting a variety of equipment to monitor and fetch the information regarding
    crop status during different stages, considering numerous crop and field types.
    Focusing on the market demand, many leading manufactures are providing a range
    of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, communication devices, and
    other heavy machinery to deliver the sensed data. In addition, various commissions,
    food and agriculture organizations, and government bodies are developing polices
    and guidelines to observe and regulate the use of these technologies in order
    to maintain food and environment safety [17]–[20]. There are reasonable efforts
    that highlight the role of the IoT in the agriculture industry, but most of the
    published work focuses only on applications [10], [21], [22]. Most of the existing
    articles either provide no insight or show limited focus on the various IoT-based
    architectures, prototypes, advanced methods, the use of IoT for food quality,
    and other future issues considering the latest facts and figures. This manuscript
    examines the trends in IoT-based agriculture research and reveals numerous key
    issues that must be addressed in order to transform the agriculture industry by
    utilizing the recent IoT developments. The major contribution of this article
    is to provide real insight regarding: Expectations of the world from the agriculture
    industry Very recent developments in IoT, both scholarly and in industry are highlighted
    and how these developments are helping to provide solutions to the agriculture
    industry. Limitations, the agriculture industry is facing. Role of IoT to cope
    these limitations and other issues like resources shortage and their precise use,
    food spoilage, climate changes, environmental pollution, and urbanization. Strategies
    and policies that need to be considered when implementing IoT-based technologies
    Critical issues that are left to solve and possible solutions that are further
    required, while suggestions are provided considering these challenges. This article
    is a compendium of knowledge that can help the researchers and agriculture engineers
    implementing the IoT-based technologies to achieve the desired smart agriculture.
    The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section II provides a deep
    overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture and what we can achieve by
    utilizing these technologies. Section III gives insight regarding the role of
    IoT in advanced agriculture practices, like vertical farming (VF), hydroponics,
    and phenotyping, to manage the issues of increased urban population. Section IV
    highlights various technologies and equipment, like sensors, robots, tractors,
    and communication devices, being used to implement IoT in this industry. Accepting
    the worth of UAVs in precision agriculture, Section V caters application achievements
    that are not possible even using other latest technologies. Food safety and transportation
    are other critical areas requiring focus to overcome the hunger issues which did
    not get the attention of researchers as it deserves. Section VI supplies the role
    of the IoT to ensure food quality for longer periods and to deliver to remote
    areas. Section VII identifies current and future trends of this technology in
    the crop industry by highlighting potential research challenges. Finally, Section
    VIII concludes this article. SECTION II. Major Applications By implementing the
    latest sensing and IoT technologies in agriculture practices, every aspect of
    traditional farming methods can be fundamentally changed. Currently, seamless
    integration of wireless sensors and the IoT in smart agriculture can raise agriculture
    to levels which were previously unimaginable. By following the practices of smart
    agriculture, IoT can help to improve the solutions of many traditional farming
    issues, like drought response, yield optimization, land suitability, irrigation,
    and pest control. Figure 3 lists a hierarchy of major applications, services and
    wireless sensors being used for smart agriculture applications. While, major instances
    in which the advanced technologies are helping at various stages to enhance overall
    efficiency are discussed below. FIGURE 3. General hierarchy of possible applications,
    services and sensors for smart agriculture. Show All A. Soil Sampling and Mapping
    Soil is the “stomach” of plants, and its sampling is the first step of examination
    to obtain field-specific information, which is then further used to make various
    critical decisions at different stages. The main objective of soil analysis is
    to determine the nutrient status of a field so that measures can be taken accordingly
    when nutrient deficiencies are found. Comprehensive soil tests are recommended
    on an annual basis, ideally in Spring; however, based on soil conditions and weather
    consents, it may be done in in Fall or Winter [23]. The factors that are critical
    to analyze the soil nutrient levels include soil type, cropping history, fertilizer
    application, irrigation level, topography, etc. These factors give insight regarding
    the chemical, physical, and biological statuses of a soil to identify the limiting
    factors such that the crops can be dealt accordingly. Soil mapping opens the door
    to sowing different crop varieties in a specific field to better match soil properties
    accordingly, like seed suitability, time to sow, and even the planting depth,
    as some are deep-rooted and others less. Furthermore, growing multiple crops together
    could also lead to smarter use of agriculture, simply making the best use of resources.
    Currently, manufacturers are providing a wide range of toolkits and sensors that
    can assist farmers to track the soil quality and, based on this data, recommend
    remedies to avoid its degradation. These systems allow for the monitoring of soil
    properties, such as texture, water-holding capacity, and absorption rate, which
    ultimately help to minimize erosion, densification, salinization, acidification,
    and pollution (by avoiding excessive use of fertilizer). Lab-in-a-Box, a soil
    testing tool kit developed by AgroCares, is considered a complete laboratory in
    itself based on its offered services [24]. By using this, any farmer, without
    having any lab experience, can analyze up to 100 samples per day (overall, more
    than 22,000 nutrient samples a year) without visiting any lab. Drought is a major
    concern which limits the productivity of crop yield. Most of the regions around
    the globe face this issue with various intensities. To deal with this issue, especially
    in very rural areas, remote sensing is being used to obtain frequent soil moisture
    data which helps to analyze the agricultural drought in far regions. For this
    purpose, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched in
    2009 which provides global soil moisture maps every, one to two days. Authors
    in [25] used SMOS L2 to calculate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) in Spain
    in 2014. In this effort, they followed different approaches to obtain the soil
    water parameters in order to compare with the SWDI acquired from in situ data.
    In [26], authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    sensor to map various soil functional properties to estimate the land degradation
    risk for sub-Saharan Africa. The soil maps and field survey data, which covered
    all major climate zones on the continent, were used to develop the prediction
    models. Sensors and vision based technologies are helpful to decide the distance
    and depth for sowing the seed efficiently. Like in [27], sensor and vision based
    autonomous robot called Agribot is developed for sowing seeds. The robot can perform
    on any agricultural lands on which the self-awareness of the robot’s placement
    is ascertained through the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning
    System (GPS) while the on-board vision system is paired with a personal computer.
    Advancing further, various non-contact sensing methods are proposed to determine
    the seed flow rate as in [28] where the sensors are equipped with LEDs; consist
    of infrared, visible light and laser-LED as well as an element as a radiation
    receiver. The output voltage varies based on the movement of the seeds through
    the sensor and band of light rays, and falling of shades on the elements of receiver.
    The signal information, linked to the passing seeds, is used to measure the seed
    flow rate. B. Irrigation About 97% of Earth’s water is salt-water held by oceans
    and seas, and only the remaining 3% is fresh water—more than two-third of which
    is frozen in the forms of glaciers and polar ice caps [29], [30]. Only 0.5% of
    the unfrozen fresh water is above the ground or in the air, as the rest lies underground
    [31]. In short, humanity relies on this 0.5% to fulfill all its requirements and
    to maintain the ecosystem, as enough fresh water must be kept in rivers, lakes,
    and other similar reservoirs to sustain it. It is worth mentioning that solely
    the agriculture industry uses approximately 70% of this accessible fresh water
    [32], [33]. In many countries, situation rises to 75% e.g. Brazil, further in
    some underdeveloped countries, even it exceeds 80% [34]. The main reason for this
    high water consumption is the monitoring procedure as even in 2013, crops visual
    inspection for irrigation decision-making was very common, as nearly 80% of farms
    in United States were observed by this [10], [35]. According to the UN Convention
    to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates in 2013 show that there were 168 countries
    affected by desertification and by 2030, almost half of the world population will
    be living in areas with high water shortages [36]. Considering the figures of
    water crises around the globe, same time its increasing demands in agriculture
    and many other industries, it should be provided to places only where it is needed,
    most importantly, in required quantities. For this purpose, increased awareness
    has been implemented to conserve the existing under-stress water resources by
    employing more efficient irrigation systems. Various controlled irrigation methods,
    like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, are being promoted to tackle the
    water wastage issues, which were also found in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation and furrow irrigation. Both the crop quality and quantity are badly
    affected when facing water shortage, as irregular irrigation, even excess, leads
    to reduced soil nutrients and provokes different microbial infections. It is not
    a simple task to accurately estimate the water demand of crops, where factors
    like crop type, irrigation method, soil type, precipitation, crop needs, and soil
    moisture retention are involved. Considering this fact, a precise soil and air
    moisture control system using the wireless sensors not only makes an optimal use
    of water but also leads to better crop health. The current situation of irrigation
    methods is expected to be changed by adopting the emerging IoT technologies. A
    significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the use of IoT based
    techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation management
    [10], [35]. For this, attaining crop canopy at different periods and air temperature
    are needed for the calculation of CWSI. A wireless sensors based monitoring system
    where all the field sensors are connected to collect the mentioned measurements,
    further transmit to processing center where corresponding intelligent software
    applications are used to analyze the farm data. Not only this but information
    from other sources including weather data and satellite imaging is applied to
    CWSI models for water need assessment, and finally specific irrigation index value
    is produced for each site. A prominent example is VRI (Variable Rate Irrigation)
    optimization by CropMetrics [37], which works according to topography or soil
    variability, ultimately improves the water use efficiency. C. Fertilizer A fertilizer
    is a natural or chemical substance that can provide important nutrients for the
    growth and fertility of plants. Plants mainly need three key macronutrients: nitrogen
    (N) for leaf growth; phosphorus (P) for root, flowers, and fruit development;
    potassium (K) for stem growth and water movement [38]. Any sort of nutrients deficiency
    or applying them improperly can be seriously harmful for the plant health. More
    importantly, excessive use of fertilizer not only results in financial losses
    but also creates harmful impacts to the soil and environment by depleting the
    soil quality, poisoning ground water, and contributing to global climate changes.
    Overall, crops absorb less than half the nitrogen applied as fertilizer, while
    remaining either emitted to the atmosphere or lost as run off. Unbalanced use
    of fertilizer leads to an imbalance in both soil nutrient levels and global climate
    as, reportedly, around 80% of the world’s deforestation has occurred due to agricultural
    practices alone [39]. Fertilization under smart agriculture helps to precisely
    estimate the required dose of nutrients, ultimately minimize their negative effects
    on the environment. Fertilization requires site-specific soil nutrient level measurements
    based on various factors, such as crop type, soil type, soil absorption capability,
    product yield, fertility type and utilization rate, weather condition, etc. The
    reason is that the measurement of soil nutrient level is not only expensive but
    also time consuming, as, typically, investigations of soil samples at each location
    are required. To better depict this discussion, figure 4, summarizes the major
    inputs, processes and resultant outputs of smart agriculture. FIGURE 4. Some key
    inputs, processes involved and possible outputs of smart farming. Show All New
    IoT-based fertilizing approaches help to estimate the spatial patterns of nutrients
    requirements with a higher accuracy and minimum labor requirements [40], [41].
    For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses aerial/satellite
    images to monitor crop nutrient status [42], [43]. Basically, NDVI is based on
    the reflection of visible and near-infrared light from vegetation and is used
    to estimate the crop health, vegetation vigor, and density, further contributing
    to assess the soil nutrient level. Such precise implementation can significantly
    improve the fertilizer efficiency, simultaneously reducing the side effects to
    the environment. Many recent enabling technologies, like GPS accuracy [44], geo
    mapping [45], Variable Rate Technology (VRT) [46], [47], and autonomous vehicles
    [48], are strongly contributing to IoT-based smart fertilization. Other than precision
    fertilization, fertigation [49] and chemigation [50], [51] are other benefits
    of IoT. In these methods, water-soluble matters, such as fertilizers, soil amendments,
    and pesticides, can be applied through the irrigation system. Although, these
    methods are not new to agriculture and have been applied over last three decades,
    their precise use with real results has been witnessed only with IoT integration
    [52], [53]. Based on recent outcomes, fertigation is considered as the best management
    practice to improve the effectiveness of many agriculture matters; most importantly,
    it can be integrated with IoT-based smart farming infrastructure seamlessly. D.
    Crop Disease and Pest Management The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato
    Famine, in which approximately one million Irish people died around 1950, resulted
    due to crop failure and yield reduction caused by “potato blight” disease [54].
    Even today, corn growers in the US and southern Canada are facing an economic
    loss of approximately one billion USD due to “southern corn leaf blight” disease
    [55]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 20–40% of global
    crop yields are lost annually due to pests and diseases [56]. To control such
    vast production losses, pesticides and other agrochemicals became an important
    component of the agriculture industry during the last century. It is estimated
    that, in each year, around half a million tons of pesticide are used in the US
    alone, while more than two-million tons are used globally [57]. Most of these
    pesticides are harmful to human and animal health, leaving severe, even irreversible,
    impact to the environment, ultimately causing significant contamination to entire
    ecosystems [58], [59]. Recent IoT based intelligent devices, such as wireless
    sensors, robots and drones are allowing the growers to slash pesticide uses significantly
    by precisely spotting crop enemies. Compared to traditional calendar or prescription
    based pest control procedures, modern IoT-based pest management provides real-time
    monitoring, modeling, disease forecasting, hence proving more effective [60],
    [61]. Generally, the reliability of crop disease monitoring and pest management
    depends on three aspects: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. The advanced disease
    and pest recognition approaches are based on image processing in which raw images
    are acquired throughout the crop area using field sensors, UAVs, or remote sensing
    satellites. Usually, remote sensing imagery covers large areas and, hence, offers
    higher efficiency with lower cost. On the other hand, field sensors are capable
    to support more functions in collecting data, like environment sampling, plant
    health, and pest situations, in every corner throughout the crop cycle. For example,
    IoT-based automated traps [62], [63] can capture, count, and even characterize
    insect types, further uploading data to the Cloud for detailed analysis, which
    is not possible through remote sensing. Approaches like vehicle precise spray
    and automatic VRT chemigation [64], commonly used under smart fertilization, can
    also be utilized for disease treatment and other pesticide applications. Moreover,
    the advancement of robotic technology offers new solutions. When equipping an
    agricultural robot with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    it can locate and deal with pest problems more precisely under the manipulation
    of a remote IoT disease management system. This IoT-based pest management system
    has many advantages, as it can reduce the overall expenditures while, at the same
    time, support the restoration of the natural climate. For example, recently, it
    has been found that yields of many crop types are facing severe threat due to
    the lack of pollination [65], [66]. In fact, the pollination is being affected
    due to bee colony collapse disorder resulting from the uncontrolled pesticides.
    E. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting Yield monitoring is the mechanism
    used to analyze various aspects corresponding to agricultural yield, like grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity. It helps to accurately
    assess by recording the crop yield and moisture level to estimate, how well the
    crop performed and what to do next. Yield monitoring is considered an essential
    part of precision farming not only at the time of harvest but even before that,
    as monitoring the yield quality plays a crucial role. Yield quality depends on
    many factors, e.g. sufficient pollination with good quality pollen especially
    when predicting seed yields under changing environmental conditions [67]–[69].
    Currently, when we are dealing with more open markets, buyers around the world
    become more particular about fruit quality; hence, effective production depends
    on the right fruit size to the right market at the right time [13]. Crop forecasting
    is an art to predict the yield and production (tons/ha) before the harvest takes
    place. This forecasting helps the farmer for near-future planning and decision
    making. Furthermore, analyzing the yield quality and its maturity is another critical
    factor which enables the determination of the right time for harvesting. This
    monitoring covers various development stages and uses fruit conditions like its
    color, size, etc., for this purpose. Predicting the right harvesting time not
    only helps to maximize the crop quality and production but also provides an opportunity
    to adjust the management strategy. Although, harvesting is the last stage of this
    process, proper scheduling can make a clear difference. To obtain the real benefits
    from crops, farmers need to know when these crops are actually ready to harvest.
    Figure 5 represents a snapshot of a farm area network (FAN) that can portrait
    the whole farm to the farmer in real time. FIGURE 5. An IoT based farm area network
    (FAN). Show All A yield monitor, developed in [70], can be installed on any harvester
    combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX, which displays live harvest data
    and uploads it automatically to the manufacturer’s web-based platform. This app
    has the ability to generate high-quality yield maps and share these maps with
    an agronomist, and the farmer also has the option to export to other farm management
    software to analyze them. To estimate the production and quality of yield precisely,
    the measurement of fruit growth can be highly beneficial. This idea is used in
    [71], where authors considered the fruit growth as the most basic and relevant
    parameter to estimate that how well the crop is progressing. Satellite images
    can be a good option to monitor the yield of crops with vast areas. This method
    is utilized in [72], where authors used Sentinel-1A Interferometric images to
    map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar. As we mentioned earlier in this
    section, fruit size always plays a critical role to estimate its maturation, making
    decisions regarding harvesting, and targeting the right market, for this purpose,
    color (RGB) depth images are used in [73] to track the different fruit conditions
    in mango farms. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used in [74] to monitor
    the shrinking of papayas, especially during drying conditions. SECTION III. Advanced
    Agricultural Practices Adopting the novel methods to enhance the quality and quantity
    of food is not something new, as humans have been doing this for centuries. Initially,
    we tried to enhance the crop production by focusing on seed variety, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. Soon it was realized that these conventional ways were not adequate
    enough to fit this demand gap; hence, agriculture scientists have begun thinking
    of other alternatives, like bioengineered (BE) foods. BE foods, also known as
    genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) foods, are foods produced
    by introducing changes into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.
    However, several studies highlight their serious effects on human health, including
    infertility, disruption in immune system, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulations,
    etc. [75], [76]. All these and many other similar technologies did not receive
    much popularity and acceptance in society because people prefer bio and organic
    food. In this regards, massive research has been conducted for decades in which
    sensors and IoT-based technologies are helping to improve conventional agriculture
    processes to enhance yield production without, or with minimum, effect on its
    originality. For this purpose, new sophisticated and more controlled environments
    are projected to tackle the above-mentioned issues. The importance and involvement
    of new technologies is more critical, as we are moving toward more cultured and
    urban farming. In fact, it would not be incorrect for one to say that the success
    of these advanced practices is in doubt without using sensor-based technologies.
    A. Greenhouse Farming Greenhouse farming is considered the oldest method of smart
    farming. Although, the idea of growing plants in controlled environment is not
    new as found since Roman times but it gained popularity in 19th century where
    largest greenhouses were built in France, Netherlands and Italy. Further, the
    practice was accelerated in the mid-20th century and highly promoted in countries
    that facing harsh weather conditions [77]. Crops grown indoors are very less affected
    by environment; most importantly, they are not limited to receiving light only
    during the daytime. As a result, the crops that traditionally could only be grown
    under suitable conditions or in certain parts of the world are now being growing
    anytime and anywhere. This was the actual time in which sensors and communication
    devices started to support various agriculture applications genuinely. The success
    and production of various crops under such controlled environment depend on many
    factors, like accuracy of monitoring parameters, structure of shed, covering material
    to control wind effects, ventilation system, decision support system, etc. A detailed
    analysis is provided in [78], where all these factors, their impacts, and how
    wireless sensors can help for all this are considered. Precise monitoring of environment
    parameters is the most critical task in modern greenhouses, where several measurement
    points of various parameters are required to control and ensure the local climate.
    In [79], an IoT-based prototype is proposed to monitor the greenhouses where MicaZ
    nodes are used to measure the inside parameters like humidity, temperature, light,
    and pressure. B. Vertical Farming The world needs more farmable lands to fulfill
    increased food demands, but reality is that one-third arable land was lost during
    the last four decades due to erosion and pollution [80], [81]. Unfortunately,
    current agricultural practices based on industrial farming are damaging the soil
    quality far faster than nature can rebuild it. Overall, it is estimated that erosion
    rates from cultivated fields is 10 to 40 times greater than the soil formation
    rates [82]. Considering the reduction of arable land issues, it could be a disaster
    for food production in the near future with current agriculture practices. Further,
    as we mentioned, 70% of fresh water is only used for agriculture purpose, which
    can increase the burden on existing limited water reservoirs. Vertical Farming
    (VF) is an answer to meet the challenges of land and water shortages. VF in the
    form of urban agriculture offers an opportunity to stack the plants in a more
    controlled environment resulting in, most importantly, significant reduction in
    resource consumption. By following this method, we can increase the production
    multiple times, as only a fraction of ground surface is required (depending on
    the number of stacks) as compared to traditional agriculture practices. Not only
    for ground surface, this system is highly efficient in terms of other resources,
    as well. For example, according to Mirai, a Japan based indoor farm developer
    presented the figures regarding a Japanese farm comprised of 25,000 square meters.
    The figures are highly encouraging, as it is producing 10,000 heads of lettuce
    per day (double the production when compared with traditional methods) and is,
    most importantly, consuming 40% less energy and up to 99% reduced water consumption
    compared to outdoor fields [83]. Aerofarms, a leader in VF, growing agricultural
    products with upto 390 times higher yields while utilizing 95% less water at Newark
    [84]. Under this farming method, many parameters are important, but CO2 measurements
    are most critical; hence, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors play a critical
    role to track and control the conditions in vertical farms. Boxed Gascard, developed
    by Edinburgh Sensors [85], is especially designed by considering such an environment,
    which employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR measurement system to enhance the stability
    and reduced optical complexity. Human hands are not required to touch the crops
    at any stage when following the IoT-connected vertical farm; this is the claim
    made by Mint Controls [86] developers who offer a wide range of solutions, like
    waste containers and sensors and their integration for various VF applications.
    C. Hydroponic In order to enhance the benefits of greenhouse farming, agriculture
    experts moved forward another step and provided the idea of hydroponic, a subset
    of hydroculture in which plants are grown without soil. Hydroponic is based on
    an irrigation system in which balanced nutrients are dissolved in water and crop
    roots stay in that solution; in some cases, roots can be supported by medium like
    perlite or gravel. When combining hydroponics with VF, a farm of 100 sq. meters
    can produce the crop equivalent to 1 acre of traditional farm, most importantly
    upto 95% less water and fertilizers utilization and without pesticides/herbicides
    [87]. Currently, available systems and sensors e.g. [88], [89] are not only used
    to monitor a range of parameters and take readings at predefined intervals but,
    also, the measurements are stored so that can be used to analyze and diagnostic
    purpose later on. Under this application, the precision of nutrient measurements
    is crucial, as such, a highly reliable wireless control system for tomato hydroponics
    is proposed in [90] in which they focused on various communication standards that
    are least effected by plants’ presence and their growth. The monitoring of solution
    contents and their precision is most critical under this method; for this purpose,
    many systems are offered to check the presence of contents considering the plant
    demands. In [91] a wireless-sensor-based prototype is proposed to deliver a turn-key
    solution for the hydroponic cultivation which offers real-time measurements for
    soilless indoor growing. Further, a compact sensor module is presented in [92],
    which uses oscillator circuits to measure the presence and concentrations of various
    nutrients and water levels. D. Phenotyping The previously discussed smart methods
    look more promising for the future of agriculture, as they are already being used
    to produce different crop products under precise environments. Other than these,
    a few advanced techniques are under experiment to further enhance the crop capabilities
    by controlling their limitations with the help of advanced sensing and communication
    technologies. Among these methods, the more prominent is phenotyping, which is
    based on emerging crop engineering, which links plant genomics with its ecophysiology
    and agronomy, as shows in Figure 6. The progress in molecular and genetic tools
    for various crop breeding was significant in the last decade. However, a quantitative
    analysis of the crop behavior, e.g. grain weight, pathogen resistance, etc., was
    limited due to the lack of efficient techniques and technologies that we can now
    enjoy. FIGURE 6. The process of phenotyping [96]. Show All Research investigations,
    completed in [93], conclude that plant phenotyping can be highly beneficial to
    investigate the quantitative characteristics, such as those are responsible for
    its growth, yield quality and quantity, and resistance capabilities to handle
    various stresses. Similarly, the role of sensing technologies and image-based
    phenotyping are highlighted in [94] and describes how these solutions can help
    to boost the progress not only for screening numerous biostimulants but also their
    role in understanding the mode of actions. Furthermore, an IoT-based phenotyping
    platform, CropQuant, is designed to monitor the crop and relevant trait measurements
    that can provide facility for crop breeding and digital agriculture [95]. Here,
    an automatic in-field control system was developed to process the data generated
    by platform. The provided trait analyses algorithms and machine-learning modeling
    help to explore the relation among the genotypes, phenotypes, and environment
    where it grows. SECTION IV. Major Equipment and Technologies Different from ancient
    farming, most of the tasks in modern, large-scale agriculture are being done by
    heavy and urbane equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and other robots which
    are fully or partially supported by remote sensing and other communication technologies.
    In precision agriculture, when tasks like sowing, fertilizing, irrigation, and
    harvesting are being performed, the operating vehicles are equipped with GPS and
    GIS facilities so that they can work precisely, site-specifically, and autonomously.
    In fact, the idea of site-specific crop management is not possible without involving
    the recent advanced technologies. The success of precision agriculture is based
    on the accuracy of collected data, which is usually done in two ways [10]. The
    first entails the usage of multifunctional imaginary devices equipped with remote
    sensing platforms, such as satellites, agriculture airplanes, balloons, and UAVs;
    the second is from various types of sensors—those that are mostly deployed for
    specific purpose across various sites of our interest. The gathered data is identified
    with the precise location information by using GPS devices so that the site-specific
    treatment can be provided afterwards. Agriculture has transformed during the last
    few decades from small/medium farming operations to highly industrialized and
    commercial farming. This transition allows the leading corporations to treat agriculture
    like other industries, e.g., manufacturing where the measurements, data, and control
    are very important to provide a balance between costs and production in order
    to boost the profits. Accordingly, every aspect of agriculture that can be automated,
    digitally planned, and managed will benefit from IoT technologies and solutions.
    Based on this fact, efforts are being focused to offer more sophisticated tools
    such as agricultural robots to perform a range of activities, like planting, watering,
    weeding, picking, thinning, fertilizing, spraying, packing and transporting. This
    revolution is being driven not only due to the advancement of technology, but
    is also a result of factors like fear of losing the low-cost labor, most importantly
    need for better and cheaper food. Based on these facts, during the period of 2017
    to 2022, the global smart farming market is predicted to rise at a growth rate
    of 19.3% per year to touch $23.14 billion in 2022 [97]. Here it is worth mentioning
    that UAV/drones are generating and further expected to generate the highest revenue
    amongst all agricultural robots utilized in smart farming (UAVs are discussed
    in Section V). Evergreen demand for higher crop yield, increased incorporation
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in farming and the rapid global
    climatic changes are some of the major drivers resulting to such high market growth.
    Manufacturers in the market offer a variety of products and solutions, mostly
    based on sensors and efficient communication for a range of applications; a few
    are shown in figure 7. The key technologies and equipment’s that are currently
    available for this purpose are discussed in following. FIGURE 7. Selected IoT
    based products and prototypes for smart agriculture. Show All A. Wireless Sensors
    Among all the equipment for smart farming currently available in the market, wireless
    sensors are the most crucial and play a key role when it comes to collecting the
    crop conditions and other information. Wireless sensors are being used standalone
    wherever required, further integrated with almost every portion of advanced agricultural
    tools and heavy machinery, depending on application requirements. In the following,
    major sensor types are discussed according to their working procedure and purpose
    and the benefits they offer. 1) Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors offer a miscellaneous
    appliance in farm management, including soil cultivation, weeding, fruit harvesting,
    etc.; the main benefit of this technology is its low-cost solutions with fast
    response, especially when considering portable equipment. It functions by measuring
    the change in the noise level as the tool interacts with other materials, e.g.,
    soil particles [98]. Acoustic sensors are commonly used for pest monitoring and
    detection [99] and classifying the seed varieties according to their sound absorption
    spectra [100]. 2) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Sensors FPGA based
    sensors are starting to be used in agriculture recently due to their flexibility
    of reconfiguration. The major options where these can be employed include measuring
    real-time plant transpiration, irrigation, and humidity [101], [102]. However,
    their utilization in agriculture is in the early stages due to their limitations,
    such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors require more power; hence,
    they are not suitable for continuous monitoring, further high in cost even compromising
    on performance [103]. By overcoming these issues, FPGA-based sensors can offer
    satisfactory solutions according to specific application requirements. 3) Optical
    Sensors These sensors use light reflectance phenomena and help to measure soil
    organic substances, soil moisture and color, presence of minerals and their composition,
    clay content, etc. [104], [105]. These sensors test the soil’s ability to reflect
    light based on different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The changes occurred
    in wave reflections help to indicate the changes in soil density and other parameters.
    Fluorescence-based optical sensors are used for basic plant assessment, especially
    to supervise the fruit maturation [106]. Further, when integrating optical sensors
    with microwave scattering, it can be used for characterizing grove canopies, like
    olives and other similar crops [107]. 4) Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors Sensors of
    this category are considered a good choice being low cost, potential to operate
    in a variety of applications, and ease of use and adjustability, such as the sampling
    rate. Common uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (e.g., boom
    height and width control in order to perform uniform spray coverage, object detection,
    and collision avoidance), and monitoring crop canopy [108], [109]. When combined
    with a camera, these sensors can then be used for the weed detection [110], where
    the heights of plants are identified using the ultrasonic sensors and the camera
    determines the weed and crop coverage. 5) Optoelectronic Sensors Optoelectronic
    sensors can differentiate plant type; hence, they help to detect weeds, herbicides,
    and other unwanted plants, especially in wide-row crops [111]. When combining,
    an optoelectronic sensor and location information, it can map the weed distribution
    and resolution [112]. Optoelectronic sensors are also capable of differentiating
    between vegetation and soil from their reflection spectra. 6) Airflow Sensors
    These sensors are capable of measuring soil air permeability and percentage of
    moisture and identifying soil structure to distinguish different types of soils.
    Measurements can be made at singular locations or dynamically while in motion,
    e.g., can be used on a fixed position or in mobile mode. The desired output is
    the pressure required to push a predetermined amount of air into the ground at
    a prescribed depth. It follows the procedure of various soil properties, including
    compaction, structure, and moisture levels, producing unique identifying signatures
    [113]. 7) Electrochemical Sensors These are mostly used to assess the significant
    soil characteristics to analyze the soil nutrient levels, such as pH [114]. The
    standard chemical soil analysis, which are mostly expensive and time consuming,
    can be easily substituted with these sensors. To be more precise, the macro and
    micro nutrients in the soil, salinity and pH [115], are measured using sensors
    of this nature. 8) Electromagnetic Sensors Electromagnetic sensors are used to
    record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response, identify
    electrical response, and adjust variable rate applications in the actual situation.
    Sensors based on this technology use electric circuits to measure the capability
    of soil particles to conduct or accumulate electrical charge, which is mostly
    done by the following two methods: contact or non-contact [116]. Residual nitrates
    and organic matter in the soil can also be measured using the electromagnetic
    sensors, as done in [117]. 9) Mechanical Sensors Mechanical sensors assess the
    soil mechanical resistance (compaction) to indicate the variable level of compaction.
    The mechanical sensors enter or cut through the soil and record the force assessed
    by strain gauges or load cells [118]. A pressure unit is used to measure the soil’s
    mechanical resistance, which is actually the ratio of the force needed to go into
    the soil medium using the frontal part of the tool, actually engaged with the
    soil. 10) Mass Flow Sensors Category of this sensors are used for yield monitoring,
    as it provides the yield information by measuring the amount of grain flow, e.g.,
    when passing through the combine harvester. Sensing the mass flow of grain to
    determine the crop yield is not new, as it has been performed the last two decades
    [119]. The mass flow sensor is the most critical component, but, overall, the
    yield monitoring system consists of several other modules, like the grain moisture
    sensor, data storage device, and an internal software to analyze the data, which
    are within the interface provided in the John Deere tractors [120]. 11) Eddy Covariance-Based
    Sensors This type of sensors can be used for quantifying exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, methane or other gases, and energy between the surface of the earth
    and the atmosphere. This method offers an accurate way to measure surface-atmosphere
    fluxes of energy and trace gas fluxes over a variety of ecosystems for, most importantly,
    agricultural applications [121]. Currently, the sensors based on this technology
    are preferred over other similar options, like the close chamber, due to high
    precision and its ability to measuring continuous flux over large areas [122].
    12) Soft Water Level-Based (SWLB) Sensors SWLB sensors are being utilized in agriculture
    catchments to characterize hydrological behaviors, such as water level and flow,
    at adjustable time-step acquisitions. This is done by measuring rainfalls, stream
    flows, and other water presence options [11], [123]. 13) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) This technology is widely used in a range of agriculture applications,
    such as land mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, farm 3D modelling,
    monitoring erosion and soil loss, and yield forecasting [124]–[126]. LiDAR is
    also commonly used to obtain dynamic measurement information regarding fruit-tree
    leaf area, and, when combined with GPS, it can produce a 3D map [127]. Moreover,
    this technology is often used when estimating the biomass of various crops and
    trees [128]. 14) Telematics Sensors Telematics sensors support telecommunication
    between two places—more precisely, among two vehicles when considering the agriculture-based
    applications. Telemetry sensors are used to collect data from remote locations
    (especially inaccessible points), operations of machines that report on how the
    components are working, and record location and travel routes to avoid visiting
    the same patch [129]. These services enable farm managers to record and store
    all information related to farm operations automatically, which maximizes the
    utilization of environmental benefits, further can minimize threats like farm
    equipment theft as utilized in [130], [131]. 15) Remote Sensing Sensors belong
    to this category are used to capture and store the geographic information, further
    analyze, manipulate, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data.
    Similar to LiDAR, these sensors also found significant use in agriculture applications
    including crop assessment, forecasting yield dates, yield modelling and forecasting,
    identification of plants and pests, land cover and degradation mapping etc [132]–[134].
    Argos sensor is one of leading example, a satellite-based sensor system used to
    collect, process and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide [135]. Moreover, automatic packet reporting system (APRS) is being integrated
    to report telemetry data through satellite communication [136]. Table 1 lists
    a few sensors to provide the idea about their possible uses and the environment
    where they can be placed. TABLE 1 Some Selected Sensors and Their Possible Uses
    in IoT Based Agriculture B. IoT Based Tractors As rural labor resources have started
    to come under stress due to the expansion of the crop industry, tractors and other
    automatic heavy machinery started to enter the agriculture sector. Where available,
    an average size tractor can work 40 times faster with significantly less expenses
    than traditional farm labor [157]. To fulfill the continuously increasing demands,
    agricultural-based equipment manufacturers, like John Deere, Hello Tractors, Case
    IH and CNH (New Holland), have started to provide better solutions focusing on
    the grower’s requirements. With the advancement of technology, most of these manufacturers
    are offering tractors with automatic-driven and even Cloud-computing capabilities.
    This technology is not new, as self-driving tractors have been in the market even
    before semi-autonomous cars. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors
    is their ability to avoid revisiting the same area or row by reducing the overlap
    even less than an inch. In addition, they can make very precise turns without
    a driver’s physical presence. This facility offers better precision with reduced
    errors, especially when spraying insecticide or targeting weeds; those are mostly
    unavoidable when a human controls the machinery. Although, at the moment, no fully
    autonomous tractor is available in market, many researchers and manufactures are
    hardly working to mature the technology. Based on current progress and future
    demands of high-tech tractors, it is predicated that around 700,000 tractors equipped
    with facilities like autosteer or tractor guidance will be sold in 2028 [158],
    while the same study expects that around 40,000 unmanned, fully-autonomous (level
    5) tractors will be sold in 2038 [159]. When talking about such cultured machines,
    most farmers can’t afford to own them while most of the tractor service providers
    and manufacturers operate well below their potential. Considering the challenge,
    Hello Tractor has developed a solution to sort these issues. The company has developed
    a low-cost monitoring device that can be placed on any tractor, provides powerful
    software and analytics tools [160]. The benefits of this device are twofold- on
    one side it ensures that overall cost of tractor remains affordable for the most
    of growers while at the same time it monitors the condition of the tractor and
    reports if any problems occur. The software connects tractor’s owner to farmers
    in need of tractor services, just like Uber for tractors. Another major example
    is Case IH’s Magnum series [161] tractor which uses on board video cameras and
    LiDAR sensors for object detection and collision avoidance. Recently, Case IH
    used this tractor to plant soybeans by following the concept of autonomous tractors.
    In another development made by standards group ETSI where world’s first tractor
    connected to a car in France, using IoT [162] to control the accidents due to
    farm vehicles. After collecting all the important crop data, the next step is
    pushing computing from the Cloud to the edge, as John Deere [163] wants. In their
    proposed system, an analytics engine works locally on the farmer’s tractor rather
    than in the Cloud in order to adjust the local inputs. For this purpose, they
    considered all the existing analytics and recommendations to modify the current
    data in real time depending on the field conditions. Based on this phenomenon,
    the manufacturer is bringing their tractors to next level by connecting their
    machine to the Internet and creating a method to display the information wherever
    farmer wants to see it. C. Harvesting Robots Harvesting is the most critical stage
    during the production process, as this last phase dictates the crop’s output and,
    ultimately, its success. In some crops, this is done a single time while, in some
    others, performed several times, even on a daily basis, as crop reaches a certain
    stage. Harvesting the crop at the right time is very critical, as doing so either
    early or late can affect the production significantly. When talking about the
    labor, it is estimated that the US faces a $3.1 billion decline in crop production
    on a yearly basis due to labor shortage [164]. Not only this, but, according to
    a study conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, overall 14 %
    of farm costs go to wages and labor costs, while it can be upto 39% in some labor
    intensive farms [165]. Considering the worth of this stage and labor issues, farm
    experts expect that involvement of agriculture robotics may not only ease the
    labor pressure but also provide the flexibility to harvest whenever needed. In
    order to automate the harvesting process and make it more precise, the role of
    robots has been increasing over the recent decades. Considering the robot services,
    many researchers have done intensive research in order to mature the sensitivity
    of fruit detection, its shape, size, color, and localization [166]–[169]. Automatic
    harvesting of fruits requires deep investigation of sophisticated sensors that
    are capable of collecting precise and unambiguous information of that particular
    crop and fruit. The task of detecting the right target in natural scenes is not
    simple since most of the fruits are occluded partially—sometimes even fully—under
    the leaves and branches or are overlapped with other fruits [170]. Here, most
    of the prominent studies found in regard to this purpose are deeply based on computer
    vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques. This process needs
    very specialized and sophisticated tools to differentiate the fruit conditions,
    as there are more than sixty shapes, sizes, and colors for a pepper alone when
    it is ready to harvest. Considering such complexity, many robots are being developed
    for specific crops. Some of the leading robots being used for crop harvesting
    include SW 6010 [171] and Octinion [172] for strawberries, SWEEPER robot [173]
    for peppers, and FFRobot [174] for tree-based fruits like apples which can pick
    up to 10,000 fruits per hour. Strawberries are one of the most consumed fruits,
    available mostly throughout the year while labor is the major contributor to the
    high cost of this fruit, especially during harvesting and packaging stages [175].
    As the strawberry farms are grown mostly under greenhouse systems hence the harvesting
    robots are designed to move on defined paths like rails where the translational
    motion is restricted and robots can move backward and forward only. Robots developed
    by Agrobot are able to collect strawberries along the side of strawberry plant
    rows in the field, further packed by human operators [176]. For example, SW6010
    by Agrobot is a specialized and semi-automatic robot towards the specific task
    of strawberry harvesting [177]. Tektu T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable strawberry
    harvester run silently with zero emission inside the poly-tunnels [178]. The installed
    pickers are able to position over the crop rows and gather the fruit quickly and
    efficiently, directly into punnets. D. Communication in Agriculture Communication
    and reporting the information on a timely basis are considered the backbone of
    precision agriculture. The real purpose cannot be achieved unless a firm, reliable,
    and secure connection among various participating objects is provided. To achieve
    communication reliability, telecom operators can play a crucial role in the agricultural
    sector. If we truly want to implement IoT on a large scale in the agriculture
    industry, we have to provide a suitably large architecture. Here, the factors
    like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability are critical and have
    to be considered before choosing the mean of communication. Low-energy networks
    can provide connectivity only on one site and mostly do not offer services in
    remote areas where sensed data need to be transmitted to the farm management system
    (FMS). Depending on availability, scalability and application requirements, various
    communication modes and technologies are being used for this purpose, most common
    are discussed here, 1) Cellular Communication Cellular communication modes from
    2G to 4G can be suitable, depending on the purpose and bandwidth requirement;
    however, the reliability, and even availability, of a cellular network in rural
    areas is a major concern. To tackle this, data transmission via satellite is another
    option, but, here, the cost of this communication mode is very high, which makes
    it not suitable for small- and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication
    mode also depends on application requirements, such as some farms required sensors
    that can operate with low data rate but need to work for long periods hence demand
    long battery life. For such scenarios, a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is considered a better solution for cellular connectivity, not only in
    terms of long battery life but also a larger connectivity range with affordable
    rates (2 to 15 USD per year) [179]. Currently, crop and pasture management are
    two of the main applications where LPWAN networks are highly suitable, and, further
    considering its success, it can be utilized in many other farming-related uses.
    Besides WAN connectivity option, many short range and medium level communications
    are being used in mesh networks [180]. For example, a mesh-network of sensor nodes
    collects data and transmits it to the gateway which is located somewhere in the
    same area. The gateway further sends this data to the farm management system using
    the WAN network. The communication technologies used within the mesh networks
    vary e.g. Bluetooth and Zigbee can be used to provide connectivity for peer-to-peer
    wireless communications. From here, the sensed data forwarded to the FMS, which
    gathers and analyses the information about all the activities happening at different
    parts even the historical data regarding the weather and climate updates, economic,
    products being used and their specifications etc, in short making it decision
    farming. It is important to mention that, the communication technology has its
    own worth but the FMS also plays a critical role which must be custom designed
    considering the specific application requirements. Generally, based on communication
    data rates and power consumption, wireless sensors for agriculture applications
    are divided in three broad categories as shown in table 2. TABLE 2 Data and Power
    Specifications of Wireless Sensors Commonly Used for Agriculture Applications
    2) Zigbee Zigbee is primarily designed for a wide range of applications especially
    to replace existing non-standard technologies. Depending on the application requirements,
    the devices based on this protocol can be one of three types including Coordinator,
    Router and End User. Further, three different topologies are supported by Zigbee
    networks named, Start, Cluster Tree and Mesh [34]. Based on these characteristics,
    and further considering the agriculture application requirements, Zigbee can play
    vital role especially targeting the greenhouse environment where usually short
    range communications are required. During monitoring the various parameters, the
    real time data from the sensor node is transferred through Zigbee to end server.
    For the applications like, irrigation and fertilization, Zigbee modules are networked
    for communication, e.g. in drip irrigation used to monitor soil contents like
    moisture. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field data
    where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the shorter
    distances. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that connects
    small-head devices together over shorter distances usually cooperating in a close
    proximity. Due to its advantages of low power requirements, easy to use and low
    cost, this technology is being utilized in many smart farming applications. Further,
    Bluetooth making advancements in many IoT systems with the release of Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) or commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. The study conducted in
    [181] which tests Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller) with ICS (integrated
    control strategy), timer control and soil moisture control approach for smart
    irrigation. The target of this study is to find an optimum utilization of water
    and energy consumption for various greenhouse or field applications. A moisture
    and temperature sensor based on BLE is developed in [182] especially focusing
    on the agriculture environments and weather conditions of crop fields. Here the
    reason of choosing BLE for communication purpose is due to its inherent support
    for smart phone accessibility. Further, a similar effort is done in [183] where
    a new sensor node is designed to monitor ambient light and temperature employing
    BLE communication protocol preferable for IoT based agriculture applications.
    Other than short range, WiFi is utilized whenever LAN communications are required
    in smart agriculture. Along short range connectivity, WiFi is utilized whenever
    LAN communications are required in smart agriculture. Study presented in [184]
    investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the sensor nodes were
    based on WSN802G modules. The deployed nodes communicate wirelessly with a central
    server, which is responsible to collect and store the monitored data and further
    allow displaying the information after required analysis. 4) LoRa LoRa wireless
    technology is a long-range, low-power platform used extensively in IoT applications.
    Being low in power consumption, it offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless
    sensors and the Cloud. It has proved itself much more effective and reliable than
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. especially in restaurants or kitchen environments. Sensors
    based on LoRa can be installed in smaller devices for reliable monitoring. Most
    importantly, LoRa signals can penetrate thick and insulated objects, even buildings,
    and can, hence, cover a larger network area. Overall, LoRa-based networks perform
    higher in terms of lifespan and, at the same time, pose reduced maintenance and
    upkeep burden [185]. Considering the advantages, many researchers tested this
    communication method in kitchens, storage rooms, and transport systems. In [186],
    a test was conducted in a warehouse with a capacity to store 40 tons of apples,
    and results show that it provided full coverage, where the temperature and airflow
    readings transferred successfully with a packet rate of more the 96%. Similarly,
    [187] presents a system to achieve information traceability in the grain transport
    system to ensure the food quality by monitoring the temperature and humidity levels.
    5) Sigfox Sigfox is also used to provide network connectivity services to low-powered
    objects as “things” required. It is based on narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology;
    hence, it takes very narrow chunks of spectrum and changes the phase of the carrier
    radio wave to encode the data. Based on these characteristics, it offers high
    level performance, even if 100 sensors need to transmit data at the same time,
    as experiments done in [188]. Figure 8 gives an idea that how end-to-end communication
    possibilities can be divided in various layers to interact with each other in
    order to provide the services for smart agriculture. FIGURE 8. End to end communication
    for smart farming. Show All E. Smartphones Despite its availability concerns for
    remote fields, cellular communication is the major technology in rural areas;
    mobile phones are a very common source and primary mode of communication whenever
    the need arises to contact or update most of the farming community. Recent advancements
    in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp price decreases, making this
    industry more attractive, especially to the smallholder growers in remote areas.
    The rapid spread of cellular networks in developing countries offers the opportunity
    to reach remote and dispersed farms with improved services. Mobile-phone-based
    agriculture services (m-services) are far from their assumed potential; according
    to an analysis done by GSM Association, only at 8 per cent [189]. However, the
    flexibility and functionality, such as the camera, GPS, microphone accelerometer,
    proximity, and gyroscope, attract the IT experts, and they are developing more
    appealing mobile apps that consider the farmer’s various needs [190], [191]. The
    conclusion of FAO’s 10-year investigations states that “solid information is needed
    regarding the impact of previous initiatives, including lessons learned, in order
    to inform the design and approach of future efforts” [192]. Interestingly, the
    smartphone is the first device that comes to mind when planning how to achieve
    this goal, especially considering the often dispersed and poorly serviced areas.
    Recent years have seen rapid expansion of research, with researchers conducting
    a growing number of studies and developing various models to highlight the scope
    of smartphone crop applications. These researchers mostly belong to developing
    nations, as proposed systems are based primarily in countries like Kenya [193],
    [194], Ghana [195], [196], Nigeria [197], [198], Mali [199], Uganda [200], and
    Zimbabwe [201], [202]. Although, the scope of smartphone utilization in agriculture
    has been more commonly observed in Africa, experiments in countries like Cameroon
    [203], China [204], [205], Turkey [206], [207], and India [208], [209] are also
    increasing. Analysing the success of m-services depends on many factors. One of
    the most comprehensive studies regarding the use of mobile phones for various
    agriculture applications was conducted to review all the important factors [210].
    This study concludes that the service will be of no effect if the developer of
    the application does not truly understand the farmer needs. Obviously, the most
    important factor for such applications is that the farmer should access and use
    them. In other words, an easy-to-use, free or low-cost app that supports various
    languages could attract the farmer’s attention. In addition, developers should
    study and consider the relevant factors before making their suggestions. For example,
    market prices are of great interest to farmers, but would be of no use in cases
    of bad roads and unavailability of proper transport vehicles. The developers should
    target the problems of the wider community instead of focusing only on farmers,
    considering the transporters, brokers, and other agriculture experts as well.
    Unfortunately, most of the applications are developed on growers’ perceptions,
    instead of using independent and verified market data. For this purpose, the developer
    should not only focus on the data retrieved by independent investigators but also
    assess it under various usage patterns covering longer durations. Table 3 lists
    smartphone based sensors that are attracting the researchers to utilize them for
    various agriculture purposes. While, last column provide some of the references
    where these sensors have been used. Further, Table 4 includes some of the important
    mobile apps developed for various agriculture applications along their features
    and achievements. TABLE 3 Smartphone Based Sensors That Being Used in Various
    Agriculture Applications TABLE 4 Selected Important Smartphone Applications for
    Various Agriculture Applications F. Cloud Computing Precision agriculture is showing
    its potential and benefits by improving agricultural operations through better
    data-driven decision making. However, to continue this success, precision agriculture
    not only requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently but
    also at a reasonable cost such that the received data can be used to make field
    decisions efficiently. For this purpose, farmers can use Cloud services to access
    information from predictive analysis institutes so that they can choose the right
    product available according to their specific requirements. Cloud computing offers
    an edge to farmers to use knowledge-based repositories that contain a treasure
    of information and experiences related to farming practices as well as on equipment
    options available in the market with the necessary details. In most cases, all
    this comes along with expert advice from a wide range of sources (for example,
    on farming and the processing of agricultural products). To make it more effective,
    the scenario can be extended further to include access to consumer databases,
    supply chains, and billing systems. Surely, moving towards Cloud-based services
    offer opportunities to explore advancements, but it comes with new challenges,
    as well. First, a vast range of sensors are being developed and used in precision
    agriculture, each of which has its own data format and semantics. Secondly, most
    of the decision-support systems are application-specific while, on the other hand,
    a farmer can be in the need of accessing various systems for a specific application,
    e.g., soil monitoring. Considering both of these cases, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system not only needs to handle the diversity of data and their formats but also
    must be able to configure these formats for different applications. An open Cloud-based
    system has been established by AgJunction [243] which gathers and disseminates
    the data on a form from different precise agriculture controllers, leading to
    a decrease in costs and environmental impacts. Furthermore, “Akisai” Cloud [244],
    proposed by Fujitsu, focuses on food and agricultural industries and incorporates
    information communication technology for increasing the food supply in the coming
    years. Similarly, SourceTrace developed and offering Cloud-based mobile applications
    to provide visibility and relations between farms and markets, further tracking
    the value chain at the source, e.g., ’eService Everywhere’ [245]. An important
    note about their applications is that, during the development, they considered
    the farms’ remoteness and low bandwidth environments. Figure 9 presents possible
    infrastructure and relationship scenario of fluid computing including Edge, Mist
    and Fog for smart agriculture. FIGURE 9. Fluid computing infrastructure for smart
    farming. Show All SECTION V. UAVs in Agriculture Recently, the IoT has made remarkable
    progress in many industries, including farming sectors like poultry, fishing,
    etc. but when we talk about agriculture, the communication facilities like base
    stations or Wi-Fi are very limited, which prevents the growth of the IoT in this
    sector. Such communication infrastructure and related facilities are even worst
    in developing counties and rural areas, which is one of the major hurdles when
    introducing the IoT in the agriculture industry. The data acquired through the
    wireless sensors cannot be transmitted in the absence of reliable communication
    infrastructure. In such a scenario, UAVs offer an alternative, as they visit and
    communicate with the wireless sensors spread over large areas in order to harvest
    data for further processing and analysis. Furthermore, UAVs, better known as drones,
    fitted with high-resolution cameras and precise sensors, can be flown over thousands
    of hectares of farms. The role of surveillance in all agriculture applications
    is highly critical, especially in forestry and crop monitoring due to the need
    to cover large areas [246]. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, real-time, and large-scale
    surveillance supported with an accurate data acquisition and transmission facility
    is crucial for agriculture production. Currently, mostly two options are used
    to obtain aerial images of a field area: satellite and airplanes. Both of them
    are good for a macro view of a landscape, but they face serious issues in terms
    of quality when it comes to micro views. These macro-view images are not good
    in resolution and cannot offer the image quality which is required during the
    analyses and decision making. Secondly, not only the resolution but visiting frequency
    also matters and, through both of these, it is not simple to take and collect
    images frequently (on average, four times a month [247]). Another serous issue
    is that these operate above the cloud level where there is a strong possibility
    that both are obstructed in bad weather. When we talk about UAVs that provide
    an “eye in sky”, we can overcome— or even eliminate— the above mentioned issues
    when we consider the micro views. The quality of images taken through UAVs depends
    on the attached camera’s resolution—normally dozens of times better than satellite
    images—and, most importantly, we can adjust according to application requirements.
    More specifically, UAVs supports faster and better NDVI to assess crop conditions,
    like weed mapping, leaf assessments, etc., and provide immediate feedback so that
    farmers can take timely actions. Similarly, UAVs are better in terms of frequency,
    even if requires multiple times in a single day, and are also the option least
    affected by weather conditions, unless it is raining. Due to the mentioned advantages,
    UAVs are considered the future of precision agriculture, and this is the reason
    they are generating the highest revenue amongst all agricultural robots developed
    for precision agriculture. According to quoted figures by a report published by
    FAO in 2018, it is estimated that the agriculture drone-related market to be worth
    USD 32.4 billion [248]. The current condition of the entire field is one of the
    most valuable pieces of information to obtain in the precision program. With the
    help of this collected data, a farmer can spot problems early and rapidly; hence,
    appropriate interventions can be applied. Agricultural drones represent a new
    way to collect field-level data; the results are on-demand whenever and wherever
    needed, as the drone can be easily and quickly deployed. Most importantly, it
    is not all about their hardware but the convenience, quality, and utility they
    are offering, as the drone-enabled surveillance offers the real facility to have
    an idea of what is happening in the farm fields at that moment. The UAVs, used
    for agricultural applications usually fall into two categories: fixed-wing and
    multi-rotor drones [249] (figure 10). Although both are available in various ranges
    in terms of cost, payload capacity and mostly distinguished based on hardware
    differences. For example, when it is required to cover a large area, fixed-wing
    drones are suggested due to their long-range flight capacity, most importantly
    they are crash tolerant e.g senseFly’s eBee SQ [250] and DATAhawk [251]. On the
    other hand, multi-rotor drones are more common due to their easy and faster set
    up as can take off and land vertically. Multi-rotors actually have many advantages
    over the fixed wings as they are easier to operate, require no advance wind planning
    and have the ability to fly more precisely. Moreover, in scenarios where low altitude
    flight is required in order to capture extremely detailed images, which is more
    common in agriculture applications then the multi-rotor are considered the better
    choice, some major examples belongs to this type are DJI Matrice 200 [252] and
    Introducing Scout by American Robotics [253] which considered a fully autonomous
    drone for daily agriculture scouting. FIGURE 10. Types of agricultural drones.
    Show All Generally, drones collect information through the light reflected by
    the ground it is maneuvering, over, either from soil or plants. For agricultural
    applications, specific cameras and sensors are used, depending on the grower’s
    interest—most commonly mentioned are thermal and hyper-spectral. Thermal sensors
    can help to recognize the water quantity, as leaves of plants with more water
    access appear cooler in an image. The same phenomenon is used in near-infrared
    (NIR) sensors; commonly used to note the difference between the NIR reflectance
    and the visible reflectance, such as NDVI [254]. The resultant NDVI-based images
    help to distinguish the water stress areas, as shown in figure 11. Hyper-spectral
    based sensors or cameras record the wavelengths of both visible and invisible
    lights, are able to identify the specific type of plant by measuring the color
    of reflected light. This reflected light is used to distinguish various plant
    types, ultimately helping to detect the unwanted herbicide and weeds [255]. The
    idea is used in [256], where authors used the multispectral images to classify
    various weeds. FIGURE 11. NDVI based water stress map of 160 acre walnut orchard
    [258]. Show All Due to their nature and flexibility, UAVs are being used in a
    range of agricultural applications, including crop health monitoring, planting,
    plant counting, spraying, agriculture photography, and many other variable rate
    applications. After being equipped with automation and GPS capabilities, they
    are ready to take the agriculture sector to a further-modernized level. With every
    passing day, drones are becoming more inexpensive and reliable, hence, making
    themselves an ideal choice for new farming applications. Focusing on the success
    of this technology, SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products), one of the largest
    vendors of enterprise resource planning, has brought three of its major technologies
    together in order to make the information harvested through UAVs more effective
    [257]. The technologies include the HANA, a Cloud database which supports speedy
    data capture, retrieval, and analytics; the Leonardo IoT suite to connect and
    exchange information over any protocol; and the Connected Agriculture suite to
    provide a GUI-based, graphical-use interface to the farmers. While it depends
    on the situation, in most cases, few hours delays doesn’t leave serious impact
    in most of the agriculture applications but flight time is more important as need
    to cover larger areas due field vastness. Not only vastness, but in some applications
    of pesticide and fertilizer, UAVs need to carry heavy payloads. In such situations,
    optimum battery utilization becomes crucial to extend the flight time. For this
    purpose, many factors can be considered to increase the drone efficiency. Firstly,
    when flying, choose right conditions e.g. weather or air direction. Next, try
    to include optimum payload and place it appropriately. For this situation, it
    can be helpful to attach the payload near the field, better in smaller quantities
    and the refilling again instead of putting heavy quantities. Further, depending
    on area size and visiting frequency, optimum path selection plays a critical role.
    For this purpose, many routing schemes like [259], [260] are proposed especially
    for the UAVs so choosing and implementing the right scheme can provide clear difference.
    Considering the application of pesticide and UAV based irrigation where drone
    need to fly with heavy payloads then new procedures like tethering system can
    be helpful. In UAV tethering, a connection that provide power through the long
    cable, is provided so that it can fly as long as you have power backup on the
    ground, most importantly it doesn’t require to lift heavy batteries. Currently,
    agriculture is being considered one of the most favorable fields where UAVs can
    offer solutions to resolve many dominant and long-lasting issues. Some of key
    areas in which drones are already playing key roles to assist farmers throughout
    the crop cycle are highlighted below. A. Soil and Field Analysis Drones are able
    to produce precise information to analyze the soil before sowing the crop, which
    helps to determine the most suitable crop for specific land; furthermore, it suggests
    the seed type and its planting patterns. In [261] authors shared their experimental
    results using Sirius I, a fixed-wing aircraft, affixed with a Lumix GF1 digital
    camera by Panasonic to capture images from different sites to monitor the soil
    erosion issues in Morocco. Similarly, authors in [262] targeted the issues of
    soil analyses where they used Lumix DMC-LX 3 to take the images and Pix4UAV for
    mapping the results. B. Planting Millions of acres of land are currently under-utilized
    due to being human inaccessible or lack of suitable workers. Safety concerns of
    rough terrain are main reason not to utilize these areas for forestry or agriculture
    purpose. For this purpose, drone based planting systems are being developed that
    decrease planting costs upto 85 percent [263]. Not only cost, but within shorter
    time as some recently developed drones can plant 100,000 trees in a single day
    [264]. These systems shoot pods which include the seeds and necessary nutrients
    required to grow the plant. This method is found very effective for rough terrain;
    most importantly the success rate is more than 75% [265]. Due to the success and
    flexibility they offer, UAVs are being considered the best candidate for plantation
    all over the world, from NASA engineer [266] to countries like Pakistan [267]
    and India [268]. C. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is one of tough jobs and facing
    low efficiency due to covering large area. Drones are offering the solutions by
    allowing real-time monitoring of far farms, more accurately and cost-effectively
    comparing with previously used satellite imagery. The Microdrones +m [269] is
    an accessory toolkit which provides aerial imaging facility to observe the crop
    nutrients, moisture levels and monitoring of other necessary parameters. A study
    conducted in [270] where authors used UAVs along digital camera to monitor the
    crop conditions. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between
    the crop spectral characteristics and effect of fertilizer availability for plant
    health. Further, [271] presents an innovative procedure to compute and map the
    3-dimensional geometric characteristics of trees and tree-rows. The generated
    maps can be helpful to understand the relation between the trees’ growth and field
    related factors like its geometry and nutrients ultimately help to optimize the
    crop management operations. D. Irrigation Use of drones for irrigation applications
    is, again, two-fold. On one side, equipping UAVs with a variety of sensors and
    cameras can help to identify areas that are under water stress and conclude what
    irrigation changes are required. At the same time, they can be used for sprinkling
    water and pesticides on the crops precisely, especially in emergency cases, which
    would save both time and wastage. In [272], multispectral images of citrus crops
    were acquired using the fixed-wing UAV, where the retrieved data was used to assess
    and detect structural and physiological changes in the targeted crop. Further,
    [273], [274] are similar efforts in which UAVs were used to estimate the crop
    water stress. Furthermore, UAVs are not only used to analyze the irrigation properties
    but also provide solutions by sprinkling water precisely over the water stress
    areas as in [275]. Due to this application of UAVs, they are being considered
    the newest water-saving tool, while their use is helping not only to increase
    watering efficiency but also detect possible pooling or leaks in irrigation. Examples
    like ’JT20L-606’ [276] and ’AGRASMG-1’ [277] are specialized drones that were
    developed and are being used for this purpose. E. Plant Counting and Gap Detection
    Precision agriculture critically needs the spatial data on crop density when making
    decisions during various applications. The quantity and plant numbering not only
    reflects the field emergence but allows better and more precise assessment of
    the yield production, in fact, determining the crop fate. Again, UAVs are offering
    flexible solutions for this purpose. In [278], authors performed digital counting
    of Maize plants with the help of UAVs. Further, in [279], authors proposed a method
    in which they used UAVs to estimate the density of wheat plants at the emergence
    stage while a Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera was used to take the images. F. Spraying
    the Pesticides/Herbicides Similar to irrigation, UAVs can be used to spray herbicides/
    pesticides on crops, but their use for these applications is more critical. Spraying
    application would be highly efficient compared to current procedures; herbicides/pesticides
    are usually sprayed over the entire farm, which is not required in most cases.
    If using an UAV to spray herbicide, it can spray directly on the unwanted weeds
    or can target the affected areas only. Furthermore, as spraying using drones would
    be highly targeted, the drone would figure out and spray as per requirements,
    helping to reduce the overall expenditures. Handling the sudden environment changes
    like wind direction or speed is another issue for an UAV especially when being
    used for spraying applications. For this purpose, [280] proposed a computer based
    system that autonomously adopt the UAV control rules to keep precise pesticide
    deposition. G. Health Assessment Scanning crops with visible and Infrared (IR)
    light sensors fitted on drones can identify which plants may be infected by bacteria
    or fungus. Using UAVs, this can be done frequently and with flexibility. The early
    detection of any such issues helps to prevent the disease being spread to other
    plants or crop areas. Multispectral images can help to detect the disease or sickness
    at early stages even before reaching the level in which it is possible to detect
    with the human eye. Experiments done in [280] present the data collection campaign
    performed over a sorghum crop which was severely damaged by white grubs. Further,
    in [281], UAVs are used to collect data from ground-based sensors, including a
    chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer, and the collected
    information was used to evaluate the plant health and crop condition, ultimately
    reflecting the ground truth. H. Detection/Recognition of Plant Species Recently,
    UAVs are being started to detect and recognize the plant species, especially those
    are considered extinct or remains only few on our Earth. An UAV is a best candidate
    to perform this task as it can go in very remote locations those are almost inaccessible
    to humans. As National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) stated that, Hibiscadelphus
    woodi, a Hawaiian flower, which thought to be extinct in 2009, is discovered on
    a vertical cliff face using the drone [282]. Similarly, using the special cameras
    that can detect the forest biomass and fuel, forest fuel estimation is possible
    through UAVs which is mostly being done from radars and satellites [283], [284].
    SECTION VI. Food Safety and Transportation With the increasing population, we
    have to feed around 25% more mouths until 2050, as compared to 2010, which appears
    to be a monumental task when considering the vast hunger issues that the world
    is currently facing. The numbers are shocking, as more than one-quarter of the
    planet’s population suffers from malnutrition [285] and nearly one billion people
    are chronically hungry [286]. Considering this current hunger scenario, it could
    be big ask to feed the new billions of mouths in the future. In order to handle
    the situation, some believe the solution lies simply in growing more food. This
    has also been reinforced by a latest research, published in the journal Bioscience,
    which concludes that from the present time until 2050, the rise in total food
    production should be in the bracket of 25–70%. [287]. However, what if someone
    tells you that there’s already enough food currently grown on farms to feed 10
    billion people? [288]. Yes, the good news is that we are already producing enough
    food for that many people; however, it is a crucial matter to figure out that
    how to distribute this food while maintaining its quality. Considering this fact,
    one can say that increasing the food production is also important, but transporting
    the existing available food safely and efficiently to more people is the real
    subject of issue of the food industry [289]. A comprehensive report regarding
    the future food requirements published by World Resources Institutes (WRI) in
    2018, highlights that we need sustainable food industry to feed 10 billion people
    by 2050. The report suggests a five-course menu of solutions to tackle the future
    food issues where “reduction in food losses and waste” is declared as the first
    and most important course [290]. Further it conclude that, reducing the food loss
    and waste only by 25% can help to reduce the food gap by 12%, the land gap by
    27% and greenhouse gas mitigation gap by 15%. To have better idea, detailed figures
    about the food loss are highlighted in figure 12 based on various geographical
    locations and considering the stages along food supply chain where these losses
    are occurring. FIGURE 12. Food losses occurring along food supply chain [290].
    Show All Other than WRI, the figures released by United Nations’ FAO are also
    shocking as it is estimated that one-third of all the global food produced for
    human use, valued at $1 trillion, is lost or wasted each year [291]. The US food
    waste alone represents 1.3% of its total GDP [292]. Based on these scary figures,
    it can be concluded that food waste is massive market inefficiency—the kind of
    which does not persist in other industries [293]. Although, the loss of $1 trillion
    has its own worth, but, more crucially, environmental implications of these losses
    are real, such as the water wasted to produce the food that is never eaten being
    equal to the water that can fulfill the needs of all of Africa [285]. Furthermore
    the CO2 emissions that resulted during the growing process of this food are equivalent
    to removing every car off the road across the world [290]. Moreover, according
    to another study conducted by FAO, if you consider food waste as a source of greenhouse
    gas emissions, it would be the third biggest emitter in the world behind only
    China and the United States [294]. In addition, when food waste goes to the landfill,
    where it mostly ends up, it decomposes in the absence of oxygen and produces methane,
    which is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of negative effects.
    In short, every which way you look at it; food waste is a major culprit in destroying
    our planet. Among all perishable food produced in the world today, only 10% is
    preserved properly [295]. When we talk about most of the developed countries,
    a robust food cold chain is maintained where essential quality checks are followed,
    entailing temperature-regulated refrigerated warehouses to refrigerated trucks
    to ensure that food gets from farm to market safely. On the other hand, many developing
    countries lack such proper cold chain infrastructure, simply resulting the majority
    of food spoiling when being transported to the end-user. Considering this fact,
    there is a huge opportunity to cut food waste and improve food distribution by
    simply implementing a controlled-temperature transportation system. Based on the
    facts, one can conclude that increasing food production is not sufficient to achieve
    food security, but, rather, some practical actions are required to find skillful
    ways for efficient distribution of the already available food. There are different
    ways to monitor and control food temperature. The manual method of checking a
    thermometer and recording the temperature has many drawbacks, where someone must
    actually do it and, most importantly, take the readings correctly. On other side,
    implementing an automatic method that uses wireless sensors to electronically
    measure and record temperatures can substantially improve food safety. This method
    allows for a continuous data stream of temperatures simply—24 hours a day, 7 days
    a week. By doing so, temperatures can be recorded consistently and on time, leaving
    little room for interpretation; in short, the entire process is based on facts
    and nothing more. Further, utilizing the recent technologies, the recorded data
    can be stored in the Cloud and accessed via any type of internet-connected device.
    Notifications can be established that will send real-time alerts if the temperature
    strays outside preset limits, allowing for immediate action to remedy the situation.
    Further, IoT offers predictive maintenance and indicate when the monitoring equipment
    itself is going to end its useful life so it can be replaced before it fails and
    compromises product quality. These are only couple of scenarios, now if we consider
    the figures presented in figure 12, IoT has the potential to monitor and keep
    the food quality at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption.
    A research study conducted by Indian School of Business in which students worked
    with a local grower to transport fruits and vegetables in refrigerated trucks
    from Punjab to Bangalore, a distance of more than 2,500 km through rough roads
    under high temperatures. The results were highly encouraging to implement the
    cold chain to transport the agriculture products. The out of conducted study brought
    benefits in three ways: (1) increased food shelf-life from one week to two months;
    (2) an up to 23% higher profit for everyone linked in the supply chain was observed;
    (3) a 76% reduction of food wastage (post-harvest). Besides all this, another
    critical factor is the emission of greenhouse gases was observed to be reduced
    by 16% [296]. To provide the recommended environment, a device with supported
    technology can be installed at the storage site, even in transport trucks. Further,
    it is linked to an online dashboard that can be configured to send alerts in the
    event of abnormal temperature levels to trigger swift remedial action. Some of
    key technologies available for this purpose and their use cases are mentioned
    here. A. Compliancemate Compliance with hazard analysis and critical control points
    (HACCP) offers a food safety and quality monitoring program which collects temperature
    data inside coolers and other kitchen equipment continuously. For example, its
    integration with Touchblock is used to capture temperatures in coolers and prep
    rooms at every minute [297]. B. Laird’s Sentrius A battery-powered and long-range
    integrated sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. It provides LoRaWAN options at 868/915 MHz, based
    on the Semtech SX1272 and Nordic nRF51 silicon. Further, it offers high RF performance
    in a precise temperature and humidity. Two major series, including RS1xx and RG1xx
    (multi-wireless gateways), work together in order to provide Cloud-based services.
    Most importantly, it requires an inexpensive endpoint radio and a more sophisticated
    base station to manage the network. As compared to LoRa, Sigfox communication
    tends to be better if it is headed up from the endpoint to the base station. Although
    it supports the bidirectional functionality, its capacity going from the base
    station back to the endpoint is constrained, as it provides less link width going
    down than going up. C. CCP Smart Tag (RC4) CCP claims to be a complete monitoring
    solution for the food service and food retail industry [298]. It is capable to
    automate the temperature environment which meets the food safety regulations suggested
    for various food items. Further, temperature and other data are interpreted and
    viewed on a service provider Cloud platform via web and mobile applications. D.
    Tempreporter In compliance with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points),
    it is used to monitor temperatures 24/7. Further, it logs the readings automatically.
    Reports are auto-filled by considering HACCP & HPRA (Health Products Regulatory
    Authority) recommendations regarding temperature monitoring. According to Finistere
    Ventures report, as of 2018, around $2 billion has been invested globally in AgTech.
    Several investments are expected to cross these figures in 2019. Considering the
    future needs of IoT in agriculture applications, almost all leading technological
    giants are supporting this progress in their own way. Table 5 provides a list
    of several of the leading global organizations who have proposed and are proposing
    initiatives in AgTech, especially in regard to IoT-based agriculture solutions.
    TABLE 5 Current Status and Future Vision of Major Technological Giants Regarding
    the IoT in Agriculture Industry SECTION VII. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
    According to a plan announced in 2015 under “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
    the UN and international community set a target to end hunger by 2030. However,
    recent figures released by WHO (World Health Organization) do not look encouraging
    enough to support the agenda, as more than 800 million people worldwide are facing
    the food shortage—one out of every nine people [313]. Although these figures are
    quite alarming on their own, what is more shocking is the quality of food. Other
    than availability, the quality of food is becoming another serious issue and even
    more critical. According to a research supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
    published in “The Lancet”, either shortage or poor diets are diverting 11 million
    people to an early grave annually, making it more deadly than smoking [314]. The
    research, which reflects the effect of poor diet on health, was conducted in 195
    countries from 1990 to 2017 and concluded that one out of five deaths per year
    could be prevented by providing better diet. The report summarizes that, globally,
    a diet lower in whole grains was the most common and leading risk factor for deaths.
    Other than the basic food needs, per capita incomes of most of the countries in
    2050 are expected to be a multiple as compared to today’s levels [315]. Such an
    increase in income will result in a more health-conscious population that expects
    quality food that is rich in fiber and other minerals. Trends, like increased
    population where the world needs to feed one third more mouths with increased
    demand of quality food, show that food demands continue to grow rapidly. In response
    to all this, overall crop production needs to increase not only for food but cash-crops
    are also required to grow in order to fulfill the demands of industry, like cotton
    and rubber, and, most importantly, increasing demands for bioenergy like ethanol.
    Figure 13 presents a snapshot of major challenges that future agriculture expected
    to face in 2050. This diagram, basically presents three major issues: how to feed
    around 10 billion people; without using more land and; by reducing the emission
    of greenhouse gasses by more than 60%. However, when we look closely then these
    three challenges lead to many new, including smaller rural labor, continuously
    shrinking arable land, water scarcity, harsh weather conditions, and many more.
    As the world moves toward urbanization, the rural populations are not only shrinking
    but are rapidly aging; hence, fewer and younger growers need to step up to take
    the responsibility. Such population imbalance and generation shift can create
    serious implications, not only for the remaining workforce but also for production
    patterns and land tenure. Furthermore, on one side, arable land is shrinking while,
    among the remaining regions, many are only suitable for specific crops due to
    certain geographic and environmental limitations. Moreover, harsh climate changes
    are starting to affect almost every aspect of crop production. These changes are
    expected to enhance the intensity of many of the existing long-term environmental
    issues, like droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, soil degradation, etc. FIGURE
    13. Major challenges for sustainable future agriculture. Show All During the 20th
    century, in most regions, growers kept following the traditional agricultural
    methods while trying to meet the food demands by greater utilizing fertilizers
    and pesticides. Implementation of such chemicals is facing two issues: these can
    help to increase the production to only a certain level and, at the same time,
    their blind use is creating irreversible implications to the environment. Furthermore,
    implementation of any resource, like water, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    uniformly across an entire field is not going to solve the problem. Rather than
    dealing with every farm and crop in same way, farmers need to use these resources
    according to the requirement of specific areas, even if they have to consider
    the requirement of every plant. Focusing on the above discussion, one can feel
    that the farms and relevant crop operations need to be run differently than the
    past practices. One of the major reasons is the advancements in technology, including
    sensors, communication methods, machines, and even robots. In fact, technology
    has proved this already, as, in most developing countries; more than 50% of the
    population is somehow engaged in the agriculture industry yet are far behind in
    providing both the quantity and quality when compared with the developed countries,
    where less than 2% of the population is performing much better. The difference
    is clear, as countries like Australia, the US, and most of Europe are pioneers
    to employ the advanced tools and methods multiplying the crop yields during the
    last five decades. These comparisons show that recent technologies and advanced
    methods are making the farms not only highly profitable but safe and environmentally
    friendly. Considering this scenario, future agriculture is expected to evolve
    as a high-tech industry where interconnected systems will enjoy the luxury of
    artificial intelligence and Big Data facilities. The resultant systems will converge
    into a single unit where farm machinery and management, starting from seeding
    to production forecasting, are combined. By involving the advanced technologies
    like agricultural robots, Big Data, and cloud-computing artificial intelligence,
    agriculture can create a new era of superfusion. Following are some of the key
    technologies and methods that need to apply; focusing to achieve sustainable future
    agriculture. A. Wireless Sensors and the IoT Wireless sensors placed strategically
    around fields are providing farmers with up-to-date information in real time,
    allowing them to adapt the care that the crops need, which results in higher food
    production with less waste. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are also being used
    to inform farmers about nearly all aspects of their crop growth as well as about
    the readiness state of the farm’s machinery, thus, helping in preventing loss
    of crop as well as enhancing the readiness of the equipment which cultivates it.
    WSNs with GPS capability are helping tractors in compensating for uneven terrain
    and optimizing land preparation for growing crops. Recently, advances in image
    recognition and digital signal processing gave even more capabilities to WSN to
    accurately determine crop quality and health. In order to make agriculture sustainable,
    the use of the IoT will be at the center and forefront in agricultural operations.
    This includes everything from water and power usage, crop transportation, farm
    machinery operation and maintenance alerts, and market price updates. The IoT
    has the capability to make these tasks streamlined and more predictable by recognizing
    the crop’s needs at every stage. It has already proved a breakthrough and is further
    going to change the way we look at various agriculture activities by providing
    the farmer control over their land and assets in an unprecedented way, thus, maximizing
    their effectiveness and efficiency. Further, the future of the IoT can be shaped
    by the phenomenal advances in WSNs and the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile
    communication technologies to provide farmers with real-time data and information
    anytime and everywhere their land is. Based on recent success, it is estimated
    that more than 75 million IoT-based devices will be operating in the agriculture
    industry by 2020. Further, the average farm is expecting to generate 4.1 million
    data points on a daily bases by 2050 [316]. B. Communication Real success of IoT
    in agriculture largely depends on advances in connectivity. From telecom’s perspective,
    providing mainly connectivity and other value-added services has an immense potential
    and can influence the entire chain greatly [317]. Most of the telecom operators
    around the globe offer connectivity services, but such services only represent
    a tiny amount of the entire smart agriculture market. Considering its worth, especially
    in rural areas, the cellular operators have to offer a new range of services targeting
    the growers’ demands. Accepting the fact that most of the community belong to
    this industry are not highly educated and mostly unaware of new technologies,
    hence the operator should provide end-to-end solutions other than just providing
    the connectivity. If so, then it will certainly help to increase the market share
    of mobile and telecom operators. Further, these operators need partnerships with
    the investors to provide end-to-end solutions, which demands higher investment,
    even before advantages can be seen. The results of success when inviting the investors
    depend on the nature of the partnership and the involved bodies, like device manufacturers,
    solution providers, non-cellular connectivity service providers, system integrators,
    etc. On one side, the outcome of this partnership would help operators to enter
    deeper into the industry, ultimately boosting their market share. At the same
    time, this opportunity can create strong relationships among the organizations
    and farmers to help to educate them about the benefits of smart agriculture. The
    success of cellular technology is only possible when service providers leverage
    its real benefits like portability, flexibility and luxury of two way communication
    to offer low cost but customized solutions. They must provide what the farmer
    is in need, at the place they choose. Furthermore, to provide fast penetration
    in agriculture industry, policy changes are required in order to provide access
    of reliable and quality inputs. The research conducted in [172] which considers
    23 studies where mostly belong to developing countries, concludes that the cellular
    services and smartphone technology carry a promising future for smallholder farmers
    being capable to improve their yields. Furthermore, licensed LPWA (low-power wide-area)
    technology is expected to be a game changer for smart agriculture. Due to its
    characteristics and supported services including low power consumption and efficient
    coverage are well suited to the geography and economics of agriculture hence expected
    to play a critical role in future smart farming. Consequently, narrowband IoT
    (NB-IoT) got strong industry support and becoming an effective global standard
    for LPWA connectivity. It has the potential to provide major connectivity changes
    in agriculture industry by changing the perceptions about Internet capabilities.
    Believing in its future success, it is expected that leading cellular operators
    with strong IoT ambitions can generate significant revenues by providing smart
    agriculture services when collaborating with LPWA technology providers. In order
    to achieve long term success of these short, mid and long range communication
    technologies, necessary steps for infrastructure construction are required towards
    attaining the technology-based agriculture. C. UAVs and Other Robots Drones are
    being widely used by farmers for crop growth monitoring and as a means to combat
    hunger and other harmful environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are being used
    to spray water and other pesticides efficiently, considering the tough terrains,
    especially when the crops possess different heights. Drones have proven their
    value, not only in terms of spraying speed but precision, as well, when compared
    with traditional machinery of same purpose. With recent advances in swarm technology
    and mission-based control, groups of drones equipped with heterogeneous sensors,
    including 3D cameras, can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive
    capabilities to manage their land. With the inclusion of UAVs in agriculture,
    farmers are able to put their eye in sky, but many challenges need to be addressed
    in order to enjoy the real advantages of this technology, especially the integration
    of other technologies and how to use them in poor weather conditions. Beside drones,
    robotics within agriculture have improved productivity and resulted in higher
    and faster yields. Such robots, like spraying and weeding robots, are reducing
    agrochemical use. Robots equipped with laser and camera guidance are being used
    for identifying and removing weeds without human intervention. They navigate between
    rows of crops on their own, ultimately increasing the yield with reduced manpower.
    More recently, plant-transplanting and fruit-picking robots are emerging to add
    a new level of efficiency to traditional methods. D. Machine Learning and Analytics
    Machine learning and analytics are used to mine data for trends. In farming, machine
    learning is used, for example, to predict which genes are best suited for crop
    production. This has been giving growers all over the world the best seed varieties,
    those which are highly suitable to respective locations and climate conditions.
    Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, have indicated which products
    are of high demand and which products are currently unavailable in the market.
    Thus, for the farmer, this has given valuable clues for future farming. Recent
    advances in machine learning and analytics will make it possible for farmers to
    accurately classify their products and weed out less desirable crops before they
    arrive to customers. E. Power Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrids, and Smart
    Grids Despite its future opportunities, smart agriculture facing some limitations
    that are holding back the growth of IoT. One of them is power issue as due to
    its nature; smart farming requires wide use of energy. Among the main reasons
    of extensive power consumption some are including, long term sensor deployment,
    use of GPS repeatedly and transmission of sensed data via GPRS. Traditionally,
    farmers in remote areas have bought and utilized renewable energy sources randomly
    and at a hefty price, which has limited their ability to use them in farming to
    a great extent. However to solve the power issues in long term, deep analysis
    of power consumption sources like remote data transmission can help to tackle
    the problem at some extent. Further, smart grids and microgrids, however, lend
    themselves to seamless integration of distributed energy sources (DERs), thus,
    making them appealing for adoption by farmers. The emergence of smart power meters
    has further given the farmers the confidence to invest in DER, especially since
    they have the option to sell the excess power to the grid. Recent advances in
    energy storage devices, integrated electricity and heat systems will make DER
    even more attractive for farmers, as they will be able to store energy and use
    the heat generated by cooling and heating when needed. However, healthy investment
    requirements and public perceptions are two other barriers on the way to making
    these solutions successful. F. Hydroponics and Vertical Farming (VF) Other than
    employing the advanced technologies, new agricultural practices can be very crucial
    to overcome the geographic and resource limitation challenges. On one side, arable
    land is shrinking, and, at the same time, it is estimated that three million people
    around the globe are migrating to cities, resulting in more pressure on the existing
    limited urban resources [318]. Considering this rapid migration, it is estimated
    that by 2030, 60% of the world’s population is going to depend on cities, and
    this number is further expected to rise to 68% until 2050 [319]. Considering both
    of these issues, it could be disaster for food production in the near future with
    current agriculture practices. VF is an answer of these issues, as it meets the
    challenges of land and water shortage and, at the same time, looks highly suitable
    to be adopted near the cities. VF is portrayed as the answer to the looming shortage
    of food and shrinking arable land, at least in some areas of the world. Further,
    hydroponics can play a key role, as this method lowers the requirements of water
    and space to a great extent. Rapid growths in computer power are propelling scientific
    discoveries in plant nutrition and growth that would make VF even more appealing
    to growers. Along VF and hydroponics, new and advanced solutions are required
    to increase the arable land without disturbing the forests and other natural animal
    habitats. For this, we have to focus on the deserts as these cover one third of
    the Earth’s land surface. The solutions are started already as Norwegian and Chinese
    firms/experts are doing efforts in Dubai, Qatar, Jordan and Chinese deserts [320]–[322].
    Agriculture is not just an industry; in fact, it provides the basis of human society,
    as the goal is not just to grow crops, but the target is the perfection of human
    being. A vibrant and prosperous agriculture sector can provide the basis for a
    happy and healthy society, as recent decades witnessed this. The presence of advance
    technologies, especially the involvement of the IoT, matters a great deal in regard
    to reaching this goal. Environmental issues continue to cage the planet, which
    increases the need for safe and clean agriculture. This is the reason humanity
    is witnessing a second green revolution, largely based on the IoT. The use of
    these technologies makes the farming industry highly productive with reduced labor
    and other resource consumption; same time, minimizing the impact on the environment.
    Our planet has the resources, but we have to learn how to utilize them wisely
    and precisely. Sensible use of technology can lead us where we can utilize these
    resources efficiently in order to ensure the food security of the current and
    coming generations. For this purpose, we need collective efforts to build such
    institutions that can shape long-term decisions and polices to eliminate hunger
    effectively. On this route, the experience, tools, and support from those nations
    that have succeeded in overcoming hunger should provide to those regions that
    are fighting to feed its local mouths. Although growth in every industry matters,
    growth in agriculture, particularly among small growers, can be highly effective
    to control the undernourishment issues, as more than 70% of the population of
    developing countries belongs to rural areas and somehow depends on agriculture
    sector. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The focus on smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing methodologies is required in order to meet the growing food demand
    of the increasing world population in the face of the ever-shrinking arable land.
    The development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, one can readily
    see currently: technology-weaned, innovative younger people adopting farming as
    a profession, agriculture as a means for independence from fossil fuels, tracking
    the crop growth, safety and nutrition labeling, partnerships between growers,
    suppliers, and retailers and buyers. This paper considered all these aspects and
    highlighted the role of various technologies, especially IoT, in order to make
    the agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations. For this
    purpose, wireless sensors, UAVs, Cloud-computing, communication technologies are
    discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, a deeper insight on recent research efforts
    is provided. In addition, various IoT-based architectures and platforms are provided
    with respect to agriculture applications. A summary of current challenges facing
    the industry and future expectations are listed to provide guidance to researchers
    and engineers. Based on all this, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production. However, to deal with every inch accordingly,
    the use of sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication technologies is not
    optional—it is necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    \ for calibrating and validating land surface models and\nsatellite-based soil\
    \ moisture retrievals.\nIn addition, long-\nterm time series of in situ soil moisture\
    \ measurements them-\nselves can reveal trends in the water cycle related to cli-\n\
    mate or land cover change. Nevertheless, on a worldwide\nbasis the number of meteorological\
    \ networks and stations\nmeasuring soil moisture, in particular on a continuous\

    \ of technique and protocol. To overcome many of these\nlimitations, the International\

    Currently (status May 2011), the ISMN contains data of 19\nnetworks and more than\
    \ 500 stations located in North Amer-\nica, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The time\

    though most datasets have originated during the last decade.\nThe database is\
    \ rapidly expanding, which means that both\nthe number of stations and the time\
    \ period covered by the\nexisting stations are still growing. Hence, it will become\
    \ an\nincreasingly important resource for validating and improving\nsatellite-derived\

    Across many landscapes, soil moisture and its freeze/thaw\nstate control evapotranspiration,\
    \ thus providing the link be-\ntween terrestrial and atmospheric water, energy,\
    \ and carbon\ncycles (Robock et al., 2000). In addition, surface soil mois-\n\
    ture is a determinant of the partitioning of surface precipita-\ntion into inﬁltration\
    \ and runoff. The availability of better spa-\ntial estimates of surface soil\
    \ moisture conditions can there-\nfore help to improve forecasting of precipitation,\
    \ droughts\nand ﬂoods as well as climate projections and predictions\n(Dirmeyer\
    \ et al., 2006).\nIt will also contribute to further\nthe development of other\
    \ hydrological applications that can\nsupport water managers and water resource\
    \ decision-makers.\nThe importance of soil moisture in the global climate system\n\
    Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n\

    \ been underlined by the Global Climate Observ-\ning System (GCOS) by endorsing\
    \ soil moisture as an Essen-\ntial Climate Variable1.\nThe value of soil moisture\
    \ for various applications is re-\nﬂected by the large number of satellite-based\
    \ soil moisture\nproducts that have emerged during the last decade. Only in\n\
    2000, Robock et al. (2000, p. 1298) concluded their paper\nstating: “There are\
    \ no existing global soil moisture datasets\nmeasured from remote sensing”. Today,\
    \ a wide variety of op-\nerational global soil moisture products are available\
    \ for ex-\nisting microwave sensors such as AMSR-E (Jackson, 1993;\nNjoku et al.,\
    \ 2003; Koike et al., 2004; Owe et al., 2008),\nTRMM-TMI (Owe et al., 2008), SSM/I\
    \ (Owe et al., 2008),\nWindSat (Li et al., 2010), ERS 1 and 2 (Wagner et al.,\
    \ 1999;\nScipal et al., 2002), and ASCAT (Naeimi et al., 2009). In ad-\ndition,\
    \ special missions dedicated to soil moisture either have\nbeen recently launched,\
    \ i.e. the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity Mission (SMOS) of the European Space\
    \ Agency\n(ESA; Kerr et al., 2001; Wigneron et al., 2007), or are sched-\nuled\
    \ for the near future, such as the Soil Moisture Active\n& Passive (SMAP) mission\
    \ of the United States National\nAerospace Space Administration (NASA; Entekhabi\
    \ et al.,\n2010a).\nIn addition, global soil moisture products based\non land\
    \ surface models are being made available routinely\nthrough operational forecast\
    \ systems, e.g. from the European\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (Drusch\
    \ and\nViterbo, 2007), re-analyses (Uppala et al., 2005; Simmons et\nal., 2007)\
    \ or the soil moisture ﬁelds provided by the Global\nLand Surface Data Assimilation\
    \ System (Rodell et al., 2004)\nand the Global Soil Wetness Project (Dirmeyer\
    \ et al., 1999).\nTo calibrate and validate such satellite- and model-based\n\
    soil moisture estimates, in situ measurements are an indis-\npensable source of\
    \ information (e.g. Ceballos et al., 2005;\nWagner et al., 2007; Balsamo et al.,\
    \ 2009; Gruhier et al.,\n2010; Jackson et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011).\nMoreover,\n\
    in situ soil moisture measurements provide information that\nfacilitates the study\
    \ of the spatial and temporal variability\nof soil moisture at different scales\
    \ (Famiglietti et al., 1999;\nEntin et al., 2000; Brocca et al., 2007), the exchange\
    \ of water\nbetween different layers within the soil column or between\nthe land\
    \ surface and the atmosphere (Mahfouf and Noilhan,\n1991; Chen and Hu, 2004; Albergel\
    \ et al., 2008), and climate\nrelated trends in soil moisture (Robock et al.,\
    \ 2005).\nSince the early 1980s, several dedicated soil moisture ﬁeld\ncampaigns\
    \ in the US, Europe, and Australia have resulted in\nboth short term and long\
    \ term soil moisture datasets. Most\nof these campaigns were designed for satellite\
    \ validation pur-\nposes. Of great historical importance were the soil moisture\n\
    ﬁeld experiments performed at the Beltsville Agricultural\nResearch Center (BARC)\
    \ where for one the ﬁrst times remote\nsensing measurements were coupled with\
    \ ﬁeld observations\n(Wang et al., 1980). Being one of the ﬁrst datasets publicly\n\
    available, the BARC datasets triggered many researchers to\n1http://gosic.org/ios/MATRICES/ECV/ECV-Introduction.htm\n\
    study the ability of retrieving soil moisture from space obser-\nvations. Other\
    \ historically important experiments include the\nBotswana experiment (Van De\
    \ Griend et al., 1989), HAPEX-\nSahel (Prince et al., 1995), EFEDA (Braud et al.,\
    \ 1993), FIFE\n(Peck and Hope, 1995), and the soil moisture experiments\ncoordinated\
    \ by the United States Department of Agriculture\n(e.g. Jackson et al., 2002).\n\
    The importance of soil moisture has been growing in im-\nportance also in the\
    \ meteorological and hydrological com-\nmunities and as a result several networks\
    \ now measure soil\nmoisture as a routine observation (e.g. Beyrich and Adam,\n\
    2007; Calvet et al., 2008) . Nevertheless, on a global basis\nthe number of long-term\
    \ in situ monitoring networks is still\nsmall and mostly restricted to mid-latitude\
    \ regions. Only few\nmeasurements are being made in Africa and South America.\n\
    Complicating the easy utilization of network data is the lack\nof a standard measurement\
    \ technique and a standard mea-\nsurement protocol (Robock et al., 2000). Also,\
    \ the fact that\nthe various datasets are managed by a large number of dif-\n\
    ferent organizations makes clear that global studies incorpo-\nrating in situ\
    \ soil moisture measurements are tedious to per-\nform.\nActions to collect data\
    \ from several networks and to offer a\ncentralized portal for dissemination are\
    \ basically conﬁned to\nthe historical Global Soil Moisture Data Bank previously\
    \ ex-\nisting at Rutgers University, NJ (Robock et al., 2000, 2005).\nThis data\
    \ archive provided data and metadata for various his-\ntorical and operative networks\
    \ around the globe. The dozens\nof scientiﬁc publications relying on its datasets\
    \ have afﬁrmed\nthe importance of this dissemination platform. Although the\n\
    Global Soil Moisture Data Bank was a good starting point for\nglobal validation\
    \ efforts, the last update of the data base oc-\ncurred in 2005 which made it\
    \ unusable for the most recent\nand upcoming satellite-based soil moisture products\
    \ listed\nabove. In addition, the observations of the various networks\nin the\
    \ Global Soil Moisture Data Bank were not harmonized\nin terms of measurement\
    \ units. They were presented either\nas plant-available volumetric or as total\
    \ volumetric soil mois-\nture in cm or percent for a given soil layer depth. Hence,\
    \ the\nsoil water units needed to be carefully checked before per-\nforming a\
    \ comparison.\nThe need for intensiﬁed international cooperation in estab-\nlishing\
    \ new monitoring networks and constructing central-\nized and harmonized global\
    \ soil moisture datasets has been\nbroadly recognized by the international community\
    \ (Grabs\nand Thomas, 2002; Jackson et al., 2005). Hence, in 2006\nthe International\
    \ Soil Moisture Working Group (ISMWG)\nwas established to facilitate the creation\
    \ of multi-source soil\nmoisture datasets, including in situ observations. The\
    \ de-\nvelopment of these datasets and an in situ soil moisture net-\nwork was\
    \ consequently included in the Group on Earth Ob-\nservation (GEO) 2009–2011 Work\
    \ Plan under sub-task WA-\n08-01a lead by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Exper-\n\
    iment (GEWEX) and ESA. Its implementation is coordi-\nnated through the ISMWG\
    \ under auspices of GEWEX. The\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\n\

    \ of the ISMN, which can be\naccessed through http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu.\
    \ To put\nthe structure of the system and the data manipulations per-\nformed\

    \ of soil moisture deﬁnitions and the\nmeasurement techniques and instruments\
    \ commonly used to\nmeasure soil moisture in situ (Sect. 2). Section 3 provides\n\
    an overview of the technical design and implementation of\nthe ISMN, and the methods\
    \ used for harmonizing the soil\nmoisture datasets. Section 4 summarizes the datasets\
    \ cur-\nrently contained in the database. Even though the number of\nnetworks\
    \ and stations are still rapidly increasing (visit http:\n//www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu/index.php/news.html\
    \ for news\non recent updates), this section intends to provide insight in\nthe\
    \ diversity of the datasets that are considered for integra-\ntion in the ISMN.\
    \ Section 5 discusses the possible outreach\nof the ISMN and some issues that\
    \ should be taken into con-\nsideration if in situ soil moisture data are used\
    \ for calibration\nand validation of remote sensing products and land surface\n\
    models. Section 6 concludes this paper by looking into the\nfuture and outlining\
    \ some prerequisites for a successful con-\ntinuation of the ISMN.\n2\nMeasuring\
    \ in situ soil moisture\n2.1\nSoil moisture deﬁnitions and units\nSoil moisture\
    \ (2) is usually deﬁned as the water present\nin the unsaturated part of the soil\
    \ proﬁle, i.e., between the\nsoil surface and the ground water level and can be\
    \ expressed\nin different units (e.g. Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Hillel,\n1998;\
    \ Robock et al., 2000; Seneviratne et al., 2010). An\nunderstanding of the different\
    \ deﬁnitions is crucial for ho-\nmogenization of the soil moisture measurements.\
    \ The most\ncommon deﬁnition of soil moisture is volumetric soil mois-\nture.\
    \ It is either expressed as the volumetric fraction of water\nin a given soil\
    \ depth [m3 water per m3 soil] or as the depth of\na column of water contained\
    \ in a given depth of soil [mm wa-\nter per mm soil]. The volumetric fraction\
    \ [m3 m−3] is most\nwidespread in earth observation. Therefore, this is also the\n\
    unit adopted in the ISMN. Datasets that are provided in other\nunits will be converted\
    \ to this unit (Sect. 3.3.2). Some other\nrelevant descriptors are presented below.\n\
    Soil moisture can also be expressed as fraction of satura-\ntion. A fraction of\
    \ the soil, typically less than 0.5, consists\nof pores that can be ﬁlled with\
    \ air or water. This fraction is\ncalled the porosity (P). If this fraction were\
    \ completely ﬁlled\nwith water, the soil would reach its maximum soil moisture\n\
    content or saturation. The saturation ratio varies between 0\n(no soil moisture)\
    \ and 1 (full saturation). The porosity, or\nwater storage capacity, is needed\
    \ to convert the saturation ra-\ntio into volumetric fraction.\nAnother commonly\
    \ used term is plant available water\n(PAW), which is the volume of water available\
    \ to plants.\nPAW is computed by subtracting the volume of water cor-\nresponding\
    \ to the permanent wilting point from the total vol-\numetric soil water content.\
    \ Below the wilting point water is\nheld too strongly by the soil matrix and is\
    \ not accessible to\nplants (Hillel, 1998). The wilting point depends on soil\
    \ prop-\nerties such as soil texture, and thus varies geographically.\nEssential\
    \ for the deﬁnition of soil moisture is the char-\nacterization of the soil volume,\
    \ as soil moisture content is\nnot homogeneously distributed vertically and horizontally\n\
    and thus depends on the soil volume considered.\nThis is\nof high relevance for\
    \ intercomparing in situ measurements\noriginating from different stations and\
    \ for the comparison of\nin situ measurements with Earth observation and land\
    \ sur-\nface model data. For example, some methods sample only\nsoil moisture\
    \ in the top few millimeters to centimeters of the\nsoil (e.g., microwave remote\
    \ sensing), a small volume at a\ngiven depth (e.g., Time Domain Reﬂectometry (TDR)\
    \ mea-\nsurements Sect. 2.2), or provide an integral measure down\nto the water\
    \ table depth. Moreover, for certain soil moisture\ndeﬁnitions (e.g., root zone\
    \ soil moisture, total soil moisture),\n2 may be a function of space and time\
    \ (i.e., as a function of\nthe plants’ rooting depth or the water table depth).\n\
    For a more extensive description of soil moisture deﬁni-\ntions we refer the reader\
    \ to existing literature (e.g. Hillel,\n1998; Seneviratne et al., 2010).\n2.2\n\
    Measurement techniques\nSeveral techniques are available for measuring soil moisture\n\
    content in situ (Ward and Robinson, 1990; Robock et al.,\n2000; Walker et al.,\
    \ 2004; Robinson et al., 2008; Senevi-\nratne et al., 2010). They can be categorized\
    \ either as direct\nor indirect methods. The most frequently used methods are\n\
    summarized below. For a more detailed discussion we refer\nto the references cited\
    \ above.\n2.2.1\nGravimetric method\nThe gravimetric method is the only method\
    \ that measures\nsoil moisture directly. Typically, soil samples are taken using\n\
    coring devices or augers at speciﬁc depths and locations. The\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\
    Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\n1678\nW. A. Dorigo et al.: The\
    \ International Soil Moisture Network\nsamples are weighted before and after drying,\
    \ and from the\nchanges in mass, the soil moisture content can be derived.\nThe\
    \ method is labor-intensive and destructive (i.e., a sam-\nple cannot be taken\
    \ at exactly the same location more than\nonce). When implemented as a monitoring\
    \ technique, the\ntemporal resolution of long-term measurement networks us-\n\
    ing this technique is usually coarse, typically of the order of\n1–2 weeks at\
    \ best (Seneviratne et al., 2010). Nevertheless,\nas the gravimetric method is\
    \ low-tech and simple, it makes\nan excellent technique for long homogeneous climatological\n\
    records (Robock et al., 2000). Today, most systematic obser-\nvations are based\
    \ on indirect methods; however, calibration\ntypically requires using the gravimetric\
    \ method.\n2.2.2\nNeutron probes\nNeutron probes are relatively easy to use, accurate,\
    \ and capa-\nble of measurements in real time. This indirect method uses\na radioactive\
    \ source of fast (high-energy) neutrons, which is\nlowered into a borehole, and\
    \ the backscattered slow neutrons\nare measured.\nA detector counts the number\
    \ of neutrons\nslowed down or thermalized by collisions with hydrogen nu-\nclei,\
    \ mainly representing soil water. A relationship with vol-\numetric soil moisture\
    \ content is obtained by calibrating the\nslow neutron counts with gravimetric\
    \ samples of soil mois-\nture content and bulk densities (Vachaud et al., 1977).\
    \ Since\nradioactive scattering occurs over a spherical domain, a neu-\ntron probe\
    \ samples a volume of soil rather than a point. The\nprobe’s relatively large\
    \ volume of inﬂuence makes observa-\ntions at shallow depths prone to errors,\
    \ as adjoining air is\nalso sampled. Disadvantages of neutron probes include their\n\
    requirement to be calibrated to soil types and zones over a pe-\nriod of time\
    \ with different soil moisture fractions, that they\nare also labor-intensive,\
    \ the need for precautions associated\nwith handling radioactive material, and\
    \ the relatively high\ncosts. It is also not adaptable to frequent and automated\
    \ ob-\nservations. The neutron probe is mostly used to measure soil\nmoisture\
    \ differences rather than absolute soil moisture con-\ntent.\n2.2.3\nElectromagnetic\
    \ techniques\nSoil capacitance measurements, TDR, and Frequency Do-\nmain Reﬂectometry\
    \ (FDR) are electromagnetic techniques\nthat make use of the dependency of the\
    \ dielectric permittivity\nof the soil on soil moisture content, caused by the\
    \ difference\nbetween the dielectric constant of soil components and wa-\nter,\
    \ respectively. These techniques are non-destructive and\nnon-radioactive and\
    \ can be easily set up for automated oper-\nation with a data logger. This facilitates\
    \ frequent measure-\nments up to several measurements per hour. TDR and FDR\n\
    sensors, operating at higher frequencies, are more accurate\nthan capacitance\
    \ sensors (e.g. Robinson et al., 2008). How-\never, the latter are of much lower\
    \ cost, which can allow for\na higher number of instruments and thus much denser\
    \ net-\nworks (e.g., Bogena et al., 2007). On the other hand, FDR is\nsensitive\
    \ to temperature ﬂuctuations and ideally would need\nto be corrected for these.\
    \ All techniques require calibration\nwith gravimetric samples.\n2.2.4\nCosmic-ray\
    \ neutrons\nRecently, a non-invasive method has been proposed that\nmeasures low-energy\
    \ cosmic-ray neutrons that are generated\nwithin the soil, moderated mainly by\
    \ hydrogen atoms, and\ndiffused back to the atmosphere (Zreda et al., 2008; Desilets\n\
    et al., 2010). These neutrons are sensitive to water content\nchanges, but largely\
    \ insensitive to variations in soil chem-\nistry. Their intensity above the surface\
    \ is inversely correlated\nwith hydrogen content of the soil. Portable neutron\
    \ detec-\ntors are placed a few meters above the ground and allow for\na sampling\
    \ interval of several minutes to hours. Soil mois-\nture information is inferred\
    \ over a depth of 15 to 70 cm. In\ncontrast to the methods presented above, cosmic-ray\
    \ mea-\nsurements integrate soil moisture measurements over much\nlarger horizontal\
    \ scales (diameter ∼670 m) and hence have\nthe potential to bridge the spatial\
    \ mismatch between point\nmeasurements using contact methods and remote sensing\
    \ es-\ntimates over large areas. Several operational and experimen-\ntal networks\
    \ based on this method are currently set-up world-\nwide2.\n2.2.5\nOther indirect\
    \ techniques\nTensiometers and electrical resistance blocks are capable of\nmeasuring\
    \ the matric potential of soil water, which is di-\nrectly related to the ability\
    \ of plants to extract water from\nsoil. However, each instrument has a limited\
    \ accessible wa-\nter potential range. Tensiometers work well only in wet soils,\n\
    whereas resistance blocks (mostly made of gypsum) do bet-\nter in moderately dry\
    \ soils (WMO8, 2008). Keeping in mind\nthese known limitations they are sufﬁciently\
    \ reliable and in-\nexpensive. However, tensiometers are relatively service in-\n\
    tensive and sensitive to temperature ﬂuctuations while resis-\ntance blocks need\
    \ careful (re-)calibration during longer op-\neration periods. Both sensor types\
    \ are frequently used for\nagricultural purposes. A detailed description of these\
    \ meth-\nods can be found in (WMO8, 2008).\nHeat dissipation (or pulse) sensors\
    \ measure temperature\nchanges in response to a heat pulse (Robock et al., 2000).\
    \ It\nmakes use of the principle that the thermal behavior of the\nsoil is closely\
    \ related to its water content. Other indirect soil\nmoisture measurement techniques\
    \ include gamma densitom-\netry (based on the relatively greater gamma radiation\
    \ atten-\nuation factor of water compared to other soil components)\nand psychrometers.\
    \ All these indirect techniques need to be\nrecalibrated with gravimetric samples.\n\

    \ operational networks. Harmonization and quality\ncontrol of soil moisture datasets\
    \ can only be performed if suf-\nﬁcient data and metadata are available (Sects.\
    \ 3.3 and 3.4).\nThe information that is useful in interpreting the soil mois-\n\
    ture measurements can be subdivided into information that is\nconsidered either\

    \ meteorological and hydrologi-\ncal variables).\nThe static variables that are\
    \ included in the ISMN are sum-\nmarized in Table 1. The coordinates of the measurement\

    \ can be helpful indicators of soil moisture\ndata quality (Sect. 3.4). Temporal\
    \ sampling resolutions of\nthese variables (including soil moisture measurements)\
    \ vary\nfrom 10 min to infrequent measurements every couple of\ndays or even weeks,\
    \ although an hourly sampling interval is\nmost common. The sampling rate of the\
    \ original soil mois-\nture measurements for each network will be summarized in\n\
    Sect. 4.\n3.2\nSystem overview\n3.2.1\nGeneral layout\nThe data hosting facility\
    \ has been designed fulﬁlling the fol-\nlowing requirements: Firstly, the data\
    \ hosting facility had to\nbe able to store all relevant information for the networks,\
    \ the\nstations, the datasets, and the measurements techniques. Sec-\nondly, this\
    \ information should also be easily accessible, e.g.,\nby users who are looking\
    \ for datasets within a speciﬁc region\nof interest, or by users that for satellite\
    \ product validation are\ninterested only in soil moisture measurements of the\
    \ top soil\nlayer. Finally, any modiﬁcations made to the original data,\nlike\
    \ harmonization, should be traceable and the user should\nbe able to invert this\
    \ procedure to obtain the original mea-\nsurement values (e.g., plant available\
    \ water).\nBased on these considerations the following system was\nimplemented\
    \ (Fig. 1):\n1. software for automated reading, conversion, harmoniza-\ntion,\
    \ and quality checking of input data,\n2. a database containing the harmonized\
    \ data and meta-\ndata, and\n3. a web portal to provide the interface between\
    \ the\ndatabase and user queries and output.\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\

    The last two items are presented in this section, whereas\ndata harmonization\
    \ and quality control are discussed in\nSects. 3.3 and 3.4, respectively.\nThe\
    \ system is automated to the highest degree possible to\nfacilitate the processing\
    \ of large datasets and frequent up-\ndates. In practice, this means that data\
    \ harmonization, qual-\nity control, and archiving are performed in a fully automated\n\
    way.\nOnly the ingestion into the system of the original\ndatasets needs to be\
    \ tailored to the speciﬁc network, as the\ndata made available to the ISMN (e.g.,\
    \ by email or by down-\nload) are very heterogeneous with respect to ﬁle naming,\
    \ ﬁle\ntype, ﬁle format, the variables measured, and the metadata\navailable.\
    \ All data manipulations are performed in the Inter-\nactive Data Language (IDL)\
    \ of ITT-VIS3.\n3.2.2\nDatabase\nThe database (or archive) is the core of the\
    \ ISMN data host-\ning facility. Its design was very critical, since inadequate\n\
    design considerations can signiﬁcantly slow down operation\nwhen the database\
    \ gets ﬁlled or leads to a database structure\nthat is incapable of assimilating\
    \ new networks with a differ-\nent design or measurement setup. The design and\
    \ content of\nthe database was established after inventorying potential con-\n\
    tributing networks, expected soil moisture and other datasets,\npossible users,\
    \ and standards for hydrometeorological and\nspatial data and metadata (Sect.\
    \ 3.2.4). Thus, an overview\nof expected database entries, data volumes, and data\
    \ trafﬁc\ncould be established. A prototype of the data hosting facil-\nity was\
    \ ﬁrst tested with a selected number of users and data\nproviders and, wherever\
    \ feasible, modiﬁed to their sugges-\ntions.\nThe database distinguishes between\
    \ mandatory, condi-\ntional, and optional database entries (see also Tables 1-2)\
    \ and\nuses the following hierarchy: network > station > dataset.\n3http://www.ittvis.com\n\
    Apart from data and metadata of soil moisture and other vari-\nables, additional\
    \ relevant information on the networks and\nthe stations is included, e.g., the\
    \ responsible organization or\nreferences to more detailed information on the\
    \ networks and\nsites. Among others, an important design consideration has\nbeen\
    \ the use of a measurement depth interval (“from – to”)\nto comply with the different\
    \ measurement techniques and in-\nstallation positions of the sensors. In the\
    \ case of a variable\nmeasured at a speciﬁc depth, the “from” and “to” depths\
    \ are\nidentical.\nThe database was implemented in the open-source object-\nrelational\
    \ database management system PostgreSQL4 (ver-\nsion 8.4) including the spatial\
    \ database extension PostGIS5\n1.3.6.\n3.2.3\nWeb portal\nThe ISMN can be accessed\
    \ at http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/\ninsitu. It consists of two major parts: (i)\
    \ a project website\nproviding details about networks, partners, and the project\n\
    itself, and (ii) the data hosting centre itself where users can\nquery, view,\
    \ and download the data contained in the database.\nFigure 2 shows a screenshot\
    \ of the initial view of the data\nhosting centre. It embeds a Google Maps application\
    \ pro-\ngramming interface (API), which offers the user a map-based\nselection\
    \ tool to view and download the available data. In ad-\ndition, through the satellite\
    \ data and orthophotos in Google\nMaps the user is able to obtain additional information\
    \ about\nthe land use/land cover and topography in the vicinity of the\nmeasurement\
    \ stations. By clicking on the markers, the user\nobtains a summary of important\
    \ metadata about the networks\nor stations, respectively, depending on the zoom\
    \ level within\nGoogle Maps. For a selected station the available data can\nbe\

    \ hy-\ndroclimate projects. CEOP has accelerated the adoption of\nstandards for\
    \ various types of observations, including those\nof soil moisture. These standards\
    \ do not only specify the\nformats of the data (Table 3) but also provide prescriptions\n\
    on metadata formats and ﬁle naming conventions. Metadata\ndescriptions compliant\
    \ with ISO 19115 and INSPIRE (In-\nfrastructure for Spatial Information in the\
    \ European Com-\nmunity)8 are directly retrieved from the database and saved\n\
    in an XML ﬁle that is appended to the data download.\n6 CEOP is renamed GEWEX\

    Datasets provided by participating networks (Sect. 4) are har-\nmonized in time\
    \ and with respect to the measurement units.\n3.3.1\nTemporal resampling\nThe\
    \ various networks and stations measure at different tem-\nporal sampling intervals.\
    \ Whereas the datasets contained in\nthe Global Soil Moisture Data Bank (Robock\
    \ et al., 2000)\nsupply only several observations per month, most modern\nautomated\
    \ stations provide several measurements per hour\n(Sect. 4). Following recommendations\
    \ from the World Me-\nteorological Organization, co-sponsored programs and appli-\n\
    cations for satellite soil moisture products9, we decided that\nfor the ISMN a\
    \ temporal resolution of 1 hour is sufﬁcient for\nall applications, including\
    \ regional numerical weather pre-\ndiction.\nObservation datasets, which are available\
    \ at sub-hourly\nsampling rates, have been thinned selecting the individual\n\
    measurements at the hourly UTC reference time step (Ta-\nble 4).\nIf at this hourly\
    \ sampling interval no measure-\nment is available (e.g., indicated by a dummy\
    \ value like\n“−99.90”), the database entry will receive the value “NaN”\n(Not\
    \ a Number). This is illustrated in Table 4 for the time\nstep 18:00 UTC. If no\
    \ valid measurement is available, which\nmeans that the measurement value is outside\
    \ a plausible\nrange, the database entry for this measurement is labeled\nwith\

    \ it is not a common practice\nthat soil moisture networks provide quality indicators\
    \ with\ntheir data.\nTherefore, we decided to integrate the alloca-\ntion of quality\
    \ indicators in the data hosting facility itself.\nA rather conservative quality\
    \ checking scheme was imple-\nmented, so that suspect observations can be detected\
    \ more\neasily. We decided to provide only quality indicators that\ncan be checked\
    \ in an objective way. Hence, indicators like\n“Bad” and “Good” are not included.\
    \ This leads to the subset\nof CEOP quality ﬂags presented in Table 6.\nTable\
    \ 7 shows the possible ranges for the most important\nmeteorological variables.\
    \ If a measured data value exceeds\nthis range (on either side of the range) the\
    \ measurement re-\nceives the ﬂag value “C.” If a measurement is missing, its\n\
    quality ﬂag is set to “M.” All other dataset values have been\nset to “U” for\
    \ unchecked.\nIn contrast to the other meteorological measurements, for\nsoil\
    \ moisture also the quality ﬂag “Questionable/Dubious\n(D)” is adopted. This quality\
    \ ﬂag is adopted when a soil\nmoisture measurement in combination with another\
    \ variable\nleads to a suspicious result (Table 8).\n10http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/ceop/dm/documents/\n\

    \ information on the sites can be found in\nTable 9 and in Brocca et al. (2008,\
    \ 2009). Data from the\nCNR-IRPI network have been used to test the reliability\
    \ of\nvarious AMSR-E and ASCAT-based soil moisture products\n(Brocca et al., 2010b,\
    \ 2011; Liu et al., 2011) and to study\nthe spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture\
    \ (Brocca et al.,\n2007, 2010a).\n4.6\nFMI\nThis network is operated by the Finish\
    \ Meteorological In-\nstitute (FMI) as part of an operational weather observatory.\n\
    Currently it consists of a single station (FMI Arctic Research\nCentre in Sodankyl¨a)15\
    \ that measures soil moisture in a fully\nautomated operational mode at three\
    \ different locations a few\nmeters apart. The network has participated in several\
    \ inter-\nnational projects and initiatives, such as FLUXNET (Baldoc-\nchi et\
    \ al., 2001) and the validation of diverse SMOS products\n(Rautiainen et al.,\
    \ 2011). More information on the FMI can\nbe found in Rautiainen et al. (2011)\
    \ and in Table 9. The\nFMI network is the ﬁrst network in the ISMN that provides\n\
    updates on a fully automated basis. Once a day, data sets\nare downloaded from\
    \ the FMI server, processed and qual-\nity controlled, and ingested into the database\
    \ of the ISMN.\nData sets of the FMI network were used for studying the rela-\n\
    tionship between soil moisture and microwave emissions and\nbackscatter in L-.,\
    \ C-, and X-band (Pulliainen et al., 1994;\nRautiainen et al., 2011).\n4.7\nICN\n\
    The Illinois Climate Network (ICN)16 is coordinated by the\nWater and Atmospheric\
    \ Resources Program of the Illinois\nState Water Survey. This network was also\
    \ contained in the\nGlobal Soil Moisture Data Bank. Measurements began in\n1981\
    \ and the network continues to operate until present. The\nmain purpose of the\
    \ network is to provide information on ex-\ntreme and usual weather events, as\
    \ well as short and long-\nterm trends in climate data. The dataset contained\
    \ in the\nISMN covers the period 1983 through July 2008 while an\nupdate with\
    \ the most recent datasets is foreseen for the near\nfuture. The ﬁrst two years\
    \ were removed because of spin-up\n14http://www.irpi.cnr.it/\n15 http://fmiarc.fmi.ﬁ/index.html\n\

    \ 9 and Hollinger and Isard (1994). Apart from climate re-\nsearch (e.g., Hollinger\
    \ and Isard, 1994; Robock et al., 2000),\nseveral scientiﬁc disciplines already\
    \ beneﬁted form this net-\nwork including the evaluation of land surface ﬂuxes\
    \ and state\ndatasets (e.g., Findell and Eltahir, 1997; Dirmeyer, 2000;\nMaurer\
    \ et al., 2002), the assessment of drought severity mod-\nels (e.g., Dai et al.,\
    \ 2004), evaluation of climate models (e.g.,\nRobock et al., 1998; Oleson et al.,\
    \ 2008), long-term weather\nforecasting (e.g., Huang et al., 1996), designing\
    \ soil mois-\nture observational networks (e.g., Vinnikov et al., 1999a) and\n\
    satellite soil moisture product validation (e.g., Vinnikov et\nal., 1999b; Owe\
    \ et al., 2001; Njoku et al., 2003; Reichle et\nal., 2004; Owe et al., 2008).\n\
    4.8\nIOWA\nThe IOWA dataset was transferred from the Global Soil\nMoisture Data\
    \ Bank and consists of soil moisture observa-\ntions from two different catchments\
    \ located in the southwest\nof Iowa. Soil moisture observations were taken for\
    \ scientiﬁc\npurposes until 1994 when it ceased operation. The gravi-\nmetric\
    \ method was used to measure soil moisture for the top\n5 layers, neutron probes\
    \ for the deeper layers. On average,\nobservations were made twice a month between\
    \ April and\nOctober. More information about this network can be found\nin Table\
    \ 9, Entin et al. (2000), and Robock et al. (2000). The\nIOWA dataset has been\
    \ used e.g. for trend analysis in soil\nmoisture (Robock et al., 2000), satellite\
    \ product validation\n(Reichle et al., 2004) and for studying the temporal and\
    \ spa-\ntial scales of soil moisture dynamics (Entin et al., 2000).\n4.9\nLindenberg\
    \ Meteorological Observatory\nThe Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory – Richard\
    \ Ass-\nmann Observatory (MOL-RAO)17 is situated close to Berlin,\nGermany. It\
    \ is operated by the German Meteorological Ser-\nvice DWD and perfoms systematic\
    \ observations of the atmo-\nsphere and the land surface. Soil moisture is operationally\n\
    measured at a grassland site (Falkenberg) and a forest site\n(Kerigh) since 1998\
    \ and 2002, respectively. Being part of\nan operational meteorological observatory,\
    \ also several other\nrelevant hydrometeorological variables are provided and\
    \ soil\nproperties are well documented. Information on the network\ncan be found\
    \ in Table 9, in Beyrich and Adam (2007) and in\nvarious web sources 18. Soil\
    \ moisture data of the MOL-RAO\nnetwork have been used to study the effect of\
    \ soil moisture on\nsurface heat ﬂuxes (Beyrich et al., 2006; Heret et al., 2006).\n\
    4.10\nMONGOLIA\nAlso this dataset was previously contained in the Global\nSoil\
    \ Moisture Data Bank. Soil moisture datasets were col-\nlected by the National\
    \ Agency of Meteorology, Hydrology\nand Environment Monitoring in Ulaanbaatar\
    \ for agricultural\npurposes. All observations were initially provided as volu-\n\
    metric plant-available water. As the original measured wilt-\ning levels, required\
    \ to convert PAW into fractional volumet-\nric soil moisture content, could not\
    \ be retrieved, these were\ncalculated from soil texture and organic carbon content\
    \ at\neach station using the predictive equations of Saxton and\nRawls (2006).\
    \ Input to the equations was provided by the\nHarmonized World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-\n\
    CAS/JRC, 2009). Soil moisture measurements are provided\nthree times a month during\
    \ the warm period of the year,\nwhich runs from April until the end of October.\
    \ More infor-\nmation about this network is found in Table 9 and Robock\net al.\
    \ (2000). Datasets of the MONGOLIA network have\nbeen extensively used in studies\
    \ connected to climate vari-\nability (Robock et al., 2000), the evaluation of\
    \ drought sever-\nity models (Dai et al., 2004), validation of satellite-based\
    \ soil\nmoisture products (Reichle et al., 2004), and for studying the\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales of soil moisture dynamics (Entin\net al., 2000).\n4.11\n\
    OzNet\nThe OzNet hydrological monitoring network (Table 9) con-\nsists of several\

    \ et\nal., 2008) and the Goulburn River catchments (R¨udiger et al.,\n2007). The\
    \ OzNet network is managed by the University of\nMelbourne. Datasets from the\
    \ OzNet have been extensively\nused for satellite product validation (Draper et\
    \ al., 2009; Liu\net al., 2011; Parinussa et al., 2011) and the evaluation of\
    \ land\nsurface models (Richter et al., 2004).\n4.12\nREMEDHUS\nThe REMEDHUS network\
    \ is situated in the center of the\nIberian Peninsula. It was set up in 1999 as\
    \ an experimen-\ntal network by the Centro Hispano Luso de Investigaciones\nAgrarias\
    \ (CIALE) group of the University of Salamanca20.\nThe stations lie in an agricultural\
    \ area. In the vicinity of a\nfew stations irrigation occurs. As a result, large\
    \ jumps in\nmeasured soil moisture that cannot be coupled to meteoro-\nlogical\
    \ events and very high soil moisture fractions (up to\n0.95 m3 m−3) may be observed\
    \ here. As irrigation usually\nis a very local phenomenon, the stations that are\
    \ affected\nshould be treated with caution when interpreted in a spa-\ntial context.\
    \ Details of the network can be found in Table 9\nand in Mart´ınez-Fern´andez\
    \ and Ceballos (2005). Datasets\nof the REMEDHUS network have been used by study\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture (Mart´ınez-\nFern´andez\
    \ and Ceballos, 2003, 2005) and for satellite prod-\nuct validation (Ceballos\
    \ et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2007; Liu\net al., 2011; Parinussa et al., 2011).\n\
    4.13\nRUSWET-AGRO\nSoil moisture datasets for 78 districts in the Former Soviet\n\
    Union were prepared for agricultural purposes by the Rus-\nsian Hydrometeorological\
    \ Center, Moscow, Russia and ini-\ntially distributed through the Global Soil\
    \ Moisture Databank.\nThe soil moisture observations were originally provided\
    \ as\nvolumetric plant-available water [volumetric %]. Due to the\nlag between\
    \ observations and the publication of the data in\nreference books, and geo-political\
    \ changes during the era,\ninformation on the wilting points (required to convert\
    \ plant\navailable water into volumetric soil moisture) has gone lost.\nTo resolve\
    \ this problem and make the data compatible, the\npredictive equations of Saxton\
    \ and Rawls (2006) were used\nto estimate the wilting points from soil texture\
    \ and organic\ncarbon content. Input to the equations was provided by the\nHarmonized\
    \ World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-\nCAS/JRC, 2009). As the RUSWET-AGRO\
    \ dataset was de-\nsigned for monitoring soil moisture at agricultural ﬁelds,\n\
    datasets were separately available for spring cereal crops and\nwinter cereal\
    \ crops for all locations. In the ISMN stations\nwith the sufﬁx “a” represent\
    \ spring cereal crops while sta-\ntions with “b” illustrate winter cereal crops.\
    \ Measurements\nare available three times a month during the growing period\n\
    of 1987 and 1988. More information about this network is\n20http://campus.usal.es/∼hidrus/\n\
    available in Table 9, Vinnikov and Yeserkepova (1991), and\nRobock et al. (2000).\
    \ The RUSWET-AGRO datasets have\nbeen widely used for climate research (Robock\
    \ et al., 2000),\nevaluation of drought severity models (Dai et al., 2004), land\n\
    surface model evaluation (Balsamo et al., 2009), and satellite\nproduct validation\
    \ (Reichle et al., 2004).\n4.14\nRUSWET-GRASS\nThe RUSWET-GRASS dataset is a merger\
    \ of the RUSWET-\n130STA and RUSWET-50STA networks from the former So-\nviet Union\
    \ previously contained in the Global Soil Moisture\nData Bank.\nMeasurements were\
    \ originally used for agri-\ncultural predictions. As soil moisture was originally\
    \ pro-\nvided as plant available water, wilting points were needed\nto covert\
    \ the measurements into volumetric soil moisture.\nSimilarly as for the RUSWET-AGRO\
    \ network, the predic-\ntive equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006) were used to\
    \ es-\ntimate the wilting points from soil texture and organic car-\nbon content\
    \ while input to the equations was provided by the\nHarmonized World Soil Database\
    \ (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-\nCAS/JRC, 2009). The dataset covers the years 1952–1985,\n\
    but the spatial extent of these data is poor until about 1975.\nObservations were\
    \ made with a temporal resolution of about\n10 days during the warm season, and\
    \ once a month during\nwinter. The provided measurements are the average of four\n\
    samples taken within an area of about 1000 m2. More in-\nformation on this dataset\
    \ can be found in Table 9, Vinnikov\nand Yeserkepova (1991), and Robock et al.\
    \ (2000).\nThe\nRUSWET-GRASS datasets have been widely used for cli-\nmate research\
    \ (e.g., Robock et al., 2000), evaluation of land\nsurface models (e.g., Robock\
    \ et al., 1995, 1998; Yang et\nal., 1997), evaluation of drought severity models\
    \ (e.g., Dai\net al., 2004), and satellite product validation (e.g., Reichle\n\
    et al., 2004).\n4.15\nRUSWET-VALDAI\nSoil moisture datasets for 3 catchments located\
    \ in the Val-\ndai basin were collected by the State Hydrological Institute\n\
    in St. Petersburg from 1960 to 1990 for water balance stud-\nies. The catchments\
    \ are characterized by different types of\nvegetation. Soil moisture [volumetric\
    \ %] was computed us-\ning data from 9–11 observational points distributed over\
    \ the\nbasin area. The resulting ﬁles contain monthly means of soil\nmoisture\
    \ for three different depth intervals. Thus, soil mois-\nture values are available\
    \ as monthly means, precipitation as\nmonthly totals [mm], and temperature [◦C]\
    \ as daily values.\nOther variables measured but not included into the ISMN\n\
    are runoff, monthly averaged water table depth, snow water\nequivalent, and evaporation.\
    \ More information can be found\nin Table 9, Vinnikov and Yeserkepova (1991),\
    \ and Robock\net al. (2000). The RUSWET-VALDAI datasets have been\nwidely used\
    \ for climate research (Robock et al., 2000), anal-\nysis of scales of soil moisture\
    \ variation (e.g., Vinnikov et al.,\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698,\

    \ et al., 2003),\nevaluation of drought severity models (Dai et al., 2004), and\n\
    satellite product validation (Reichle et al., 2004).\n4.16\nSMOSMANIA\nThe SMOSMANIA\
    \ network in southern France was\nset up in support of calibration and validation\
    \ activi-\nties for SMOS. The network is operated by the Cen-\ntre National de\
    \ Recherches M´et´eorologiques,\nGroupe\nd’Etude de l’Atmosph`ere M´et´eorologique\
    \ (CNRM/GAME),\nM´et´eoFrance, CNRS. Initially, 12 stations were installed, but\n\
    from the start of 2009 the network was extended with an-\nother 9 stations. Details\
    \ of SMOSMANIA can be found in\nTable 9 and in Albergel et al. (2008) and Calvet\
    \ et al. (2008).\nMeasurements taken by this network have been extensively\nused\
    \ for validating various satellite-based soil moisture prod-\nucts (Albergel et\
    \ al., 2009, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Brocca et\nal., 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Parinussa\
    \ et al., 2011) and for\nstudying the interaction between surface and sub-surface\
    \ soil\nmoisture levels (Albergel et al., 2008).\n4.17\nSWEX POLAND\nThe\nSoil\n\

    \ Institute of\nAgrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences.\nThe\nnetwork has\
    \ been set up in particular to support calibration\nand validation of SMOS products\
    \ over wetlands.\nSoil\nmoisture and soil temperature are measured over eight\n\
    different depths. More info is found in Table 9 and Mar-\nczewski et al. (2010).\
    \ Primary purpose of the network will\nbe the validation of satellite–based soil\
    \ moisture retrievals\n(Marczewski et al., 2010).\n4.18\nUDC SMOS\nThe\nUpper\n\
    Danube\nCatchment\nSMOS\nnetwork\n(UDC SMOS) in Southern Germany is one of the\
    \ two\nofﬁcial European SMOS cal/val test sites. The soil moisture\nnetwork is\
    \ run as a cooperation between the University\nof Munich and the Bavarian State\
    \ Research Center for\nAgriculture. It is funded by the German Aerospace Centre\n\
    (DLR) through the project SMOSHYD21. At some stations\nsoil moisture of a speciﬁc\
    \ layer is measured by multiple\nsensors. Details on the UDC SMOS network can\
    \ be found\nin Ttable 9 and Loew et al. (2009). Loew and Schlenz (2011)\nused\
    \ the soil moisture data of this network to quantify the\nuncertainties of an\
    \ AMSR-E derived soil moisture product.\n21http://www.geographie.uni-muenchen.de/department/ﬁona/\n\
    forschung/projekte/index.php?projekt id=103\n4.19\nUMSUOL\nUMSUOL is a network\
    \ in the Po river plain in Northern Italy.\nIt is part of an operational meteorological\
    \ network operated\nby the Service of Hydrology, Meteorology and Climate of the\n\
    Regional Agency for Environmental Protection in Emilia-\nRomagna (ARPA – SIMC)\
    \ mainly for agricultural purposes.\nMore information is given in Table 9. Soil\
    \ moisture data of\nthis network have been used for satellite product validation\n\
    and intercomparison (Brocca et al., 2011).\n5\nDiscussion\n5.1\nImpact of the\
    \ ISMN for satellite products and land\nsurface models\nEven though initial funding\
    \ for the establishment of the\nISMN, as provided by ESA, mainly focuses on the\
    \ SMOS\nmission, other satellite-based soil moisture products from the\nexisting\
    \ and future missions such as AMSR-E, ASCAT, and\nSMAP can proﬁt from the established\
    \ network (for refer-\nences see the individual networks in Sect. 4). However,\
    \ the\nintention of the ISMN is to go beyond the role of satellite val-\nidation\
    \ resource and to serve other scientiﬁc and application-\noriented communities\
    \ as well, such as hydrological model-\ning, numerical weather forecasting, and\
    \ water management.\nTo fulﬁll this task, the ISMN stores not only surface soil\n\
    moisture but also soil water content of the deeper layers and\nrelevant hydrometeorological\
    \ variables such as precipitation\nand temperature of the air and soil. In addition,\
    \ to better\nserve time critical applications (ranging from several hours\nto\
    \ a few days), the ISMN has been structured in a way that\nenables processing\
    \ incoming soil moisture measurements on\na fully automated basis. The automated\
    \ daily update of data\nfrom the FMI network shows that a NRT assimilation and\n\
    redistribution of data is possible. Nevertheless, prerequisite\nfor the added\
    \ value of such a mode is the presence of opera-\ntional measurement and processing\
    \ chains on the part of the\ndata providers in order to guarantee timely data\
    \ delivery to\nthe ISMN.\n5.2\nConsiderations on data representativeness and\n\
    quality\nThe appropriateness of one or more soil moisture datasets\nfrom the ISMN\
    \ for a speciﬁc application strongly depends\non the spatial and temporal scales\
    \ of the in-situ measure-\nments and of the process that the user wishes to describe.\n\
    For example, if the aim is to validate satellite-derived surface\nsoil moisture,\
    \ the user should be aware that these products\ncontain information only about\
    \ the upper few millimeters to\ncentimeters of the soil column, whereas a technique\
    \ based\non cosmic-ray neutrons provides information up to a depth\nof ∼70 cm.\
    \ On the other hand, the latter provides estimates\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\
    Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\n1692\nW. A. Dorigo et al.: The\
    \ International Soil Moisture Network\nthat are spatially more consistent than\
    \ single electromagnetic\ndevices or gravimetric measurements.\nApart from the\
    \ choice of the measurement technique itself,\nalso its employment has a strong\
    \ impact on what is exactly\nobserved. The in-situ measurements are inﬂuenced\
    \ by sev-\neral factors including:\n– Installation depth of the sensor.\n– Placement\
    \ of the sensor, e.g., is sensor positioned hori-\nzontally or vertically?\n–\
    \ Is soil moisture measured at a speciﬁc depth or inte-\ngrated over a certain\
    \ soil depth interval? This is often\nclosely related to the positioning of the\
    \ instrument.\n– Density and geographical distribution of measurements.\n– Characterization\
    \ of the soil, including texture, porosity,\nand organic matter content.\n– Calibration\
    \ of the sensor\nIdeally, all these factors should be accounted for when har-\n\
    monizing in situ soil measurements from different sites, so\nthat observed variations\
    \ are related only to real differences in\nsoil moisture. However, such a harmonization\
    \ of data would\ngo beyond the current objective of the ISMN.\nThe choice of the\
    \ measurement technique may also have a\nstrong impact on the data quality. In\
    \ Sect. 2.2 and several ad-\nvantages and disadvantages of the different techniques\
    \ were\nhighlighted while the relative performance of various sensors\nhas been\
    \ extensively documented in literature (Baumhardt et\nal., 2000; Walker et al.,\
    \ 2004; Czarnomski et al., 2005; Mit-\ntelbach et al., 2011). Even if TDR sensors\
    \ nowadays are of-\nten considered as benchmark for operational ﬁeld monitoring\n\
    of soil moisture, other, less expensive systems may in many\nsituations show comparable\
    \ performance (e.g. Czarnomski\net al., 2005) and therefore should not be excluded\
    \ on before-\nhand from data analysis.\nThe relative accuracy and precision of\
    \ stations may differ\nfrom site to site (even when employing similar instruments)\n\
    and can shift over time due to sensor degradation or external\ndisturbances. Not\
    \ considering these differences in further us-\nage of the data may falsely affect\
    \ results obtained and con-\nclusions drawn by a study. Therefore, adequate quality\
    \ char-\nacterization of the individual networks and stations is highly\ndesired.\
    \ As the current quality control procedure is only able\nto detect evident outliers\
    \ but does not give us any informa-\ntion about subtle differences between stations,\
    \ future efforts\nwill primarily focus on improved quality control. This will\n\
    be done at the level of individual measurement values as well\nas at the station\
    \ and network level.\n5.3\nUtilization strategies for ISMN datasets\nEvaluating\
    \ satellite- and model-derived soil moisture re-\ntrievals with in situ soil moisture\
    \ measurements is commonly\nbased on the root-mean-square metric (Jackson et al.,\
    \ 2010).\nHowever, to use in situ soil moisture measurements from\nthe ISMN in\
    \ satellite and land surface model validation and\ncalibration, the user should\
    \ be aware of the systematic dif-\nferences that may exist between in situ measurements\
    \ and\nsoil moisture estimates from models and satellite observa-\ntions (Entekhabi\
    \ et al., 2010b). Even though the ISMN pro-\nvides soil moisture measurements\
    \ in the same volumetric\nunit that is returned by most satellite products and\
    \ models, bi-\nases and differences in the dynamic range may exist between\nthe\
    \ datasets, e.g., by assumptions and generalizations made\nwithin the retrieval\
    \ concept, scaling issues, or due to the dif-\nferent soil layers or soil depths\
    \ considered. Thus, other met-\nrics, such as the Pearson or Spearman correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient,\noften provide valuable and complementary information on\nthe performance\
    \ (Entekhabi et al., 2010b).\nTo combine in situ soil moisture measurements with\
    \ satel-\nlite retrievals and a ﬁrst guess predicted by a land surface\nmodel,\
    \ e.g., in the framework of data assimilation, it is often\nnecessary to minimize\
    \ systematic differences between the in-\ndividual datasets (e.g. Drusch, 2007).\
    \ These correction meth-\nods include standard rescaling techniques, e.g. based\
    \ on sim-\nple statistic descriptors of both datasets such as minimum,\nmaximum,\
    \ mean, and variance (Dorigo et al., 2010; Miralles\net al., 2010), linear regression\
    \ (Scipal et al., 2008), or CDF-\nmatching (Drusch et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2011).\
    \ Other studies\npropose the use of exponential ﬁlters or land surface models\n\
    to ﬁnd a robust relationship between the soil moisture dy-\nnamics observed at\
    \ different observation depths and in dif-\nferent observation spaces (Wagner\
    \ et al., 1999; Sabater et al.,\n2007; Albergel et al., 2008).\n5.4\nAdditional\
    \ science beneﬁts of the ISMN\nSince for the ﬁrst time a globally harmonized soil\
    \ moisture\ndataset is available, the ISMN may help to ﬁnd comprehen-\nsive answers\
    \ to fundamental science questions regarding soil\nmoisture and its role in the\
    \ integrated water cycle, such as:\n– Can we reﬁne our understanding of the memory\
    \ of soil\nmoisture (e.g., Entin et al., 2000)? How does it depend\non climate\
    \ variability, climate persistence and soil hy-\ndraulic properties? How do vegetation\
    \ characteristics\naffect this memory?\n– How is surface soil moisture dynamics\
    \ linked with that\nin the subsurface proﬁle? How does soil moisture at the\n\
    surface and below the surface respond to precipitation\nevents and drydowns?\n\
    Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\
    W. A. Dorigo et al.: The International Soil Moisture Network\n1693\n– Can long-term\
    \ trends and changes in the frequencies of\nextremes that have been regionally\
    \ observed in regional\nin situ observations (e.g., Robock et al., 2005) be ex-\n\
    trapolated to the global scale?\n– What are the functional relationships between\
    \ soil mois-\nture and evaporation (e.g. Jung et al., 2010)? How does\nit depend\
    \ on vegetation, soil type and structure?\nIn addition, existing knowledge on\
    \ the temporal stability and\nspatial correlation of soil moisture (e.g. Vachaud\
    \ et al., 1985;\nMart´ınez-Fern´andez and Ceballos, 2005; Cosh et al., 2008),\n\
    can now be strengthened with global evidence. Moreover,\nthere is a proven strong\
    \ relationship between soil moisture\nand the biogeochemical cycles (e.g. Ciais\
    \ et al., 2005) while,\nat the same time, our knowledge on how this interaction\
    \ ex-\nactly takes place is still very limited (van der Molen et al.,\n2011).\
    \ The ISMN may help to gain further inside in this pro-\ncess.\n6\nConclusions\
    \ and outlook\nWith the establishment of the ISMN data hosting center pre-\nsented\
    \ in this paper, a ﬁrst important step has been taken to-\nward a global soil\
    \ moisture observing system. Although soil\nmoisture is now recognized as an essential\
    \ climate variable\nby GCOS, the growth and continuity of this effort will de-\n\
    pend upon the commitment of ﬁnancial support and the co-\noperation of data providers\
    \ on a long-term basis. To reach\nthe goal of a fully integrated global soil moisture\
    \ observing\nsystem it will be necessary to establish, expand and improve\ncurrent\
    \ soil moisture observations, both in situ and remotely\nsensed. The in situ efforts\
    \ should focus on:\n– Developing a coordinated plan for soil moisture net-\nworks\
    \ at both the national and international levels.\n– Designing a supersite program,\
    \ approximately satellite\nfootprint size regions with high density measurements,\n\
    needed to provide the comprehensive datasets required\nfor satellite sensor evaluation\
    \ and calibration, and to\nprovide a basis for developing soil wetness algorithms\n\
    for satellite measurements and the evaluation of cli-\nmate model outputs. For\
    \ example, we expect the newly\nestablished National Ecological Observatory Network\n\
    (NEON) in the US and the densely sampled watershed\nvalidation networks operated\
    \ by USDA, to help serve as\na model for such efforts.\n– Enhancing consistency\
    \ and standardization of measure-\nments, data, and metadata.\n– Striving for\
    \ data continuity and automation.\n– Advancing data exchange.\nThe positive and\
    \ vital contributions of international orga-\nnizations such as WCRP, GEWEX and\
    \ GEO, the support of\nSpace Agencies, and the voluntary efforts of numerous in-\n\
    dividual scientists contributing to the ISMN have raised the\nconﬁdence that the\
    \ consciousness and willingness to realize\nsuch an integrated soil moisture observing\
    \ system are ubiq-\nuitous.\nFinally, we would like to emphasize that the ISMN\
    \ is a\ngrowing entity animated by the scientiﬁc community itself.\nWe therefore\
    \ solicit users to download, use, and give feed-\nback on the datasets currently\
    \ contained in the database, and\ninvite potential networks to enrich the collection\
    \ by shar-\ning their data with the ISMN. As was demonstrated by the\nsuccess\
    \ the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank (Robock et al.,\n2000), the beneﬁt of sharing\
    \ soil moisture data free of cost\nwith the scientiﬁc community is valuable not\
    \ only for data\nusers but also for the networks. Networks may become em-\nbedded\
    \ as key networks in international calibration and val-\nidation activities or\
    \ climate monitoring programs, e.g. like\nhappened to the ﬂux tower sites participating\
    \ to FLUXNET\n(Baldocchi et al., 2001) or the stations participating to the\n\
    Baseline Surface Radiation Network (Ohmura et al., 1998).\nThis in turn may lead\
    \ to vast international scientiﬁc recog-\nnition and pave the way for access to\
    \ extended funding re-\nsources.\nAcknowledgements. We greatly thank all data\

    Media Tables Share SUMMARY Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a highly troublesome
    pathogen for many institutions globally. As a consequence of its immense ability
    to acquire or upregulate antibiotic drug resistance determinants, it has justifiably
    been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention. Apart from its predilection
    for the seriously ill within intensive care units, A. baumannii has more recently
    caused a range of infectious syndromes in military personnel injured in the Iraq
    and Afghanistan conflicts. This review details the significant advances that have
    been made in our understanding of this remarkable organism over the last 10 years,
    including current taxonomy and species identification, issues with susceptibility
    testing, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, global epidemiology, clinical impact
    of infection, host-pathogen interactions, and infection control and therapeutic
    considerations. INTRODUCTION The genus known as Acinetobacter has undergone significant
    taxonomic modification over the last 30 years. Its most important representative,
    Acinetobacter baumannii, has emerged as one of the most troublesome pathogens
    for health care institutions globally. Its clinical significance, especially over
    the last 15 years, has been propelled by its remarkable ability to upregulate
    or acquire resistance determinants, making it one of the organisms threatening
    the current antibiotic era. A. baumannii strains resistant to all known antibiotics
    have now been reported, signifying a sentinel event that should be acted on promptly
    by the international health care community. Acting in synergy with this emerging
    resistance profile is the uncanny ability of A. baumannii to survive for prolonged
    periods throughout a hospital environment, thus potentiating its ability for nosocomial
    spread. The organism commonly targets the most vulnerable hospitalized patients,
    those who are critically ill with breaches in skin integrity and airway protection.
    As reported from reviews dating back to the 1970s (199), hospital-acquired pneumonia
    is still the most common infection caused by this organism. However, in more recent
    times, infections involving the central nervous system, skin and soft tissue,
    and bone have emerged as highly problematic for certain institutions. Interest
    in Acinetobacter, from both the scientific and public community, has risen sharply
    over recent years. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of
    this fascinating organism since it was last reviewed in this journal in 1996 (28).
    In the present review, we describe these advances and also provide a comprehensive
    appraisal of the relevant microbiological, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics
    of A. baumannii, the most clinically relevant species. The epidemiology, clinical
    impact, and resistance mechanisms of Acinetobacter species outside the A. baumannii
    group are not covered in this review. MICROBIOLOGY Historical Perspective of the
    Genus Acinetobacter The history of the genus Acinetobacter dates back to the early
    20th century, in 1911, when Beijerinck, a Dutch microbiologist, described an organism
    named Micrococcus calco-aceticus that was isolated from soil by enrichment in
    a calcium-acetate-containing minimal medium (24). Over the following decades,
    similar organisms were described and assigned to at least 15 different genera
    and species, including Diplococcus mucosus (587), Micrococcus calcoaceticus (24),
    Alcaligenes haemolysans (228), Mima polymorpha (117), Moraxella lwoffi (14), Herellea
    vaginicola (116), Bacterium anitratum (485), Moraxella lwoffi var. glucidolytica
    (434), Neisseria winogradskyi (323), Achromobacter anitratus (60), and Achromobacter
    mucosus (352). For a comprehensive review of the history of the genus, the reader
    is referred to the work of Henriksen (228). The current genus designation, Acinetobacter
    (from the Greek ακινετοσ [akinetos], i.e., nonmotile), was initially proposed
    by Brisou and Prévot in 1954 to separate the nonmotile from the motile microorganisms
    within the genus Achromobacter (61). It was not until 1968 that this genus designation
    became more widely accepted (21). Baumann et al. published a comprehensive survey
    and concluded that the different species listed above belonged to a single genus,
    for which the name Acinetobacter was proposed, and that further subclassification
    into different species based on phenotypic characteristics was not possible (21).
    These findings resulted in the official acknowledgment of the genus Acinetobacter
    by the Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of Moraxella and Allied Bacteria in 1971 (324).
    In the 1974 edition of Bergey''s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (312), the
    genus Acinetobacter was listed, with the description of a single species, Acinetobacter
    calcoaceticus (the type strain for both the genus and the species is A. calcoaceticus
    ATCC 23055) (24). In the “Approved List of Bacterial Names,” in contrast, two
    different species, A. calcoaceticus and A. lwoffii, were included, based on the
    observation that some acinetobacters were able to acidify glucose whereas others
    were not (512). In the literature, based on the same properties, the species A.
    calcoaceticus was subdivided into two subspecies or biovars, A. calcoaceticus
    bv. anitratus (formerly called Herellea vaginicola) and A. calcoaceticus bv. lwoffii
    (formerly called Mima polymorpha). These designations, however, were never officially
    approved by taxonomists. Current Taxonomy The genus Acinetobacter, as currently
    defined, comprises gram-negative, strictly aerobic, nonfermenting, nonfastidious,
    nonmotile, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative bacteria with a DNA G+C content
    of 39% to 47%. Based on more recent taxonomic data, it was proposed that members
    of the genus Acinetobacter should be classified in the new family Moraxellaceae
    within the order Gammaproteobacteria, which includes the genera Moraxella, Acinetobacter,
    Psychrobacter, and related organisms (466). A major breakthrough in the long and
    complicated history of the genus was achieved in 1986 by Bouvet and Grimont, who—based
    on DNA-DNA hybridization studies—distinguished 12 DNA (hybridization) groups or
    genospecies, some of which were given formal species names, including A. baumannii,
    A. calcoaceticus, A. haemolyticus, A. johnsonii, A. junii, and A. lwoffii (51).
    Work done by Bouvet and Jeanjean, Tjernberg and Ursing, and Nishimura et al. (53,
    401, 542) resulted in the description of further Acinetobacter genomic species,
    including the named species A. radioresistens, which corresponds to Acinetobacter
    genomic species 12 described previously by Bouvet and Grimont (51). Some of the
    independently described (genomic) species turned out to be synonyms, e.g., A.
    lwoffii and Acinetobacter genomic species 9 or Acinetobacter genomic species 14,
    described by Bouvet and Jeanjean (14BJ), and Acinetobacter genomic species 13,
    described by Tjernberg and Ursing (13TU). More recently, 10 additional Acinetobacter
    species were described, including 3 species of human origin, A. parvus, A. schindleri,
    and A. ursingii (392, 393), and 7 species isolated from activated sludge (recovered
    from sewage plants), namely, A. baylyi, A. bouvetii, A. grimontii, A. tjernbergiae,
    A. towneri, A. tandoii, and A. gerneri (72), increasing the actual number of validly
    described (genomic) species to 31, of which 17 have been given valid species names
    (Table 1). It has to be noted, however, that some of the recently described environmental
    Acinetobacter species included only one or a few strains at the time of publication
    (72). Four of the above listed species, i.e., A. calcoaceticus, A. baumannii,
    Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU, are very
    closely related and difficult to distinguish from each other by phenotypic properties.
    It has therefore been proposed to refer to these species as the A. calcoaceticus-A.
    baumannii complex (189, 191). However, this group of organisms comprises not only
    the three most clinically relevant species that have been implicated in the vast
    majority of both community-acquired and nosocomial infections, i.e., A. baumannii,
    Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU (see below),
    but also an environmental species, A. calcoaceticus, that has frequently been
    recovered from soil and water but has, to our knowledge, never been implicated
    in serious clinical disease. Therefore, since it is the environmental species
    that has given its name to the complex, the designation A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii
    complex may be misleading and not appropriate if used in a clinical context. Species
    Identification Acinetobacters may be identified presumptively to the genus level
    as gram-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, nonmotile, nonfermenting
    coccobacilli. They are short, plump, gram-negative rods that are difficult to
    destain and may therefore be misidentified as either gram-negative or gram-positive
    cocci (hence the former designation Mimae). Acinetobacter species of human origin
    grow well on solid media that are routinely used in clinical microbiology laboratories,
    such as sheep blood agar or tryptic soy agar, at a 37°C incubation temperature.
    These organisms form smooth, sometimes mucoid, grayish white colonies; colonies
    of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex resemble those of Enterobacteriaceae,
    with a colony diameter of 1.5 to 3 mm after overnight culture, while most of the
    other Acinetobacter species produce smaller and more translucent colonies. Unlike
    the Enterobacteriaceae, some Acinetobacter species outside the A. calcoaceticus-A.
    baumannii complex may not grow on McConkey agar. Isolates of the species A. haemolyticus
    and several other currently not-well-defined species, such as Acinetobacter genomic
    species 6, 13BJ, 14BJ, 15BJ, 16, and 17, may show hemolysis on sheep blood agar,
    a property that is never present in Acinetobacter isolates belonging to the A.
    calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex. Unfortunately, no single metabolic test distinguishes
    acinetobacters from other similar nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria. A reliable
    method for unambiguous identification of acinetobacters to the genus level is
    the transformation assay of Juni, which is based on the unique property of mutant
    Acinetobacter strain BD413 trpE27, a naturally transformable tryptophan auxotroph
    recently identified as A. baylyi (574), to be transformed by crude DNA of any
    Acinetobacter species to a wild-type phenotype (281). For the recovery of acinetobacters
    from environmental and clinical specimens (e.g., skin swabs to detect skin colonization),
    enrichment culture at low pH in a vigorously aerated liquid mineral medium supplemented
    with acetate or another suitable carbon source and with nitrate as the nitrogen
    source has proven useful (20). To facilitate the isolation of acinetobacters from
    mixed bacterial populations, Leeds Acinetobacter medium was proposed (260). Of
    the few methods that have been validated for identification of Acinetobacter species,
    DNA-DNA hybridization remains the reference standard (51). The phenotypic identification
    scheme proposed by Bouvet and Grimont in 1986 is based on 28 phenotypic tests
    (51). This identification scheme was refined in 1987 by the same authors and includes
    growth at 37°C, 41°C, and 44°C; production of acid from glucose; gelatin hydrolysis;
    and assimilation of 14 different carbon sources (52). While this simplified identification
    scheme allows discrimination between 11 of the 12 genomic species initially described
    (51) and correctly identified to the species level 95.6% of 136 Acinetobacter
    isolates recovered from human skin samples (495), it does not permit identification
    of the more recently described (genomic) species. In particular, the closely related
    and clinically most relevant species A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species
    13TU cannot be distinguished, while A. calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic
    species 3 can only be separated by their growth properties at different temperatures
    (191). Unfortunately, simple phenotypic tests that are commonly used in routine
    diagnostic laboratories for identification of other bacterial genera to the species
    level are unsuitable for unambiguous identification of even the most common Acinetobacter
    species. Both DNA-DNA hybridization and the phenotypic identification system of
    Bouvet and Grimont are laborious and far from being suitable for routine microbiology
    laboratories. In fact, these methods are available in only a few reference laboratories
    worldwide. Molecular methods that have been developed and validated for identification
    of acinetobacters include amplified 16S rRNA gene restriction analysis (ARDRA)
    (572; for an evaluation of ARDRA, see reference 127), high-resolution fingerprint
    analysis by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) (258, 392), ribotyping
    (189), tRNA spacer fingerprinting (146), restriction analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA
    intergenic spacer sequences (131), sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA gene
    spacer region (79), and sequencing of the rpoB (RNA polymerase β-subunit) gene
    and its flanking spacers (310). ARDRA and AFLP analysis are currently the most
    widely accepted and validated reference methods for species identification of
    acinetobacters, with a large library of profiles available for both reference
    and clinical strains, while tRNA fingerprinting, though generally also suitable
    for species identification, does not discriminate between A. baumannii and Acinetobacter
    genomic species 13TU. Both ribotyping and sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA
    gene spacer region were found to discriminate between species of the A. calcoaceticus-A.
    baumannii complex but have not been applied to other Acinetobacter species, and
    sequencing of the rpoB gene, although very promising, awaits further validation.
    All of these methods have contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology
    and clinical significance of Acinetobacter species during recent years, but they
    are too laborious to be applied in day-to-day diagnostic microbiology, and their
    use for the time being is also confined mainly to reference laboratories. More
    recent developments include the identification of A. baumannii by detection of
    the blaOXA-51-like carbapenemase gene intrinsic to this species (559), PCR-electrospray
    ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI-MS) (145), and a simple PCR-based method
    described by Higgins et al. (234) that exploits differences in their respective
    gyrB genes to rapidly differentiate between A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic
    species 13TU. Promising results with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight
    MS have been obtained for species identification of 552 well-characterized Acinetobacter
    strains representing 15 different species (496). Matrix-assisted laser desorption
    ionization-time-of-flight MS allows for species identification in less than 1
    hour, but it requires expensive equipment and needs further evaluation. Species
    identification with manual and semiautomated commercial identification systems
    that are currently used in diagnostic microbiology, such as the API 20NE, Vitek
    2, Phoenix, and MicroScan WalkAway systems, remains problematic (33, 35, 244).
    This can be explained in part by their limited database content but also because
    the substrates used for bacterial species identification have not been tailored
    specifically to identify acinetobacters. In particular, the three clinically relevant
    members of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex cannot be separated by currently
    available commercial identification systems; in fact, A. baumannii, Acinetobacter
    genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU are uniformly identified
    as A. baumannii by the most widely used identification systems. In referring to
    these species, it therefore seems appropriate to use the term A. baumannii group
    instead of A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex. This reflects the fact that
    A. baumannii, Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species
    13TU share important clinical and epidemiological characteristics (124, 335, 498)
    and also eliminates the confusion resulting from inclusion of an environmental
    species, A. calcoaceticus (see above). However, since the vast majority of studies
    that have addressed epidemiological and clinical issues related to Acinetobacter
    have not employed identification methods that allow for unambiguous species identification
    within the A. baumannii group, the designation A. baumannii in this review, if
    not stated otherwise, is used in a broader sense to also accommodate Acinetobacter
    genomic species 3 and 13TU. The need for species identification of acinetobacters
    in routine clinical laboratories has been questioned by some researchers (191).
    From a clinical and infection control point of view, however, it is necessary
    to distinguish between the A. baumannii group and acinetobacters outside the A.
    baumannii group since the latter organisms rarely have infection control implications.
    In addition, these organisms are usually susceptible to a range of antimicrobials,
    and infections caused by these organisms are most often benign. From a research
    perspective, in contrast, clinical studies using proper methods for species identification
    of acinetobacters, including those within the A. baumannii group, are mandatory
    to increase our knowledge of the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and clinical impact
    of the various species of this diverse genus. Natural Habitats Members of the
    genus Acinetobacter are considered ubiquitous organisms. This holds true for the
    genus Acinetobacter, since acinetobacters can be recovered after enrichment culture
    from virtually all samples obtained from soil or surface water (20). These earlier
    findings have contributed to the common misconception that A. baumannii is also
    ubiquitous in nature (171). In fact, not all species of the genus Acinetobacter
    have their natural habitat in the environment. However, a systematic study to
    investigate the natural occurrence of the various Acinetobacter species in the
    environment has never been performed. Most Acinetobacter species that have been
    recovered from human clinical specimens have at least some significance as human
    pathogens (493, 502). Acinetobacters are part of the human skin flora. In an epidemiological
    survey performed to investigate the colonization of human skin and mucous membranes
    with Acinetobacter species, up to 43% of nonhospitalized individuals were found
    to be colonized with these organisms (495). The most frequently isolated species
    were A. lwoffii (58%), A. johnsonii (20%), A. junii (10%), and Acinetobacter genomic
    species 3 (6%). In a similar study, a carrier rate of 44% was found for healthy
    volunteers, with A. lwoffii (61%), Acinetobacter genomic species 15BJ (12%), A.
    radioresistens (8%), and Acinetobacter genomic species 3 (5%) being the most prevalent
    species (31). In patients hospitalized on a regular ward, the carriage rate of
    Acinetobacter species was even higher, at 75% (495). Dijkshoorn et al. studied
    fecal carriage of Acinetobacter and found a carrier rate of 25% among healthy
    individuals, with A. johnsonii and Acinetobacter genomic species 11 predominating
    (126). In contrast, A. baumannii, the most important nosocomial Acinetobacter
    species, was found only rarely on human skin (0.5% and 3% in references 31 and
    495, respectively) and in human feces (0.8%) (126), and Acinetobacter genomic
    species 13TU was not found at all (31, 126, 495). More recently, Griffith et al.
    investigated the nares of healthy U.S. soldiers and did not find acinetobacters
    at all, but they did not use enrichment culture to increase the recovery rate
    (211). In a subsequent study, Griffith et al. did not detect skin carriage of
    the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex among a representative sample of 102
    U.S. Army soldiers deployed in Iraq, but again, they performed cultures without
    enrichment and with an extremely long transport time that may have contributed
    to this finding (212). Notably, in tropical climates, the situation may be different.
    In Hong Kong, Chu et al. found 53% of medical students and new nurses to be colonized
    with acinetobacters in summer versus 32% in winter (91). Such a seasonal variability
    in skin colonization may contribute to the seasonal variation seen in the prevalence
    of A. baumannii in clinical samples (360). Acinetobacter genomic species 3 (36%),
    Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU (15%), Acinetobacter genomic species 15TU (6%),
    and A. baumannii (4%) were the most frequently recovered species, while A. lwoffii,
    A. johnsonii, and A. junii were only rarely found. Although various Acinetobacter
    species have been isolated from animals and A. baumannii was occasionally found
    as an etiologic agent in infected animals (173, 571), the normal flora of animals
    has never been studied systematically for the presence of acinetobacters. Of note,
    A. baumannii was recovered from 22% of body lice sampled from homeless people
    (311). It has been speculated that this finding might result from clinically silent
    bacteremia in these people; the clinical significance of this observation, however,
    is not yet clear. The inanimate environment has also been studied for the presence
    of acinetobacters. Berlau et al. investigated vegetables in the United Kingdom
    and found that 30 of 177 vegetables (17%) were culture positive for Acinetobacter
    (32). Interestingly, A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 11 (each at
    27%) were the predominant species, followed by A. calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter
    genomic species 3 (each at 13%), while Acinetobacter genomic species 13 was found
    only once. In Hong Kong, 51% of local vegetables were culture positive for Acinetobacter
    species, the majority of which were Acinetobacter genomic species 3 (75%), but
    one sample grew A. baumannii (245). Houang et al. found acinetobacters in 22 of
    60 soil samples in Hong Kong, and the most frequent species were Acinetobacter
    genomic species 3 (27%) and A. baumannii (23%), with only one sample yielding
    A. calcoaceticus (245). In an unpublished study from Germany, 92 of 163 samples
    (56%) from soil and surface water yielded acinetobacters, and A. calcoaceticus,
    A. johnsonii, A. haemolyticus, and Acinetobacter genomic species 11 were found
    most frequently. Only a single sample yielded A. baumannii, three samples were
    positive with Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Acinetobacter genomic species
    13TU was not found at all in soil and water (H. Seifert, personal communication).
    Some recently described Acinetobacter species, i.e., A. baylyi, A. bouvetii, A.
    grimontii, A. tjernbergiae, A. towneri, and A. tandoii, that were isolated from
    activated sludge are obviously environmental species and have, as yet, never been
    found in humans (72). In contrast, two other recently described species, A. schindleri
    and A. ursingii, have been recovered only from human specimens, while A. parvus
    was found in humans and was also cultured from a dog (138, 392, 393). In conclusion,
    although available data derive from only a few studies, some Acinetobacter species
    indeed seem to be distributed widely in nature, i.e., A. calcoaceticus is found
    in water and soil and on vegetables; Acinetobacter genomic species 3 is found
    in water and soil, on vegetables, and on human skin; A. johnsonii is found in
    water and soil, on human skin, and in human feces; A. lwoffii and A. radioresistens
    are found on human skin; and Acinetobacter genomic species 11 is found in water
    and soil, on vegetables, and in the human intestinal tract. At least in Europe,
    the carrier rate of A. baumannii in the community is rather low. Also, although
    it has been found in soil samples in Hong Kong and on vegetables in the United
    Kingdom, A. baumannii does not appear to be a typical environmental organism.
    Existing data are not sufficient to determine if the occurrence of severe community-acquired
    A. baumannii infections that have been observed in tropical climates (8, 325,
    591) may be associated with an environmental source. Acinetobacter genomic species
    13TU was found on human skin in Hong Kong but not in Europe. Also, it has not
    been identified in the inanimate environment. Thus, the natural habitats of both
    A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU still remain to be defined.
    MECHANISMS OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE The wide array of antimicrobial resistance
    mechanisms that have been described for A. baumannii is impressive and rivals
    those of other nonfermentative gram-negative pathogens (Table 2) (426, 443). The
    rapid global emergence of A. baumannii strains resistant to all β-lactams, including
    carbapenems, illustrates the potential of this organism to respond swiftly to
    changes in selective environmental pressure. Upregulation of innate resistance
    mechanisms and acquisition of foreign determinants are critical skills that have
    brought A. baumannii great respect. Despite the absence of data on the genetic
    competence of A. baumannii, other Acinetobacter spp., in particular A. baylyi,
    are highly competent and recombinogenic (16, 574). A recent study by Fournier
    et al. typifies the genetic agility and broad resistance armamentarium of A. baumannii
    (172). After performing whole-genome sequencing of a clinical epidemic A. baumannii
    strain found in France (AYE), an 86-kb resistance island, one of the largest to
    be described thus far, was identified (AbaR1). Of the 88 predicted open reading
    frames (ORFs) within this genomic region, 82 were predicted to have originated
    from other gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., and
    Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the G+C content of this region was 52.8%, compared
    to 38.8% for the remaining chromosome, indicating a likely foreign source. Overall,
    52 resistance genes were identified, and surprisingly, 45 (86.5%) were localized
    to the AbaR1 resistance island (172). The genetic surroundings of these resistance
    determinants provided more evidence for genetic promiscuity, with an array of
    broad-host-range mobile genetic elements identified, including three class 1 integrons,
    transposons, and insertion sequence (IS) elements. Interestingly, no plasmid markers
    were identified in this resistance hot spot, and of the three plasmids found within
    the AYE strain, none contained any known resistance marker (172). Compared to
    a susceptible A. baumannii strain from the same geographic region (SDF), a similar
    structure was identified (AbaG1) in the homologous ATPase-like ORF, but it was
    devoid of resistance determinants (172). To assess whether this hot spot is conserved
    among A. baumannii strains, a further 22 clinical strains were screened. Seventy-seven
    percent had an intact ATPase ORF yet also had a multidrug resistance phenotype
    (172), indicating that resistance determinants can be inserted into other areas
    of the genome. Similarly, the recently published genome sequence of A. baumannii
    ATCC 17978 demonstrated a wide array of resistance markers but only one within
    the homologous location to that described by Fournier et al. (514), again illustrating
    the genetic flexibility of this pathogen. β-Lactams Enzymatic mechanisms. The
    most prevalent mechanism of β-lactam resistance in A. baumannii is enzymatic degradation
    by β-lactamases. However, in keeping with the complex nature of this organism,
    multiple mechanisms often work in concert to produce the same phenotype (47, 165,
    446). Inherent to all A. baumannii strains are chromosomally encoded AmpC cephalosporinases
    (49, 249, 250, 427, 468), also known as Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases
    (ADCs) (249). Unlike that of AmpC enzymes found in other gram-negative organisms,
    inducible AmpC expression does not occur in A. baumannii (49, 233). The key determinant
    regulating overexpression of this enzyme in A. baumannii is the presence of an
    upstream IS element known as ISAba1 (described below) (106, 233, 468, 492). The
    presence of this element highly correlates with increased AmpC gene expression
    and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (106, 468). Cefepime and carbapenems
    appear to be stable in response to these enzymes (249). Extended-spectrum β-lactamases
    (ESBLs) from the Ambler class A group have also been described for A. baumannii,
    but assessment of their true prevalence is hindered by difficulties with laboratory
    detection, especially in the presence of an AmpC. More recent focus has been on
    VEB-1, which disseminated throughout hospitals in France (clonal dissemination)
    and was also recently reported from Belgium and Argentina (VEB-1a) (71, 381, 382,
    417, 442); PER-1, from France, Turkey, Belgium, Romania, Korea, and the United
    States (250, 381, 385, 439, 565, 611); and PER-2, from Argentina (417). Interestingly,
    blaVEB-1 was found to be integron borne (class 1) yet encoded on the chromosome
    (442). This integron was identical to that identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
    in Thailand (197) and was also associated with an upstream IS element (IS26),
    indicating the possible origin and mechanism of spread to A. baumannii (442).
    blaPER-1 is either plasmid or chromosomally encoded and also has an upstream IS
    element (ISPa12) that may enhance its expression (438). Other ESBLs identified
    in A. baumannii include TEM-92 and -116 (148, 387), from Italy and The Netherlands,
    respectively, and SHV-12 from China and The Netherlands (248, 387). Also, CTX-M-2
    and CTX-M-43 have been described from Japan and Bolivia, respectively (76, 386).
    Narrow-spectrum β-lactamases, such as TEM-1 and TEM-2, are also prevalent in A.
    baumannii (111, 250, 579), but their current clinical significance is limited
    given the potency of other resistance determinants. Of the β-lactamases, those
    with carbapenemase activity are most concerning and include the serine oxacillinases
    (Ambler class D OXA type) and the metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) (Ambler class B)
    (443, 447, 589). Thus far, the Ambler class A carbapenemases (KPC, GES, SME, NMC,
    and IMI) have not been described for A. baumannii (447). For a detailed review
    of carbapenemases in A. baumannii, readers are referred to an excellent review
    by Poirel and Nordmann (443), and for carbapenemases in general, see the work
    of Queenan and Bush (447). A summary of OXA-type enzymes in A. baumannii is shown
    in Fig. 1. The first identified OXA-type enzyme with carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity
    was from a clinical A. baumannii strain isolated in 1985 from Edinburgh, Scotland
    (418). This plasmid-encoded resistance determinant (initially named ARI-1) was
    found to be transferable, and the gene was later sequenced and named blaOXA-23
    (132, 482). This enzyme type now contributes to carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii
    globally (46, 99, 107, 110, 250, 264, 265, 298, 358, 384, 556, 566, 585, 619).
    OXA-27 and OXA-49 are closely related enzymes that make up the blaOXA-23 gene
    cluster in A. baumannii (3, 65) (Fig. 1). Two other acquired OXA-type gene clusters
    with carbapenemase activity have been described, including the blaOXA-24-like
    (encoding OXA-24, -25, -26, and -40) (3, 50, 70, 114, 230, 342, 344) and the blaOXA-58-like
    (36, 42, 98, 196, 421, 440, 441, 445, 550, 564, 617) carbapenemase genes. The
    crystal structure of OXA-24 was recently described and provides important insights
    for future drug development toward this emerging class of carbapenemases (477).
    blaOXA-58 was identified more recently and, similar to blaOXA-23, is often plasmid
    mediated (441), which may explain its widespread distribution (98, 358, 421).
    blaOXA-58 has also been identified in A. junii from Romania and Australia (358,
    423). The final gene cluster, blaOXA-51-like genes (encoding OXA-51, -64, -65,
    -66, -68, -69, -70, -71, -78, -79, -80, and -82), is unique in that it is naturally
    occurring in A. baumannii, hence its chromosomal location and prevalence (66,
    98, 231, 250, 559, 564, 606, 619). Similar to other class D enzymes, its product
    has a greater affinity for imipenem than for meropenem (66, 230). Its role in
    carbapenem resistance appears to be related to the presence of ISAba1 (558). In
    the absence of this element, cloning studies suggest a minimal effect on carbapenem
    susceptibility, even in the presence of an overexpressed multidrug efflux pump
    (AdeABC) (231). Given the multiplicity of β-lactam resistance mechanisms in A.
    baumannii (443), the contributions of the acquired carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases
    to carbapenem resistance are often difficult to determine. This issue has been
    addressed by Heritier et al., who studied the changes in susceptibility profiles
    of both natural and recombinant plasmids containing blaOXA-23, blaOXA-40 (only
    a recombinant plasmid, as no natural plasmid was identified), and blaOXA-58 in
    different host backgrounds (232). blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-40 appeared to produce
    higher MICs of imipenem than did blaOXA-58, and all blaOXA genes produced higher
    MICs of imipenem in the presence of an overexpressed AdeABC efflux pump. Inactivation
    of the blaOXA-40 gene led to susceptibility to carbapenems, and resistance was
    restored with complementation. Interestingly, the natural plasmids containing
    blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-58, extracted from clinical isolates, produced significantly
    greater levels of resistance to carbapenems than did their respective recombinant
    plasmids in similar host backgrounds (232). This discrepancy is most likely due
    to the presence of IS elements in the natural plasmids. The importance of IS elements
    for carbapenem resistance due to oxacillinases in A. baumannii has only recently
    been appreciated (107, 441, 558). These elements provide two main functions (www-is.biotoul.fr/is.html
    ). First, they encode a transposase and therefore are mobile. Second, they can
    contain promoter regions that lead to overexpression of downstream resistance
    determinants. Most commonly, these elements have been described in association
    with blaOXA-23 (107, 250, 384, 558, 566, 619) and blaOXA-58 (196, 440, 441, 444,
    550), but they may also promote carbapenem resistance in association with blaOXA-51
    (558) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, certain IS elements, especially ISAba1, appear
    relatively unique to A. baumannii (491). As described in this section, IS elements
    are also important for the expression of resistance to other antibiotics in A.
    baumannii (438, 442, 455, 468, 469). Despite MBLs being less commonly identified
    in A. baumannii than the OXA-type carbapenemases, their hydrolytic activities
    toward carbapenems are significantly more potent (100- to 1,000-fold) (443). These
    enzymes have the capability of hydrolyzing all β-lactams (including carbapenems)
    except the monobactam aztreonam, which may assist in laboratory detection. Of
    the five MBL groups described to date (589), only three have been identified in
    A. baumannii, including IMP (89, 104, 113, 179, 246, 265, 298, 316, 402, 471,
    506, 530, 544, 618), VIM (316, 335, 551, 606, 615), and SIM (320) types. Several
    geographic regions, such as Spain, Singapore, Greece, and Australia, have shown
    the presence of both OXA- and MBL-type enzymes in the same strains (70, 298, 423,
    551). Unlike the OXA-type enzymes, MBLs are most commonly found within integrons,
    which are specialized genetic structures that facilitate the acquisition and expression
    (via a common promoter) of resistance determinants. Most acquired MBL genes in
    A. baumannii have been found within class 1 integrons, often containing an array
    of resistance gene cassettes, especially those encoding aminoglycoside-modifying
    enzymes (246, 320, 458, 551, 618). Not surprisingly, A. baumannii strains carrying
    integrons have been found to be significantly more drug resistant than strains
    without integrons (216). The clinical significance of this unique genetic structure
    is that overuse of one antimicrobial may lead to overexpression of multiple resistance
    determinants as a consequence of a common promoter. In isolation, integrons are
    not mobile and therefore are embedded within plasmids or transposons that act
    as the genetic vehicles for resistance dissemination. For a detailed review of
    MBLs, readers are referred to the work of Walsh et al. (589). Nonenzymatic mechanisms.
    β-Lactam resistance, including carbapenem resistance, has also been ascribed to
    nonenzymatic mechanisms, including changes in outer membrane proteins (OMPs) (47,
    108, 119, 165, 209, 336, 380, 446, 510, 511), multidrug efflux pumps (232, 236,
    347), and alterations in the affinity or expression of penicillin-binding proteins
    (165, 188, 406, 510). Relative to other gram-negative pathogens, very little is
    known about the outer membrane porins of A. baumannii. Recently, the loss of a
    29-kDa protein, also known as CarO, was shown to be associated with imipenem and
    meropenem resistance (336, 380, 511). This protein belongs to a novel family of
    OMPs found only in members of the Moraxellaceae family of the class Gammaproteobacteria
    (380). No specific imipenem-binding site was found in CarO (511), indicating that
    this porin forms nonspecific channels. A second protein, known as Omp25, was identified
    in association with CarO, but it lacked pore-forming capabilities (511). The loss
    of the CarO porin in imipenem-resistant A. baumannii appears secondary to carO
    gene disruption by distinct insertion elements (380). Clinical outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant
    A. baumannii due to porin loss, including reduced expression of 47-, 44-, and
    37-kDa OMPs in A. baumannii strains endemic to New York City (446) and reduced
    expression of 22- and 33-kDa OMPs in association with OXA-24 in Spain (47), have
    been described. Other identified OMPs relevant to β-lactam resistance include
    the heat-modifiable protein HMP-AB (209), which is homologous to OmpA of Enterobacteriaceae
    and OmpF of P. aeruginosa (580); a 33- to 36-kDa protein (94, 119); a 43-kDa protein
    which shows significant homology to OprD from P. aeruginosa (141); and OmpW, which
    is homologous to OmpW proteins found in E. coli and P. aeruginosa (510, 580).
    Interestingly, when comparative proteomic studies were performed between a multidrug-resistant
    A. baumannii strain and a reference strain, no difference in expression was identified
    for Omp33/36 or OprD, but CarO expression and the structural isoforms of OmpW
    were different (510). Further studies are still required to elucidate the significance
    of these porins and their overall prevalence in multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.
    As represented by Fournier et al., the genome of a multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    strain encodes a wide array of multidrug efflux systems (172). The resistance-nodulation-division
    (RND) family-type pump AdeABC is the best studied thus far and has a substrate
    profile that includes β-lactams (including carbapenems) (232, 236), aminoglycosides,
    erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim,
    and ethidium bromide (232, 236, 347, 356, 397, 420, 469). Similar to other RND-type
    pumps, AdeABC has a three-component structure: AdeB forms the transmembrane component,
    AdeA forms the inner membrane fusion protein, and AdeC forms the OMP. AdeABC is
    chromosomally encoded and is normally regulated by a two-component system with
    a sensor kinase (AdeS) and its associated response regulator (AdeR) (356). Point
    mutations within this regulatory system have been associated with pump overexpression
    (356), but such mutations are not necessary (420, 469). Most recently, disruption
    of the adeS gene by the IS element ISAba1 was identified (469). Insertional inactivation
    of the transmembrane component of the pump, encoded by adeB, led to loss of pump
    function and multidrug resistance (347). However, this was not the case with inactivation
    of the gene encoding the OMP, adeC, suggesting that AdeAB may be able to recruit
    other OMPs to form a functional tripartite complex (356). Other RND-type pumps
    have been described for different Acinetobacter genomic species (82, 90). Aminoglycosides
    As mentioned above, the presence of genes coding for aminoglycoside-modifying
    enzymes within class 1 integrons is highly prevalent in multidrug-resistant A.
    baumannii strains (246, 320, 395, 458, 503, 551, 556, 618). All of the major enzyme
    classes have been described, including acetyltransferases, nucleotidyltransferases,
    and phosphotransferases (250, 395). More recently, 16S rRNA methylation has been
    described for A. baumannii (armA) strains from Japan, Korea, and the United States
    (129, 314, 608). This emerging resistance mechanism impairs aminoglycoside binding
    to its target site and confers high-level resistance to all clinically useful
    aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin (130). Interestingly,
    the genetic surroundings of armA appear very similar across gram-negative organisms,
    as it is plasmid borne and within a transposon (Tn1548) (129). Apart from the
    AdeABC efflux pump, which less effectively transports amikacin and kanamycin due
    to their more hydrophilic nature (347), aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin)
    are also substrates of the recently described AbeM pump, a member of the multidrug
    and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family (525). Quinolones Modifications to
    DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV through mutations in the gyrA and parC genes have
    been well described for A. baumannii (220, 236, 504, 581, 582). These mutations
    interfere with target site binding. Similar to aminoglycosides, many quinolones
    are also substrates for multidrug efflux pumps (456), including the RND-type pump
    AdeABC (236, 347) and the MATE pump AdeM (525). Thus far, plasmid-mediated quinolone
    resistance, mediated by qnr genes, has not been reported for A. baumannii. Tetracyclines
    and Glycylcyclines Resistance to tetracyclines and their derivatives can be mediated
    by efflux or ribosomal protection (169). Tetracycline-specific efflux pumps include
    those encoded by the tet(A) to tet(E) determinants, most often found within gram-negative
    organisms, and the tet(K) determinant found in Staphylococcus aureus. Thus far,
    the tet(A) and tet(B) determinants have been described for A. baumannii (217,
    455, 457). tet(A) was found within a transposon similar to Tn1721, in association
    with an IS element (455). tet(A) confers resistance to tetracycline but not minocycline,
    an agent with greater activity against A. baumannii. Ribosomal protection is mediated
    by the tet(M) and tet(O) determinants, with tet(M) being described rarely for
    A. baumannii (457). Interestingly, this tet(M) determinant was identical to that
    described for S. aureus (457). Apart from tetracycline-specific efflux pumps,
    this class of antimicrobials is also susceptible to efflux by the multidrug efflux
    systems, such as the AdeABC pump (347). Importantly, tigecycline, which is the
    first of a new class of modified tetracycline antimicrobials known as glycylcyclines,
    is also a substrate for this emerging efflux system (420, 469). By performing
    real-time PCR with the adeB gene in clinical and laboratory exposed isolates with
    increased MICs of tigecycline, increased adeB gene expression was identified (420).
    It was of concern that the rise in MIC of tigecycline occurred rapidly with in
    vitro passage, suggesting that the expression of this multidrug efflux pump can
    be upregulated swiftly in response to selective pressure. The role of the AdeABC
    efflux pump in reduced susceptibility to tigecycline was confirmed by insertional
    inactivation of the adeB gene, which led to a significant drop in the MIC of tigecycline
    (4 μg/ml to 0.5 μg/ml) (469). These data suggest that caution should be used in
    considering tigecycline treatment for A. baumannii infection in sites where drug
    levels may be suboptimal, such as the bloodstream (424). Polymyxins Despite recent
    reports demonstrating increasing in vitro resistance and heteroresistance to the
    polymyxins in A. baumannii (177, 334), the mechanism of resistance remains unknown.
    It has previously been shown that reduced binding to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
    target site can lead to resistance in E. coli, Salmonella spp., and P. aeruginosa
    (100, 431). Also, changes in OMPs causing reduced susceptibility to polymyxins
    have been described for P. aeruginosa (400, 614). Other Antibiotics The prevalence
    of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance in A. baumannii is high in many geographic
    regions (216, 575). As discussed above, integrons are very common among strains
    of A. baumannii that have a multidrug resistance phenotype. The 3′-conserved region
    of an integron most commonly contains a qac gene fused to a sul gene, conferring
    resistance to antiseptics and sulfonamides, respectively (589). Consequently,
    sulfonamide resistance has been shown to be highly predictive of integron-carrying
    strains of A. baumannii (83, 216). Similarly, genes coding for trimethoprim (dhfr)
    and chloramphenicol (cat) resistance have also been reported within integron structures
    in A. baumannii (216, 246, 320, 551). Efflux may also contribute to resistance
    against these agents (525). ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING FOR THE CLINICAL
    MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY Breakpoints for Various Antibiotics and A. baumannii It
    is noteworthy that the major organizations that determine breakpoints (CLSI and
    the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [EUCAST]) have
    different breakpoints for many of the key antibiotics used in the therapy of A.
    baumannii infections (for example, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides)
    (Table 3). At the time of this writing, no EUCAST breakpoints exist for penicillins,
    cephalosporins, polymyxins, tetracyclines, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus
    A. baumannii. Breakpoints for tigecycline versus A. baumannii are not available
    via EUCAST, CLSI, or the FDA. Issues for Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of
    A. baumannii CLSI recommends that MICs for antibiotics versus Acinetobacter spp.
    be determined in broth, using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth, or on agar,
    using Mueller-Hinton agar (97). Disk diffusion should also be performed using
    Mueller-Hinton agar (97). Swenson and colleagues assessed these CLSI-recommended
    methods and identified several problems in testing β-lactam antibiotics (529).
    First, very small colonies or a star-like growth was frequently observed in wells
    containing high concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics. This apparent growth beyond
    a more obvious end point makes determining an MIC by broth microdilution methods
    quite difficult. Second, there were many discrepancies between results obtained
    by broth microdilution and those obtained by disk diffusion. Very major errors
    (susceptible according to disk diffusion but resistant according to broth microdilution)
    occurred with ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate,
    ceftazidime, and cefepime. In the absence of human or animal model data, it is
    impossible to determine which testing method is more clinically relevant. Finally,
    interlaboratory variations in susceptibility testing results were frequent, especially
    for cefepime (529). In contrast to the findings with these β-lactams, there was
    little MIC and zone diameter discrepancy for carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones,
    and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (529). The specific issue of in vitro testing
    of β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations has been assessed by Higgins et
    al. (235). CLSI guidelines for testing piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanic
    acid require fixed concentrations of 4 μg/ml (tazobactam) and 2 μg/ml (clavulanic
    acid) (97). In contrast, CLSI guidelines for testing ampicillin-sulbactam require
    a ratio of ampicillin to sulbactam of 2:1 (97). Higgins et al. showed that the
    in vitro results for β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations against A. baumannii
    are determined mainly by the activity of the inhibitors alone and therefore influenced
    by whether a fixed ratio of β-lactam to inhibitor or a fixed concentration of
    inhibitor is used (235). Therefore, it is doubtful that current testing of piperacillin-tazobactam
    or ticarcillin-clavulanic acid achieves clinically meaningful results, and we
    recommend that these drugs not be tested for susceptibility versus A. baumannii.
    The situation with disk diffusion testing is also problematic. Owing to the methodologic
    problems described above, we discourage the use of disk diffusion testing for
    all of the β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations versus A. baumannii. Semiautomated
    methods, such as those for the Vitek 2, Microscan, and BD Phoenix systems, are
    commonly used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by clinical microbiology
    laboratories. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the performance
    of these methods against A. baumannii. Studies from the 1990s with an early Vitek
    system showed that numerous isolates were reported as resistant to imipenem by
    Vitek but typically were susceptible to imipenem when tested by broth and agar
    dilution (552). In view of this report and a subsequent evaluation showing that
    carbapenem testing difficulties existed for Vitek 2 in examining the susceptibility
    of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa (523), some authors advocate confirmation
    of Vitek-determined carbapenem resistance (195). An “all-in-one plate” for this
    purpose has been described, in which susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem
    is confirmed by disk diffusion and the MIC of colistin is determined on the same
    plate by Etest (195). In general, however, the Vitek 2 system does appear to be
    reliable, in comparison to reference broth microdilution methods, for assessing
    susceptibility of A. baumannii to imipenem and other commonly used antibiotics
    (279). In evaluations of small numbers of A. baumannii group strains, the BD Phoenix
    automated microbiology system did not give very major errors in susceptibility
    testing compared to reference methods (133, 149, 176, 362, 521). Susceptibility
    testing of the polymyxins and tigecycline against A. baumannii warrants specific
    mention because these antibiotics are often utilized for serious infections with
    multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. As mentioned above, the FDA, CLSI, and EUCAST
    have established no breakpoints for interpretation of antibiotic susceptibility
    testing of tigecycline versus A. baumannii. This has resulted in immense confusion
    as to appropriate methods for performing and interpreting antibiotic susceptibility
    testing for this drug-organism combination. In the product information for tigecycline
    (http://www.wyeth.com/content/showlabeling.asp?id=474 [accessed 2 August 2007]),
    it is recommended in general for tigecycline susceptibility testing that disk
    diffusion testing (with paper disks impregnated with 15 μg/ml tigecycline) or
    broth, agar, or broth microdilution methods be used. MICs must be determined with
    testing medium that is fresh (that is, <12 h old) (54, 243, 429). When tested
    in freshly prepared media (<12 h old), tigecycline was 2 to 3 dilutions more active
    than when it was tested in “aged” media. Media stored under anaerobic conditions
    or supplemented with the biocatalytic oxygen-reducing reagent Oxyrase resulted
    in MICs similar to those obtained with fresh medium (54, 429). Tigecycline is
    stable in MIC trays that are prepared with fresh broth and then frozen. Therefore,
    the laboratory can thaw the preprepared MIC plates on the day of use and retain
    accuracy in MIC measurements (54). Questions have arisen regarding the reliability
    of disk diffusion or Etest determination of tigecycline susceptibility testing
    versus A. baumannii (278, 538). In one study, Etest MICs were typically fourfold
    higher than those determined by broth microdilution (538). However, others have
    found good correlation between tigecycline MIC determinations by Etest versus
    reference broth microdilution methods, although the numbers of Acinetobacter isolates
    in these studies were small (44, 242). The utility of the Vitek 2, Microscan,
    or BD Phoenix system for susceptibility testing of A. baumannii versus tigecycline
    has not yet been reported. With regard to disk diffusion testing, Jones and colleagues
    extrapolated FDA breakpoints for tigecycline versus Enterobacteriaceae to 103
    Acinetobacter strains and found that approximately 20% of strains would appear
    “falsely intermediate” by disk diffusion testing in comparison to broth microdilution
    testing (278). Suggestions have been made to utilize an inhibition zone diameter
    of ≥16 mm (278) or ≥13 mm (538) as an indicator of A. baumannii susceptibility
    to tigecycline. We urge caution in applying tigecycline breakpoints defined for
    the Enterobacteriaceae to A. baumannii for several reasons. Breakpoints are established
    with knowledge of the wild-type susceptibility of the organism to the antibiotic,
    the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antibiotic, and clinical data
    with respect to serious infections with the organism treated with the antibiotic
    (554). Clearly, wild-type susceptibilities and clinical responses may be organism
    specific. This has led to the situation, for example, whereby the FDA breakpoint
    for susceptibility of enterococci to tigecycline is ≤0.25 μg/ml while that for
    Enterobacteriaceae is ≤2 μg/ml (http://www.wyeth.com/content/showlabeling.asp?id=474
    [accessed 2 August 2007]). There are no data available to make such distinctions
    for tigecycline and A. baumannii. EUCAST notes that “there is insufficient evidence
    that the species in question is a good target for therapy with the drug” (http://www.srga.org/eucastwt/MICTAB/MICtigecycline.htm
    [accessed 2 August 2007]). Furthermore, there is a difference in tigecycline breakpoints
    for Enterobacteriaceae between different breakpoint setting organizations (FDA
    versus EUCAST), and no breakpoints have been set by CLSI. Finally, the mean maximum
    blood concentration of tigecycline is 0.63 μg/ml after administration of a 100-mg
    intravenous loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 h, so it would seem prudent
    not to report bloodstream isolates of A. baumannii with tigecycline MICs of >0.5
    μg/ml as susceptible (424). Indeed, it is for this reason that we suggest that
    an MIC-based method of antibiotic susceptibility testing (rather than disk diffusion
    testing) be performed for tigecycline for bloodstream isolates of A. baumannii.
    The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) has established tentative
    tigecycline breakpoints for Acinetobacter spp., as follows: MICs of ≤1 μg/ml,
    susceptible; MIC of 2 μg/ml, intermediate; and MICs of >2 μg/ml, resistant (www.bsac.org.uk/_db/_documents/version_6.1.pdf
    [accessed 2 August 2007]). Pending further information, we recommend using these
    breakpoints for infection sites other than blood. Unlike EUCAST and BSAC, the
    CLSI has established breakpoints for colistin and polymyxin B versus A. baumannii
    (97). These are as follows: MICs of ≤2 μg/ml, susceptible; and MICs of ≥4 μg/ml,
    resistant. Testing of A. baumannii susceptibility to colistin or polymyxin B should
    be performed by a method enabling determination of the MIC, such as broth dilution
    (178, 276). Using agar dilution, MICs of colistin may be 1 dilution higher than
    those of polymyxin B for some organisms (238). We recommend that institutions
    test the susceptibility of the polymyxin that is used in clinical practice at
    their institution. It is important that although colistin methanesulfonate (CMS;
    also known as colistimethate) is used in intravenous formulations of “colistin,”
    the human formulation should not be used for susceptibility testing (332). This
    is for several reasons. First, CMS is an inactive prodrug of colistin (27). Second,
    in determining MICs in broth during overnight incubation at 35°C, hydrolysis of
    CMS to colistin occurs via a series of partly methanesulfonated intermediates;
    the killing characteristics of this mixture change over time during incubation,
    leading to potentially unpredictable results (332). Thus, dilution-based testing
    should always be done with colistin sulfate (obtained, for example, from chemical
    supply companies such as Sigma-Aldrich), not with the intravenous “colistin” formulation
    obtained from a hospital pharmacy. A number of studies have assessed the performance
    of Etest for determination of colistin susceptibility (13, 346, 536). Although
    agreement between MICs within one twofold dilution obtained by Etest and broth
    microdilution is rather low, categorical concordance is 87% to ≥95% (13, 346,
    536). In one evaluation, there was 100% categoric agreement between agar dilution
    and Vitek 2 testing for colistin susceptibility, but no colistin-resistant isolates
    were tested (534). Inherent properties of the polymyxins make disk diffusion testing
    difficult, and we do not recommend it as a means of assessing susceptibility of
    A. baumannii to colistin (346, 533). The polymyxins are large polypeptides and
    diffuse poorly in agar, resulting in small zones of inhibition. Subsequently,
    this results in poor categorical differentiation of susceptible and resistant
    isolates. Use of higher concentrations of the polymyxin in the disks does not
    appear to improve the accuracy of test results (533). Clinical Laboratory Detection
    of Carbapenemases As described above, a variety of β-lactamases produced by A.
    baumannii are capable of hydrolyzing carbapenems. These “carbapenemases” were
    recently reviewed in detail in this journal by Queenan and Bush (447). Acinetobacter
    isolates that express these enzymes but which have carbapenem MICs in the susceptible
    range have been described, but these appear to be uncommon (174). Phenotypic tests
    for evaluating the presence of serine carbapenemases (OXA type) in A. baumannii
    have not yet been described. The most frequently used methods for detecting MBLs
    have been disk approximation methods comprising imipenem and imipenem plus EDTA
    (174, 290, 318). Others have used 2-mercaptopropionic acid for this purpose (12).
    An Etest MBL strip has been developed and, in published reports, has been shown
    to be reliable for detecting IMP- and VIM-type MBLs in A. baumannii (319, 589).
    Apparently, false-positive results were seen for isolates producing OXA-23 but
    lacking genes encoding IMP and VIM (490). These investigators did not seek other
    MBLs, however. It is also noteworthy that since the lowest concentrations of imipenem
    with and without EDTA on the Etest MBL strip are 1 and 4 μg/ml, respectively,
    the strip cannot be used in the evaluation of an isolate with an imipenem MIC
    of <4 μg/ml (609). Role of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory in Providing Surveillance
    for Multidrug-Resistant A. baumannii Surveillance for patients colonized with
    multidrug- or pandrug-resistant A. baumannii may be considered for infection control
    purposes. There are few data at present on which to base recommendations. Culture
    of samples from the nostrils, pharynx, skin, and rectum of patients with recent
    clinical cultures of A. baumannii was thought to have poor sensitivity (<25% for
    any one site) when samples were plated onto MacConkey agar plates containing 8
    μg/ml ceftazidime and 2 μg/ml amphotericin (355). Further studies are required
    to define the most effective methods for screening A. baumannii carriage in hospitalized
    patients and to determine the impact of such screening on infection rates and
    containment of this problematic organism. DEFINITIONS OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT ACINETOBACTER
    BAUMANNII Unfortunately, problems exist in evaluating previously published literature
    on the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. Most surveillance studies
    indicate the percentages of isolates susceptible (or resistant) to a variety of
    antibiotics. However, few assess the percentage resistant to multiple antibiotics.
    Furthermore, when such assessments have occurred, a variety of definitions of
    multidrug resistance in A. baumannii have been utilized. This has clearly hindered
    comparison of the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in different
    regions of the world, and we encourage the development of guidelines to unify
    the approach to these definitions. For the purposes of this review, the following
    definitions are used. Multidrug resistance is resistance to more than two of the
    following five drug classes: antipseudomonal cephalosporins (ceftazidime or cefepime),
    antipseudomonal carbapenems (imipenem or meropenem), ampicillin-sulbactam, fluoroquinolones
    (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin), and aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin,
    or amikacin). It needs to be acknowledged that susceptibility testing of β-lactam-β-lactamase
    inhibitor combinations is highly problematic and that laboratories may not test
    piperacillin-tazobactam or ticarcillin-clavulanate versus A. baumannii. Despite
    “pan-” meaning “all,” pandrug resistance is often defined as resistance to all
    antimicrobials that undergo first-line susceptibility testing that have therapeutic
    potential against A. baumannii. This would include all β-lactams (including carbapenems
    and sulbactam [MICs of >4 μg/ml]), fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. However,
    with the increased use of the polymyxins and possibly tigecycline, this definition
    will likely have to encompass these other agents. GLOBAL EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ACINETOBACTER
    BAUMANNII Europe A. baumannii infections have been a substantial clinical issue
    in many parts of Europe (Fig. 2) (575). Since the early 1980s, hospital outbreaks
    of A. baumannii infections in Europe, mainly in England, France, Germany, Italy,
    Spain, and The Netherlands (28, 171, 584), have been investigated using molecular
    epidemiological typing methods. In the majority of cases, one or two epidemic
    strains were detected in a given epidemiological setting. Transmission of such
    strains has been observed between hospitals, most probably via transfer of colonized
    patients (112, 557, 569). Spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is not confined
    to hospitals within a city but also occurs on a national scale. Examples are the
    spread of the so-called Southeast clone and the Oxa-23 clones 1 and 2 in Southeast
    England (99, 557), the dissemination of a multidrug-resistant A. baumannii clone
    in Portugal (112), the interhospital spread of a VEB-1 ESBL-producing A. baumannii
    clone from a total of 55 medical centers in northern and southeastern France (382),
    and the spread of an amikacin-resistant A. baumannii clone observed in nine hospitals
    in various regions in Spain (583). International transfer of colonized patients
    has led to the introduction and subsequent epidemic spread of multidrug-resistant
    A. baumannii strains from Southern into Northern European countries, such as Belgium
    and Germany (42, 488). Intercontinental spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    has also been described between Europe and other countries as a consequence of
    airline travel (383, 421). These events highlight the importance of appropriate
    screening and possible isolation of patients transferred from countries with high
    rates of drug-resistant organisms. In addition to these interinstitutional outbreaks,
    three international A. baumannii clones (the so-called European clones I, II,
    and III) have been reported from hospitals in Northern Europe (including hospitals
    in Belgium, Denmark, the Czech Republic, France, Spain, The Netherlands, and the
    United Kingdom) as well as from hospitals in southern European countries, such
    as Italy, Spain, Greece, and Turkey (123, 394, 570), and in Eastern Europe (606).
    Initially detected by AFLP clustering at a similarity level of >80%, the epidemiological
    relationship of these clones was confirmed by ribotyping (394, 570), pulsed-field
    gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (570), and most recently, multilocus sequence typing
    (MLST) (18). In contrast to the aforementioned multisite outbreaks, no epidemiological
    link in time or space could be established between the outbreaks of the European
    clones in different medical centers, and the actual contributions of these three
    widespread clones to the overall burden of epidemic A. baumannii strains remain
    to be determined. Carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii is now an issue in many
    European countries. Information on the prevalence of carbapenem resistance in
    various European countries is difficult to obtain, but it appears from the outbreak
    literature that carbapenem resistance rates are highest in Turkey, Greece, Italy,
    Spain, and England and are still rather low in Germany and The Netherlands. Carbapenem
    resistance in Eastern Europe appears to be increasing (128, 606). Rates appear
    to be lowest in Scandinavia, although sporadic isolates have been reported from
    patients transferred from elsewhere, including victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami
    (284). In an industry-supported surveillance report (MYSTIC) from 48 European
    hospitals for the period 2002-2004, just 73.1% of isolates were susceptible to
    meropenem and 69.8% were susceptible to imipenem (560). Susceptibility to other
    antibiotics was also very low, with 32.4%, 34.0%, and 47.6% being susceptible
    to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, respectively (560). A. baumannii
    isolates resistant to the polymyxins have been detected in Europe, although at
    present these remain rare (26, 74, 140, 177, 182, 229, 568). For a detailed review
    of phenotypic resistance in Acinetobacter spp. throughout Europe, readers are
    referred to an excellent review by Van Looveren and Goossens (575). North America
    There is a long history of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infections occurring
    in the United States. In 1991 and 1992, outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii
    were observed in a hospital in New York City (200). This followed an outbreak
    of infections due to ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae during which use of
    imipenem increased substantially (365, 450). The organisms in this outbreak were
    multidrug resistant, retaining susceptibility only to polymyxins and ampicillin-sulbactam
    (200). Numerous other hospitals in New York City also had clonal outbreaks of
    multidrug- or pandrug-resistant A. baumannii (143, 200, 277, 308, 309, 348, 351,
    446), and similar outbreaks have frequently been reported from many other regions
    of the United States (277, 342, 359, 522, 549, 604). National surveillance studies
    have demonstrated significant trends in the emergence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter
    strains (187). For example, data from the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance
    system collected from 1986 to 2003, involving many hospitals throughout the United
    States, showed significant increases in Acinetobacter strains resistant to amikacin
    (5% to 20%; P < 0.001), ceftazidime (25% to 68%; P < 0.001), and imipenem (0%
    to 20%; P < 0.001) (187). In a more recent industry-supported surveillance study
    including isolates of Acinetobacter spp. collected between 2004 and 2005 from
    76 centers throughout the United States, only 60.2% were susceptible to imipenem
    (218). A further industry-supported surveillance study including isolates of Acinetobacter
    spp. from 15 centers throughout the United States reported improved carbapenem
    and aminoglycoside susceptibilities in 2005 compared with those in 2004 (454).
    However, rates of nonsusceptibility were still substantial, as follows: 10% to
    15% for carbapenems, 35% to 40% for ceftazidime/cefepime, 10% to 30% for aminoglycosides,
    and 35% to 40% for ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin (454). The MIC50 and MIC90 of tigecycline
    for A. baumannii isolates collected from the United States between 2004 and 2005
    were 0.5 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml, respectively, with an MIC range of 0.03 μg/ml to 8
    μg/ml (588). The MIC90 for multidrug-resistant strains collected in the same time
    period was 2 μg/ml (237), which is more consistent with that reported from individual
    centers. Global surveillance data for susceptibility to polymyxin B have reported
    an MIC50 of ≤1 μg/ml and an MIC90 of 2 μg/ml against 2,621 Acinetobacter sp. isolates
    from four major geographic regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and North
    America) (177). The rate of polymyxin B-nonsusceptible Acinetobacter spp. in North
    America was reported to be 1.7% (177). This compares with 1.9%, 2.7%, and 1.7%
    in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and Latin America, respectively (177). Overall,
    2.8% and 3.2% of carbapenem-resistant and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp.,
    respectively, were resistant to polymyxin B (177). It is clear that more attention
    is being paid to A. baumannii infections in the United States now than at any
    time in the past. This may reflect increased recognition of pandrug-resistant
    strains. There are some data to suggest that the proportion of intensive care
    unit (ICU)-acquired pneumonia cases being found to be due to A. baumannii is actually
    increasing. In a review from the CDC, 7% of ICU-acquired pneumonias were due to
    Acinetobacter in 2003, compared to 4% in 1986 (P < 0.001) (187). The proportion
    of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and skin/soft tissue infections due to Acinetobacter
    also significantly increased during this period (187). There is some evidence
    that nosocomial Acinetobacter infections have some seasonal variation in the United
    States, with an unexplained upswing in late summer months (360). An important
    contribution to the epidemiology of infections with A. baumannii in the United
    States is the return of military personnel who have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan
    (75, 115, 376, 489, 555). An increase in infections with A. baumannii was first
    observed in U.S. military personnel in March 2003, soon after combat operations
    commenced in Iraq. Most injured military personnel were first treated at field
    hospitals before being evacuated to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (Germany)
    or the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (United States) (489). Most of these infections
    were detected at or soon after admission to these institutions. In a careful outbreak
    investigation, it was determined that neither preinjury skin colonization nor
    introduction of the organism from soil at the time of traumatic injury was the
    source of infection (376, 489). Rather, multiple A. baumannii isolates were cultured
    from a range of inanimate surfaces in field hospitals and were genotypically linked
    to patient isolates (489). Typically, these isolates were multidrug resistant,
    being resistant to fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and piperacillin-tazobactam.
    Just 10% were nonsusceptible to carbapenems (489). However, in a paper by Hawley
    et al., the rate of non-imipenem-susceptible A. baumannii was 37% for injured
    deployed military personnel (224). Such rates are more consistent with those seen
    in Europe than in the United States. The MIC90 of tigecycline for these strains
    was 8 μg/ml (224). Hujer and colleagues found that carbapenem-resistant isolates
    from patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center typically produced OXA-23 or
    OXA-58 carbapenemase (250). Interestingly, in a study comparing the clonal relatedness
    of A. baumannii strains from injured military personnel from the United States
    with that of strains from the United Kingdom, the main outbreak strains were indistinguishable
    (555). This provides further support that A. baumannii acquisition is occurring
    in the field hospitals. A comparable situation with Canadian soldiers injured
    in Afghanistan and British soldiers injured in Iraq has recently been reported
    (274, 540, 555). Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in Canadian civilian
    hospitals appear to be less common than those in comparable institutions in the
    United States but have certainly still been reported (509). Latin America Rates
    of nonsusceptibility to meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam,
    ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin in Latin America appear to be among the highest
    in the world (560). For example, just 71% of isolates were susceptible to meropenem
    or imipenem in an assessment from a surveillance program in the period 2002-2004
    (560). In a surveillance study involving Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia
    from 1997 to 2001, resistance rates were highest in Argentina, but no countries
    were spared multidrug-resistant isolates (543). As described previously, a variety
    of carbapenemases have been identified in A. baumannii isolates in Latin America,
    including IMP-1 and IMP-6 in Brazil (179, 471, 544), OXA-23 in Brazil and Colombia
    (110, 585), and OXA-58 in Argentina (98). Interestingly, the SPM- and VIM-type
    MBLs, which are widespread in Brazil (SPM) and other parts of Latin America (VIM)
    in P. aeruginosa strains, have not yet been reported for A. baumannii strains
    in these regions, to our knowledge. Africa Data on the extent of antibiotic resistance
    in A. baumannii in Africa are largely limited to South Africa at the present time,
    although there are scattered reports from other countries (255, 391, 475). Brink
    and colleagues have shown that about 30% of A. baumannii bloodstream isolates
    in South Africa are carbapenem resistant, >40% are resistant to cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam,
    and >30% are resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (59). Such resistant
    strains are endemic in some units (for example, burns and ICUs) and have been
    spread from institution to institution (354). Asia and the Middle East Numerous
    outbreaks of pandrug-resistant A. baumannii have been documented in Asian and
    Middle Eastern hospitals (Fig. 2), and a variety of carbapenemases have been described
    to originate there (2, 3, 78, 186, 264, 265, 293, 298, 317, 320, 419, 610). Rates
    of nonsusceptibility in SENTRY isolates (2001-2004) exceeded 25% for imipenem
    and meropenem, 40% for cefepime and ceftazidime, 40% for ampicillin-sulbactam,
    35% for amikacin, and 45% for ciprofloxacin (177). Unfortunately, resistance to
    tigecycline (389) and polymyxin B (177, 293) already exists in this region. Australia
    and Pacific Islands Initial reports of A. baumannii from Australia came from the
    Northern Territory, where community-acquired infections are well described (8,
    9). Such infections have a vastly different epidemiology from that seen in hospital-acquired
    infections, with male gender, age of >45 years, Aboriginal ethnic background,
    cigarette smoking, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive airway
    disease being important risk factors (9). Also, these community-acquired strains
    are significantly more susceptible to antimicrobials (9). Throat carriage and
    microaspiration may be involved in the pathogenesis of these infections (8). The
    first described Australian outbreak of hospital-acquired A. baumannii was in Western
    Australia (460). These isolates were resistant to gentamicin, cephalosporins,
    and ticarcillin, with some isolates also being resistant to ciprofloxacin. Molecular
    epidemiological analysis identified that 11% of staff hand samples were positive
    for the same strain of A. baumannii as that causing patient infection (460). More
    recently, outbreaks of A. baumannii have affected other major cities along the
    eastern seaboard of Australia, including Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne (422,
    437, 566). Unfortunately, these outbreaks have involved carbapenem-resistant strains
    of A. baumannii, with OXA-23 contributing to this phenotype (566). As seen in
    other countries, strains within institutions are often clonally related (422).
    Also, interhospital spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains has likely
    occurred in certain cities (435). Outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii
    have also occurred in French Polynesia (384). Most recently, reduced susceptibility
    to tigecycline of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains has been described
    in Australia (254). CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII INFECTIONS
    In the vast majority of publications on the clinical manifestations of Acinetobacter
    infections, the methods used for species identification were not appropriate according
    to current standards (see above). However, with an acceptable level of uncertainty,
    we can assume that what has been published on nosocomial Acinetobacter infection
    in general, or on A. baumannii infection in particular, is indeed applicable to
    A. baumannii. Case reports or small series on clinical manifestations of infections
    caused by Acinetobacter infections outside the A. baumannii group should be interpreted
    with caution if (semi)-automated methods for species identification were employed.
    Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia In most institutions, the majority of A. baumannii
    isolates are from the respiratory tracts of hospitalized patients. In many circumstances,
    it is very difficult to distinguish upper airway colonization from true pneumonia.
    There is no doubt, however, that true ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due
    to A. baumannii occurs. In large surveillance studies from the United States,
    between 5 and 10% of cases of ICU-acquired pneumonia were due to A. baumannii
    (187). However, it is highly likely that in certain institutions, the proportion
    of ICU-acquired pneumonia due to A. baumannii is much higher. Typically, patients
    with A. baumannii infections have had prolonged ICU stays (184), although in outbreak
    situations, earlier acquisition of infection may occur. Community-Acquired Pneumonia
    Community-acquired pneumonia due to A. baumannii has been described for tropical
    regions of Australia and Asia (8, 9, 39, 205, 325). The disease most typically
    occurs during the rainy season among people with a history of alcohol abuse and
    may sometimes require admission to an ICU (8). It is characterized by a fulminant
    clinical course, secondary bloodstream infection, and mortality rate of 40 to
    60% (325). The source of infection may be throat carriage, which occurs in up
    to 10% of community residents with excessive alcohol consumption (8). Bloodstream
    Infection In a large study of nosocomial bloodstream infection in the United States
    (1995-2002), A. baumannii was the 10th most common etiologic agent, being responsible
    for 1.3% of all monomicrobial nosocomial bloodstream infections (0.6 bloodstream
    infection per 10,000 admissions) (597). A. baumannii was a more common cause of
    ICU-acquired bloodstream infection than of non-ICU-ward infection (1.6% versus
    0.9% of bloodstream infections, respectively, in those locations). Crude mortality
    overall from A. baumannii bloodstream infection was 34.0% to 43.4% in the ICU
    and 16.3% outside the ICU. A. baumannii bloodstream infection had the third highest
    crude mortality rate in the ICU, exceeded only by P. aeruginosa and Candida sp.
    infections. A. baumannii infections were the latest of all bloodstream infections
    to occur during hospitalization, occurring a mean of 26 days from the time of
    hospital admission (597). It is therefore not certain if the high crude mortality
    rate represents its occurrence in patients with ongoing underlying critical illness
    or whether the organism does have significant attributable mortality (see below).
    Sources of bloodstream infection were not described in the study mentioned above
    but are typically line related or attributed to underlying pneumonia, UTI, or
    wound infection (501). It is notable that 102 patients had bloodstream infections
    at sites treating U.S. military members injured in Iraq or Afghanistan from 1
    January 2002 and 31 August 2004 (75). The sites of origin of these infections
    were not described in this report. Traumatic Battlefield and Other Wounds A. baumannii
    may occasionally cause skin/soft tissue infections outside of the military population.
    The organism caused 2.1% of ICU-acquired skin/soft tissue infections in one assessment
    (187). It is a well-known pathogen in burn units and may be difficult to eradicate
    from such patients (549). However, its contribution to poor outcome in burn patients
    is debated (5, 600). A. baumannii is commonly isolated from wounds of combat casualties
    from Iraq or Afghanistan (270, 376, 428, 489, 595, 616). It was the most commonly
    isolated organism (32.5% of cases) in one assessment of combat victims with open
    tibial fractures (270). However, it appears to be of low pathogenicity at this
    site—after initial treatment, the organism was never isolated from follow-up cultures
    in any of the patients with open tibial fractures and did not appear to contribute
    directly to persistent nonunion or need for amputation (270). UTI A. baumannii
    is an occasional cause of UTI, being responsible for just 1.6% of ICU-acquired
    UTIs in one study (187). Typically, the organism is associated with catheter-associated
    infection or colonization. It is not usual for this organism to cause uncomplicated
    UTI in healthy outpatients. Meningitis Nosocomial, postneurosurgical A. baumannii
    meningitis is an increasingly important entity. The microbial epidemiology of
    nosocomial meningitis is evolving to include more gram-negative pathogens (58,
    142, 414, 507), so it is not surprising that multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    is among the pathogens implicated (364, 399, 404, 408). Typical patients have
    undergone neurosurgery and have an external ventricular drain (363). Mortality
    may be as high as 70%, although the cause of mortality is often difficult to discern
    (363). Other Manifestations A small number of case reports of Acinetobacter endocarditis
    exist (361, 407, 461, 520, 567). Most, but not all, cases have involved prosthetic
    valves. Acinetobacter spp. may cause endophthalmitis or keratitis, sometimes related
    to contact lens use or following eye surgery (105, 287, 329, 338). A single case
    report exists of a Shiga toxin-producing A. haemolyticus strain, which was associated
    with bloody diarrhea in a 3-month-old infant (213). Note that precise species
    identification remains an issue in these reports. CLINICAL IMPACT OF ACINETOBACTER
    BAUMANNII INFECTION Given the predilection of A. baumannii to colonize and infect
    critically ill patients, who often have a poor prognosis irrespective of secondary
    infective complications, it has been challenging to determine the true clinical
    impact of this pathogen, and much debate still exists in the literature (154,
    160, 528). Unfortunately, significant methodological heterogeneity exists between
    studies (Table 4); thus, it has been difficult to formulate conclusions. Most
    studies utilize a matched cohort or case control study design, but the definitions
    used for a case and the comparative control group are clearly diverse among studies.
    For example, the definitions of a case include patients with A. baumannii infection
    only (5, 183, 528), infection and colonization (1, 341, 345, 437), infection of
    one site (40, 183, 215, 306, 600), or infection of multiple sites (1, 5, 528).
    Patients with polymicrobial infections were also allowed in some studies (40,
    600). However, it is the extreme diversity in controls that really distinguishes
    one study from another, as controls included patients with no A. baumannii infection
    or colonization but infection with other organisms allowed (183), no A. baumannii
    infection only but colonization allowed (600), no infection with drug-resistant
    A. baumannii but infection with susceptible isolates allowed (1, 437), or no specific
    infection type, such as bacteremia, with any organism allowed (40). Also, the
    rigor of matching for severity of illness and comorbid conditions varies, and
    thus important confounding factors cloud some of the literature, and the quality
    of species identification in many studies is suboptimal, which may also affect
    outcomes. At this point, despite the influx of such studies over recent times,
    we still feel that the issue of attributable mortality remains unsettled. For
    example, in a recent study performed by the CDC, which involved thorough adjustment
    of important confounding variables and used clear definitions for comparison groups,
    there was no significant increase in mortality between those infected with multidrug-resistant
    A. baumannii and those with no infection (odds ratio [OR], 6.6; 95% confidence
    interval [95% CI], 0.4 to 108.3) (528). However, hospital and ICU lengths of stay
    were significantly longer in the former group. A comparison between all those
    with infection, regardless of susceptibility profile, and those without infection
    was not performed. These results are supported by several studies (5, 40, 183,
    341) yet contrast with many others (1, 181, 215, 306, 345), including those that
    primarily assessed the clinical impact of multidrug or carbapenem resistance on
    patient outcomes (306, 437). Interestingly, when outcomes from A. baumannii bacteremia
    were compared directly to those for patients who had bacteremia with other gram-negative
    organisms, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, a significant increase in mortality
    was noted for A. baumannii (266, 462). A further study showed a significant increase
    in mortality with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii colonization or infection compared
    to that with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization or infection,
    using a Kaplan-Meier analysis (198). However, none of these studies used a formal,
    standardized method to adjust for severity of illness or comorbidities, such as
    an APACHE, McCabe, or Charlson score (81, 322). Whether the disparity between
    studies can be explained purely by methodological differences is unknown. However,
    it is important that all A. baumannii outcome studies involve a single geographic
    region, and thus the potential for a pathogen-specific variable, such as virulence,
    to cause the diversity in results is possible. This concept is further supported
    by the significantly worse outcomes observed in patients infected with A. baumannii
    from the community than those for patients infected in the hospital setting, including
    a high incidence of bacteremia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated
    intravascular coagulation, and death (325). Community-acquired A. baumannii infection
    appears to be a unique clinical entity occurring predominantly in tropical climates
    (9, 325). More recently, the clinical impact of empirical therapy on patient outcomes
    with A. baumannii bacteremia has been analyzed. Several studies report that receipt
    of inactive empirical therapy is an independent predictor of increased mortality
    (306, 337, 463), whereas others have not been able to confirm these findings (5,
    87, 159, 215, 528). Such differences may relate to the small patient numbers included
    in these studies and the resulting lack of statistical power. Finally, despite
    A. baumannii being the most common species leading to clinical infection, very
    few data exist on the comparison of outcomes between A. baumannii and other Acinetobacter
    species. In a recent study from Korea, 28 patients with bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter
    species outside the A. baumannii group, predominantly A. lwoffii, A. haemolyticus,
    and A. calcoaceticus, were compared to 112 patients with A. baumannii bacteremia
    (88). After adjusting for severity of illness, proportion of patients with polymicrobial
    bacteremia, and adequacy of antibiotic therapy, no significant difference was
    observed in mortality. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly
    longer for those with A. baumannii infection. Unfortunately, species identification
    in this study was not based on reliable methods, and therefore it is difficult
    to make definite conclusions. It now appears that the image of A. baumannii as
    a low-virulence pathogen is under extreme scrutiny. The organism is clearly evolving,
    as determined by genomic comparative studies (172), and with the acquisition of
    drug resistance determinants, which impairs our ability to use active empirical
    therapy, acquisition of virulence determinants may also be occurring. HOST-PATHOGEN
    INTERACTIONS INVOLVING ACINETOBACTER Relative to other gram-negative organisms,
    such as P. aeruginosa, very little is known about the host-pathogen interactions
    involving A. baumannii. Recent whole-genome sequencing studies involving A. baumannii
    have demonstrated not only a vast array of antibiotic drug resistance determinants
    but also many pathogenicity islands (172, 514). Of relevance, a significant number
    of identified genes encoding resistance to antibiotics, heavy metals, and antiseptics
    likely originated in other highly pathogenic organisms, including Pseudomonas
    spp., Salmonella spp., and E. coli (172). This implies that genetic transfer of
    virulence determinants may also be possible. After performing random mutagenesis
    of an A. baumannii ATCC strain (17978), Smith et al. were able to identify several
    mutants in six different pathogenicity islands with attenuated virulence, as determined
    by the nonmammalian models Caenorhabditis elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum
    (514). The relevant mutated genes encoded transcription factors, multidrug efflux
    transport systems, and a urease. Unfortunately, the virulence of these mutants
    was not assessed in a mammalian model. When the genome of A. baumannii was compared
    to that of the nonpathogenic species A. baylyi, 28 gene clusters were unique to
    A. baumannii, with 16 having a potential role in virulence (514). One of the most
    interesting of these was a 133,740-bp island that contained not only transposons
    and integrases but also genes homologous to the Legionella/Coxiella type IV virulence/secretion
    systems (514). Other relevant genes included those involved in the cell envelope,
    pilus biogenesis, and iron uptake and metabolism. An earlier study, which first
    described the applicability of transposon mutagenesis to A. baumannii, identified
    several mutants with altered metabolic and global regulatory functions, including
    a gacS-like gene encoding a sensor kinase that is important for the regulation
    of virulence determinants in other gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas
    (291, 577), as well as attachment or biofilm mutants (136). Such broad-based genetic
    approaches are critical for the future identification of novel virulence factors
    in A. baumannii. The study of more specific virulence mechanisms in A. baumannii
    has focused on siderophore-mediated iron acquisition systems (135, 137, 144, 607),
    biofilm formation (545, 578), adherence and OMP function (315, 510), and the A.
    baumannii LPS (152, 222, 292). In order for A. baumannii to thrive in the iron-deficient
    environment of a human host, it secretes low-molecular-mass ferric binding compounds,
    or siderophores (135, 137). Interestingly, the expression of these elements can
    vary greatly between clinical strains of A. baumannii (135, 607), and these elements
    have structural and functional similarities to a siderophore produced by the fish
    pathogen Vibrio anguillarum (137), a potential origin of this critical virulence
    mechanism. The ability of A. baumannii to adhere to and form biofilms on inanimate
    objects and surfaces may explain its success in the hospital environment. Tomaras
    et al. demonstrated that biofilm formation in A. baumannii is phenotypically associated
    with exopolysaccharide production and pilus formation (545). Through random mutagenesis
    and genetic complementation, a gene encoding a protein highly similar to that
    encoded by the Vibrio parahaemolyticus csuE gene was identified as a key factor
    in pilus and biofilm formation (545). Further sequence analysis identified a csu
    polycistronic operon involving five genes, some of which are homologous to genes
    that encode proteins related to chaperones and involved in pilus assembly in other
    gram-negative bacteria (545). Adherence of A. baumannii to human bronchial epithelial
    cells and erythrocytes has also been demonstrated, with similar pilus-like structures
    appearing important for adherence (204, 315). Interestingly, considerable variation
    in quantitative adherence was observed between strains, including greater adherence
    of strains from European clone II than from clone I (315). However, no difference
    between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains was observed. After adherence to human
    cells, it appears that A. baumannii can induce apoptosis via an OMP (Omp38) (84).
    This protein appears to localize to the mitochondria, leading to both caspase-dependent
    and -independent pathways of apoptosis (84). However, it is not the only factor
    involved, as an Omp38 mutant caused incomplete attenuation of cell death (84).
    Finally, quorum sensing has been shown to regulate a wide array of virulence mechanisms
    in many gram-negative organisms, particularly P. aeruginosa. Up to four different
    quorum-sensing signal molecules have been identified in Acinetobacter, indicating
    that this may be a central mechanism for autoinduction of multiple virulence factors
    (203, 271). Apart from biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide production is also
    thought to protect bacteria from host defenses (271). Several recent studies have
    described the innate immune response to A. baumannii and the importance of Toll-like
    receptor (TLR) signaling (152, 292). In a mouse pneumonia model, TLR4 gene-deficient
    mice had increased bacterial counts, increased bacteremia, impaired cytokine/chemokine
    responses, and delayed onset of lung inflammation compared to wild-type mice (292).
    A. baumannii LPS was identified as the major immunostimulatory factor (292). This
    was further illustrated by the attenuated effects of A. baumannii on mice deficient
    in CD14, an important molecule that enables LPS binding to TLR4 (292). These findings
    were recently confirmed using human cells, but in contrast to the mouse model,
    TLR2 was also identified as an important signaling pathway (152). The latter study
    also demonstrated the potent endotoxic potential of A. baumannii LPS, which stimulated
    the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha equally
    to the stimulation by E. coli LPS at similar concentrations (152). These studies
    suggest that A. baumannii endotoxin may incite a strong inflammatory response
    during infection. Humoral immune responses have also been described for Acinetobacter
    infection, with antibodies being targeted toward iron-repressable OMPs and the
    O polysaccharide component of LPS (513). Of interest, a more recent study showed
    that mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies directed at A. baumannii OMPs expressed
    in an iron-depleted environment have bactericidal and opsonizing in vitro activity
    (201). These antibodies were also able to block siderophore-mediated iron uptake
    (201). INFECTION CONTROL PERSPECTIVE Why Is A. baumannii a Persistent Hospital
    Pathogen? There are three major factors possibly contributing to the persistence
    of A. baumannii in the hospital environment, i.e., resistance to major antimicrobial
    drugs, resistance to desiccation, and resistance to disinfectants. Resistance
    to antibiotics may provide certain A. baumannii strains with a selective advantage
    in an environment, such as the modern ICU, where microorganisms are confronted
    with extensive exposure to antimicrobials. Several researchers have observed that
    resistance rates in epidemic A. baumannii strains are significantly higher than
    those in sporadic A. baumannii strains (123, 227, 262, 297). Resistance to the
    fluoroquinolones in particular was associated with epidemic behavior (227, 262).
    Villers et al. identified previous therapy with a fluoroquinolone as an independent
    risk factor for infection with epidemic A. baumannii, and it appeared that the
    selection pressure caused by the indiscriminate use of fluoroquinolones was responsible
    for the persistence and epidemic spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii clones
    for at least 5 years (586). The recently observed increase in carbapenem-resistant
    A. baumannii strains was associated almost exclusively with hospital outbreaks
    (99, 351, 354). It has been suggested that any clinical A. baumannii isolate with
    resistance to multiple antibiotics indicates a potential nosocomial outbreak strain
    (297). To assess the desiccation tolerance of A. baumannii, Jawad et al. compared
    the survival times on glass coverslips of 22 strains isolated from eight well-defined
    hospital outbreaks with the survival times of 17 sporadic strains. The overall
    mean survival time was 27 days, with a range of 21 to 33 days (262). Of note,
    there were no differences in survival times between outbreak and sporadic strains;
    all investigated A. baumannii strains had the ability of long-time survival on
    dry surfaces and therefore an increased potential for epidemic spread. It has
    also been shown that A. baumannii strains survive desiccation far better than
    do other Acinetobacter species, such as A. johnsonii, A. junii, and A. lwoffii
    (261, 377). This, together with their greater susceptibility to commonly used
    antimicrobials, may explain why Acinetobacter strains belonging to these species
    have been implicated only very rarely in hospital outbreaks. The majority of A.
    baumannii strains had survival times that were considerably longer than those
    found for Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae but similar to those observed
    for Staphylococcus aureus. These observations, as well as the previously suggested
    airborne spread of Acinetobacter spp. in hospital wards (6, 34), may explain the
    occurrence of repeated outbreaks after incomplete disinfection of contaminated
    dry surfaces. Prolonged survival of A. baumannii in a clinical setting, i.e.,
    on patients'' bed rails, has been found to be associated with an ongoing outbreak
    in an ICU and illustrates that dry vectors can be secondary reservoirs where A.
    baumannii can survive (73). Concern has been growing regarding the potential of
    antibiotic and disinfectant coresistance in clinically important bacteria. Reduced
    susceptibility of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) versus methicillin-susceptible
    S. aureus to chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium compounds was reported (527),
    and MRSA strains with low-level resistance to triclosan have emerged (57). Similar
    observations were made in gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa
    (539). It has been speculated that resistance to disinfectants may contribute
    to the epidemicity of the organism in a clinical setting, but to our knowledge,
    the association of resistance to biocides and the propensity for epidemic spread
    has never been studied systematically. Wisplinghoff et al. recently compared the
    in vitro activities of various disinfectants, such as propanol, mecetronium ethylsulfate,
    polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine, triclosan, and chlorhexidine, against sporadic and
    epidemic A. baumannii strains by using a broth macrodilution method (601). They
    concluded that resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably not a major
    factor favoring the epidemic spread of A. baumannii, since all disinfectants inhibited
    growth of all A. baumannii isolates when concentrations and contact times recommended
    by the respective manufacturer were used. However, with most of the disinfectants
    tested, a substantial number of viable bacteria remained if contact times were
    <30 s or if diluted agents were used, as may occur in day-to-day clinical practice.
    No significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic
    strains were observed under these conditions. Minor deviations from the recommended
    procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role
    in nosocomial cross-transmission, but larger studies using additional methods
    would be required to confirm these findings. Molecular Epidemiologic Techniques
    To control the spread of A. baumannii in the hospital, it is necessary to identify
    potential reservoirs of the organism and the modes of transmission. To distinguish
    the outbreak strain from epidemiologically unrelated acinetobacters, comparison
    of isolates at the subspecies level is required, and the methods used for this
    purpose are designated epidemiological typing methods. Phenotypic typing systems
    based on biochemical profiles (biotyping), antibiotic susceptibility patterns,
    serological reactions (serotyping), phage typing, and protein profiles (for a
    comprehensive review of these techniques, the reader is referred to the work of
    Bergogne-Berezin and Towner [28]) have largely been replaced by a multitude of
    molecular typing systems, including, in historical order, plasmid profiling (221,
    494); ribotyping (62, 123, 189, 498); PFGE (48, 206, 498); randomly amplified
    polymorphic DNA analysis (208, 214, 295); repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based
    (REP) PCR (252, 516); AFLP analysis, a high-resolution genomic fingerprinting
    method (123, 257, 295); integrase gene PCR (296); infrequent-restriction-site
    PCR (612); and most recently, MLST (18) and multilocus PCR-ESI-MS (145). Plasmid
    analysis. The majority of Acinetobacter species contain indigenous plasmids. Plasmid
    analysis has been used successfully for epidemiological typing of A. baumannii
    strains (221, 396, 494), and plasmid profiling is one of the few methods that
    have also been applied to study the epidemiology of Acinetobacter species outside
    the A. baumannii group (495, 499, 502). Even though the method is fairly robust,
    interpretation of results must include the consideration that many plasmids are
    easily transferable and may be gained or lost, and this contributed to the replacement
    of plasmid profiling by more robust molecular methods for epidemiological studies
    of acinetobacters. Ribotyping. Ribotyping was developed primarily to identify
    acinetobacters, in particular strains of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex,
    to the species level (189). This method—using EcoRI, ClaI, and SalI for restriction
    of purified chromosomal DNA, followed by electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization
    with a digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled cDNA probe derived from E. coli rRNA—has also
    been used to type strains in several studies investigating the epidemiology of
    acinetobacters (210, 211, 394). However, the discriminatory power of ribotyping
    is limited, and PFGE (see below) and other methods are less labor-intensive and
    more discriminatory (498, 508). More accurate typing results with a discriminatory
    power comparable to that of PFGE have been obtained using an automated ribotyping
    system (RiboPrinter; DuPont Qualicon, Wilmington, DE) (62, 453, 508). Automated
    ribotyping generates typing results more rapidly than PFGE does, but it is expensive
    and requires specialized equipment that is available in only a few laboratories
    that perform high-throughput molecular epidemiology investigations. PFGE. Even
    in the face of sequence-based methods that are now available and are challenging
    PFGE as the gold standard for typing of many bacterial species, for Acinetobacter
    PFGE still remains the reference method of choice. It is a rather laborious method
    that requires several days before generating a typing result, but the necessary
    equipment is now standard not only in most reference laboratories but also in
    hospital-based laboratories. Generally, ApaI and/or SmaI is used for restriction
    of intact chromosomal DNA (48, 206, 498). The resulting chromosomal fragments
    are separated by electrophoresis, and fingerprint profiles are compared visually
    or using specialized computer programs that also allow the storage of profiles
    in a database. As with other so-called comparative typing systems that are based
    mainly on a side-by-side comparison of molecular fingerprint patterns of a limited
    number of strains, interlaboratory comparison has always been a problem with PFGE,
    but a recent study has shown that with sufficient standardization of protocols
    interlaboratory reproducibility can be achieved (497). This approach would permit
    the recognition of epidemic strains and the early detection of multihospital or
    nationwide outbreaks, particularly if cases are geographically separated. As seen
    with other species, the discriminatory power of PFGE may be too high for large-scale
    epidemiologic and population studies, but the potentially greater value of newer
    methods, such as MLST or PCR-ESI-MS (see below), remains to be demonstrated for
    Acinetobacter. PCR-based typing methods. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR,
    involving amplification of random fragments of genomic DNA with single primers
    with an arbitrary sequence, has been used successfully to assess the strain relatedness
    of Acinetobacter isolates (208). An alternative approach, referred to as REP-PCR
    (48, 516), uses consensus primers for the highly conserved REP sequences to amplify
    intervening sequences located between these DNA motifs. Both methods do not require
    specialized equipment and are fast, easy, and low-cost methods that allow grouping
    of A. baumannii strains with various degrees of genotypic relatedness. The discriminatory
    power of these methods, however, is inferior to that of PFGE. Interlaboratory
    reproducibility of PCR-generated fingerprints was demonstrated in one study, using
    four different primers (DAF4, ERIC-2, M13, and REP1 plus REP2) and a highly standardized
    protocol (214), but these findings could not be confirmed in later studies (L.
    Dijkshoorn, L. Dolzani, and H. Seifert, unpublished data). Huys et al. (252) recently
    used REP-PCR fingerprinting with a (GTG)5 primer to distinguish members of the
    pan-European multidrug-resistant A. baumannii clone III (570) from the known clones
    I and II (123). In general, PCR-based typing methods allow for a quick estimate
    of epidemiological relatedness in a defined setting (599, 605), but they are not
    suited for large-scale comparative epidemiological studies. It remains to be shown
    if more rigorous standardization and automation of REP-PCR, such as by use of
    a DiversiLab system (bioMérieux), which includes a microfluidics-based detection
    system, will allow bacterial strain typing with an increased interlaboratory reproducibility
    (226). AFLP analysis. AFLP analysis was established in the 1990s. It is a highly
    sensitive DNA fingerprinting method by which DNA is digested with restriction
    enzymes, followed by selective amplification, electrophoretic separation of fragments,
    and visualization. It is a rather cumbersome and expensive method that is usually
    performed in a semiautomated procedure, with laser detection of fragments on a
    sequencing platform. The resulting complex profiles are digitized and usually
    analyzed with appropriate software. Apart from being a powerful tool in bacterial
    taxonomy (256, 392), this high-resolution fingerprinting method has also been
    found to be useful for the characterization of Acinetobacter strains at the subspecies
    level and for outbreak investigation (123, 128, 257, 258, 295, 570, 605). Even
    though AFLP analysis is a relatively robust method, it requires a high level of
    standardization and extensive experience in interpretation of banding patterns
    even if sophisticated computer programs are available to aid in pattern analysis.
    Therefore, this method is restricted to reference laboratories and not suited
    for routine epidemiological analyses. In addition, data are not readily transportable
    between laboratories, mainly due to a lack of reproducibility when different sequencing
    platforms are used. Although clustering obtained with AFLP analysis compared well
    to PFGE-derived clustering in small-scale studies (109, 508, 570), a detailed
    and comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these two typing methods has never
    been performed. MLST. MLST is a highly discriminative typing method that has been
    applied to a variety of bacterial pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis (349),
    Streptococcus pneumoniae (164), and S. aureus (150). The MLST scheme that was
    recently developed for A. baumannii by Bartual and coworkers is based on 305-
    to 513-bp sequences of the conserved regions of the following seven housekeeping
    genes: gltA, gyrB, gdhB, recA, cpn60, gpi, and rpoD (18). It can also be applied
    to Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU isolates (598). The currently available
    MLST data are in good concordance with typing results generated by PFGE and AFLP
    analysis (18). Thus far, the system has been used with only a limited number of
    A. baumannii strains, mainly from Spanish and German hospital outbreaks, and requires
    further evaluation. The discriminatory power of the currently proposed MLST system
    is comparable to that of both PFGE and AFLP analysis. However, MLST is expensive
    and laborious and therefore not suited for routine outbreak analysis or other
    limited-scale analysis of the epidemiology of A. baumannii. It remains to be determined
    if this typing scheme is appropriate for the study of the population structure
    of A. baumannii and perhaps other Acinetobacter species, as shown successfully
    when this method was applied to other microorganisms. To date, MLST is one of
    the few so-called library typing systems used for the epidemiological study of
    A. baumannii, i.e., a typing system where typing data are translated into a numerical
    code that can be obtained in an identical manner at different laboratories by
    using the same protocol. It provides a portable method that may be suitable for
    global epidemiologic study and allow the recognition of epidemic, multiresistant,
    and virulent A. baumannii clones and the monitoring of their national and international
    spread. PCR-ESI-MS. PCR-ESI-MS is a form of high-throughput MLST that can be used
    for species identification of A. baumannii as well as Acinetobacter genomic species
    3 and 13TU and, in addition, to determine clonality (145). The conserved regions
    of six bacterial housekeeping genes (trpE, adk, efp, mutY, fumC, and ppa) are
    amplified from each isolate, amplification products are then desalted and purified,
    and the mass spectra are determined. The system was established using 267 Acinetobacter
    isolates collected from infected and colonized soldiers and civilians involved
    in an outbreak in the military health care system associated with the war in Iraq,
    previously characterized outbreaks in European hospitals, and culture collections.
    A good correlation with PFGE typing was observed. As a major advantage, the PCR-ESI-MS
    genotyping method appears to be very fast (taking only 4 h), providing typing
    results on a time scale not achievable with most other systems. Further evaluation
    of this method is clearly warranted. Hospital Outbreaks and Control Measures The
    propensity for outbreaks of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii has been demonstrated
    clearly. Only one or two strain types were found in the majority of more than
    20 outbreaks assessed, using PFGE or PCR-based typing methods to assess clonality
    (584). In New York City, two strain types accounted for >80% of carbapenem-resistant
    isolates. Among six pandrug-resistant isolates, three separate ribotypes were
    identified (446). This clearly demonstrates the importance of infection control
    interventions in response to outbreaks of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infections.
    The following infection control interventions are appropriate with regard to A.
    baumannii outbreaks. (i) Molecular epidemiologic investigations should be conducted
    to determine if a clonal outbreak strain is present (as described above). (ii)
    Environmental cultures should be used to determine if a common environmental source
    is present. If such a source is found, it should be removed from the patient care
    setting. Numerous potential sources have been identified in prior studies, including
    ventilator tubing, suction catheters, humidifiers, containers of distilled water,
    urine collection jugs, multidose vials of medication, intravenous nutrition, moist
    bedding articles, inadequately sterilized reusable arterial pressure transducers,
    and computer keyboards (171, 390, 563, 584). A high-profile outbreak arose from
    pulsatile lavage wound treatment, a high-pressure irrigation treatment used to
    debride wounds (353). (iii) Enhanced environmental cleaning should be performed
    in order to eliminate the organism from the peripatient environment. (iv) Enhanced
    isolation procedures, aimed at optimizing contact isolation (usage of gloves and
    gowns when dealing with colonized patients or their environment) and improving
    hand hygiene, should be implemented. In some circumstances, cohorts of patients
    or staff are used, but optimally patients should be nursed in single rooms with
    a dedicated nurse. This will be impractical in many settings. (v) Antibiotic management
    processes should be used to ensure that “at-risk” antibiotics are not being used
    excessively. Optimally, a case-case control study should be performed to determine
    which antibiotics truly do increase the risk of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    strains (288). Numerous studies have assessed antibiotic risk factors for infection
    with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, although only a few have examined risk
    factors for emergence of pandrug resistance. Although exposure to any antibiotic
    active against gram-negative bacteria has been associated with the emergence of
    multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (359), three classes of antibiotics have been
    implicated most frequently, including broad-spectrum cephalosporins (71, 251,
    309, 483), carbapenems (103, 120, 321), and fluoroquinolones (586). A number of
    investigators have demonstrated that interventions such as those described above
    can be effective in the control of A. baumannii infections (78, 109, 121, 390,
    435, 594). In some cases, despite these efforts, ongoing cases of multidrug-resistant
    A. baumannii infection continue to occur. Monitoring adherence to such infection
    control interventions is also important. Although health care worker hand carriage
    with Acinetobacter is typically transient, it may be more prolonged in individuals
    with damaged skin (22, 247). In some scenarios, closure of wards to new admissions
    needs to be undertaken (435). Some authors have suggested that eradication of
    colonization be performed by techniques such as selective digestive tract decolonization
    or use of topical or aerosolized polymyxins (200, 563). However, we are hesitant
    to recommend these interventions due to the possible risks of polymyxin-resistant
    organisms. Rather, we would prefer greater assessment for colonized patients,
    greater attention to environmental decontamination, and improved hand hygiene
    as a means for prevention of patient-to-patient transfer. Further studies are
    still required to define the efficacy of these infection control interventions
    in the prevention of A. baumannii dissemination. THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES FOR ACINETOBACTER
    BAUMANNII INFECTION The wide array of intrinsic and acquired resistance determinants
    that have emerged in A. baumannii have justifiably brought it great scientific
    attention. As determined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, A. baumannii
    is one of the “red alert” pathogens that greatly threaten the utility of our current
    antibacterial armamentarium (531). Prior to the 1970s, it was possible to treat
    Acinetobacter infections with a range of antibiotics, including aminoglycosides,
    β-lactams, and tetracyclines (28). However, resistance to all known antibiotics
    has now emerged in A. baumannii (153, 309), thus leaving the majority of today''s
    clinicians in unfamiliar territory. Compounding the problem is the large number
    of pharmaceutical companies that have abandoned antibiotic drug discovery and
    development, driven primarily by the risks of poor financial returns relative
    to those for more lucrative classes of drugs (519, 593). The dearth of antibiotics,
    especially for gram-negative organisms, has recently stimulated attention from
    major research and governing bodies (388, 531). Unfortunately, at this stage,
    very little is in the therapeutic pipeline (459), and the new agents with activity
    against gram-negative organisms are all modifications of existing classes. Novel
    antibiotic targets and mechanisms of action are urgently required. Given the current
    therapeutic environment, optimizing the use of existing antimicrobials is critical.
    To achieve this goal, a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
    parameters that predict maximal drug efficacy yet minimize the evolution of drug
    resistance, as well as an evidence-based approach to therapeutic strategies for
    highly drug-resistant strains, is required. The following section concentrates
    on the available in vitro, animal, and human data to assist the reader in the
    management of infections due to highly drug-resistant A. baumannii. Existing Antimicrobial
    Agents Given the range and diversity of resistance determinants in A. baumannii,
    therapy should be based on the results of adequately performed antimicrobial susceptibility
    testing. The details and important pitfalls of such testing are described above.
    Antibiotic selection for empirical therapy is challenging and must rely on recent
    institutional-level susceptibility data. Time to effective therapy clearly impacts
    patient outcomes (253, 299), and this may include patients with A. baumannii infection
    (159, 306). Thus far, carbapenems have been thought of as the agents of choice
    for serious A. baumannii infections. However, although these drugs are still active
    against the vast majority of A. baumannii strains worldwide, the clinical utility
    of this class of antimicrobial is increasingly being jeopardized by the emergence
    of both enzymatic and membrane-based mechanisms of resistance, as described above,
    often working in concert (47, 446). This concerning phenotype, challenging one
    of our most potent last lines of defense, is unfortunately being described with
    increased frequency worldwide. What other pharmacological strategies are available?
    Sulbactam. Sulbactam is one of three commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors.
    Unlike clavulanic acid and tazobactam, it has clinically relevant intrinsic antimicrobial
    activity against certain organisms, specifically Acinetobacter (55, 102, 235,
    326, 328, 405, 464) and Bacteroides spp. (596), mediated by its binding to penicillin-binding
    protein 2 (403). Sulbactam is commercially available in a combined formulation
    with either ampicillin or cefoperazone and also as a single agent in France, Germany,
    and Spain (55, 326). Studies assessing the activity of sulbactam alone compared
    to its combination with a β-lactam clearly demonstrate the intrinsic activity
    of the agent rather than its ability to inhibit β-lactamase (55, 102, 235). In
    vitro susceptibilities of A. baumannii strains to sulbactam vary widely, depending
    on the geographic region (326). Thus, we strongly recommend susceptibility testing
    using a broth-based method, rather than disk susceptibility testing (see above),
    prior to its use as monotherapy. Despite the absence of randomized clinical trials,
    sulbactam has shown promising results against A. baumannii strains with various
    susceptibility profiles. Using time-kill studies, authors have demonstrated bactericidal
    activity against susceptible rather than intermediately resistant strains of A.
    baumannii (405, 464), whereas others have shown bacteriostatic activity (102).
    In a murine pneumonia model, using an imipenem- and sulbactam-susceptible A. baumannii
    isolate, similar efficacies were observed between these agents when the dosing
    of sulbactam reached a time above the MIC similar to that of imipenem (1.84 versus
    2.01 h, respectively), indicating the time-dependent activity of this antimicrobial
    (464). Such efficacy data are consistent with data from previous animal models
    (167, 294, 372, 405, 602) and, most importantly, are in keeping with results from
    clinical human studies (85, 93, 102, 263, 515, 561, 603). Urban et al. performed
    a small study assessing the clinical efficacy of sulbactam during an outbreak
    of A. baumannii resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and other β-lactams
    (561). Of the 10 patients who received ampicillin-sulbactam for >3 days, 9 clinically
    responded, with many achieving microbiological eradication (561). These results
    were supported by a further noncomparative study from Spain, which showed that
    29/41 (95%) patients with non-life-threatening A. baumannii infections were cured
    or clinically improved with ampicillin-sulbactam or sulbactam alone (102). All
    isolates were multidrug resistant but were susceptible to imipenem, sulbactam,
    and polymyxins. As pointed out in that study, the use of a sulbactam-containing
    regimen for milder infections may be an appropriate strategy in limiting excessive
    carbapenem use. More supportive data are now available on the efficacy of sulbactam
    in treating serious A. baumannii infections. Wood et al. performed a retrospective
    comparative trial involving patients with A. baumannii VAP and found that treatment
    successes were similar between those who received ampicillin-sulbactam (n = 14)
    and those who received imipenem-cilastatin (n = 63) (93% versus 83%, respectively;
    P > 0.05) (603). Microbiological eradication appeared to be superior in the ampicillin-sulbactam
    group; however, this was not statistically significant. Ampicillin-sulbactam was
    primarily prescribed for patients infected with sulbactam-susceptible, non-imipenem-susceptible
    organisms. Interestingly, significantly more patients in the ampicillin-sulbactam
    group received combination therapy (50% versus 14%; P = 0.01), most commonly with
    an aminoglycoside. No outcome differences were observed between these subgroups,
    but the small sample size limits this analysis. An equivalent efficacy of sulbactam
    to that of imipenem has also been shown for treatment of A. baumannii bloodstream
    infection (85, 93, 263), with one study demonstrating a reduction in pharmaceutical
    costs (263). In a further study, treatment of highly drug-resistant A. baumannii
    bacteremia (susceptible only to sulbactam and polymyxin E) with ampicillin-sulbactam
    was comparable to treatment of more susceptible strains with other therapies,
    including imipenem, aminoglycosides, and quinolones (515). These data indicate
    that when A. baumannii is susceptible to sulbactam, this agent is probably as
    efficacious as any other. Small observational series have shown encouraging results
    with ampicillin-sulbactam for the treatment of nosocomial A. baumannii meningitis
    (268, 328), a problematic entity of increasing significance. However, failures
    have been reported (268, 328). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of sulbactam
    in patients with inflamed meninges is reported to be 2 to 32% of serum levels
    (170), with peak serum levels reaching approximately 42 to 60 mg/liter after an
    intravenous (i.v.) dose of 1 g (170, 366). Thus, assuming that the susceptibility
    breakpoint for sulbactam is ≤4 μg/ml, inadequate dosing may explain the variable
    clinical response. For serious A. baumannii infections, we recommend dosing of
    at least 6 g/day of sulbactam in divided doses, assuming normal renal function.
    Recently, dosing of up to 12 g/day was reported for the treatment of hospital-acquired
    pneumonia caused by sulbactam-resistant A. baumannii, without major adverse effects;
    however, outcomes were similar in those who received 9 g/day (38). The clinical
    benefits of combination therapy with sulbactam compared with sulbactam monotherapy
    are not yet clear. Much of the data comes from in vitro studies using checkerboard
    or time-kill analyses and shows enhanced activity when sulbactam is combined with
    cefepime (472, 548), imipenem (86, 518), meropenem (289, 294), amikacin (481),
    rifampin (11), and ticarcillin-clavulanate (272). In a mouse pneumonia model,
    the combination of ticarcillin-clavulanate, sulbactam, and rifampin appeared most
    efficacious toward a carbapenem- and sulbactam-resistant A. baumannii strain (rifampin
    MIC of 4 mg/liter); however, such effects were lost when a strain that was less
    susceptible to rifampin (MIC, 8 mg/liter) was tested (602). Interestingly, combination
    therapy can prevent the emergence of rifampin resistance (412, 602). Another mouse
    model, using an A. baumannii strain with reduced susceptibility to meropenem and
    sulbactam (MICs, 8 mg/liter and 8 mg/liter, respectively), showed a statistically
    significant improvement in mouse survival with the combination compared to that
    with each agent alone (294). Human data are very limited and lack statistical
    power (303, 603). For example, a retrospective study involving 55 patients with
    A. baumannii bloodstream infection showed superior outcomes in those given a carbapenem
    and ampicillin-sulbactam compared to those given a carbapenem alone (30.8% versus
    58.3%, respectively), but no patient matching was performed (303). Such data are
    intriguing and require further clinical evaluation in humans. Despite the shortcomings
    of these studies, the results suggest that sulbactam should be considered as a
    therapeutic option for mild to severe A. baumannii infections caused by sulbactam-susceptible
    organisms. Unfortunately, sulbactam resistance is common in certain geographic
    areas, and this phenotype will no doubt increase over time. Polymyxins. The emergence
    of A. baumannii strains resistant to all routinely tested antimicrobials has led
    to the necessary revival of the polypeptide antibiotics known as the polymyxins
    (colistin or polymyxin E and polymyxin B). These positively charged antimicrobial
    peptides were discovered in 1947 (524), originating from Bacillus polymyxa (300).
    They target the anionic LPS molecules in the outer cell membranes of gram-negative
    bacteria, leading to interactions between the inner and outer cell membranes,
    with associated lipid exchange, membrane disturbance, osmotic instability, and
    eventual cell death (95, 156). There are two commercially available forms of colistin,
    namely, colistin sulfate for oral and topical use, and CMS, also known as sodium
    colistin methanesulfonate or colistin sulfomethate sodium, for parenteral use
    (332). Both forms are available for nebulization. Given that the polymyxins were
    discovered over 50 years ago, they were never subjected to the rigorous drug development
    process that we now expect of more contemporary antimicrobials. Thus, our understanding
    of the critical pharmacological parameters that govern dosing for maximal efficacy
    and minimal toxicity is poor. As a consequence, confusion exists among clinicians
    and in the literature regarding formulations, nomenclature, and dosing (157, 331,
    332). Such information is urgently required before we mistakenly jeopardize this
    valuable antimicrobial (10, 153, 334, 452). For a detailed review of the pharmacology
    of the polymyxins, readers are referred to the work of Li et al. (332). For the
    remainder of this section, colistin is used to mean all formulations of CMS. In
    vitro, colistin demonstrates concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against
    A. baumannii strains with various susceptibility profiles, as determined by time-kill
    analyses (372, 411, 465). However, significant regrowth has been observed at 24
    h for strains characterized as having heterogeneous resistance to colistin (411).
    Presumably, the subpopulations with higher MICs flourish under selection pressure.
    Whether this phenomenon is clinically relevant has yet to be determined. Conflicting
    results have been reported for the postantibiotic effect of colistin (411, 436),
    a parameter often used to assist in optimizing dosing. Thus far, animal models
    have shown mixed results for colistin efficacy (372, 415, 465) and serve to remind
    us of the potential limitations of extrapolating such data to clinical management.
    Interestingly, the efficacy of colistin at reducing the bacterial burden in the
    lungs was poor in a murine pneumonia model (direct upper airway inoculation) (372),
    in contrast to excellent activity in a rat thigh infection model that led to hematogenous
    dissemination of the lungs (415). This may be explained by varied colistin penetration
    into lung compartments or a modification of activity in the epithelial lining
    fluid. The cumulative human data on the efficacy and toxicity of colistin for
    treating A. baumannii infection in the modern era are represented in Table 5.
    Overall, the efficacy of the drug has been highly encouraging in both adult and
    pediatric populations, with favorable or curative responses ranging from 57% to
    >80% (158, 185, 207, 241, 283, 301, 327, 357, 369, 409, 451, 517). In several
    recent prospective cohort studies across a range of infection types, the outcomes
    for patients receiving definitive therapy with colistin for colistin-only-susceptible
    organisms were similar to those for patients receiving combinations of other antibiotics
    (predominantly carbapenems with or without other antibiotics) for more susceptible
    organisms (185, 451). Interestingly, despite the majority of patients in the colistin
    groups receiving inactive empirical therapy compared to the noncolistin groups,
    outcomes were similar (185, 451). Most recently, a further prospective cohort
    study reported a statistically significant improvement in outcome for patients
    receiving colistin compared with those receiving other antibiotics (301). However,
    all patients were infected with isolates susceptible only to colistin, and therefore
    many patients in the noncolistin group received definitive therapy with inactive
    antimicrobials (at least 40%) (301). Nebulized colistin is increasingly being
    used in an attempt to minimize systemic toxicity and improve drug deposition at
    the site of infection (158, 219, 305, 339, 367, 425). Much of the data on nebulized
    colistin originates from patients with cystic fibrosis who are colonized or infected
    with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29, 240). However, the literature is expanding outside
    this patient population (Table 6). Thus far, no prospective comparative study
    has been performed to assess the efficacy of nebulized colistin for A. baumannii
    infection. In a retrospective case series by Kwa et al., 18 of 21 (86%) patients
    who received nebulized colistin for hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by A. baumannii
    or P. aeruginosa (resistant to all antimicrobials except polymyxins) had favorable
    clinical and microbiological responses (305). None of these patients received
    parenteral colistin, but most were receiving other antimicrobials for concomitant
    infections. One (5%) patient developed bronchospasm, and no cases of nephro- or
    neurotoxicity were reported (305). Similar, encouraging results were reported
    by Michalopoulos et al., who compared the outcomes for 8 patients who received
    supplemental nebulized colistin combined with parenteral antibiotics with those
    for 45 patients who received parenteral colistin only (367). Rates of clinical
    cure appeared superior with supplemental nebulized colistin, but the patient numbers
    were small and limit statistical comparisons (Table 6). The largest series thus
    far, by Berlana et al., included 71 patients who received nebulized colistin for
    presumed pneumonia caused by more susceptible A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa strains
    (30). Conclusions from this study are difficult to ascertain, as the majority
    of patients received concomitant i.v. antibiotics, predominantly carbapenems,
    to which the pathogens were likely susceptible; only 69% of the treated patients
    met the criteria for pneumonia; and adverse events were not reported (30). Reassuringly,
    of the 33 patients who received nebulized colistin for A. baumannii and had follow-up
    cultures, all had microbiological eradication (30). Overall, more recent data
    suggest that nebulized colistin is well tolerated (Table 6), but a recent U.S.
    FDA health alert was issued for nebulized colistin after the death of a patient
    with cystic fibrosis (www.fda.gov ). This patient used a premixed CMS vial for
    inhalation through a nebulizer and developed respiratory distress soon after.
    Once CMS is mixed into aqueous solution, it is converted into colistin by hydrolysis.
    The bioactive colistin, specifically colistin A (polymyxin E1), can be toxic to
    lung tisssue. Thus, those prescribing nebulized colistin must be aware of this
    health alert and should advise patients to use the CMS immediately after preparation.
    CMS is not FDA approved for inhalation. Predose bronchodilators may be beneficial
    in preventing bronchospasm with nebulized colistin (425). CMS dosing for inhalation
    varies from 1 to 3 million IU/day in divided doses (diluted in sterile normal
    saline), using a conventional nebulizer (30, 305, 367, 425), but doses of up to
    6 million IU/day have been used (367). Currently, the evidence for nebulized colistin
    in patients without cystic fibrosis is still limited, and further data are required
    to determine its efficacy. In severe or refractory cases of pneumonia, and taking
    into account the recent U.S. FDA health alert, nebulized colistin in combination
    with an active systemic agent may be warranted. Apart from monitoring for acute
    respiratory toxicities, future studies should also assess for superinfection,
    whereby a shift in organism ecology toward those inherently resistant to colistin
    (Serratia, Proteus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, and Flavobacteria)
    occurs (163). As described, nosocomial meningitis is an increasingly important
    entity, with multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens being implicated as an
    etiology with greater frequency. To optimize therapy of these challenging infections,
    intrathecal or intraventricular colistin has been utilized (Table 7). This route
    of administration is not novel for the polymyxins and was implemented soon after
    its availability (96, 225, 546). Despite the majority of patients with A. baumannii
    meningitis receiving colistin both systemically and directly into the CSF, the
    latter alone may be adequate (25, 398, 576). Such a strategy avoids the unnecessary
    risks of nephrotoxicity. Thus far, intrathecal/ventricular colistin has been well
    tolerated, with rare reports of chemical meningitis that spontaneously resolved
    with either drug cessation or dose reduction (155, 398). In the absence of an
    external CSF drain, which is often the source of infection, repeated lumbar punctures
    are required, with the associated risk of introducing other pathogens. Several
    cases of A. baumannii meningitis have been cured with i.v. colistin only (267,
    269, 327, 416), with reported levels in CSF of 1.25 mg/liter (CSF/serum ratio
    of 25%) (267, 269); however, failures have also been reported that eventually
    responded only to intrathecal/ventricular administration (7, 67, 286, 398, 526).
    Dosing varies greatly between studies, but according to the Infectious Diseases
    Society of America, 5 mg of polymyxin B or 10 mg of colistin daily is recommended
    for adults (553). Given the available literature and the severity of this infection,
    we recommend the use of colistin directly into the CSF early for patients with
    carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii meningitis. Many in vitro and animal studies
    support the role of combination therapy with colistin (Table 8). In particular,
    colistin in combination with a carbapenem and/or rifampin appears most promising
    (194, 239, 351, 373, 415, 518, 537, 541, 613). Understandably, in the presence
    of significant carbapenemase activity, as opposed to membrane-based changes (porins
    and efflux pumps) that are likely disrupted by the polymyxins, synergy with carbapenems
    may be lost (592). Unfortunately, very few human data are available to support
    these in vitro studies. Much of the clinical data on colistin efficacy comes from
    uncontrolled, retrospective case series (Table 5), which often include heterogeneous
    populations. In addition to colistin, the majority of patients received a potpourri
    of other antimicrobials, most commonly carbapenems but also quinolones, aminoglycosides,
    sulbactam, rifampin, and others (30, 158, 301, 305, 357, 367, 369, 409, 517).
    In the absence of a well-matched control group (i.e., a group receiving colistin
    alone), it is difficult to make conclusions about the potential benefits of combination
    therapy (374, 432, 517). More recently, Falagas et al. performed a retrospective
    cohort study, comparing patients who received colistin only with those who received
    colistin and meropenem (161). After adjusting for severity of illness, no difference
    in outcomes was observed. Whether combination therapy will protect colistin from
    the emergence of resistance is presently unknown, but an in vitro pharmacodynamic
    model suggests that this may be possible (302). Further human studies are warranted.
    The most surprising feature of the colistin renaissance has been the low rates
    of nephrotoxicity, whose frequency is highly dependent on study definitions. Overall,
    however, the rates are significantly less than previously reported (168) and appear
    to be reversible with cessation of the drug (158, 301, 327). Prolonged administration
    of colistin (>4 weeks) without adverse effects has been reported (162). Patients
    with a history of renal impairment (301, 327, 369), those given concomitant nephrotoxins
    (301, 409, 517), and the elderly (409) are at greatest risk. Dosing should be
    adjusted in those with preexisting renal dysfunction (colymycin M parenteral package
    insert; Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Bristol, TN) and those receiving renal replacement
    therapy (333). As observed with acute renal failure in other clinical settings
    (19), this adverse outcome may be a predictor of increased mortality in patients
    receiving colistin (369, 409). Of concern, rates of resistance to the polymyxins
    have recently been reported to be as high as 3.2% for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    strains (177), with higher rates reported in Korea (293). Resistance in other
    problematic gram-negative pathogens is also emerging (10, 177, 307). Such events
    signify the importance of prudent and cautious use of this class of antimicrobial
    as well as an urgent need to further understand its complex pharmacology. New
    Antimicrobials A concerning void of new therapeutic options exists for A. baumannii
    infections. Of the recently licensed antimicrobials, tigecycline, a 9-t-butylglycylamido
    semisynthetic derivative of minocycline, has provided some hope, but clinical
    data are still limited. As with other tetracycline derivatives, tigecycline inhibits
    the 30S ribosomal subunit, but its unique feature is its ability to evade the
    major determinants of tetracycline resistance, i.e., the tet(A) to tet(E) and
    tet(K) efflux pumps and the tet(M) and tet(O) determinants that provide ribosomal
    protection (169, 430). Thus far, the in vitro activity of tigecycline against
    A. baumannii has been assessed largely by MIC testing. Most studies have reported
    an MIC50 of 1 μg/ml and an MIC90 of 2 μg/ml (229, 413, 473), but studies from
    Germany (500), Spain (37), and Israel (389) have reported MIC90s of 4 μg/ml, 8
    μg/ml, and 32 μg/ml, respectively, with the last being determined by Etest only.
    More recently, combination therapy with tigecycline has been studied using time-kill
    and Etest synergy methodology (476, 486). When it was tested against a non-carbapenem-susceptible
    A. baumannii strain, tigecycline alone allowed maximal killing at concentrations
    near the MIC, which was 1 μg/ml, with no benefit of using higher concentrations
    (486). Importantly, concentrations just below the MIC (0.5 μg/ml to 0.7 μg/ml),
    which are consistent with the mean maximum serum steady-state concentration achieved
    with standard dosing (0.63 μg/ml after a 100-mg i.v. loading dose followed by
    50 mg i.v. twice/day) (410), caused significant regrowth at 24 h (486). No difference
    was observed for all tigecycline combinations, including combinations with amikacin,
    meropenem, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ampicillin-sulbactam, rifampin,
    and polymyxin B (476, 486). These data raise concerns about the use of tigecycline
    for bloodstream infections caused by organisms with MICs of >1 μg/ml. Such concerns
    have now been illustrated in several clinical reports involving A. baumannii (424,
    484). Subinhibitory concentrations may promote the rapid emergence of resistance,
    leading to clinical failure (420, 424). At this point, we would not recommend
    using tigecycline for A. baumannii bacteremia if another option is available.
    Conversely, the drug is concentrated in tissues, including the lung parenchyma
    (101), and thus its utility for treating A. baumannii pneumonia or other tissue-based
    infections warrants further evaluation. A recent retrospective series including
    22 patients with VAP caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii showed that 18
    patients had clinical resolution (484). However, only three of these patients
    received tigecycline monotherapy, with the remainder also receiving therapy with
    imipenem and/or colistin. Further clinical data on tigecycline''s efficacy in
    pneumonia are still awaited. The most common adverse effect of tigecycline is
    nausea (15, 147), often requiring concomitant antiemetic therapy and limiting
    dose escalation. However, this is less of a problem in an ICU setting, where most
    A. baumannii infections occur. Other agents on the licensing horizon with activity
    against gram-negative organisms include doripenem, a new parenteral carbapenem,
    and the next generation of cephalosporins with activity against MRSA, ceftobiprole
    and ceftaroline. At this point, none of these agents appear to have significant
    advantages over current antimicrobials for A. baumannii, but in vitro data for
    doripenem suggest a slight advantage over meropenem (175, 275, 378, 379). Clinical
    data for doripenem against A. baumannii are still awaited. Other Combination Therapy
    The use of combination therapy to treat multidrug- or pandrug-resistant gram-negative
    organisms has become an area of great interest (449). This strategy aims to create
    an active combination out of two agents to which the organism tests nonsusceptible
    in the laboratory. Apart from trying to improve efficacy, combination therapy
    may also help to prevent the emergence of resistance when at least one agent is
    active in vitro (77, 412). Future studies assessing combination therapy for multidrug-resistant
    organisms should address this issue. The studies involving combination therapy
    with either sulbactam or the polymyxins that are described above form the major
    and most promising group. Other combinations have also been studied using in vitro
    techniques and animal models, including various combinations of quinolones, β-lactams,
    and/or amikacin (45, 80, 139, 280, 467). The results for quinolone combination
    therapy are varied, with reduced efficacy being described when ciprofloxacin was
    used for ciprofloxacin-resistant A. baumannii (151), as well as a lack of enhanced
    activity with levofloxacin combined with imipenem or amikacin in a mouse pneumonia
    model (273). Interestingly, enhanced activity was seen when aztreonam was tested
    in combination with other β-lactams against a select group of MBL-producing A.
    baumannii strains (474). Using a mouse pneumonia model, Montero et al. reported
    on the potential efficacy of imipenem and rifampin against a carbapenem- and rifampin-resistant
    A. baumannii strain (373). However, after performing a small preliminary clinical
    study, the same group suggested against such a combination for infection with
    A. baumannii isolates with a similar resistance pattern (470). Unfortunately,
    in some geographic regions, desperate therapeutic measures are required, including
    the use of multiple antibacterial agents that in isolation are predicted to have
    poor activity against the infecting A. baumannii strain, as determined by standardized
    laboratory testing. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Strategies Achieving pharmacodynamic
    target attainment with our existing antimicrobials is now, more than ever, critical
    in our therapeutic approach to drug-resistant A. baumannii infection. The use
    of Monte Carlo simulation, which is a stochastic modeling tool that combines pharmacokinetic
    parameters of antibiotics with population-based microbiological susceptibility
    data, has improved our understanding of appropriate antibiotic dosing. Apart from
    assisting in the optimization of drug efficacy (259, 304, 330, 340), this strategy
    may also help to prevent the evolution of drug resistance, as reported for P.
    aeruginosa (478, 532). The most promising data with regard to A. baumannii are
    the benefits of a prolonged infusion of meropenem (259, 330). The likelihood of
    achieving bactericidal target attainment (defined as a time above the MIC of at
    least 40% of the dosing interval) for organisms that have an MIC at the susceptibility
    breakpoint (4 μg/ml) increases from 64% to 90% as the infusion time of a 1-g dose
    is extended from 0.5 to 3 h (330). In a study involving patients with VAP, extending
    the meropenem infusion time to 3 h and increasing the dose to 2 g every 8 h provided
    concentrations in serum of >16 μg/ml for almost 60% of the time (259). Such data
    support the use of an extended meropenem infusion time for treating serious A.
    baumannii infections and highlight the benefits of an increased dose for nonsusceptible
    isolates. Thus far, the effects of such a dosing strategy on the clinical outcomes
    of patients with A. baumannii infection are unknown and should be a focus of future
    research. Future Therapeutic Considerations Despite the absence of new therapeutic
    options for A. baumannii in clinical studies, the activity in the preclinical
    arena is notable. Such agents can be divided into those that inhibit a currently
    recognized mechanism of resistance or those that have a novel mechanism of action.
    With regard to the former, attention has been directed toward new β-lactamase
    inhibitors, especially those targeting the Ambler class B MBLs (547), as well
    as toward inhibitors of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and multidrug efflux
    pumps. As mentioned above, MBLs have played an important role in the emergence
    of carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii, although they are less prevalent than
    the OXA-type enzymes. Their structure and catalytic mechanism, being zinc dependent,
    contrast with those of other serine β-lactamases, hence their stability toward
    current β-lactamase inhibitors. Agents that chelate the active Zn2+ site appear
    to be the most promising; however, several challenges exist (589). As a consequence
    of the significant differences in the active site architecture between MBL types,
    the ability to develop a pan-MBL inhibitor is problematic (589). Of most concern,
    MBLs have homologous mammalian enzymes (69, 487) and therefore increase the potential
    for significant toxicity. Despite these hurdles, the development of compounds
    that target the metalloenzymes continues (68). Thus far, inhibitors of both aminoglycoside-inactivating
    enzymes and multidrug efflux pumps have also been troubled by diverse targets,
    with bacteria often harboring multiple enzyme or pump types. More recently, cationic
    antimicrobial peptides that are capable of inhibiting both aminoglycoside phosphotransferases
    and acetyltransferases have been described (41). The importance of multidrug efflux
    pumps in A. baumannii is increasingly being recognized, with tigecycline recently
    identified as a substrate of the RND-type pump AdeABC (420, 469). Through large-scale
    in vitro screening, a range of efflux pump inhibitors have been identified, with
    the majority being plant alkaloids (433) but, more recently, also synthetic compounds
    (43). Unfortunately, progress has been slow, with agents such as phenyl-arginine-β-naphthylamide
    doing well when assessed in vitro but coming to demise due to toxicity concerns
    (433). Challenges are also anticipated as a result of the number of efflux systems
    often available in gram-negative organisms, thus leading to compensatory upregulation
    of noninhibited pumps. For a more detailed review of efflux inhibitors, readers
    are referred to references 282 and 343. With advances in genomics, proteomics,
    and chemical biology, new strategies for pathogen control are being devised. Justifiably,
    significant attention is being directed toward eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides,
    which are ubiquitous elements of the innate immune response in a variety of invertebrate,
    plant, and animal species (64). These cationic peptides act primarily by disturbing
    the cell membranes and share a similar structure and charge profile with the polymyxins,
    but the final steps in pathogen lethality have been shown to be different (479,
    480). This mechanistic difference is clinically attractive and is well illustrated
    by the susceptibility of polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii strains to such peptides
    (480, 562). Bactericidal activity against A. baumannii, using both in vitro (4,
    193, 448, 479, 480, 562) and in vivo (56, 125) models, has been reported. Combination
    studies, as determined by fractional inhibitory indexes, demonstrated that magainin
    II acted synergistically with β-lactams against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii
    but that four other peptides showed no synergy (192). More recently, modified
    peptides containing linear sequences of alternating acyl chains and cationic amino
    acids, known as oligo-AKs, were reported (448). In this study, the oligo-AK compound
    C12K-7α8 was compared to conventional antimicrobial peptides and standard antibiotics.
    It was found to have significant bactericidal activity, more so than imipenem
    and ciprofloxacin at 6× MIC, similar membrane binding properties to other peptides,
    no emergence of resistance after serial passages, and almost no toxicity toward
    human red blood cells (448). Furthermore, in a mouse peritoneal infection model
    using E. coli, C12K-7α8 prevented mortality similar to imipenem and ciprofloxacin,
    whereas conventional peptides did not (448). Overall, antimicrobial peptides have
    demonstrated great potential and may provide a feasible alternative for treatment
    of A. baumannii infections, including those caused by polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii
    (480, 562). Toxicity and efficacy data from human studies are awaited. Other novel
    antimicrobial strategies for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii include the use
    of bacterial conjugation, resulting in antibacterial gene transfer (505). This
    highly innovative approach uses attenuated E. coli as a vector for a conjugative
    plasmid carrying bactericidal genes that disrupt protein synthesis. While in E.
    coli the plasmid is tightly repressed, once it is transferred into the target
    pathogen, derepression occurs. In vitro, the donor E. coli cells led to killing
    of A. baumannii (505). Using a murine burn sepsis model, a significant improvement
    in survival of animals that were treated with donor cells was observed, as well
    as inhibition of A. baumannii growth in burn wounds (505). Novel topical agents
    that may be effective for environmental cleaning of A. baumannii, including highly
    charged copper-based biocides, have recently been reported (180). Such agents
    have broad-spectrum activity, including activity against Clostridium difficile
    spores; however, copper resistance was described when copper was used in animal
    feed (223). Other innovative therapeutic avenues, which have not yet been tested
    against A. baumannii but have the potential for efficacy, include the use of bacteriophage
    treatment (590), improvement in host response via passive or active immunization
    (63, 122, 134, 350), and modification of bacterial virulence by inhibition of
    quorum sensing (202, 375), other bacterial secretion systems (17), or LPS biosynthesis
    (118). More broadly, deepening our understanding of the mechanisms of antimicrobial
    resistance gene transfer and the cellular responses (such as the SOS response)
    that lead to mutagenesis and eventual resistance (23, 92, 313) will provide unique
    targets that, when inhibited, may prevent the emergence and dissemination of resistance.
    The clinical utility of these agents will be an adjunct to other antimicrobials.
    Which of these new agents will successfully progress through the gauntlet of drug
    development is unknown, but it is reassuring to see the surge in interest. CONCLUSIONS
    Significant advances have been made in our understanding of A. baumannii over
    recent years, but many unanswered questions still remain. With the advent of whole-genome
    sequencing, we have been able to gain important insights into the genetic complexity
    and agility of this fascinating organism. Its wide array of drug resistance determinants
    and its ability to effectively regulate these according to selective environmental
    pressures clearly demand respect. The global epidemiology of A. baumannii is concerning
    for widespread dissemination, most often in a clonal manner within institutions
    or cities, and sometimes between countries. The evidence suggests that hospital-acquired
    A. baumannii infections prolong the lengths of hospital stays and subsequent health
    care costs. However, the direct effects of A. baumannii on mortality appear less
    well defined. Despite the majority of A. baumannii strains still being susceptible
    to carbapenems, many institutions around the world are faced with the challenging
    issue of pandrug resistance. Concerns have been raised about the use of tigecycline
    for A. baumannii infection, particularly for bacteremia, leaving colistin as the
    only therapeutic option for some. It is imperative that future research be directed
    toward understanding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the
    polymyxins in order for clinicians to optimize patient outcomes, minimize adverse
    effects, and prevent the emergence of secondary resistance. Our understanding
    of the role of combination therapy for patients with multidrug- or pandrug-resistant
    A. baumannii infections is also critical. New therapeutics are clearly needed,
    and we as clinicians, microbiologists, and scientists must think broadly about
    our approach to antimicrobial drug development, as novel targets will no doubt
    provide the most reward for our afflicted patients. FIG. 1. FIG. 1. Summary of

    IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and its relevant
    market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration of multiple
    devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal and external
    states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT has become the
    megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the whole business
    spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity of end devices,
    system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple applications
    such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic congestion
    industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work has been
    done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming solutions
    [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by examining
    multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with the advancement
    of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists and technologists
    are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer are facing such as
    shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues [6], [7]. State-of-the-art
    IoT technologies have detected all these issues and provide solutions to increase
    productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made on wireless sensors networks
    enable us to collect data from sensing devices and send it to the main servers
    [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information about different environmental
    condition to monitor the whole system properly. Monitoring the environmental conditions
    or crop productivity is not only the factor for the evaluation of crop but there
    are many other factors which effect the crops’ productivity, e.g. field management,
    soil and crop monitoring, movement of an unwanted object, attacks of wild animals,
    and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover, IoT provides a well-organized scheduling
    of restricted resources which makes sure that the best use of IoT enhances the
    productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram showing the agricultural trends
    which provide easy and cost effective interactions through a secure and unblemished
    connectivity across individual Greenhouse, Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring.
    Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks using the wireless devices enable real
    time crop and animal monitoring. The figure shows that two sensor kits (Libelium
    Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit)
    have been implemented which monitor the soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature,
    humidity, productivity, and air flow. While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal
    health, fertility, feeding, ruminating and resting. The agricultural servers,
    gateways, and agriculture database play an important role to store agriculture
    records and provide on demand agricultural services to authorized users. FIGURE
    1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole, in agriculture field there are multiple
    applications, protocols and prototypes. IoT agriculture research trends include
    network platform, network architecture, applications, security, and challenges
    among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many countries and organizations over globe
    different IoT policies and guidelines have been implemented in agriculture field.
    However in IoT agricultural environment a reasonable amount of work has been done
    and there is a need of thorough study on IoT in agriculture context to understand
    the current research status. To transform agriculture technologies via IoT innovation
    this paper analyzes various issues and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research
    as a contribution following IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature:
    Present major components of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies
    in Section II. Section III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture
    of IoT that involves network architecture and layers, network topologies used;
    and devices and protocols used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains
    and relevant smart phone and sensor based applications have been discussed in
    Section IV. The security and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been
    discussed in Section V. The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI
    that provides the details related to top technology industries investing in this
    area. The IoT agricultural policies made by different countries for the standardization
    of IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section VII. This section also
    presents few success stories in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges
    to improve IoT based agricultural technologies from many aspects have been presented
    in Section VIII. SECTION II. Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT
    Based Smart Farming A. Major Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart
    farming consist of four major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major
    components of IoT based smart farming. Show All These four major components are
    physical structure, data acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The
    physical structure is the most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid
    any unwanted happening. Whole system is designed in such a way which controls
    the sensors, actuators, and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil
    sensing, temperature sensing, weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing.
    Similarly devices perform many control functions like, node discovery, device
    identification and naming services etc. All these functions are performed by any
    device or sensor which is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling
    operation is performed by any remote device or a computer which is connected through
    the Internet. Data Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely:
    IoT data acquisition and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition
    component consists of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT), Websocket, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can
    be used for the implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data
    acquisition ZigBee, WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS
    protocols have been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are
    image or video processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining
    as shown in Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be
    added that may work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists
    of two main features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves
    three main application in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field
    Monitoring, and Green house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock
    via multiple sensors which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like
    temperature, heart rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications
    intend to report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature,
    humidity, gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring
    [12], [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink

    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Environmental Science & Technology Abstract Pursuit of sustainable development
    requires a systems approach to the design of industrial product and service systems.
    Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual
    development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range
    of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across
    the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate
    and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative
    is to design systems with inherent “resilience” by taking advantage of fundamental
    properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous
    work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements.
    For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity
    and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders
    as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design
    protocol is presented that involves the following steps:  identifying system function
    and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies,
    developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a
    practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration
    of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they
    are embedded. This publication is licensed under the terms of your institutional

    joseph@eco-nomics.com. Connected, distributed systems, from power grids to business
    firms to even entire economies, are both more fragile and more robust than populations
    of isolated entities. Duncan J. Watts ( 1) Overview ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To We
    live in a small world of ever-increasing connectivity, with both cooperation and
    conflict occurring on a global scale. Individuals, companies, and communities
    are linked through worldwide systems of communication, transportation, and commerce.
    Similarly, individual products and services are linked to the global value chains
    in which they are created, delivered, and used. This connectivity presents daunting
    challenges to the design and commercialization of new systems. Instead of focusing
    purely on the function and form of a product or service, design teams today must
    consider a broad range of system-level issues, including safety, security, manufacturability,
    serviceability, material and energy ef ficiency, end-of-life recovery, environmental
    emissions, and even long-term impacts upon quality of life for future generations
    ( 2). In the face of such complexity, traditional methods for analyzing costs,
    benefits, and risks can become overwhelm ing. Instead, it is helpful to delve
    more deeply into the fundamental properties of successful systems in the biologi
    cal, social, and commercial arenas. What do such systems have in common? They
    are complex, adaptive, and unpredictable. They exhibit self-organizing behavior
    that enables continuity in response to external stress. They can survive unexpected
    disruptions, although they can also fail catastrophically. Likewise, engineered
    systems cannot be designed to anticipate all future possibilities, as evidenced
    most recently by the Columbia shuttle disaster and the Northeast electrical power
    blackout of 2003. Nevertheless, engineered systems can be endowed with intrinsic
    characteristics that improve their robustness and adaptability. This paper considers
    how an industrial enterprise can work toward sustainability by adopting a fresh
    perspective based on systems thinking. The concept of “resilience”, borrowed from
    the field of ecology, enables sustainability to be viewed as an inherent system
    property rather than an abstract goal. Already, existing design practices have
    demonstrated many useful techniques for enhancing system resilience. Building
    on these insights, a generalized approach to sustainable systems design is presented,
    including explicit consideration of system boundary conditions and external impacts.
    Toward Sustainable Systems ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In industries ranging from
    resource extraction (e.g., petroleum, lumber) to conversion and processing (e.g.,
    chemicals, electric power) to consumer goods (e.g., packaged foods, electronics),
    shareholders and analysts have become sensitized to a company''s ecological and
    social “footprint”, including global issues such as climate change and poverty.
    Many leading corporations have adopted the concept of sustainable development
    ( 3), recognizing that environmental protection and social responsibility are
    important to both shareholders and other stakeholders ( 4). Yet, despite their
    heightened awareness and commitment, most companies have found it difficult to
    translate broad goals and policies into day-to-day decision-making. There are
    several barriers that limit the practical applica tion of sustainable development
    principles. For one thing, the notion of protecting future generations seems remote
    in the face of contemporary business pressures. The concept of “sustainability”
    is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of status quo rather
    than with opportunities for continued innovation, growth, and prosperity. In addition,
    the popular metaphor of the “triple bottom line” ( 5) seems to imply that economic
    profits need to be “balanced” against environmental and social benefits, whereas
    in truth these three aspects of corporate performance are inseparable and contribute
    synergistically to shareholder value ( 6). Finally, sustainability is often misinterpreted
    as a goal to which we should collectively aspire. In fact, sustain ability is
    not an end state that we can reach; rather, it is a characteristic of a dynamic,
    evolving system. And systems thinking offers a potential means to overcome the
    above barriers. Alternative definitions of sustainability abound, but for system
    design purposes the following definition is useful:  A product, process, or service
    contributes to sustainability if it constrains environmental resource consumption
    and waste generation to an acceptable ( 7) level, supports the satisfaction of
    important human needs, and provides enduring economic value to the business enterprise
    ( 8). Note that a product cannot be sustainable in an absolute sense; rather,
    it must be considered in the context of the supply chain, the market, and the
    natural environment. Therefore, the key practical challenge of sustainable design
    is to understand how products, processes, and services interact with these broader
    systems. As illustrated in Figure 1, full exploration of this question would extend
    beyond the enterprise, even beyond the conventional “product life cycle”, to the
    underlying economic flows as well as ecosystem services derived from “natural
    capital” ( 9). How, then, does one establish realistic boundaries for system design?
    Figure 1 Extending the boundaries of system design ( 8). The challenge of boundary
    definition is evident in a “sustainable mobility” study being conducted by an
    international group of automotive and energy companies working with the World
    Business Council for Sustainable Develop ment. Their goal is for humans to “move
    freely, gain access, communicate, trade and establish relationships without sacrificing
    other essential human or ecological values, today or in the future” ( 10). A key
    issue is how future transportation technologies and demand patterns will evolve,
    together with their supporting infrastructures (e.g., adoption of hydrogen fuel
    cells for automotive vehicles will require development of a new refueling network).
    The infrastructure question is especially challenging since it encompasses roads,
    railways, airports, intermodal freight terminals, and maintenance and guidance
    systems. Ultimately, the evolution of mobility systems will be influenced by urban
    and regional planning policies as well as competing supply chain management strategies.
    The vast scope of these interlocking systems is bewildering for any business enterprise
    seeking to develop a sustainable business strategy for mobility-related products
    and services. What Is a Sustainable Enterprise? ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To During
    the 1990s, Royal Dutch Shell conducted a historical study of corporations in an
    effort to understand what drives corporate longevity ( 11). They found that the
    average life expectancy of large corporations worldwide was less than 50 yearsin
    effect, most companies die prematurely. Furthermore, they identified four factors
    that distinguished long-lived companies: (i) sensitivity and adaptability to the
    business environment (ii) cohesion and sense of identity (iii) tolerance of diversity
    (decentralization) (iv) conservative use of capital Profitability was conspicuously
    absent from this list and was considered to be an outcome rather than a predictor
    of longevitymany companies have delivered spectacular profits for short periods
    of time and then vanished abruptly. From this study emerged the notion that the
    real purpose of a corporation is to learn, grow, and survive in the long run and
    that a corporation is best understood as a living organism rather than as a machine
    engineered to deliver profits. More recently, a decade-long study of 160 companies
    indicated that the main determinants of superior financial performance were not
    technology-based but rather were organic system traitsan achievement-oriented
    culture, a flexible and responsive structure, a clear and focused strategy, and
    flawless execution ( 12). Moreover, the enterprise system needs to encourage recognition
    that the future may not resemble the past since individuals often tend to cling
    to the familiar status quo ( 13). This organic view of the corporation is consistent
    with an emerging recognition by the business community of “intangible” value drivers.
    Company characteristics such as human capital, innovation, alliances, and brand
    equity are increasingly viewed as leading indicators of shareholder value ( 14).
    Moreover, paying attention to social and environmental performance strengthens
    many of these intangibles, including reputation, stakeholder relationships, employee
    pride, ef ficient technology, and license to operate. In short, an enterprise
    that contributes to sustainable development enhances its own sustainability as
    a business. Unfortunately, the term sustainability has become both ambiguous and
    laden with ethical connotations. The following definitions offer a logical framework
    of “nested” systems that may be helpful to system designers. (i) A sustainable
    society is one that continues to satisfy the current needs of its population without
    compromising quality of life for future generations. (ii) A sustainable enterprise
    is one that continues to grow and adapt in order to meet the needs and expectations
    of its shareholders and stakeholders. (The enterprise system is a component of
    the overall socio-economic system.) (iii) A sustainable product (or service) is
    one that continues, possibly with design modifications, to meet the needs of its
    producers, distributors, and customers. (The product system is a component of
    the overall enterprise system.) The above definitions imply that social responsibility
    is a characteristic of the enterprise, not of the product or service, and requires
    continuous adaptation to ensure transparency and responsiveness to the changing
    needs of stakeholders. Ecological integrity and quality of life, however, are
    often influenced by characteristics of a product or service and thus can be addressed
    through sustainable design principles. Finally, sustainable development, in the
    sense of addressing the needs of future generations, can only be addressed meaningfully
    at the level of a collective society. Individual products or enterprises cannot
    be deemed sustainable in isolation, although they can make important contributions
    to the fulfillment of specific human needs. Nor can corpora tions alone be held
    accountable for sustainable developmentsupply and demand are coupled. Achieving
    a sustainable society will require cooperative efforts among industry, government,
    and public interest groups to ensure not only sustainable production systems but
    also sustainable consumption patterns on the part of individuals and institutions
    ( 15). In effect, product/service systems are the offspring of corporations and
    acquire important characteristics from their “parents” including branding, technology,
    distribution chan nels, and stakeholder perception. Today, corporations are increasingly
    expected to disclose the origins of products, including raw materials, and the
    conditions under which they were manufactured. Do they employ forced labor or
    child labor? Do they utilize recycled material content or renewable energy? Were
    chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in the manufacturing process? Do they contain
    genetically engineered constituents? As we broaden the scope of product/service
    design, we inevitably begin to consider the higher-order characteristics of the
    systems in which they are embedded. Resilience and Sustainability ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To Systems theory is the study of how complex entities interact openly with their
    environments and evolve continually by acquiring new, “emergent” properties (
    16). Rather than reducing an entity (e.g., the human body) to the properties of
    its parts or elements (e.g., organs or cells), systems theory focuses on the relationships
    (e.g., feedback loops) between the parts that connect them into a whole. It turns
    out that many system properties are independent of the concrete substance of their
    elements (e.g. particles, cells, transistors, people). Complex systems are generally
    dynamic, nonlinear, and capable of self-organization to sustain their existence.
    For example, by pollinating flowers, bees create a feedback loop that reinforces
    the production of nectar. Similarly, by supporting social and philanthropic activities,
    corporations strengthen the vitality of the communities to which their employees
    belong. By the laws of thermodynamics, closed systems will gradually decay from
    order into chaos, tending toward maximum entropy. However, living systems are
    “open” in the sense that they continually draw upon external sources of energy
    and maintain a stable state of low entropy that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium
    ( 17). Perhaps the essence of sustainability is resilience, the ability to resist
    disorder ( 18). Figure 2 provides a simplified illustration of thermodynamic changes
    that characterize different types of resilience. Each system has a stable state
    representing the lowest potential energy at which it maintains order, and each
    is subject to perturbations that shift it along a trajectory of adjacent states.
    Figure 2 Examples of system behavior. (i) System a is typical of engineered, highly
    controlled systems. It operates within a narrow band of possible states and is
    designed to resist perturbations from its equilibrium state. It recovers rapidly
    from small perturbations, but it may not survive a large perturbation. We call
    this a resistant system. (ii) System b is typical of social and ecological systems.
    It can function across a broad spectrum of possible states and gradually tends
    to return to its equilibrium state. Through adaptation and evolution, it is capable
    of surviving large perturbations. We call this a resilient system. (iii) System
    c is even more resilient than system b in that it can tolerate larger perturbations.
    Under certain conditions it may shift to a different equilibrium state, representing
    a fundamental change in its structure and/or function. The contrast between resistant
    and resilient systems is exemplified by China and India, both sophisticated civiliza
    tions that have flourished for centuries. Whereas China has tended to resist foreign
    influences and preserve homogeneity of language and religion, India has accepted
    and integrated foreign influences into a diverse tapestry of religious and cultural
    variants. The concept of resilience and its applicability to ecological, social,
    and management systems has been investigated extensively by an international group
    of researchers led by two noted ecologists, Lance Gunderson and C. S. Holling.
    They have developed a general theory of adaptive cycles, arguing that all systems
    exhibit similar patterns of slow accumulation of resources, increasing connectedness,
    and decreasing resilience, punctuated by periods of crisis, transformation, and
    renewal ( 19). Based on an understanding of these patterns, humans may be able
    to intervene in appropriate ways that take advantage of the system dynamics rather
    than merely resisting change. Applying Resilience to System Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To The design of engineered systems, including both hardware and software, has
    been approached traditionally as a process of hierarchical decomposition (i.e.,
    the overall system func tion and architecture are developed first and then the
    systems and subsystems are designed accordingly). Complex, hierarchically organized
    systems (e.g., aircraft, nuclear plants) tend to have rigid operating parameters,
    are resistant to stress only within narrow boundaries, and may be vulnerable to
    small, unforeseen perturbations. Alternatively, distributed systems composed of
    independent yet interactive elements may deliver equivalent or better functionality
    with greater resilience. For example: (i) A collection of distributed electric
    generators (e.g., fuel cells) connected to a power grid may be more reliable and
    fault-tolerant than a central power station. (ii) A swarm of miniature unmanned
    surveillance drones may be less costly and more robust than a single conventional
    surveillance aircraft. (iii) A network of autonomous software agents operating
    asynchronously may be more effective and speedier than a monolithic software program.
    (iv) A geographically dispersed workforce linked by telecommunications may be
    less vulnerable to catastrophic events that could destroy a single facility. While
    such distributed systems may not always represent a superior solution, they typify
    a novel approach to systems engineering, sometimes called “biomimicry”, that more
    closely resembles the patterns seen in living systems ( 20). In addition to mimicking
    nature, system designers need to be aware of their impacts upon nature. It is
    often said that “nature is resilient”. Some argue that we should not impose unreasonable
    regulatory burdens upon industrial activities since we cannot predict their impacts
    upon complex ecosystems. Indeed, many regulatory restrictions are based on admittedly
    inadequate methodologies, such as the models used for extrapolating from laboratory
    studies to predict human cancer incidence due to chemical exposures. These models
    use “conservative” assumptions intended to overstate the true risk. In some cases,
    this precautionary approach may impose economic burdens that distort the economy.
    In other cases, the models fail to account for phenomena such as multi-pollutant
    synergies and may actually understate the risk. Similarly, the worldwide elimination
    of CFCs was undertaken without a clear understanding of the their impacts upon
    atmospheric ozone. Scientists may never be able to predict accurately the impacts
    of perturbations upon biological or ecological systems. The emergent properties
    of open systems give them the capacity to tolerate perturbations and to evolve
    into new, unimagined forms. However, it is possible to explore the properties
    of both natural and engineered systems that make them more or less resilient.
    As shown in Table 1, there are several key characteristics of living systems that
    can also be extended to industrial systems. For example, it is commonly argued
    among ecologists that a decrease in biodiversity will tend to reduce ecosystem
    stability ( 21). As mentioned earlier, a similar observation was made in the Shell
    study of corporate longevitya decrease in managerial diversity reduces a company''s
    ability to survive upheavals. Table 1.  Characteristics of Resilient Systems   diversity

    1 identifies four major system characteristics that contribute to resilience and
    interprets them in the context of the nested systems discussed earlier. These
    characteristics are as follows: (i) Diversityexistence of multiple forms and behaviors;
    (ii) Efficiencyperformance with modest resource consumption; (iii) Adaptabilityflexibility
    to change in response to new pressures; (iv) Cohesionexistence of unifying forces
    or linkages. An understanding of system resilience becomes important when significant
    disruptions or discontinuities occur that shift the system away from its current
    equilibrium state. Such disruptions could include the introduction of new technolo
    gies, the emergence of new regulatory and market forces, or changes in the availability
    of resources. For example, will the broad introduction of low-cost electronic
    devices in developing nations create an excessive flow of post-consumer wastes,
    and how will local governments respond? Some believe that emerging sustainability
    issues will catalyze innovations that will change the basis of competition in
    many industries ( 22). Those that wish to reap the benefits of these changes must
    also be alert to the riskscomplex systems may be vulnerable to small, unforeseen
    perturbations that cause catastrophic failures. Already, practitioners of enterprise
    risk management are beginning to adopt resilience concepts as a way to “withstand
    systemic discontinuities and adapt to new risk environments” ( 23). There are
    numerous instances of system design practices that have contributed to sustainability
    improvements, especially with regard to ecological issues. For example: (i) Sustainable
    Building Systems. Many architects and engineers have embraced the concepts of
    “green” or sustainable buildings. According to the U.S. Department of Energy,
    buildings consume about 33% of all the energy used in the United States and 66%
    of all electricity, thus accounting for about 35% of all carbon dioxide emissions
    ( 24). Examples of sustainable design practices include energy efficiency, use
    of local materials, respect for natural surroundings, utilization of ecological
    services (e.g., heating and cooling), and sensitivity to human well-being ( 25).
    Apart from the obvious energy and environmental benefits, studies suggest that
    sustainable buildings also improve employee satisfaction and productivity ( 26).
    The LEED protocol, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is widely used
    to evaluate environmental performance from a “whole building” perspective over
    a building''s life cycle. At a higher system level, a number of academic and research
    institutions, such as University of California at Berkeley, have developed plans
    and guidelines for sustainable campuses. (ii) Sustainable Process Systems. Over
    the past decade, the field of process systems engineering has gradually expanded
    from a traditional focus on process technology and economics to incorporate sustainability
    issues such as process safety and environmental emissions ( 27). The synergy between
    process performance and sustainability is well captured in the concept of eco-efficiency,
    which measures the value produced as output per unit of resource input ( 28).
    Reductions in labor intensity, energy consumption, process hazards, and waste
    generation tend to translate into lower capital requirements, lower economic risks,
    and lower operating and maintenance costs. New technologies such as process intensification
    and microreactors have demonstrated the potential for order of magnitude increases
    in process yield and capital productivity. At the same time, significant advances
    have occurred in the field of green chemistry, also known as sustainable chemistry,
    which seeks new pathways and catalysts for environmentally benign chemical synthesis
    and processing ( 29). For example, Dow Chemical and other companies are using
    novel processing methods to convert renewable biomass (e.g., soybeans, corn, cellulose)
    into useful materials such as adhesives and plasticizers. (iii) Sustainable Supply
    Chain Systems. Products such as automobiles and computers, which involve a series
    of discrete manufacturing and assembly processes along the supply chain, can generate
    a significant ecological footprint in terms of material, energy, and land use
    as well as industrial wastes and emissions. Manufacturers such as General Motors
    and HP have utilized a variety of “design for environment” techniques ( 30) to
    reduce the resource intensity of their manufacturing and logistical systems. These
    techniques include simplifying product architecture to reduce the number of distinct
    parts and assembly operations (which also enables easier maintenance and disassembly);
    utilizing recycled materials or refurbished components; avoiding substances with
    undesirable properties such as carcinogenicity, toxicity, flammability, ozone
    depletion, or environmental persistence; reducing electrical and thermal energy
    use through process modifications or transportation ef ficiency (e.g., improved
    product geometry for pallet loading); utilizing quality improvement and “lean”
    manufacturing techniques (e.g., just-in-time inventory replenishment) to reduce
    work-in-process and scrap; and collaborating with customers and suppliers to streamline
    the supply chain and minimize waste. (iv) Sustainable Product Life Cycle Systems.
    Some companies have begun to look beyond the supply chain that they control and
    consider the full life cycles of their products and services, including resource
    extraction, procurement, transportation, manufacturing, product use, service,
    and end-of-life disposition or asset recovery (see Figure 1). For example, BASF
    Corp. has adopted a new eco-efficiency analysis tool to help identify products
    and processes that consume less energy and generate less waste than alternatives
    while maintaining or improving the products'' commercial value ( 31). The tool
    has been applied to over 100 different products and processes such as asphalt
    microsurfacing, nylon fiber, building materials, automotive coatings, plastics,
    and adhesives. The resulting analyses have influenced BASF business decisions
    regarding capital investments, production techniques, acquisitions, and product
    positioning. BASF''s methodology combines assessment of life cycle ecological
    impacts (including raw material and energy consumption, air and water emissions,
    and potential health risks) with an economic analysis of life cycle costs. Economic
    and ecological data are then plotted on a graph, revealing the eco-efficiency
    of a product or process as compared to competing products and processes. (v) Sustainable
    Industrial Networks. Companies working in isolation may achieve incremental improvements
    in addressing sustainability issues; however, a more powerful approach is for
    companies to collectively optimize their activities as part of an industrial ecology
    network. Stated simply, industrial ecology is a framework for transforming industrial
    systems from a linear model to a closed-loop model that resembles the cyclical
    flows of ecosystems, in which one creature''s waste becomes another creature''s
    nutrients ( 32). Rather than exporting industrial and consumer wastes for disposition
    outside the system, industrial ecology suggests elimination of the very concept
    of waste by designing innovative pathways for conversion of wastes into useful
    byproducts. The scope of the “system” then encompasses all participating companies
    as well as the natural environment in which they operate. Simple examples are
    common:  cement manufacturers incinerate contaminated wastes in cement kilns as
    a substitute for fossil fuel, effectively reducing global warming emissions; electric
    utilities recycle fly ash from their boilers for blending into cement and capture
    waste heat for local applications; electronic equipment recyclers recover parts
    and materials from discarded devices and recycle them into a variety of secondary
    uses. A more advanced example of industrial ecology is a complex at Kalundborg,
    Denmark, where “symbiotic” relationships have developed among several large facilities
    and a host of smaller ones. The main partners are a coal-fired power plant, a
    refinery, a plasterboard factory, and a pharmaceutical and enzyme plant operated
    by Novo Nordisk ( 33). The main focus of the above design efforts has been upon
    a particular system characteristicecological efficiency. It is likely that companies
    will discover additional opportunities for value creation by expanding their scope
    to include other dimensions of Table 1 (i.e., finding ways to enhance the diversity,
    adaptability, and cohesion of engineered systems and the related systems with
    which they interact). A Generalized Approach to Sustainable System Design ARTICLE
    SECTIONSJump To Among the vast range of systems that we encounter, there are many
    well-bounded systems that are truly “designed”. Clothing, appliances, aircraft,
    and buildings, for example, are designed and then manufactured or assembled through
    a rigorously controlled series of processes. On the other hand, we participate
    in social and ecological systems that are not at all designed; yet we can still
    design policies and interven tions that influence the system behavior and evolution.
    The latter case typifies virtually all of our environmental protection effortswe
    introduce changes such as soil remediation, pollution reduction, reforestation,
    or streamflow diversion in an effort to enhance the health of the overall ecosystem.
    Controlled design is the dominant focus of the product and process development
    community, and companies have made huge investments in design technology in order
    to improve the creativity, quality, and speed of system development. For example,
    the system acquisition processes utilized by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
    engage dozens of organizations in a controlled design effort that encompasses
    the full life cycle of military systems. Inevitably, such efforts turn out to
    have unforeseen, inadvertent impacts upon related systems. For example, the DoD
    is currently examining the sustainability of domestic artillery test ranges in
    terms of their impacts upon surrounding communities, an issue that was overlooked
    for many years. The unforeseen secondary impacts of system design may be trivial
    or profound. For example, in the case of automotive design: (i) A structural design
    change that improves vehicle performance may have virtually no significant secondary
    impacts; (ii) A change in the materials of construction may have substantial impacts
    on economic and ecological systems within the manufacturer''s supply chain; (iii)
    A new engine design may have not only supply chain impacts but also economic,
    environmental and social impacts that affect entire markets. Thus, certain design
    decisions may constitute interven tions in broader systems. From this perspective,
    “green engineering” and “design for environment” are efforts to anticipate and
    consider broader ecological system impacts within a controlled design process.
    More generally, “design for sustainability” represents an effort to consider both
    environmental and socio-economic systems. We cannot design a perfect natural environment
    or an ideal society, but we can try to modify the controllable characteristics
    of our designed artifacts (e.g., factories, products) in ways that create environmental
    and social benefits. Individual companies, especially market leaders, can exert
    powerful influences through such system interventions. Regulatory agencies can
    also exert powerful influences, but a more promising approach is collaborative
    partnerships whereby industry, government, and other interested parties jointly
    design interventions for the benefit of society. Without such partnerships, well-intentioned
    efforts may go awry; for example, airborne emissions might merely be shifted to
    waterborne effluents elsewhere in the supply chain, or the distribution of risks
    and benefits among workers and consumers might be inequitable. Perhaps the most
    ambitious example of collective system intervention is the worldwide effort to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To encourage systems design that incorporates
    sustain ability thinking explicitly, it is useful to have a systematic protocol.
    Consideration of related (parent or sibling) systems and their resilience can
    be accomplished through an expan sion of existing design protocols, as illustrated
    in Figure 3. At one extreme, if there are no important interactions anticipated
    with related systems, the protocol reduces to a standard “stage-gate” development
    process, commonly used in industry. At the other extreme, the external interactions
    may be so significant that the majority of the design effort is spent trying to
    understand related systems, including impacts and boundary constraints. Each of
    the steps in Figure 3 is described below. Figure 3 Expanded design protocol including
    system considerations. Defining System Function and Boundaries ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To The sustainable mobility problem mentioned at the begin ning of this paper
    illustrates the difficulty of establishing the scope for a system design effort.
    Every open system interacts with its environment and, hence, is part of a larger
    system. Carried to the extreme, this type of reasoning leads to the “Gaia hypothesis”,
    which claims that the world is a single giant organism ( 34). This is not a very
    helpful perspective if one is trying to design an electronic appliance. However,
    a more practical application of systems thinking is to consider the related systems
    in which a design artifact is embeddedliterally thinking outside the box. This
    may lead to surprising innovations. For example, the development of a telephone-answering
    device might be seen from several alternative related system perspectives: (i)
    It is part of a home system from the consumer use perspective and can become a
    network appliance as well a communication device. (ii) It is part of a material
    flow system from a supply chain perspective and can become a source of reusable
    components at end-of-life. (iii) It is an enabling technology from a developing
    economy perspective and can serve as an element of an entrepreneurial communication
    service business. It follows that one of the most important steps in system design
    is establishing a clear, practical definition of the function and boundaries of
    “the system”. For example, are we creating a voice recording device, a telephone-answering
    system, or a voice mail service? Are we designing a physical device, a human interface,
    or a total solution delivery system? Depending on the system scope, the design
    methodology and technological options can vary greatly. A common way to define
    systems, for purposes of customer value analysis and life cycle analysis of competing
    designs, is in terms of a unit of functional value. In the above example, the
    functional unit chosen might be a “message capture event” including both recording
    and playback. Then alternative designs could be analyzed in terms of cost, reliability,
    ease of use, and resource efficiency per message capture event. A good illustration
    of how system boundaries become broadened is in the field of industrial carpeting,
    which surprisingly has become a hotbed of sustainable design. Collins & Aikman
    Floorcoverings (now part of Tandus Group) has developed a closed-loop recovery
    process whereby customers return their carpet with assurance that 100% of it will
    be recycled into new carpet. Another industry leader, Interface, has pledged to
    offset the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its floorcovering products with
    investments in GHG reduction projects such as installing energy-efficient boilers
    and lighting in public schools or planting trees that absorb greenhouse gases.
    Developing System Requirements ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In systems engineering,
    requirements definition and management has traditionally focused on observable
    product characteristics such as cost, structure (e.g., size, geometry), and functional
    performance. A requirement can be defined as a set of testable conditions applicable
    to products or processes ( 35). The conditions may be represented in various forms,
    ranging from qualitative statements (e.g., “system shall shut down when left idle”)
    to quantitative metrics (e.g., power rating). Testing of requirements typically
    involves some human interpretation, and the broader the scope of the system, the
    more difficult it becomes to apply definitive tests. The requirements management
    process generally consists of three main functions that are performed in an iterative
    fashion: (i) Requirements analysis involves interpreting customer needs and deriving
    explicit, verifiable requirements. (ii) Requirements tracking involves analysis
    of design tradeoffs, including project risk, schedule, cost constraints, and performance
    goals. A traceability hierarchy is frequently used to keep track of changes in
    system and subsystem requirements. (iii) Requirements verification involves determining
    whether a system design will meet the specified requirements. The earlier verification
    can be performed, the more likely it is that gaps or flaws will be detected before
    a large investment is made. To incorporate sustainability issues, as shown in
    Figure 3, system requirements definition should take into account the boundary
    conditions derived from related systems. This may require thinking beyond the
    usual supply chain considerations to consider the broader industrial and social
    context. For example, recent European Union directives are requiring both electronics
    and automotive manufacturers to take responsibility for end-of-life vehicle recovery,
    stimulating reconsideration of the design assumptions for systems and their components.
    Another recent trend is the interest of multi-national companies such as Dow,
    HP, and Procter & Gamble in addressing the large, heretofore untapped markets
    at the bottom of the economic pyramid ( 36). They have found that designing products
    as well as marketing and distribution systems to serve low-income populations
    in developing nations requires a deep understanding of local conditions, resources,
    and behavior patterns. For example, in India, consumables such as detergent can
    now be purchased in one-cent single-serving pouches made of biodegradable plastic.
    The life cycle issues that need to be emphasized in requirements definition vary
    greatly across different industries. Natural resource extraction industries such
    as mining, oil production, agriculture, and forest products might emphasize appropriate
    land use, ecosystem protection, and worker safety. Industries farther downstream
    in the supply chain such as petroleum refining, metals, chemicals, and electric
    utilities might emphasize process safety, conversion efficiency, and waste minimization.
    Industries close to the end-customer such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals,
    automotive, and electronics might emphasize environmentally conscious packaging
    (for consumable products), end-of-life recovery (for durable products), and responsiveness
    to social needs. Finally, service industries such as transportation, communication,
    and retailing might emphasize efficient logistics, product certification (e.g.,
    lumber), and human resource development. To develop sustainability requirements,
    it is helpful to consider a “mental map” of human needs, presented in Figure 4.
    Basic survival needs are associated with the physical realm, while higher-order
    needs are associated with the socio-economic realm. These two realms are closely
    intertwined, with energy needs playing a pivotal rolein fact, energy is the one
    essential input for all living systems. The current status of these needs, including
    significant gaps, may provide boundary conditions for system design; for example,
    in a region with severe water shortages, industrial depletion of water should
    be avoided. Practically speaking, the needs of society must be clarified and prioritized
    through stakeholder engagement, including a dialogue among corporations, government
    policy-makers, and public interest groups. Thus, there is no universal set of
    performance conditions that defines sustainability, even within a particular industry.
    Figure 4 present and future human needs. This ambiguity may be perplexing to a
    system designer accustomed to having performance-based requirements. For example,
    one might intuitively believe that a “zero-emission” factory was a worthwhile
    goal. Yet the technologies required to reduce plant emissions to zero might be
    both complex and costly. Instead, a combination of throughput reduction and partial
    conversion of wastes to useful byproducts might result in a superior environmental
    profile for the larger economic system in which the plant operates. Furthermore,
    a business strategy that encourages diversity in adjacent industrial development
    might create additional markets for waste materials. Selecting Technologies and
    Creating a Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Recent innovations in genomics, materials
    science, nanosystems, and information technology can contribute directly to sustainability
    by increasing the efficiency and adaptability of existing products and processes.
    For example, increased use of electronic communication and information storage
    may reduce the need for physical transportation and record-keeping, although we
    have yet to achieve a “paperless office”. DuPont, for one, encourages its businesses
    to substitute intellectual capital for physical capital by measuring product performance
    in terms of shareholder value per pound of product sold. However, there are hidden
    tradeoffs to consider. Systems that are smaller, faster, cheaper, and more flexible
    may actually have a larger environmental footprint than their bulkier, slower
    predecessors. In the semiconductor industry, for example, the precision manufacture
    of a tiny microchip consumes large amounts of energy and materials ( 37). Nanosystem
    production may prove even more resource-intensive, and some scientists are concerned
    about the potential hazards associated with inhalation of nanoparticles. Due to
    such system-level considerations, no technology can be deemed intrinsically sustainable.
    Renewable or bio-based materials are not necessarily preferable to inorganic materials.
    Recycled materials are not necessarily preferable to virgin materials. Biodegradable
    materials are not necessarily preferable to durable materials since industrial
    ecology networks may recycle spent materials into new applications. It all depends
    on the system boundaries and requirements. The system design process itself is
    undergoing consider able evolution ( 38). Traditional, hierarchical design has
    proved cumbersome and “brittle” in the sense that a single deviation can disrupt
    the entire process. Many organizations are experimenting with new techniques such
    as cooperative, distributed, asynchronous design. Again, this approach is patterned
    after the self-organizing behavior of living systems. Through advanced communication
    and groupware technologies, design teams can be distributed geographically and
    share their ideas and progress via interactive computer displays. For design of
    complex systems, the ability to iterate rapidly is especially important since
    design teams need to assess the robustness of alternative designs under a variety
    of different scenarios and assumptions. In the automotive industry, for example,
    it is common for the major automakers to co-locate design engineers from their
    principal “Tier 1” suppliers together with their in-house design teams, enabling
    a tightly integrated development process. As mentioned earlier, the design of
    sustainable systems may benefit from including requirements that address inherent
    resilience. Characteristics such as diversity and adaptability may not have an
    obvious relationship to system performance but may contribute to the system''s
    longevity and ultimate success. For example, vehicle designers have increasingly
    stressed adaptability issues such as reliability and maintainability under extreme
    conditions, which influ ence both life cycle performance and cost of ownership.
    Sometimes the greatest resilience is achieved through design simplicity, which
    reduces the chances of unexpected failure or disruption. Evaluating System Performance
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To A key part of any iterative system development effort
    is evaluating the anticipated performance of a partially or fully completed design.
    In many industries this evaluation process is supported by automated tools, known
    as computer-aided design and manufacture (CAD/CAM), which can perform highly detailed
    simulations before the system is ever built. Boeing, for example, has honed this
    approach to the point that its engineers can design a complete aircraft without
    ever physically building and testing a prototype. However, as the design focus
    shifts from form and function to the impact on related systems, the evaluation
    task becomes immensely more challenging. Theoretical computer simula tions can
    be performed to model interventions in biological organisms, ecosystems, or socio-economic
    systems, but we can seldom ensure their validity. One alternative approach is
    life-cycle assessment, a systematic method for identifying and quantifying the
    environmental burdens associated with the life cycle of a product or process (
    39). The approach has also been extended to support life cycle cost accounting
    ( 40). A life cycle inventory can be used to profile the system-wide energy and
    material consumption and waste generation in terms of flows per functional unit.
    Life cycle impact assessment attempts to evaluate the actual significance of these
    flows in terms of human effects and ecosystem perturbations, although uncertainties
    abound. Despite data quality issues, life cycle methods can be useful for relative
    comparisons of alternative system design options, thus supporting business decisions.
    Other evaluation methods include integrative modeling approaches such as systems
    dynamics that attempt to characterize system behavior and anticipate potential
    evolutionary paths ( 41). For example, recent applications of generalized economic
    equilibrium models have been helpful in projecting the impacts of different energy
    technologies upon global climate change ( 42). However, such models cannot be
    predictive in the classical sense and are often controversial. Recognizing the
    scientific challenges of integrated system evaluation, the National Science Foundation
    has initiated a program in biocomplexity, which addresses “the dynamic web of
    often surprising interrelationships that arise when components of the global ecosystembiological,
    physical, chemical, and the human dimensioninteract” ( 43). The needed linkages
    among the natural, social, and mathematical science disciplines are still at an
    embryonic stage. The usual objective of system evaluation is to quantify selected
    performance indicators that portray the consequences of design choices. Although
    integrated modeling is not always feasible, the identification of such indicators
    can be extremely helpful. Even in the absence of quantitative models, it may be
    possible to develop subjective or qualitative assessments of the directional impacts
    on key indicators. Table 2 provides example of sustainability indicators that
    have commonly been used to characterize the performance outcomes of system design
    or system intervention ( 44). The Global Reporting Initiative has developed a
    more exhaustive catalog of performance indicators as part of its guideline for
    sustainability reporting ( 45). Table 2.  Examples of Conventional Sustainability

    is important to assess not only performance outcomes but also the intrinsic characteristics
    that contribute to system resilience. Recent studies of energy flows in ecological
    and industrial systems suggest that new, more elegant, sustainability indicators
    may be developed based on thermodynamic analysis. For example, it has been conjectured
    that systems with lower entropy (i.e., higher degree of order) will have a larger
    life cycle impact on their surroundings ( 46). Calculation of exergy (useful energy)
    appears to offer a promising method for comparative assessment of the ecological
    efficiency associated with industrial processes ( 47). Planning System Deployment
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The final step in system design is the development of
    a plan for the release, introduction, and deployment of the system. In the past,
    product development teams often released their specifications to the manufacturing
    organization without considering downstream issues associated with component procurement,
    product distribution, customer support, maintenance, waste disposition, and potential
    upgrades of the original design. The introduction of “simultaneous engineer ing”
    methods and more rigorous stage-gate reviews has helped to shift these considerations
    back into the design process, thus avoiding delays and unnecessary costs. However,
    the question of broader system impacts is still poorly understood, and it is rare
    for design teams to consider them explicitly. Companies wishing to pursue sustainable
    system design have a strong motivation to consider the broad implications of an
    innovative system upon all of the enterprise stakehold ers. Each stakeholder group
    will be touched by the system in different ways and will have their own particular
    expecta tions. For example, employees expect the system to be safe and easy to
    operate. Shareholders expect the system to streamline existing operations and
    provide an improved return on an investment. Customers expect efficacy and convenience.
    Public interest organizations expect environmental and social benefits. To understand
    and manage all of these expectations, it is critical for the company to engage
    with its stakeholders, understand their concerns, and develop mutual trust so
    that the system can be introduced success fully. Indeed, the design team should
    begin considering the deployment phase as early as possible. The importance of
    stakeholder engagement is evident in the life sciences field, where companies
    are developing a host of biotechnology-based products that they claim will enable
    a shift to sustainable agriculture. One class of these new agricultural products
    is genetically engineered pest-resistant crops. Proponents claim that this technology
    will reduce pesticide use, increase agricultural productivity, and lower consumer
    costs, while opponents are concerned about unforeseen health and environmental
    impacts ( 48). An open dialogue among interested parties is necessary to establish
    agreement on the value of these products and the appropriate technical, legal,
    and ethical conditions for their use. History has shown that it is wise for designers
    to consider not only the product technology but also the socio-economic system
    into which it will be introduced. The need to consider the broader systems context
    is especially great in developing nations, where agriculture is often central
    to the indigenous culture. An example is wet rice cultivation in Bali, Indonesia,
    whose hills are covered with graceful, terraced rice paddies. The rural Balinese
    lifestyle represents a harmonious equilibrium between society and nature that
    has persisted for centuries. Rice has long been the island''s most important crop
    and is deeply embedded in the Balinese social structure. Village life centers
    around a rice growing association called a subak, which organizes community work
    on irrigation and cultivation systems. Festivals and religious rituals are intertwined
    with the rice planting, growing, and harvesting seasons. Thus, no matter how promising
    a new technology may be, any effort to modify the practice of rice growing must
    begin with a thorough understanding of the ecological and social boundary condi
    tions ( 49). Conclusion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To This paper has provided but a
    glimpse of the challenges encountered as system design moves from the bounded,
    controllable scope of traditional products and services to the boundaryless, unpredictable
    realm of industrial, ecologi cal, and social systems. The increasing connectedness
    of these systems creates new opportunities but also exposes society to greater
    risks. Economic threats such as the collapse of markets, political threats such
    as military aggression, biological threats such as mutant viruses, or ecological
    threats such as global warming have become the concern of all nations. Moreover,
    system complexity keeps increasingserious proposals are being raised for development
    of sustainable systems on a much larger scale, such as entire cities or regions
    ( 50). The classic reductionist tools that served so well in a simpler age are
    no longer adequate. Complex, nonlinear systems cannot be modeled by linking together
    a fragmented collection of linear models. What is needed is a new language and
    new metaphors to describe the relation ships and dynamic behaviors that characterize
    these exquisitely complex systemsa new, multi-disciplinary toolkit that begins
    with connectivity and integration as fundamental themes rather than afterthoughts.
    Einstein reputedly said, “Individuality is an illusion created by skin”. Indeed,
    separateness is a convenient assumption that enables the analysis of objects,
    people, or companies as if they were independent of their surroundings. However,
    in practice, this assumption is invalid. System design should proceed with a constant
    awareness of related systems, boundary conditions, external effects, and potential
    feedback loops. As design teams continually expand the system boundary, they will
    need to address new technical challenges in creative ways, for example: (i) Requirements
    will include system behaviors rather than just outcomes; (ii) Predictive modeling
    will give way to exploratory scenario building; (iii) Design strategies will rely
    upon intervention rather than control; (iv) Robustness will be achieved through
    resilience rather than resistance; (v) Risk management will draw upon new concepts
    such as adaptivity and diversity; (vi) System state indicators will be based on
    fundamental energy attributes. The resilience perspective has important implications
    for companies that wish to become more sustainable. It is not sufficient for a
    company to redesign only those systems that it fully controls. At best, this will
    result in incremental changes that do no harm but do not create substantial benefits
    either for the enterprise or for society. Instead, companies that wish to ensure
    their long-term resilience must reach beyond their own boundaries, develop an
    understanding of the intricate systems in which they participate, and strive for
    continuous innovation and renewal. In this broader playing field, the rules are
    different:  Strategic adaptation becomes more important than strategic planning,
    and decision makers need to embrace uncertainty rather than trying to eliminate
    it. As stated in a recent Harvard Business Review article: Any company that can
    make sense of its environment, generate strategic options, and re-align its resources
    faster than its rivals will enjoy a decisive advantage. This is the essence of
    resilience ( 51). The history of technological progress has emphasized the conquest
    of nature, using brute force and standardization to overcome nature''s infinite
    diversity ( 52). Today, scientists and engineers are learning from nature, discovering
    patterns that they can apply for the benefit of both humans and the environment.
    In business as in science, the old Newtonian view of an orderly, machine-like
    world is giving way to a new view of a chaotic, evolving world. Designing systems
    that are inherently resilient will support our collective quest for sustainability
    in this ever-changing, unpredictable universe. Author Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump

    \ turned into proﬁtable decisions only when eﬃciently\nmanaged. Current advances\
    \ in data management are making Smart Farming grow exponentially\nas data have\
    \ become the key element in modern agriculture to help producers with critical\n\
    decision-making. Valuable advantages appear with objective information acquired\
    \ through sensors\nwith the aim of maximizing productivity and sustainability.\
    \ This kind of data-based managed farms\nrely on data that can increase eﬃciency\
    \ by avoiding the misuse of resources and the pollution of\nthe environment. Data-driven\
    \ agriculture, with the help of robotic solutions incorporating artiﬁcial\nintelligent\
    \ techniques, sets the grounds for the sustainable agriculture of the future.\
    \ This paper\nreviews the current status of advanced farm management systems by\
    \ revisiting each crucial step,\nfrom data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to variable\
    \ rate applications, so that growers can make optimized\ndecisions to save money\
    \ while protecting the environment and transforming how food will be\nproduced\
    \ to sustainably match the forthcoming population growth.\nKeywords: agriculture\

    \ technology (VRT); AI\n1. Introduction\nThe agriculture sector is undergoing\
    \ a transformation driven by new technologies, which seems\nvery promising as\
    \ it will enable this primary sector to move to the next level of farm productivity\n\
    and proﬁtability [1]. Precision Agriculture, which consist of applying inputs\
    \ (what is needed) when\nand where is needed, has become the third wave of the\
    \ modern agriculture revolution (the ﬁrst was\nmechanization and the second the\
    \ green revolution with its genetic modiﬁcation [2]), and nowadays,\nit is being\
    \ enhanced with an increase of farm knowledge systems due to the availability\
    \ of larger\namounts of data. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ already reported in October\n2016 that Precision Agriculture technologies increased\
    \ net returns and operating proﬁts [3]. Also,\nwhen considering the environment,\
    \ new technologies are increasingly being applied in the farms\nto maintain the\
    \ sustainability of farm production. However, the adoption of these technologies\n\
    involves uncertainty and trade-oﬀs. According to a market analysis, the factors\
    \ that would facilitate\nthe adoption of sustainable farming technologies include\
    \ better education and training of farmers,\nsharing of information, easy availability\
    \ of ﬁnancial resources, and increasing consumer demand\nfor organic food [4].\
    \ When applying these new technologies, the challenge for retrieving data from\n\
    crops is to come out with something coherent and valuable, because data themselves\
    \ are not useful,\njust numbers or images. Farms that decide to be technology-driven\
    \ in some way, show valuable\nadvantages, such us saving money and work, having\
    \ an increased production or a reduction of costs\nwith minimal eﬀort, and producing\
    \ quality food with more environmentally friendly practices [5].\nHowever, taking\
    \ these advantages to the farm will depend, not only on the willingness of producers\n\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n2 of 21\nfor adopting new technologies in their ﬁelds,\
    \ but also on each speciﬁc farm potential in terms of scale\neconomies, as proﬁt\
    \ margin increases with farm size. The USDA reported that, on average, corn\n\
    farm operating proﬁt of Precision Agriculture adopters was 163 dollars per hectare\
    \ higher than for\nnon-adopters, taking into account that the highest adoption\
    \ rates for three technologies (computer\nmapping, guidance, and variable-rate\
    \ equipment) were on farms over 1500 hectares [3]. Such margins\ncan even go up\
    \ to 272 dollars depending on the crop. A greater use of Smart Farming services\
    \ is vital\nto not only improving a farm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet\
    \ the food needs of an expanding\npopulation [6].\nThe ﬁnal purpose of this paper\
    \ is to demonstrate how making decisions with the modern\ndata-based agriculture\
    \ available today can lead to sustainable and proﬁtable actuation to nourish\n\
    people while reducing harm to the environment. In order to evaluate how modern\
    \ agriculture can help\nin a sustainable decision-making process, this article\
    \ revisits the main steps of an information-based\nagriculture and focuses on\
    \ data management systems by reviewing recent applications related to each\ncrucial\
    \ step, from data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to the execution of tasks with variable\
    \ rate equipment.\n2. Data-Driven Agriculture: Agriculture 4.0\nThis new philosophy\
    \ centered on agricultural data has been expressed with several names:\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0, Digital Farming, or Smart Farming, and was born when telematics and data\
    \ management\nwere combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture,\
    \ improving the accuracy of\noperations [7]. As a result, Agriculture 4.0 is based\
    \ on Precision Agriculture principles with producers\nusing systems that generate\
    \ data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper\n\
    strategical and operational decisions. Traditionally, farmers have gone to the\
    \ ﬁelds to check the status\nof their crops and make decisions based on their\
    \ accumulated experience. This approach is no longer\nsustainable as, among other\
    \ reasons, some ﬁelds are too large to be eﬃciently managed according to\nthe\
    \ threefold criteria that will lead the coming years: Eﬃciency, sustainability\
    \ and availability (for\npeople). Advanced management systems within the context\
    \ of Smart Farming are providing practical\nsolutions. Also, despite some farmers\
    \ have a long-time experience gathered after many years of work\nin the ﬁeld,\
    \ technology may provide a systematic tool to detect unforeseen problems hard\
    \ to notice\nby visual inspection on occasional checks. Regarding the willingness\
    \ of adopting modern tools in\nagriculture, young farmers show a more positive\
    \ attitude than elder ones, as the former can support\ntheir not-so-large experience\
    \ in the ﬁeld with new smart tools providing key information. However,\nthe average\
    \ age of farmers in the last decades has been alarmingly increasing: Around 58\
    \ years old in\nthe USA and Europe, 60 in sub-Saharan Africa, or 63 in Japan [8,9].\
    \ Fortunately, this trend is expected\nto change. Several European policies, for\
    \ example, are being set to support a generational renewal,\nfacilitating access\
    \ to initial investment, loans, business advice, and training [9]. A generational\
    \ renewal\nin a rural development context goes beyond a reduction in the average\
    \ age of farmers; it is also about\nempowering a new generation of highly qualiﬁed\
    \ young farmers to bring the full beneﬁts of technology\nin order to support sustainable\
    \ farming practices [10]. This implies that young farmers will need to\ntransform\
    \ the existing land to more modern and competitive farms with the purpose of maintaining\n\
    viable food production while improving the competitiveness of the agrifood chain,\
    \ because with\nadvanced technologies and new thinking, young people can transform\
    \ the agricultural sector [8].\n2.1. Internet of Things: Collecting Information\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) in an agricultural context refers to the use of sensors\
    \ and other devices to\nturn every element and action involved in farming into\
    \ data. It has been reported that an estimation\nof a 10% to 15% of US farmers\
    \ are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares and\n250,000\
    \ farms [11]. IoT drives Agriculture 4.0 [12]; in fact, IoT technologies is one\
    \ of the reasons why\nagriculture can generate such a big amount of valuable information,\
    \ and the agriculture sector is\nexpected to be highly inﬂuenced by the advances\
    \ in these technologies [13]. It is estimated that, with\nnew techniques, the\
    \ IoT has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 70% by 2050 [14],\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n3 of 21\nwhich is positive, because according to Myklevy\
    \ et al., the world needs to increase global food\nproduction by 60% by 2050 due\
    \ to a population growth over nine thousand million [15]. The main\nadvantages\
    \ of the use of IoT are achieving higher crop yields and less cost. For example,\
    \ studies from\nOnFarm found that for an average farm using IoT, yield rises by\
    \ 1.75% and energy costs drop 17 to\n32 dollars per hectare, while water use for\
    \ irrigation falls by 8% [12].\n2.2. Big Data: Analysis of Massive Data\nIn the\
    \ current technology-based era, the concept of big data is present in many economic\
    \ sectors,\nbut is it already available to agriculture?\nThe ever-growing amount\
    \ of data available for ﬁeld\nmanagement makes necessary the implementation of\
    \ some type of automatic process to extract\noperational information from bulk\
    \ data. However, the volume of data currently retrieved from most\ncommercial\
    \ ﬁelds is, arguably, not yet at the level considered to be classiﬁed as big data.\
    \ According to\nManyica et al. [16], big data has three dimensions: Volume, velocity,\
    \ and variety. Kunisch [17] added a\nfourth V for veracity. Finally, a ﬁfth V\
    \ was added by Chi et al. for the extra dimension valorization [18].\nOverall,\
    \ the ﬁve V (dimensions) of big data stand for:\n•\nVolume refers to datasets\
    \ whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to\ncapture,\
    \ store, manage, and analyze information. This deﬁnition includes an estimate\
    \ of how big\na dataset needs to be in order to be considered big, and it can\
    \ vary by study sector, depending on\nsoftware tools that are commonly available\
    \ and common sizes of datasets, typically starting in the\nterabyte range [16].\n\
    •\nVelocity refers to the capability to acquire, understand and interpret events\
    \ as they occur.\nIn agriculture, this would refer to applications that occur\
    \ in real time, like data being processed\nright in the ﬁeld to apply variable\
    \ rates of chemicals in equipment featuring variable rate\napplication technologies.\n\
    •\nVariety refers to the diﬀerent data formats (videos, text, voice), and the\
    \ diverse degrees of\ncomplexity. This situation is not strange in agriculture\
    \ when diﬀerent data sources are used to\nwork in complex scenarios such as images\
    \ and soil or weather probes.\n•\nVeracity refers to the quality, reliability,\
    \ and overall conﬁdence of the data.\n•\nValorization is the ability to propagate\
    \ knowledge, appreciation and innovation [18].\nIn the context of crop management,\
    \ Kunisch [17] concluded that big data is applicable only in\nsome cases in agriculture,\
    \ depending on each farm and its level of technology adoption. Nevertheless,\n\
    the Proagrica [19] report conﬁrmed that big data was being increasingly applied\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector. Kamilaris et al. [18] cited 34 works where big data\
    \ was used in agricultural applications, and\nWolfert et al. [20] published a\
    \ review on big data applications in Smart Farming. In line with this\ntrend,\
    \ the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR, Montpellier,\
    \ France)\ncreated a Platform for Big Data in Agriculture with the purpose of\
    \ using big data approaches to solve\nagricultural development problems faster,\
    \ better, and at a greater scale than before [21].\n2.3. Agriculture 5.0: Robotics\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to Help in Nourishing People\nBig engineering\
    \ challenges typically spur big solutions through disruptive technologies,\nand\
    \ Agriculture 5.0 is probably the one for the ﬁrst half of the 21st Century. The\
    \ concept Agriculture\n5.0 implies that farms are following Precision Agriculture\
    \ principles and using equipment that involves\nunmanned operations and autonomous\
    \ decision support systems. Thus, Agriculture 5.0 implies the use\nof robots and\
    \ some forms of AI [22]. By tradition, farms have needed many workers, mostly\
    \ seasonal,\nto harvest crops and keep farms productive. However, society has\
    \ moved away from being an agrarian\nsociety with large quantities of people living\
    \ in farms to people living in cities now; as a result, farms\nare facing the\
    \ challenge of a workforce shortage. One solution to help with this shortage of\
    \ workers is\nagricultural robots integrating AI features. According to a Forbes\
    \ study [23], farm robots augment\nthe human labor workforce and can harvest crops\
    \ at a higher volume and faster pace than human\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n4 of\
    \ 21\nlaborers. Although there are still many cases in which robots are not as\
    \ fast as humans, agriculture is\ncurrently developing robotic systems to work\
    \ in the ﬁeld and help producers with tedious tasks [24–27],\npushing agricultural\
    \ systems to the new concept of Agriculture 5.0. According to Reddy et al. [28],\n\
    the advent of robots in agriculture drastically increased the productivity in\
    \ several countries and\nreduced the farm operating costs. As said before, robotic\
    \ applications for agriculture are growing\nexponentially [27], which oﬀers promising\
    \ solutions for Smart Farming in handling labor shortage and\na long-time declining\
    \ proﬁtability; however, like most innovations, there exist important limitations\n\
    to cope with at the current early stages. These technologies are still too expensive\
    \ for most farmers,\nespecially those with small farms [29], because scale economics\
    \ make small individual farms less\nproﬁtable [30]. Nevertheless, the cost of\
    \ technology decreases with time, and agricultural robots will be\nsurely implemented\
    \ in the future as the alternative to bring about higher production [4,31]. The\
    \ world\nagricultural production and crop yields slowed down in 2015. The concept\
    \ of agricultural robotics\nwas introduced to overcome these problems and satisfy\
    \ the rising demand for high yields. Robotic\ninnovations are giving a boost to\
    \ the global agriculture and crop production market, as according to\nthe Veriﬁed\
    \ Market Intelligence report, agricultural robots will be capable of completing\
    \ ﬁeld tasks\nwith greater eﬃciency as compared to the farmers [32].\nAgricultural\
    \ tech startups have raised over 800 million dollars in the last ﬁve years [31].\
    \ Startups\nusing robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture\
    \ started gaining momentum in\n2014, in line with a rising interest in AI [33].\
    \ In fact, venture capital funding in AI has increased by 450%\nin the last 5\
    \ years [34]. This kind of new agriculture pretends to do more with less, because\
    \ nourishing\npeople while increasing production sustainably and taking care of\
    \ the environment will be crucial in\nthe coming years, as the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates\nthat, in 2050, there will\
    \ be a world population of 9.6 billion [35]. Advanced sensing technologies in\n\
    agriculture can help to meet the challenge; they provide detailed information\
    \ on soil, crop status,\nand environmental conditions to allow precise applications\
    \ of phytosanitary products, resulting in a\nreduced used of herbicides and pesticides,\
    \ improved water use eﬃciency and increased crop yield and\nquality [2].\n3. Data-Driven\
    \ Management for Advanced Farming: Principal Stages\nThe raw measurements of key\
    \ parameters from crops need to be eﬃciently processed so that\nnumbers or images\
    \ unambiguously turn into valuable information. Crop management based on ﬁeld\n\
    data already evolved when Precision Agriculture came to light thirty years ago,\
    \ but it has certainly\nbeen transformed by the present digital information era.\
    \ Traditionally, and in those places where\ntechnology has not arrived yet, ﬁeld\
    \ management consists of visually inspecting the development of\ncrops to reach\
    \ a diagnosis with which farmers make decisions and actuate giving diﬀerent treatments\n\
    to their crops. This approach relies on ﬁeld experience and the information perceived\
    \ through the\neyes of farmers. Additionally, associated growers can follow the\
    \ recommendations of cooperative\ntechnicians or engineers hired by the society\
    \ they belong to. In farms where advanced technology\nhas been implemented, ﬁeld\
    \ management varies according to the operating cycle shown in Figure 1.\nThis\
    \ management system based on objective ﬁeld data and smart decision-making starts\
    \ with the actual\ncrop to manage, taking advantage of its inner variability,\
    \ both spatial-wise and time-wise. The platform\nrefers to the physical means\
    \ with which information is acquired, being the sensors the speciﬁc elements\n\
    through which objective data are obtained. Data includes the information directly\
    \ retrieved from the\nparameters measured from the crop, soil, or ambient. Retrieving\
    \ the data from the sensors can be done\nin multiple ways, from inserting a pen\
    \ drive in a USB port to get the ﬁles [36] to retrieving data from\nsoftware applications\
    \ synchronized to the Internet. The nexus between the data and the decision stage\n\
    involves ﬁltering routines and AI algorithms for getting only the right data and\
    \ helping the grower\nmake correct decisions. Finally, actuation refers to the\
    \ physical execution of an action commanded by\nthe decision system, and is typically\
    \ carried out by advanced equipment that can receive orders from\na computerized\
    \ control unit. As each action takes place over the crop, the cycle starts and\
    \ closes at\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n5 of 21\ncrop level; the response of the\
    \ crop is then registered by specialized sensors and the loop continues\nsystematically\
    \ until harvesting time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle.\nAgronomy\

    3.1. Stage I: The Crop as the Beginning and End of the Agricultural Management\
    \ Cycle—Analyzing Variability\nRegardless how the crop will be managed, some degree\
    \ of spatial variability is assumed for all\nﬁelds by nature. According to Searcy\
    \ [37], natural variability is inﬂuenced by weather within a growing\nseason and\
    \ from year to year; then, data from several years may be needed to determine\
    \ trends in\nthe parameters of interest, and hence, data becomes a regular input\
    \ to the farm management system.\nTherefore, the necessity of monitoring crops\
    \ comes from the existence of variability, but there is a need\nfor the producer\
    \ to manage that variability in a feasible way, and the widely accepted way to\
    \ do it is by\nsetting within-ﬁeld management zones. Management zones are subﬁeld\
    \ areas that have homogeneous\nfeatures, so ﬁeld practices can be custom-made\
    \ to each of such areas, resulting in a practical and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n\
    6 of 21\ncost-eﬀective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption of\
    \ management zones would reduce\nthe cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, provide better farm records\nthat are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for management decisions [4]. According\n\
    to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a function of the natural\
    \ variability within\nthe ﬁeld, the size of the ﬁeld and certain management factors.\
    \ If the variability is high, the minimum\nsize of a zone is limited by the possibility\
    \ of each farmer to diﬀerentially manage regions within a\nﬁeld in economic and\
    \ logistics terms. In addition to decide the area of working zones, the selection\
    \ of\nthe speciﬁc parameters to be tracked within those zones must be carefully\
    \ made early in the process.\nRovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio [65] classiﬁed crop biometric\
    \ traits in a tri-level division of crop features\ndepending on the focus of interest\
    \ being at soil level, plant level, or produce level. This division\nallowed the\
    \ superimposition of various layers in a standardized map with the aim of determining\
    \ a\ndata-based wine quality index deﬁned as the Quality Potential Index (QPI)\
    \ for each subﬁeld area in a\nvineyard. Nevertheless, there may be speciﬁc cases\
    \ where the spatial variability of a ﬁeld is so low that\na single mapping event\
    \ can be suﬃcient, as reported by Klassen et al. [42] when characterizing soil\n\
    variability in rice ﬁelds.\n3.2. Stage II: Platforms Supporting Sensors\nSensors\
    \ are the universal devices to monitor crops and to obtain objective information\
    \ from them.\nThey are usually integrated in a platform, which is the general\
    \ term used in Figure 1 to name the\nstructures where sensors are placed and carried.\
    \ These platforms may be attached to oﬀ-road vehicles\nor ﬁxed to the ground within\
    \ ﬁelds such as local weather stations. One of the most urgent challenges to\n\
    cope with in the next few years will be getting a wider range of non-invasive\
    \ sensors able to measure\non-the-go. This approach would be closer to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0, as these sensors could be attached to\nautonomous platforms and robots.\
    \ Nowadays, not all the parameters of interest can be measured\nnon-invasively\
    \ and at a distance from the target; however, some technologies such as multispectral\
    \ or\nhyperspectral imaging are making signiﬁcant improvements.\n3.2.1. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms: Satellites\nRemote sensing has played a key role in the progress\
    \ of Smart Farming when ﬁeld data became\ngenerally accessible from artiﬁcial\
    \ satellites. Important satellites providing agricultural information are\nthe\
    \ American Landsat satellites (eight satellites take spectral data from the Earth\
    \ each 16 to 18 days),\nthe European Sentinel 2 satellite system (it provides\
    \ multispectral data at 10 m pixel resolution for\nNDVI—Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation\
    \ Index—imagery, soil, and water cover every ten days), the\nRapidEye constellation\
    \ (ﬁve satellites provide multispectral RGB imagery, as well as red-edge and NIR\n\
    bands at 5 m resolution), the GeoEye-1 system (captures multispectral RGB data\
    \ and NIR data at a\n1.84 m resolution), and the WorldView-3 (collects multispectral\
    \ data from the RGB bands including\nthe red-edge, two NIR bands, and 8 SWIR bands\
    \ with a resolution of 1.24 m at nadir). IKONOS\nand QuickBird have been already\
    \ decommissioned. There exist several reviews on satellite sensing\napplications,\
    \ having recent studies focused on the potential applications of thermal technologies\
    \ using\nremote sensing [44] and nutritional status in commodity crops [45].\n\
    3.2.2. Aircraft Systems\nThe distance between crops and satellites is considerable,\
    \ typically around 700 km, and deeper\ninsights are reachable when sensors remain\
    \ closer to the targets. For aircraft systems, the distance\nto land can be around\
    \ 100 m. For example, there is a legal limit of 120 m above the ground in Spain\n\
    for unmanned ﬂying vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remotely-piloted\
    \ aircrafts (RPA)\ncan basically be of two kinds: Fixed-wing aircrafts and multirotor\
    \ aircrafts. Rotary-wing UAVs are\nmore stable ﬂiers as they are capable of a\
    \ vertical take-oﬀ and landing; however, they are slower and\ncannot cover as\
    \ much area during their battery life. Fixed-wing platforms, on the other hand,\
    \ can cover\nmore area per ﬂight and carry larger payloads, but tend to be more\
    \ expensive and break more easily\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n7 of 21\nafter multiple\
    \ landings [45]. When compared to remote sensing, the advantages of UAVs for Precision\n\
    Agriculture are their ﬂexibility in frequency (revisit time of satellites) and\
    \ better spatial resolutions.\nWhen compared to ground vehicles, UAVs can get\
    \ data from inaccessible places where conventional\nequipment cannot stand; however,\
    \ they require a professional planning of the ﬂight route beforehand,\nand certain\
    \ machine vision applications may require ﬂying at midday to avoid vegetation\
    \ shadows\non the ground causing errors with imagery data. Furthermore, post processing\
    \ the data and image\nmosaicking is often quite challenging. An important disadvantage\
    \ of UAVs is the limited payload\nthey can carry, which often limits the suite\
    \ of sensors onboard, as well as the incapacity of ﬂying with\nstrong wind.\n\
    3.2.3. Proximal Sensing: Ground Autonomous Systems—the Great Push for Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nWhen monitoring platforms operate from the ground, the distance from the\
    \ sensors to the target\ncrop diminishes to less than 2 m. Due to the proximity\
    \ of the sensor to the plant, when data is acquired\nfrom ground-based platforms,\
    \ it is called proximal sensing. Ground vehicles are polyvalent in relation\n\
    to the payload of sensors. As these vehicles move near the crop, the data acquired\
    \ increase in accuracy,\nand resolutions of one or more samples per meter are\
    \ feasible, being only limited by the speciﬁcations\nof the particular sensors\
    \ implemented. When active sensors are used, weather conditions such as\nstrong\
    \ sunlight or poor illumination are not a serious problem anymore, and, in case\
    \ of on-the-ﬂy\nprocessing, real-time applications are possible, as spraying weeds\
    \ with the previous detection of the\npest [47]. There has been a signiﬁcant impulse\
    \ in the last ﬁve years for the particular case where data is\nretrieved from\
    \ an autonomous platform (unmanned ground vehicle or UGV) [48–52]. Aravind et\
    \ al. [48]\nreviewed ground robots for tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting,\
    \ crop scouting, pest control,\nweed removal and harvesting, where crop scouting\
    \ has been deﬁned as the process of continuously\nmonitoring the ﬁeld to acquire\
    \ information on the plant status, disease incidence, and infestations\naﬀecting\
    \ crop growth. Shamshiri et al. [27] described recent achievements of UGVs for\
    \ weed control,\nﬁeld scouting, and harvesting, highlighting that, if successfully\
    \ integrated and implemented, ﬁeld\nscouting robots can play a key role in reducing\
    \ production cost, increasing productivity and quality,\nand enabling customized\
    \ plant and crop treatments. The European Commission (EC) has recently\nbacked\
    \ the relevance of robotic technology for Smart Farming by funding four projects\
    \ involving the\nconstruction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: VineRobot,\
    \ Vinbot, GRAPE, and VineScout.\nIn 2016, the European project VineRobot [53]\
    \ delivered a monitoring robot prototype at a Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL)\
    \ status between 6 and 7 (TRL1 represents an early stage concept and TRL9\nis\
    \ a solution ready for production), paving the path for its conceptual termination\
    \ in the VineScout\nproject [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in Figure\
    \ 2. This robot is autonomously driven\nwhen monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local perception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and\nultrasound sensors) for\
    \ navigation and safeguarding. It gathers data from the canopy of the vines with\n\
    the goal of creating plant water status maps and nutritional status maps. In order\
    \ to accomplish its\nmission in a reasonable timeframe, established by end-users\
    \ at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors\nvine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies several challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust\nsensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and in motion, while having a cost-eﬃcient price\
    \ for the\nagriculture sector. Regarding software, the challenge was the agile\
    \ integration of all the crop-sensing\ndevices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ validation of the models developed in the ﬁeld.\nIn addition to scouting robots,\
    \ the introduction of robotics to the farm is also being led by industry\non speciﬁc\
    \ agricultural tasks. Naïo Technologies, for instance, has developed robot Oz\
    \ for mechanical\nweeding [55], and the autonomous sprayer GUSS received the Davidson\
    \ Prize in 2019 [56]. RowBot\nSystems LLC (Minneapolis, MN, USA) patented a robotic\
    \ platform whose structure was conﬁgured\nto perform several ﬁeld tasks, as selectively\
    \ applying fertilizer, mapping growth zones, or seeding\ncover crop [57]. Over\
    \ the 20th century, farm productivity has been increasing by augmenting the\n\
    size of machines, which has led to heavy and oversized equipment. In order to\
    \ invert this trend,\nresearchers and growers have started to think about alternatives\
    \ to tractors to avoid soil compaction.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n8 of 21\nShamshiri\
    \ et al. [27] suggested using various machines instead of one heavy machine. In\
    \ the same\nline, Hameed [58] proposed a technology that enabled a single farmer\
    \ to control a team of automated\nvehicles, and Ball et al. [59] used cooperative\
    \ robots as a measure to control weeds. In fact, there\nhave been several projects\
    \ implementing more than one machine operating in collaborative work,\nas the\
    \ Flourish European project that combines UAVs and UGVs to retrieve information\
    \ for decision\nsupport [46], or the RHEA project where a ﬂeet of autonomous robot\
    \ units performed treatments in\ncrops [82].\n \nfunding four projects involving\
    \ the construction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: \nVineRobot, Vinbot,\
    \ GRAPE, and VineScout. In 2016, the European project VineRobot [53] delivered\
    \ \na monitoring robot prototype at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status\
    \ between 6 and 7 (TRL1 \nrepresents an early stage concept and TRL9 is a solution\
    \ ready for production), paving the path for \nits conceptual termination in the\
    \ VineScout project [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in \nFigure 2.\

    \ (b).\n3.3. Stage III: Data\nOne of the fundamental diﬀerences between traditional\
    \ and modern farming is, apart from the\nmechanization level, the data collected\
    \ directly from the crops. In traditional farms where growers\njudge by visual\
    \ assessment, decisions are relative and subjective. Modern farming oﬀers assessment\n\
    by quantitative data producing objective decisions. Sensors allow data acquisition\
    \ in the ﬁeld, but\nthe special case of non-invasive technologies in combination\
    \ with on-the-ﬂy sensing from moving\nplatforms has opened the window of massive\
    \ data collection, a forerunner of big data in agriculture.\nHowever, the excess\
    \ of data is also a serious challenge to cope with, as vital information may result\n\
    masked by noise. The NDVI measurements collected for plotting the maps of Figure\
    \ 3 [94] were\ncollected with two sensors working simultaneously (SRS sensors,\
    \ METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA,\nUSA) and placed in the robot of Figure 2. One\
    \ of the sensors pointed to the sky and corrected NDVI\nestimates with the incident\
    \ light from the sun, and the other sensor pointed sidewise to the canopy\nto\
    \ collect data from the leaves at an approximate distance of 0.5 m. The zenithal\
    \ photo inserted on\nthe bottom-right corner of Figure 3a shows the VineScout\
    \ autonomous robot taking data between\ntwo rows in a vineyard. The onboard algorithm\
    \ averaged individual local measurements of NDVI in\nsquare cells of 16 m2 classiﬁed\
    \ into nine NDVI levels between 0 and 1 (Figure 3a). The grid map of\nFigure 3a,\
    \ despite informative, is not operational, so a further simpliﬁcation of data\
    \ is necessary before\na grower may ﬁnd it useful. Figure 3b is the result of\
    \ applying a clustering ﬁlter to Figure 3a. It shows\ntwo management zones based\
    \ on vine vigor (high-medium) for the grower to make decisions, together\nwith\
    \ water status maps, about fertilization and diﬀerential harvesting.\nAgronomy\

    3.3.1. Maps Containing Relevant Field Features\nDisplaying data in a coherent\
    \ format is key for ﬁnal users to understand what is happening in the\nﬁeld. The\
    \ most common way to display agricultural data has been in the format of maps,\
    \ as mapping is\nuseful to deﬁne spatial trends and homogeneous zones. However,\
    \ displaying agronomical information\nin beautiful maps should not be the goal\
    \ of map generation. Maps need to be useful for making decisions,\nthey need to\
    \ be a help to answer a question, providing an interpretation of spatial information\
    \ [39].\nThe goal of building maps is obtaining a few management zones with the\
    \ parameters of interest so that a\ntreatment can be eﬃciently applied. To get\
    \ plausible management zones, kriging is one of the most used\ninterpolation techniques\
    \ to delimit areas of manageable sizes [43]. Taking into account the considerable\n\
    amount of data that Smart Farming generates, there are many software applications\
    \ to cope with\ninterpolation, in general, or kriging in particular [66]. Also,\
    \ when building a map, a coordinate system\nneeds to be supplied along with the\
    \ map. One ideal alternative for agricultural maps is brought by\nthe Local Tangent\
    \ Plane (LTP) coordinate system, which features Euclidean geometry, allows user-set\n\
    origins, and employs the intuitive coordinate frame east-north. Regarding the\
    \ coding and display of\ndata in the maps, grids allow the systematic quantization\
    \ of the LTP coordinate system to manage crop\nproduction information more eﬃciently,\
    \ facilitating the exchange of information among successive\nseasons and the comparison\
    \ of multiple parameters on the same ﬁeld [67]. A practical example of\ngrid-based\
    \ maps using LTP coordinates is shown in Figure 3.\nTaking into account the key\
    \ role of positioning systems, a map-based approach is the method\nin which a\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS)—or any other Global Navigation Satellite System\n\
    (GNSS)—receiver and a data logger (e.g., an onboard computer) are used to record\
    \ the position of a\nparticular measurement (georeferenced data), so several maps\
    \ can be generated and processed along\nwith other layers of spatially variable\
    \ information [68]. In general, GNSS receivers are the universal\nposition devices\
    \ used to build maps; however, in some cases, for example in greenhouses or dense\n\
    ﬁelds of tall trees, GNSS is not the best option to use due to the diﬃculty of\
    \ getting signals with reliable\naccuracy; so, in some cases, alternative solutions\
    \ such as machine vision must be implemented [69].\n3.3.2. Data Management Software\
    \ to Ease the Process of Decision Making\nA popular way to manage ﬁeld data displayed\
    \ on maps and culminate with a practical solution\nis through the use of Geographic\
    \ Information Systems (GIS). This set of computer-based tools (or\ndata platforms)\
    \ allows to store, analyze, manipulate and map any type of georeferenced information.\n\
    A speciﬁc GIS system called the Field-level geographic Information System (FIS)\
    \ was developed\nfor Precision Agriculture applications [70], but it was set for\
    \ old computer operative systems\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n10 of 21\nsuch as Windows\
    \ 3.1×, 95, 98, or NT [71]. The updated version of FIS is the farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), which according to Burlacu et al. [72] is a management\
    \ information system\ndesigned to assist farmers with various tasks, ranging from\
    \ operational planning, implementation and\ndocumentation to the assessment of\
    \ performed ﬁeld work. The purpose of FMIS is to reduce production\ncosts, comply\
    \ with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety, guiding\n\
    growers to make the best decisions possible [95]. Farm management software solutions\
    \ support the\nautomation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning,\
    \ decision making, documenting,\nand managing the farm operations [64], and include\
    \ basic functions for record keeping like crop\nproduction rates (harvests and\
    \ yields), proﬁts and losses, farm tasks scheduling, weather prediction,\nsoil\
    \ nutrients tracking, and ﬁeld mapping, up to more complex functionalities for\
    \ automating ﬁeld\nmanagement accounting for farms and agribusinesses (accounting,\
    \ inventory management, or labor\ncontracts). In many cases, growers do not need\
    \ to be ﬂuid on data management because the software can\nbuild maps or decision-making\
    \ models with basic information introduced by growers. Furthermore,\na critical\
    \ feature of these applications is that they even help in the early warning of\
    \ weather-related\nhazards that enables farmers, policy makers, and aid agencies\
    \ to mitigate their exposure to risk [83].\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration\
    \ that the eﬃciency of a recommendation for a particular\nagent will depend on\
    \ the factors included in the algorithms of the software (technical, economic,\n\
    safety-wise. . . ). In this sense, a DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\
    \ Transfer)\nprovides outputs with experimental data for evaluation of crop models,\
    \ allowing users to compare\nsimulated outcomes with observed results, which is\
    \ critical if real-world decisions or recommendations\nare based on modeled results\
    \ [84]. Table 2 gathers a representative set of commercially available FMIS\n\
    programs speciﬁcally conﬁgured to deal with the usual data generated in the farm.\
    \ It includes the\nname of each application program, the company commercializing\
    \ it with its headquarters location,\nand the main features of the program. The\
    \ table is focused on programs managing crop data as the\nprimary tool, and its\
    \ purpose is not the compilation of all available FMIS software, which would\n\
    be futile given the rate new applications are constantly released, but bringing\
    \ a proof of the global\neﬀort realized in the last decade to deploy Smart Farming\
    \ in actual farms, accelerating the move\nfrom academics to agribusiness. The\
    \ examples show that some smartphone and tablet applications\nalready include\
    \ complex features so that growers can insert data directly in the ﬁeld; other\
    \ companies,\non the contrary, prefer having a basic application for mobile devices\
    \ to increase complexity in the\ncloud-based desktop version. In the majority\
    \ of cases, it is not necessary to have wireless connection\nwhile the grower\
    \ is entering data in the ﬁeld, because as soon as the mobile device ﬁnds a wireless\n\
    connection to the internet, it synchronizes the data previously introduced by\
    \ the grower in the mobile\ndevice with the data safely stored in the cloud. Many\
    \ of the programs listed below oﬀer the option\nof upgrading the software depending\
    \ on speciﬁc grower needs, increasing the price accordingly.\nThe most advanced\
    \ tools include features for ﬁnancial and machinery management, help in the\n\
    decision-making process, release warnings, or even propose management advice.\
    \ In many cases, these\nsoftware applications are not only addressed to the grower\
    \ or producer, but also to other stakeholders in\nagriculture such as inputs suppliers,\
    \ service suppliers, and food distributors, which makes a diﬀerence\nfor Smart\
    \ Farming, where multiple agriculture agents are connected. Regarding exploitation\
    \ rights,\nvarious agricultural management systems have been patented, as the\
    \ software from The Climate Corp.\nto generate agriculture prescriptions [85],\
    \ which entered into partnership with AGCO Corporation in\n2017 [4]. Decisive\

    \ systems, as the ones listed in Table 2, often implies\nthat producers need to\
    \ share their crop data with a software platform owned and run by private\ncompanies.\
    \ This fact creates some controversy regarding the ownership of the data. In the\
    \ Software\nServices Agreement (SSA), it is stated that the person or entity providing\
    \ the data to the farm\nmanagement software company shall own and retain all rights,\
    \ title and interest in and to their\ndata, so that the data belongs to the provider\
    \ [76]. However, when data are aggregated with other\ngrowers’ data, the combined\
    \ data typically become property of the software company [96]. The list of\napplications\
    \ included in Table 2 proves that there is a global interest in developing software\
    \ for farm\ndata management, and most of the features requested by end-users are\
    \ similar everywhere. This table\nalso gives an idea of the interest raised in\
    \ industry by software-based management systems. However,\nmany applications use\
    \ their own proprietary formats, which complicates the share of data among data\n\
    acquisition and processing systems. A standardization eﬀort is needed among software\
    \ developers\nand providers. The ADAPT toolkit of Table 2 [77] is an example of\
    \ how to face this challenge, as it\nprovides an open-source application that\
    \ eliminates a barrier to the broad use of Precision Agriculture\ndata by enabling\
    \ interoperability between diﬀerent hardware and software applications.\n3.4.\
    \ Stage IV: Decision-Making\nIn situations where many ﬁeld parameters need being\
    \ considered, people ﬁnd practical diﬃculties\nin managing complex information\
    \ to make eﬀective decisions. In such cases, artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) can\
    \ help with techniques like deep learning or neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic\
    \ algorithms,\nor expert systems. AI, with its modelling and reasoning capabilities,\
    \ can play a key role in agriculture,\nhelping to make sense of all the data available.\
    \ Fuzzy logic, to name one example within AI, resembles\nhuman reasoning imitating\
    \ the way of making decisions that involve several possibilities instead of\n\
    ‘true’ or ‘false’ alternatives; this technique uses linguistic variables that\
    \ ﬁt well with the complexity\nof the challenges posed by the diversity of agricultural\
    \ decision making. According to Dengel [20],\nagriculture oﬀers a vast application\
    \ area for all kinds of AI core technologies as agents operating in\nuncontrolled\
    \ environments. Giusti and Marsili-Libellia [81] designed a fuzzy-based decision\
    \ support\nsystem (DSS) taking as input variables soil moisture and rain forecast\
    \ for kiwi, corn, and potato.\nSimilarly, the DSS developed by Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [87] estimated weekly irrigation for citrus\norchards taking into account\
    \ climate and soil variables; in that work, real-time measurements from soil\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n14 of 21\nparameters in a closed-loop control scheme were\
    \ decisive to avoid the accumulative eﬀect due to errors\nin consecutive weekly\
    \ estimations, as the DSS was allowed to adapt to local perturbations. In the\n\
    same fashion, Lindsay Corporation (Omaha, Nebraska, USA) was awarded for its solution\
    \ FieldNET\nAdvisor™ [91] that provides irrigation management decisions for growers.\
    \ DSS may be more robust\nand reliable when diﬀerent variables are considered,\
    \ but some procedures remain controversial as\nobjectives can lead to diﬀerent\
    \ solutions at diﬀerent times based on the priority set by decision makers\nor\
    \ other people involved in the procedure [88].\nSrivastava and Singh [80] highlighted\
    \ the importance of incorporating the graphical part of GIS to\nDSS, which was\
    \ demonstrated for water management scenarios in India. The importance of using\n\
    GIS for agricultural DSS lies on using user-friendly graphical interfaces for\
    \ growers. The result of a\nquestionnaire distributed by VineScout project [36]\
    \ members to the attendees of a ﬁeld demonstration in\nPortugal (October 2019),\
    \ evidenced the high value given to graphical user interfaces (GUI). Considering\n\
    that the prototype is in research phase and not commercial yet, 84% of the attendees\
    \ concluded that\nthe robot GUI shown in Figure 4 was simple to understand and\
    \ easy to use (unpublished research).\nRupnik et al. [89] developed a cloud-based\
    \ system to allow growers upload their own data, utilize\nseveral data analysis\
    \ methods, and ﬁnally present their outputs as decisions to apply. This time,\
    \ their\nuse case focused on spray planning for ﬁghting against pests in vineyards\
    \ and orchards. Rose et al. [90]\nconducted a survey on DSS and arrived to the\
    \ conclusion that 15 factors were inﬂuential in convincing\nUK growers and advisers\
    \ to use DSS, including usability, cost-eﬀectiveness, performance, relevance to\n\
    user, and compatibility with compliance demands. In addition, they found that\
    \ 49% of UK farmers used\nsome kind of DSS, and the preferred ways of delivery\
    \ were software (28%), paper-based (22%) tools,\nand mobile apps (10%). These\
    \ results show that the use of software to manage decisions is growing,\nbut its\
    \ percentage is still low and comparable to those who preferred paper-based tools.\
    \ Choosing\nsoftware and mobile applications to make agricultural decisions may\
    \ be considered beneﬁcial because\ndigital tools increase management eﬃciency\
    \ when compared to paper-based tools; however, there is\nstill a long way to make\
    \ technology-based tools attractive enough—easy to understand, intuitive and\n\
    nice—for growers to adopt. On the producer side, it is important to have access\
    \ to proper training\nuntil these technologies can be comfortably managed.\nAgronomy\

    \ last step for closing the loop in the complete crop management cycle of Figure\
    \ 1 is the\nphysical actuation on the crop. Actuation is understood as executing\
    \ some action on the crop or\nrelated to it, and this can be done by making decisions\
    \ right after obtaining information (real-time\napplications) or in another moment\
    \ deferred in time (oﬀ-line). For farmers to execute decisions,\nthey need advanced\
    \ equipment that can receive orders from a computerized control unit. Variable\n\
    rate machines can execute a number of farming tasks driven by a smart system [60].\
    \ Variable rate\ntechnology (VRT) applied on site-speciﬁc crop management (SSCM)\
    \ has the potential to increase\nproﬁt and decrease environmental impact [61]\
    \ as only what is needed is actually applied. Colaço\nand Molin [92] conducted\
    \ a long-term study for six years with the goal of evaluating the eﬀects of\n\
    variable rate fertilization on fertilizer consumption, soil fertility, and yield\
    \ in citrus. The outcomes\nof comparing variable and uniform rates showed that\
    \ the former achieved higher yields while using\nless fertilizer: using nitrogen,\
    \ fruit yield (kg of oranges) respect to the amount of fertilizer resulted\nin\
    \ a 32% yield increase in ﬁeld 1, and 38% in ﬁeld 2. When using potassium, the\
    \ yield increase even\nreached 40% in ﬁeld 1. In the case of phosphorus, the growth\
    \ rate was approximately 20% for both\nﬁelds. A recent review led by Nawar et\
    \ al. [93] conﬁrmed that, when management zone delineation\ntechniques were used\
    \ for variable-rate nutrient application, farm eﬃciency increased in all cases\n\
    when compared to traditional uniform-rate applications, and environmental impacts\
    \ were reduced.\nMachinery manufacturers are leading the development of commercial\
    \ solutions implementing VRT.\nThomasson et al. [62] described commercial VRT\
    \ systems oﬀered by major agricultural machinery\nmanufacturers, like CLAAS, that\
    \ used the ISARIA crop sensor for the variable-rate application of\nnitrogen-based\
    \ fertilizer, or the CEBIS MOBILE ISOBUS, which, apart from having other Precision\n\
    Agriculture functions, it is a compatible terminal to integrate the ISARIA sensor.\
    \ Another promising\ntype of variable actuation is automatic diﬀerential harvesting\
    \ or variable rate harvesting (VRH),\nwhich attempts harvesting according to previously\
    \ deﬁned management zones. In specialty crops,\nSethuramasamyraja [40] worked\
    \ in diﬀerential harvesting for vineyards by using near-infrared sensors\nto determine\
    \ grape quality in the ﬁeld based on the anthocyanin content of berries. The three\
    \ steps for\nthis VRH system involved sensing the anthocyanin content of grapes,\
    \ using these data to produce\nquality map based on a threshold anthocyanin level,\
    \ and feeding the quality map to the harvester for its\ncommanding. CLAAS was\
    \ awarded for implementing VRH in combines and forage harvesters [91] by\nmerging\
    \ precision sensing technology with autonomous machine control. The goal was to\
    \ maximize\nproductivity and automatically optimize harvester performance, according\
    \ to the changing conditions\nof the soil, plants, grain, and humidity in the\
    \ harvested ﬁeld. A USDA statistical analysis conducted in\n2010 [3] showed that\
    \ variable rate technologies had positive, but small, rate adoptions of 1% due\
    \ to\ntheir diﬃculty of use. Apart from eﬃciency and utility, cost is also a critical\
    \ parameter to consider for\nthe adoption of this technology. In this sense, the\
    \ ubiquitous availability of low-cost electronics will\nfavor the introduction\
    \ of such digital applications. In fact, advances in autonomous driving technology\n\
    for cars, including object detection capabilities through multi-camera systems,\
    \ have already reduced\nthe cost of developing automated agricultural machines\
    \ [22].\n4. Discussion\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, mainly since the advent\
    \ of mechanization, and along the Green\nRevolution, humans and machines have\
    \ been eﬃciently collaborating for growing crops to feed people.\nHowever, to\
    \ face the population growth in the coming years, an extra eﬀort is needed to\
    \ succeed,\nnot only in feeding people by increasing productivity, but also in\
    \ doing it in the most eﬃcient and\nrespectful possible way, that is, producing\
    \ sustainably. To face this challenge, remarkable advances in\ntechnology have\
    \ been appearing over the last decades, in particular the access to reliable agricultural\n\
    data and advanced computer techniques to get the optimal meaning from them, eventually\
    \ obtaining\nmaximum beneﬁts while being respectful with the environment. This\
    \ new approach driven by digital\ntechnology implies that growers must act as\
    \ supervisors of their crops rather than laborers, in an attempt\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 207\n16 of 21\nof avoiding repetitive, physically-demanding, and tedious\
    \ ﬁeld tasks. In this modern agronomical\nframework, DATA is the key, and the\
    \ information-based management cycle described above provides\nthe practical approach\
    \ that unites concept and tasks. The following points summarize some of the\n\
    speciﬁc ideas drawn from this study:\n•\nPrecision Agriculture, which consists\
    \ of applying what is needed when and where is needed,\nhas further improved the\
    \ eﬃciency of managing farms with the addition of data-based digital\nsystems\
    \ that increase the knowledge of producers about their ﬁelds; this is known as\
    \ Agriculture\n4.0 or Digital Farming. When these data-driven farms incorporate\
    \ robotics with AI algorithms to\ntheir systems, the overall concept is then referred\
    \ to as Agriculture 5.0. Some studies report that\nagricultural robots integrating\
    \ forms of AI can do certain tasks faster than humans [23]. Despite\nthere are\
    \ other studies that contradict this statement [63], robotics is a growing economy\
    \ and there\nexists a great potential for many applications within agriculture.\n\
    •\nA greater adoption of Digital Farming by professional growers is vital to not\
    \ only improving a\nfarm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet the food needs\
    \ of an expanding population [6].\nSmall farms will steadily incorporate basic\
    \ technology whereas large ﬁelds will likely invest with\nsophisticated equipment,\
    \ but data-less intuition-driven management will no longer represent\nthe modus\
    \ operandi of professional farms in the future. This should be considered a source\
    \ of\nopportunities, especially for a new generation of young farmers used to\
    \ digital technology, who\nare the ones with the capacity to balance an aging\
    \ population in rural areas, mainly those in\nindustrialized countries.\n•\nAfter\
    \ the rapid growth of UAVs, a steady-state is being reached, mostly induced by\
    \ the fact that\ndata analysis and ground-truth validation has resulted far more\
    \ complex and delicate than image\nacquisition and platform handling. This has\
    \ promoted the expansion of proximal sensing and the\nexploration of combining\
    \ both data sources—aerial and terrestrial—for a better understanding of\nthe\
    \ physiology of plants and trees.\n•\nMaps, as the most common way to represent\
    \ agricultural data, would need to be standardized.\nIntensely-interpolated colored\
    \ maps are output by GIS, FMIS, and other software applications,\nbut at the time\
    \ of comparing data with the precision enough to grant statistical signiﬁcance,\
    \ it often\nbecomes an impossible mission without standardization. Figure 3, for\
    \ example, uses the ﬂat\nrepresentation provided by the local tangent plane (LTP)\
    \ and formatted in a regular grid. Other\nprograms use UTM projections, and there\
    \ are even images only given in geodetic coordinates.\nAt the need of overlapping\
    \ maps, it takes a big eﬀort to make all data compatible. Not only the\nway coordinates\
    \ are represented needs a standard, but also the units, intervals, and even colors\
    \ in\nwhich parameters are displayed. The combination of aerial and ground data,\
    \ for instance, will\ngreatly beneﬁt from such standardization in the way data\
    \ is visually displayed for the average\ngrower to understand.\n•\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a representative compilation of software applications for farm management.\n\
    The list is not exhaustive, and yet includes companies from four continents and\
    \ 14 countries,\nwhich provides evidence of the fact that agricultural digitalization\
    \ is in fact a global move.\n•\nRegarding variable rate applications, adoption\
    \ rates need to augment, and to do so, farmers must\nﬁnd by themselves the value\
    \ in this technology for their crops. Only after maintaining accurate\nspatial\
    \ records and analyzing ﬁeld data can eﬀective variable rate prescriptions be\
    \ created [39] to\naddress particular tasks.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis conﬁrms\
    \ that consistent knowledge about farms leads to optimal decisions.\nAgricultural\
    \ management systems can handle farm data in such a way that results are orchestrated\n\
    to address customized solutions for each farm. This aid for farmers in the form\
    \ of digital solutions\ncombines forces with robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to launch the imminent idea of Agriculture\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n17 of 21\n\
    5.0. After thirty years of great expectations—and disappointments—by the application\
    \ of robotics to\nagriculture, the timing seems right for the ﬁrst time. However,\
    \ in order to take the most advantages\nfrom Agriculture 5.0, deep training needs\
    \ to be delivered to users, ideally young farmers eager to\nlearn and apply modern\
    \ technologies to agriculture and granting a generational renewal still to come.\n\
    It seems to be the right time to move forward towards a modern and sustainable\
    \ agriculture that\nis capable of showing the full power of data-driven management\
    \ to face the challenges posed to\nfood production in the 21st Century. The evolution\
    \ to Agriculture 5.0 is in the agenda of most major\nfarm equipment makers for\
    \ the next decade, and therefore oﬀ-road equipment manufacturers will\nplay a\
    \ key role in this move if agricultural robots are considered as the next—smarter—generation\
    \ of\nfarm machines.\nAuthor Contributions: V.S.-R. and F.R.-M. contributed to\

    Full Access Challenges in using land use and land cover data for global change

    e-mail: Peter.verburg@ivm.vu.nl SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Land use and
    land cover data play a central role in climate change assessments. These data
    originate from different sources and inventory techniques. Each source of land
    use/cover data has its own domain of applicability and quality standards. Often
    data are selected without explicitly considering the suitability of the data for
    the specific application, the bias originating from data inventory and aggregation,
    and the effects of the uncertainty in the data on the results of the assessment.
    Uncertainties due to data selection and handling can be in the same order of magnitude
    as uncertainties related to the representation of the processes under investigation.
    While acknowledging the differences in data sources and the causes of inconsistencies,
    several methods have been developed to optimally extract information from the
    data and document the uncertainties. These methods include data integration, improved
    validation techniques and harmonization of classification systems. Based on the
    data needs of global change studies and the data availability, recommendations
    are formulated aimed at optimal use of current data and focused efforts for additional
    data collection. These include: improved documentation using classification systems
    for land use/cover data; careful selection of data given the specific application
    and the use of appropriate scaling and aggregation methods. In addition, the data
    availability may be improved by the combination of different data sources to optimize
    information content while collection of additional data must focus on validation
    of available data sets and improved coverage of regions and land cover types with
    a high level of uncertainty. Specific attention in data collection should be given
    to the representation of land management (systems) and mosaic landscapes. Introduction
    Land use and land cover change are one of the prime driving forces of changes
    in the Earth system and climate in particular. Agricultural land uses are estimated
    to contribute to changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG):
    non-CO2 GHG account for 10–12% of the total global anthropogenic emissions. At
    the same time, agricultural lands generate large CO2 fluxes both to and from the
    atmosphere, but the net flux is small. The expansion of cropland and pastures
    at the cost of forests results in an increase in atmospheric CO2. This decreases
    the sink capacity of the global terrestrial biosphere, and thereby may amplify
    the atmospheric CO2 rise. Apart from managed lands, large sources and sinks of
    GHGs are found in natural land cover types: wetlands are a well-known source of
    methane emissions (Hines et al., 2008; Kayranli et al., 2010) and much research
    focuses on the consequences of global change on emissions from arctic and boreal
    ecosystems (Chapin et al., 2000). Besides the impact of land cover change on GHG
    emissions, more subtle changes in land management and land use practices can have
    important consequences. Differences in forest management are likely to influence
    carbon emissions or sequestration in different ways (Schulp et al., 2008b) while
    agricultural management effects carbon sequestration and GHG emissions (Dendoncker
    et al., 2004). Methane emissions from rice fields are highly dependent on water
    management (Verburg & Denier van der Gon, 2001) and rice variety choice (Denier
    van der Gon et al., 2002). Land use and land cover change not only impacts GHG
    emissions but also land surface properties of relevance to climate. At the global
    scale, changes in land surface properties associated with changes in vegetation
    can have impacts on continental and global atmospheric circulation, with possible
    large impacts on regional and continental climate (Pielke et al., 1998; Chapin
    et al., 2000). Impacts of land use/cover change upon climate include remote impacts
    upon local circulation regimes often labeled as land use driven ‘teleconnections’
    because effects are communicated to regions distant from the actual changes in
    surface characteristics (Eastman et al., 2001). The impact of land use and land
    cover change on climate change is mostly studied from the perspective of land
    use/cover change as a driver of climate change (Schulp et al., 2008a). However,
    in many cases the interrelations are more complex. Land use/cover change can also
    be induced by climatic changes. Droughts have strong effects on vegetation and
    may increase the risk of forest fires. Climate change may also make areas more
    or less suitable for certain land use management practices leading to changes
    in land use decisions. Multidirectional impacts may be linked through feedbacks
    that strengthen or attenuate the interaction between land use/cover change and
    climate change (Verburg, 2006). Such feedbacks make it difficult to distinguish
    impacts from drivers (Bossel, 1999). Large-scale deforestation changes climate
    conditions and, hence, influences vegetation patterns and occurrence of forest
    fires. These may affect land requirements and reclamation potential (Nepstad et
    al., 2001; Foley et al., 2003; Carvalho et al., 2004). A feedback that deserves
    special attention is the adaptation of land management in response to climate
    change. Adaptation aims at reducing the potential negative consequences of climate
    change through adapting management practices in such a way that they anticipate
    the changed climatic conditions. Adaptation may include a wide variety of measures
    (Aerts, 2005; EEA, 2008). These include spatial planning measures, for example
    to restrict new residential locations in areas with high flooding risk, the use
    of improved crop varieties that are better adapted to the changed climatic conditions,
    resource management and diversification (Polsky & Easterling III, 2001). Finally,
    the emerging incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation
    (REDD) require high quality monitoring of forest dynamics directly related to
    land use change (Eva et al., 2010). Given the very central role of land use/cover
    change almost all assessments related to climate change somehow make use of data
    on land use/cover. These data may originate from different sources and inventory
    techniques. Each source of land use/cover data has its own domain of applicability
    and quality standards. In many studies, no specific attention is given to the
    quality and content of these data. This paper reviews the use of land use/cover
    data in climate studies and aims at identifying critical issues related to the
    use of land use/cover data in climate assessments. Based on an inventory of data
    sources, the domain of applicability and the constraints of particular data sets
    are discussed (‘Inventory of data types on land use/cover’). An inventory of large
    uncertainties and inconsistencies in land use/cover data that may have critical
    implications for climate change assessments is provided in ‘Consistency issues
    of land use and land cover data’ whereas ‘Methods and opportunities to deal with
    data inconsistencies’ discusses several methods and techniques that may reduce
    such errors and inconsistencies. The implications for global change assessments
    and integrated assessment models are described in ‘Implications for global change
    analysis and modelling’. The paper concludes with a list of the main findings
    and recommendations. Inventory of data types on land use/cover Sources for land
    use/cover data The most common source of data on land cover is remote sensing.
    Remotely sensed data include information gathered by aerial photography and satellites.
    Solar radiation (or in case of radar actively emitted radiation) is reflected
    from the surface of the earth – from soil, water, vegetation and building – to
    sensors that measure the intensity of different frequencies. Each type of surface
    reflects or absorbs different frequencies. Based on these measurements, it is
    possible to make inferences about the earth surface. The reflection is related
    to the cover of the earth surface which not always reveals the intended use of
    the land. However, land cover in combination with the spatial structures and additional
    attributes may allow, to some extent, to derive land use. Park & Stenstrom (2008)
    subdivide urban land cover derived from remote sensing data into several land
    use classes based on the dominant use of the area. They indicate that high accuracies
    in classifying different types of urban land use can be achieved. For the interpretation
    of remote sensing imagery, a wide range of methods exists ranging from fully automated,
    to semiautomated, to pure interpretation (Richards & Jia, 2006). Fully automated
    approaches, i.e. direct processing of image data using models or other techniques,
    have the advantage of fast processing allowing high temporal resolution and replication
    which is especially useful in monitoring rapid deforestation (Asner et al., 2009).
    Supervised techniques and visual interpretation allow the integration of expert-knowledge,
    field observations and pattern recognition (Sirén & Brondizio, 2009), but also
    introduce an element of subjectivity making the interpretations dependent on the
    observer (Foody, 2002). This may cause problems in replication and therefore change
    detection. Another commonly used source of land use/cover data are surveys and
    census data. Many countries and international agencies collect statistical information
    on land use. Agricultural land use types are often reported as part of an agricultural
    census. Besides cropping areas such information often also includes management
    information such as irrigation, fertilizer application rates and crop yields.
    Similarly, forestry statistics may provide information about management practices.
    Therefore, census information is highly suitable to provide land use information
    which can never be collected through remote sensing. However, most census information
    is focused on economic sectors and information on (semi-)natural land uses is
    often not included. In addition, data are often aggregated to the level of administrative
    units while the original data are not available as result of privacy legislation
    (Sabor et al., 2007). Besides remote sensing and census information other, but
    less frequently used, sources of land use/cover data include maps based on field
    surveys, participatory maps (Rambaldi et al., 2007) and cadastral information
    (Aspinall, 2004). An overview of the characteristics of different sources of land
    use/cover data is given in Table 1. Table 1. Overview of the spatial, temporal
    and thematic properties of various sources of land-use and land cover data Data
    source Spatial resolution Spatial extent Temporal resolution Temporal extent Thematic
    properties Remote sensing/ Aerial photography Dependent on sensor (remote sensing
    mostly between 0.6 m and 1 km) Dependent on sensor. Coverage is limited in case
    of clouds (not for radar) Frequent depending on sensor/satellite Depending on
    launching and life time of sensor. Few remote sensing data are available before
    1970s except for aerial photographs Land cover classes. Classification is based
    on sensor characteristics and user preferences Census/ survey data Administrative
    units Often national level Infrequent depending on census, often less than every
    10 years Country specific depending on statistical system Focus on economic sectors
    (mostly agriculture and forestry) Land-use maps based on field survey Dependent
    on scale of mapping (often between 1 : 25  000 and 1 : 1 million Varying Often
    made for 1 year only – Varying and fixed within a specific map Participatory maps
    Dependent on scale of mapping Often restricted to territory of one or more communities
    For one moment only Participatory back casting possible Depending on purpose of
    mapping Cadastral information Precise information at property level Dependent
    on cadastral system Continuously updated Often available for long time period
    Limited to tenure conditions with limited information about land use, especially
    in urban environments Applicability domains It is important to notice that the
    different sources of data have clearly different possible applications. High-resolution
    remote sensing data, for example from IKONOS and Quickbird, provide detailed land
    cover information and the possibility to infer land use information. However,
    acquisition and interpretation of such data is only feasible for relatively small
    areas and may be very costly. Therefore, global land cover data sets based on
    remote sensing data are using medium to coarse resolution sensors, e.g. in case
    of the GLC2000 dataset (http://www-tem.jrc.it/glc2000/) use was made of SPOT images
    (1 km resolution) while the recent GLOBCOVER data (http://ionia1.esrin.esa.int/index.asp)
    are based on MERIS images from ENVISAT with a spatial resolution of 300 m. The
    differences between sensors and the spatial resolution have an impact on the representation
    of landscapes and the thematic information that can be derived. In many land cover
    data sets, each pixel is classified as one specific land cover type. When land
    cover types mainly occur in small patches the occurrence of these land cover types
    may be underestimated because they will not dominate the reflectance characteristics
    of the pixel. Moody & Woodcock (1994) show that large proportion errors can arise
    as landscapes are represented at increasingly coarse scales. Therefore, the appropriate
    spatial resolution of the sensor may depend on the landscape under analysis (Ozdogan
    & Woodcock, 2006). Various methods are developed to correct, to some extent, for
    this aggregation problem either through statistical techniques (Moody & Woodcock,
    1994; Marceau & Hay, 1999) or through unmixing of the spectral information in
    the pixel during the interpretation and reporting of the fractional coverage of
    each land cover within the pixel. Whereas the discussion on spatial resolution
    effect is mostly concerned with raster data a similar effect can be found in polygon
    representations of land use data. An important generalization mechanism inherent
    to polygon maps is the minimum mapping unit (MMU), i.e. the minimum size that
    a land unit must exceed in order to be represented in the map. Land units smaller
    than the MMU are simply not represented. This may result in an overrepresentation
    of the land cover/use types that occur in larger units. An exception is the case
    of mosaic polygons, which have a compound label representing a mosaic of patches
    from different classes, all smaller than the MMU. In this kind of polygons, the
    percentage cover from each class may be reported, but information regarding their
    actual distribution within the polygon is missing (Castilla & Hay, 2007). Besides
    spatial scale, temporal scale is also important. Survey and census data tend to
    be infrequent and sampling schemes and definitions change between surveys. Remote
    sensing data offer the best possibility to monitor changes in land cover through
    time. However, time series based on remote sensing tend to suffer from inconsistencies
    due to improved resolution of sensors and changes in classification schemes. Moreover,
    accuracies of classification are often around 80% while change in land cover over
    the period analyzed is often small. Therefore, temporal consistency needs be ensured
    by focusing on change in the spectral information rather than providing two individual
    interpretations for the different years (Hansen et al., 2008; Berberoglu & Akin,
    2009). Furthermore, cloud cover may cause problems in large parts of the humid
    tropics during a considerable part of the year (Ju & Roy, 2008). Radar images
    may overcome these problems to some extent (DeFries, 2008; Freitas et al., 2008).
    Consistency issues of land use and land cover data Similar studies conducted in
    different regions and at different times often use different sources of data,
    which hinders a comparison between them. In addition, researchers may choose from
    different sources of land use/cover data that contain different information. Comparison
    and integration of different data sources is hampered by different issues including:
    • difference between land cover and land use; • temporal consistency; • spatial
    consistency and scaling bias; • thematic differences and inconsistencies. The
    following paragraphs will discuss the underlying reasons for consistency problems
    in more detail and provide a number of illustrations. Temporal consistency issues
    For monitoring and analysis of change in land use/cover, it is essential to have
    consistent data over a longer period of time. Preferably, these are derived from
    exactly the same data source with applying the same processing techniques. However,
    often this is not possible. Because technology, science and policy objectives
    are continuously changing, repeated natural resource inventories rarely employ
    the same methods as in previous surveys (Wadsworth et al., 2008). The production
    of spatial data sets from remote sensing has often been driven by short-term funding
    and specific information requirements by the funding agencies. As a result, a
    wide variety of data sets exist that were generated using different atmospheric
    classification algorithms, land cover classes, training sites, map projections
    and spatial resolutions. Remote sensing sensors have changed in time and interpretation
    techniques have become more advanced. Furthermore, many interpretations of remote
    sensing data include a ‘supervised’ component in which classification decisions
    and generalizations are made by an expert. This is not necessarily the same person
    as the one that has processed the data for an earlier year. Also survey methods
    and inventory techniques may change in time, including classification systems,
    legend classes and spatial detail. When analyzing time series of data, it is important
    to distinguish changes caused by inconsistencies between the data sets and the
    ‘real’ changes. In practice, these are often difficult to separate and it is likely
    that the land use/cover change reports from such exercises over- or underestimates
    the ‘real’ change. Spatial consistency issues Spatial inconsistencies between
    data sources may be related to positional errors caused by georeferencing of remote
    sensing data or the level of generalization of a vector map (Castilla & Hay, 2007).
    If georeferencing is appropriately done such inconsistencies are small as compared
    with inconsistencies as result of differences in spatial scale and aggregation.
    Nol et al. (2008) compare a series of land cover data from different sources available
    for the fen meadow landscape in Western Netherlands (Fig. 1). The landscape is
    dominated by grassland with a large number of small, linear, water bodies (ditches).
    The less detailed data do not represent the linear figures of the landscape and
    grassland cover dominates in the coarse scale data sets. These differences have
    large consequences for the land use statistics that can be derived from the data.
    In the field mapping grassland only covers 77% of the area and water covers 11%.
    The CLC2000 map classifies 100% of the area as grassland. Such differences have
    large impact on the estimation of GHG emissions given the large differences in
    emissions of nitrous oxide and methane from grassland and water bodies. Figure
    1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Representations of polder Zegveld using different
    land cover databases. Comparable findings were reported by Fassnacht et al. (2006)
    who found the class ‘broadleaf trees,’ which forms narrow linear features along
    rivers in the landscape studied, to be particularly susceptible to changes in
    resolution. Ozdogan & Woodcock (2006) also noted that large landscape elements
    can support large pixels, but when the landscape elements of interest are small,
    fine resolution is needed to correctly estimate surface areas. In many landscapes,
    linear or other small land cover types have important impacts on the functioning
    of the hydrological and climatic system (Ellis et al. 2009). Spatial inconsistencies
    may also originate from improper aggregation of the data to the level of analysis.
    The level of aggregation and the aggregation method are extremely important determinants
    of the resulting land use distributions and spatial configurations. Dendoncker
    et al. (2008) compared differences in landscape composition and configuration
    between three aggregation methods and three spatial resolutions. Differences between
    aggregation results were found to be at least as large as the differences between
    the results of widely diverging scenarios of land use change. This study, as well
    as a similar study by Schmit et al. (2006) demonstrated that both the rasterizing
    method and the level of aggregation can become important sources of uncertainty.
    The spatial bias introduced by aggregation is strongly dependent on the landscape
    type and level of analysis. In most studies related to climate change aggregation
    methods are arbitrarily chosen as a result of the software used and hardly ever
    reported. Thematic differences and inconsistencies Different data sources have
    different capacities in capturing specific land use/cover types given the characteristics
    of the observation technique. Each data source will therefore lead to specific
    categorical uncertainties in the final land use/cover data. Categorical uncertainty
    is commonly assessed using a contingency table of agreement between predicted
    and observed values, typically referred to as the confusion matrix (Castilla &
    Hay, 2007). Comparison and assessment of different data sources for the same area
    has shown that some land use/cover types, independent of the data source, are
    easier to delineate than other land use/cover types. For an area in Germany, Bach
    et al. (2006) compared the performance of three different data sets on land use/cover
    with accurate field information. The results showed that the congruency of the
    land use classes forest, urban and traffic areas are higher than the congruency
    of the land use classes of the open land (arable land, pastures and meadows, fallow).
    A similar conclusion was reached by an analysis of global land cover maps at 1 km
    spatial resolution by Herold et al. (2008). The authors harmonized the thematic
    legends of four available global land cover maps (IGBP DISCover, UMD, MODIS 1 km
    and GLC2000), which have arisen from different initiatives and are based on different
    remote sensing data and used different methodologies. Analysis of the agreement
    among the global land cover maps and existing validation information highlights
    general patterns of agreement, inconsistencies and uncertainties. The thematic
    classes of evergreen broadleaf trees, snow and ice and barren show high accuracy
    and good agreement among the data sets. The classes of mixed tree types show high
    inconsistency. Overall, the results show a limited ability of the four global
    products to discriminate mixed classes characterized by a mosaic of trees, shrubs
    and herbaceous vegetation. There is a strong relationship between class accuracy,
    spatial agreement among the data sets and the heterogeneity of landscapes. In
    another comparison between different data sets for Europe, Neumann et al. (2007)
    identify that comparison of different data sets using a similar legend is hampered
    by differences in the thematic content of the classes between maps. Interpreters
    have often used dissimilar definitions of land use/cover classes and used different
    aggregation schemes. Differences in thematic content are also a direct result
    of the specific purpose for which a data set was constructed. A wide range of
    definitions are used for the same land cover class between different data sets
    and inventories. Wadsworth et al. (2008) shows [based on an inventory of Lund
    (2004)] that official definitions of forest include the full range of canopy cover
    between 10% and 80%. Estimates of the Earth''s land surface covered by rangelands
    vary even more and range from 18% to 80% of the earth surface (Lund, 2007). This
    wide range of variation is due to differences in definitions used but also due
    to different estimates of the land surface (inclusive or exclusive ice covered
    surface, etc.) and data source. Large inconsistencies in the definition of rangelands
    are also a result of the lack of an international organization responsible for
    the assessment and reporting on the world''s rangelands as there is for the periodic
    global forest assessments by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
    Nations (FAO) (Lund, 2007; Grainger, 2008). The classification of rangelands is
    especially troublesome in case of sparse tree cover, such as in savannahs. If
    separate definitions of forest and rangeland are used that are not mutually exclusive
    there is a risk of double-counting or underestimating the respective areas with
    major implications for the assessments based on these numbers. Land cover vs.
    land use An important issue underlying differences in area reported is the distinction
    between land use and land cover. Several studies have identified the relation
    of land cover and land use as one of the major challenges for monitoring, modelling
    and communicating land change (Comber, 2008; Verburg et al., 2009). Land cover
    addresses the layer of soils and biomass, including natural vegetation, crops
    and human structures that cover the land surface. Land use in contrast refers
    to the purposes for which humans exploit the land cover (Fresco, 1994; McConnell
    & Moran, 2001). Land use is not always easily observable, although, in many cases,
    land use may be inferred from observable activities (e.g., grazing) or structural
    elements in the landscape (e.g., the presence of logging roads). An example of
    the potential effects of the differences between the land cover and land use definition
    is the documentation of land abandonment. While agricultural statistics indicate
    in Europe a strong decreases of agricultural areas these are, in many cases, not
    observed in data derived from remote sensing. One of the reasons for not being
    able to observe the ongoing process of agricultural abandonment by remote sensing
    is the use of ‘abandoned’ grasslands for other functions, for example horse keeping.
    Although the land cover in these areas remains the same the changing land use
    has large implications for the functioning of the land and the rural economy.
    Because in many countries hobby-horses are not included in agricultural statistics
    the extent and areas used for this type of land use are largely unknown. Many
    authors have also reported large declines of agricultural areas in Europe''s mountain
    areas (MacDonald et al., 2000; Etienne et al., 2003; Tasser et al., 2007). These
    mountain areas are facing two related trajectories of change: part of the meadows
    are more intensively used, while other parts have been converted to pasture or
    have been abandoned (Mottet et al., 2006). These changes in intensity and the
    actual use of the grasslands, either for pasture or hay-making is not observable
    by remote-sensing leading to a discrepancy with agricultural statistics. Methods
    and opportunities to deal with data inconsistencies The differences and inconsistencies
    between data set have been acknowledged by several researchers. Different methods
    are proposed to deal with these inconsistencies and make optimal use of the available
    data. This section will discuss a number of methods for data integration and data
    management that acknowledge the complementarities and inconsistencies of the different
    land use/cover data. Integrating remote sensing and census data Many land cover/use
    data sets combine (sub-)national census data with remote sensing information (Table
    2). Ramankutty et al. (2008) assume that the inventory data represent the ‘true’
    areas of agricultural land (except for identified outliers), while satellite data
    are used to spatially disaggregate these inventory data within each administrative
    unit. This way the strength of the ground observations is combined with the high
    spatial detail of remote sensing data. However, the use of inventories from various,
    national level censuses causes a risk for the use of inconsistent definitions
    of the agricultural land use classes between countries leading to a globally inconsistent
    map. Table 2. Overview of the main characteristics of a number of harmonized,

    land, grazing land, wetlands, irrigated land, inundated land 5 1990–2000 Integration
    techniques have been used in the preparation of data sets for individual countries
    or continents, e.g. Hurtt et al. (2001) combined land use statistics and remote
    sensing data to generate a land use map for the United States, Cardille & Foley
    (2003) combined remote sensing and census data to estimate land cover change in
    the Brazilian Amazon and Pelorosso et al. (2009) used a similar combination to
    detect land use changes for a small area in Central Italy. While many of the data
    sets listed in Table 2 focus on agricultural land, a number of other studies have
    focused on preparing data sets for urban areas. Although urban areas only cover
    relatively small areas at a global scale they may have a large impact on (local)
    climate. For such data sets census data are combined with remote sensing data,
    often complemented with imagery of nighttime lights as an indicator of urban activity
    (Schneider et al., 2009). For climate change studies, the history of land cover
    change is also interesting. Several attempts have been made to reconstruct historic
    land use based on sparse data of human population, potential vegetation, old topographic
    maps and model assumptions. Based on such data, authors prepared global land cover
    reconstructions (Ramankutty & Foley, 1999; Klein Goldewijk, 2001; Wang et al.,
    2006; Pongratz et al., 2008). Ruddiman & Ellis (2009) have used explorations of
    land use change during the Holocene to explain historic trends in atmospheric
    CO2 concentration and have thus been able to better understand the role of land
    use change on historic climate changes. Techniques for integration of different
    remote sensing data Combining different existing land cover data sets into one
    consistent database has the risk of inconsistent use of information and unknown
    sources of uncertainty. Alternative methods have been presented that use primary
    data from different sensors through equalizing thematic and spatial content of
    the data or through change detection techniques. Other methods explore the information
    contained in data inconsistencies to detect land cover changes. Petit & Lambin
    (2001) present a methodology to integrate multisource remote sensing data into
    a homogeneous time series of land cover maps for change detection. The authors
    developed a method to increase the comparability between land cover maps coming
    from panchromatic aerial photographs and SPOT XS (multispectral) data by equalizing
    their levels of thematic content and spatial detail. By controlling successively
    the parameters that influence the level of map generalization, the equalization
    of the thematic content and of the level of spatial detail of the two land cover
    maps can be significantly improved. Postclassification comparison is the most
    common method to detect land cover changes between two images, i.e. the change
    is identified based on a comparison of the interpreted land cover maps of time
    1 and time 2. However, the accuracy of this change detection technique is only
    as good as the result of the multiplication of the accuracies of each individual
    classification. Studies have identified image differencing as being the most accurate
    change detection technique (Macleod & Congalton, 1998; Ridd & Liu, 1998; Petit
    et al., 2001). The difference between two images is calculated by finding the
    difference between each pixel in each image, and generating an image based on
    the result. This method avoids the detection of change as result of differences
    in interpretation of the individual images. For detection of deforestation over
    larger areas, Hansen et al. (2008, 2009) have proposed the use of a combination
    of easily available images with coarse spatial resolution and high-resolution
    images for sample areas used to calibrate the information of the coarse resolution
    images. By using this combination of different image types, the method allows
    for fast monitoring of tropical deforestation across large areas such as the Brazilian
    Amazon and Indonesia. Wadsworth et al. (2008) present a method utilizing aspects
    of quantified conceptual overlaps and semantic-statistical approaches (Comber
    et al. 2005). The method is applied to reconcile three independent land cover
    maps of Siberia, which differ in the number and types of classes, spatial resolution,
    acquisition date, sensor used and purpose. A map of inconsistency scores is presented
    that identifies areas of most likely land cover change based on the maximum inconsistency
    between the maps. The method of quantified conceptual overlaps was used to identify
    regions where further investigations on the causes of the observed inconsistencies
    seem warranted. The method highlights the value of assessing change between inconsistent
    spatial data sets, provided that the inconsistency is adequately considered. A
    common approach to address the problem of classification uncertainty in remote
    sensing and GIS data is fuzzy logic (Woodcock & Gopal, 2000; Robinson, 2003; Fritz
    & See, 2005). Jung et al. (2006) present a straightforward method that merges
    existing land cover data sets into a desired classification legend for a specific
    application. This process follows the idea of convergence of evidence and generates
    a ‘best-estimate’ data set using fuzzy agreement. The authors apply the method
    to develop a new joint 1 km global land cover product (SYNMAP) with improved characteristics
    for land cover parameterization of the carbon cycle models. The overall advantage
    of the SYNMAP legend is that all classes are properly defined in terms of plant
    functional type mixtures, which can be remotely sensed and include the definitions
    of leaf type and longevity for each class with a tree component. See & Fritz (2006)
    have used fuzzy logic to incorporate expert knowledge for comparing the GLC2000
    and the MODIS land cover product. To capture classification uncertainties of both
    data sources the authors mapped spatial disagreement by using a combination of
    fuzzy logic and expert knowledge. Fuzzy membership matrices were generated based
    on knowledge of classification experts to indicate the different levels of difficulty
    in classifying different land cover types and to map spatial disagreement. The
    areas of highest disagreement were validated using additional land cover information
    and a hybrid land cover map was generated by fusion of the GLC2000 and the MODIS
    land cover product. For local scale applications, Alfieri et al. (2007) propose
    a reclassification method to better assign the various parameters needed for land
    surface model simulations in a case study in south-eastern Kansas, USA. Besides
    land use/land cover data sets normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements,
    elevation and slope are used to provide a more accurate data set. Standardization
    and harmonization of land cover data Instead of dealing with limited compatibility
    and comparability of existing land cover data sets and their thematic legends
    others have aimed at improving the flexibility and usability of land cover data
    to avoid a translation of different classification systems and to allow for comparability
    of different data sets (Neumann et al., 2007). International initiatives, such
    as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO), the Global Terrestrial Observing System
    (GTOS), and the Global Observation of Forest and Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC–GOLD),
    foster the establishment of international standards and protocols with respect
    to standardized development and harmonization of land cover data (Herold, 2006).
    These initiatives are largely driven by needs of international conventions (GCOS,
    2004; GEOSS, 2005). An example of an already established strategic and methodological
    framework for harmonization of land cover classification systems is the UN Land
    Cover Classification System (LCCS) (Jansen & Gregorio, 2002; Gregorio, 2005).
    The LCCS applies a flexible but standardized set of classifiers and thresholds
    and is currently evolving as an internationally agreed standard for land cover
    characterization (Herold, 2006). Comparable land cover classification systems
    and understanding of semantic differences between data sets is essential for comparative
    accuracy analyses of different land cover data sets. Harmonization and validation
    of land cover data are therefore often parallel processes. Analogous efforts for
    land use data are still missing since international consensus on the definition
    and classification of land use has not yet been reached (Jansen, 2006). Improved
    validation of land use and land cover data Validation can help the user to select
    the most appropriate land cover or land use map for a specific purpose based on
    its correspondence with field observations or other data of relevance to the specific
    study for which the land use/cover data are prepared. Classical validations use
    field observations to judge the suitability of land cover data. Mostly these compare
    ground observations of land cover with the information in the land cover database
    and the percentage of correctly represented observations is measured. Field observations
    require an enormous investment, especially in case of the validation of global
    data sets; consequently most global data sets have not been validated (Herold,
    2006). Therefore, Iwao et al. (2006) propose the use of Degree Confluence Project
    (DCP) information as a new method for validating land cover maps. The DCP is a
    volunteer-based project that aims to collect onsite information from all the degree
    confluences (intersections of integer level latitude and longitude gridlines)
    in the world. The paper of Iwao et al. (2006) assesses the reliability and effectiveness
    of DCP-derived data in validating land cover maps. DCP-derived validation information
    (at 749 confluences) was used to evaluate existing land cover maps for Eurasia
    (GLC2000, MOD12, UMD and GLCC). The agreements between the DCP-derived validation
    information and the land cover maps were between 50% and 58%. If the confluence
    and its surrounding 1 km square area contain more than one type of land cover,
    it is not always possible to determine whether the DCP-derived validation information
    faithfully represents the land cover of a 1 km square surrounding the confluence,
    leading to potential inconsistencies. The authors indicate that agreement may
    be improved by combining DCP-derived validation information with (visual) interpretation
    of high-resolution imagery (Iwao et al., 2006). For some regions validation efforts
    of global land cover data are even showing lower levels of agreement. Frey & Smith
    (2007) use a large set of ground-based observations to see if global and regional
    land cover products are suitable for climate and ecosystem assessments. The authors
    used a collection of 2161 geolocated, irregularly spaced field observations of
    land cover throughout West Siberia to validate a number of currently available
    global land cover characteristics databases. The study indicated that overall
    agreement with ground observations of land cover is between 11% and 21% only.
    Permanent wetlands and waterbodies are underestimated in all databases. These
    results raise into question the efficacy of incorporating currently available
    land cover products into terrestrial ecosystem models in northern wetland environments.
    In the absence of a consistent global database of field observations, Sterling
    & Ducharne (2008) validate their global land cover maps by comparing the areas
    of land cover with a wide range of estimates from the literature. The comparison,
    based on estimates of anthropogenic land cover show a wide variation in the percentage
    of the earth surface covered by anthropogenic land cover indicating the high degree
    of uncertainty in global maps. Based on these observations, the authors highlight
    the need for improvements in land cover mapping. Especially, the area and distribution
    of grazing land needs to be determined more accurately given its large influence
    on land surface processes. Similar attention is needed to map global tree plantations
    given the large importance and dynamics of timber plantations in North America
    and oil-palm plantations in Southeast Asia. Implications for global change analysis
    and modelling Land cover data and emission inventories The role of land cover
    data in calculating emissions is especially important for the reporting requirements
    for GHG inventories to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) commission.
    To make these country specific reporting as much comparable as possible, guidelines
    and best practice documents were developed (see: http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf_files/Chp2/Chp2_Land_Areas.pdf
    for the full guidelines with respect to the estimation of land cover areas). These
    guidelines address many of the issues raised in this paper regarding proper use
    of the data with respect to harmonization of legends, scaling issues and other
    uncertainties. However, these guidelines actually contain little information on
    how to estimate land areas (changes) and leave it to the individual countries
    to select the land cover data used from a variety of sources (agricultural census
    surveys, forest inventories, and remote sensing data). Although this approach
    enables countries to make best use of existing data, inconsistencies between data
    sources will ultimately lead to inconsistent estimates of emissions that are not
    easily corrected. The choice of data used in emission inventories may have large
    consequences for the resulting emission estimates. Verburg et al. (2006) made
    an assessment of the uncertainties involved in regional estimates of methane emissions
    from rice fields in one of the main rice growing regions of the Philippines. The
    rice area was determined by supervised classification of a radar image (ERS-SAR).
    A comparison between the rice areas derived from the ERS-SAR image and the rice
    area given in the statistical surveys at the level of municipalities shows large
    deviations between the two sources for a number of municipalities (Fig. 2). In
    general, the rice grown area as identified by ERS-SAR is smaller than the area
    reported in statistics (almost 30% for the total study area). Causes for this
    difference include inconsistency in statistical sources due to definitions and
    sampling methods and interpretation and classification problems of the ERS-SAR
    image. Many rice fields are relatively small and irrigation canals and dykes are
    abundant. The small size parcels may lead to an underestimation of the rice area
    in the ERS-SAR interpretation. It is clear that the regional emission of methane
    calculated with the rice area of the ERS-SAR is considerably lower than the emission
    calculated with the statistical data. In comparison to other uncertainties in
    emission estimates for this region, such as model accuracy and upscaling procedure,
    the uncertainty in land cover data is highest. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Rice area per municipality based on interpretation of Radar images
    and as reported in statistical surveys (based on Verburg et al., 2006). Earlier
    in this paper the influence of the spatial resolution of the land cover maps on
    the areas of, respectively, grassland and water bodies in the Dutch Fen Meadow
    landscape was discussed. Nol et al. (2008) assessed the impact of the spatial
    resolution of the land cover data for emissions of nitrous oxide from this region.
    Based on the estimated surface areas, agricultural N2O emissions were estimated
    using different inventory techniques. All four databases of land cover overestimated
    the grassland area when compared to the field map. This caused a considerable
    overestimation of agricultural N2O emissions, ranging from 9% for more detailed
    databases to 11% for the coarsest database. The effect of poor land cover representation
    was larger for an inventory method based on a process model than for inventory
    methods based on simple emission factors. Although the effect of errors in land
    cover representations were, in this study, small compared with the effect of uncertainties
    in emission factors, these effects are systematic (i.e., cause bias) and do not
    cancel out by spatial upscaling. Moreover, bias in land cover representations
    can be quantified or reduced by careful selection of the land cover database (Nol
    et al., 2008). Quaife et al. (2008) show how the use of different land cover maps
    influences calculated large-scale, bottom-up estimates of terrestrial carbon fluxes.
    The authors compare calculated fluxes based on globally available moderate resolution
    satellite-derived land cover maps with fluxes calculated using a reference high
    resolution (25 m) land cover map specific to Great Britain (the Land Cover Map
    2000). The authors demonstrate that uncertainty is introduced into carbon flux
    calculations by (1) incorrect or uncertain assignment of land cover classes to
    plant functional types (PFTs), (2) information loss at coarser resolutions, and
    (3) difficulty in discriminating some vegetation types from satellite data. Differences
    in land use data account for differences between −15.8% and 8.8% in calculated
    Gross Primary Production. Considerations with respect to integrated assessment
    modelling Many models used in global climate studies [e.g., ORCHIDEE (Krinner
    et al., 2005) and LPJmL (Bondeau et al., 2007)] use PFTs as a basis for simulating
    vegetation dynamics. Sterling & Ducharne (2008) indicate that the reclassification
    process of land cover type to plant functional types and especially assigning
    a percentage of bare soil to the land cover types is an important step in land
    surface modelling. The percentage of bare soil drives the major land surface fluxes
    and properties, determining, among others, LAI and albedo. Wang et al. (2006)
    present a table to convert land cover classes to Plant Functional Types using
    available information to make the PFTs as consistent with the land cover description
    as possible but also mention that this translation could be another source of
    uncertainty given the wide range of PFTs possible in one land cover type. Many
    recent integrated assessments of environmental change use a series of coupled
    models instead of one single assessment model. In such approaches often a specific
    model or module dealing with land change is found. This module converts the demands
    for commodities and services into change in land cover areas. These land cover
    changes are allocated within a spatial representation of the landscape being input
    to the emission and climate models (e.g., Rounsevell et al., 2005; Sohl et al.,
    2007; Verburg et al., 2008). The difficulty in translating demands for commodities
    in land cover claims is complicated by the different data sources used in different
    disciplinary traditions. Demands for commodities are often determined by (multi-)sectoral
    economic models and are expressed in the units of the goods or service under consideration,
    such as agricultural production (Meijl et al., 2006; Lotze-campen et al., 2008).
    The conversion of change in the demand for commodities into land cover change
    is not always straightforward. In case of agricultural commodities, farming system
    characteristics such as multiple-cropping, intercropping and other management
    practices need to be accounted for. Expansion of arable area is only one possible
    way of fulfilling an increasing demand for agricultural commodities. In many cases
    intensification by means of increasing inputs, efficiency or cropping intensity
    are a more likely means of fulfilling the demand (Neumann et al., 2010). Similar
    considerations apply to forestry. Increasing wood demands do not necessarily lead
    to deforestation but in many cases to forest degradation or changed management
    practices which are difficult to detect using remote sensing (Lambin, 1999). Most
    land change models focusing on deforestation are only capable of addressing complete
    deforestation and ignore forest degradation. Integrated assessment modelling and
    coupling of economic and geographic models means explicitly dealing with inconsistencies
    between data sources and the difference between land use and land cover. If not
    properly accounted for such differences in underlying data, integrated assessment
    modelling runs the risk of propagating errors due to inconsistent use of data
    across the different models or modules. Conclusions and recommendations Based
    on the review of literature, a number of recommendations are formulated to improve
    the practice of using land use and land cover data in climate change studies.
    Explore and document data inconsistencies and uncertainties Uncertainty assessment
    is an integral part of many climate change studies (Diniz et al., 2009; Brown,
    2010; Hastings et al., 2010). In most analyses, the uncertainty and error in the
    land use/cover data used as input to the assessments is not addressed. Because
    part of the errors and uncertainties in the data may be structured towards under-
    or overestimating a specific land cover type due to observation or aggregation
    bias this may lead to a one-directional error in the climate change assessments.
    It is especially this type of errors and uncertainties that should be given explicit
    attention in climate change assessments. Scientists should use their awareness
    of these inconsistencies and uncertainties in land use/cover data to study the
    implications of these uncertainties for the results of their studies and properly
    communicate those implications. Differences between data sets representing land
    use or land cover are often seen as inconsistencies or errors. However, in many
    cases such differences are the result of different representations of the data
    in terms of classification and temporal and spatial scale. An analysis of the
    underlying reasons for inconsistencies and errors will help to make more appropriate
    use of the data in climate change assessments. Inconsistencies between data may,
    in fact, indicate that complementary information is available which, if properly
    used, may benefit the overall assessment. Many global change assessments regard
    land use/cover data as just one of the many input variables for which easily available
    data are used without explicit consideration of alternative data sources. This
    often results in a mismatch between the characteristics of the data and the use
    of the data in further calculations. Models calibrated with point or field level
    data will, most likely, not perform optimally with coarse scale data (Heuvelink,
    1998). Therefore, a careful selection of the land use/cover data and a documentation
    of this selection for a specific application is mandatory. The risks involved
    in allowing countries to make best use of available data for their emission inventories
    could be reduced by requiring a better documentation of the potential bias involved
    in selecting a specific data source for the inventory. Enhanced guidelines could
    assist in identifying potential bias in inventories to make estimates more comparable
    between countries. Many climate change assessments focus on improving model performance
    and representation, e.g. by moving from Tier 2 to Tier 3 methods in emission inventories.
    While the Tier 2 approach applies (country-specific) emission factors and activity
    data to link land use/cover areas to emissions the Tier 3 approach uses higher-order
    methods including models with a closer link to soil and vegetation processes (IPCC,
    1997). Given the uncertainties involved in land use/cover data and the key role
    of these data in climate change assessments a better balance of research efforts
    between improvement of input data and model representation should be achieved.
    Provide full documentation of land use/cover classifications used For a proper
    selection of data on land use/cover and their intended application it is essential
    to have a clear and extended documentation of the land use or land cover classes.
    Especially in translating the land cover information to PFTs, common in land surface
    modelling, this information is essential. Given the wide variety of definitions
    for the same land cover type, it is not wise to use data without a proper documentation
    of the categories. In spite of many efforts to create uniform descriptions of
    classes a wide variety of definitions exists. This variety also reflects the diverse
    intended applications of the collected data and, in many cases, the categories
    are defined to best suit the application the data are collected for. A proper
    documentation of land use/cover data can best be made in a uniform system. The
    UN LCCS (http://www.glcn.org/) provides guidelines and software for this and is
    now accepted by many users as a proper means for documenting and exchanging documentation
    on land cover classifications. Select data based on the needs for a specific application
    Land cover and land use information is often confused and not explicitly distinguished.
    Most information currently used in climate change assessments is based on remote
    sensing and primarily contains land cover information. However, for many climate
    change assessments management aspects of the land cover are essential. Land use
    may be very different on the same land cover. Grasslands may be natural, intensively
    managed or extensively used with highly different implications for e.g. carbon
    sequestration. Recent efforts to create data sets of land management are an important
    step forward including global and regional inventories of irrigated areas (Siebert
    et al., 2005; Wriedt et al., 2009; Portmann et al., 2010), global data on crop
    yields and fertilizer use (Monfreda et al., 2008; Potter et al., 2010) and methods
    to derive parcel size and structure from remote sensing images (Kuemmerle et al.,
    2009). It is common belief that land use/cover data with high spatial resolution
    are the ‘best’ data. This is not always the case. Thematic resolution or fit of
    the land cover classes with the model description of the processes under investigation
    may be a more important criterion for data quality for a specific application.
    Selection of land use/cover data should therefore primarily be based on the match
    of the data with the model or assessment approach. Several studies have indicated
    the poor fit of global data on land use/cover to specific regions. The classification
    algorithms and categories considered in global studies are not targeted towards
    the specific regional conditions. Therefore, the use of global land use/cover
    data for regional climate change assessments should be avoided. Regional specific
    data often better represent the regional situation and are therefore better suited
    for this level of analysis. Select scaling and aggregation methods based on data
    and landscape characteristics Most studies require edits to the data prior to
    analysis. Such edits include thematic aggregations, geographic projections or
    spatial aggregations. Such changes to the data may influence the characteristics
    of the data and the information contained in the data. Proper documentation of
    the data processing is essential but often lacking. Spatial aggregations may be
    done by different methods with different effects on the data. Some aggregation
    methods lead to an overall loss of information while other aggregation methods
    can structurally change the representation of specific classes in the data depending
    on the prevalence and structure of the classes in the landscape. Different landscapes
    require different aggregation techniques. Methods are available to correct unintended
    bias due to aggregation. Careful documentation of the aggregation methods and
    its effects on the data is essential and researchers may benefit from methods
    for knowledge exchange developed in geographic information science (Fonseca et
    al., 2000; Kuhn, 2001). Combine different data sources when complementary information
    is available Several attempts of integrating different, complementary data sources
    have provided high quality results as well as assessments of the uncertainty of
    the different data sources. By combining the strengths of different data more
    robust and reliable data can be constructed. In many countries and regions, multiple
    data sources that are not yet explored as common sources of land cover data are
    available and could be used to improve remote sensing-derived land cover estimates
    or census-based land use inventories. Examples of such data are for the European
    Union (EU) the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) which was established to monitor
    the effects of the EU common agricultural policy (CAP). Derived from national
    surveys, the FADN contain harmonized micro-economic data, i.e. the bookkeeping
    principles are the same in all countries. The methodology applied aims to provide
    representative data along three dimensions: region, economic size and type of
    farming. This type of data can potentially improve insights in the land use practices
    that land cover data cannot provide. Because of privacy issues the location of
    the sample points is not disclosed, which largely restricts the applicability
    of these data. Another useful data set at the European level are for obtaining
    additional land use/cover data is the LUCAS ‘Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical
    Survey’ pilot project which was launched by Eurostat (European statistical bureau)
    in 2001. In contrast to mapping approaches this project uses area frame sampling
    to collect data. Based on the visual observation of sample geo-referenced points,
    area estimates are computed and used as a valid generalization without studying
    the entire area under investigation. The approach has also the important advantage
    of not involving/disturbing the land owners and the farmers. At European level,
    currently around 250 000 points have been sampled providing an excellent coverage
    of ground observations. A third example of alternative existing data sets that
    may provide useful information on land use are parcel registration systems and
    databases describing cropping practices and agricultural land use at the field
    scale. These data are collected to compute nutrient balances as requested by law
    or to apply for subsidies. Although such data are not always publicly available
    several authors have successfully applied such databases for research purposes
    (Schmit et al., 2006; Lucas et al., 2007). A change in the data policies of the
    responsible institutions for collecting these data adapting to the needs of the
    scientists dealing with global change research would benefit the quality of global
    change assessments. Focus the collection of new data to the most uncertain land
    use/cover types and regions In addition to making most efficient use of existing
    data new data may be collected to improve the representation of land use/cover
    in climate assessments. For newly collected data, documentation of methods and
    uncertainty (including validation) should receive sufficient attention. Documentation
    of the classification of data should follow internationally agreed guidelines.
    For global scale applications, new land cover data should focus on the main uncertainties
    in current data. Most important is the representation of grassland areas. Global
    estimates are deviating largely between current sources. Also the distinction
    between forest and forest plantations deserves explicit attention. Well organized
    campaigns aimed at a combination of remote sensing with ground observations and
    inventory data may improve the representation of grasslands and forest plantations
    in global data sets. Explicitly represent mosaics and/or land use systems in land
    classifications Most land cover data attempt to classify each pixel by the dominant
    land cover. For high spatial resolution data, this may provide a good representation
    of reality. For medium to coarse resolution data, this representation may lead
    to problems since many landscapes contain a mosaic of land cover types. Although
    the classification into one dominant land cover type is convenient in many models
    the characteristic conditions of these mosaic landscapes are disregarded. In terms
    of processes relevant to climate change mosaic landscapes can have specific characteristics
    that may not be represented correctly by the dominant land cover types. A recent
    study indicated that agricultural areas and agro-forestry systems worldwide contain
    large amounts of trees that may not be ignored given their important role in climate
    change processes (Zomer et al., 2009). Therefore, the explicit representation
    of these mosaics as separate classes in land cover data should be considered.
    Besides land cover information land use information is often essential for climate
    change assessments. The same land use may, depending on the local context, represent
    different levels of interaction of humans with the environment. Instead of representing
    the landscape in terms of land cover or land use a representation in terms of
    land use systems that integrate the land cover and management aspects may be considered.
    Ellis & Ramankutty (2008) have attempted to map land use systems, in their terminology
    called anthropogenic biomes (or anthromes). These biomes share a common level
    of interactions between humans and the environment, examples include ‘dense settlements,’‘pastoral
    villages’ and ‘populated rainfed croplands,’ Each of these biomes consists of
    a heterogeneous landscape mosaic combining a variety of different land covers.
    Through some of this heterogeneity might be explained by the relatively coarse
    resolution of the analysis, a more fundamental explanation is that human–environment
    interactions lead to different mosaics due to natural variation in terrain, human
    enhancement of the natural heterogeneity by concentrating activities at the most
    productive locations and heterogeneity caused directly by the specific activity
    types of the considered biome. The use of an anthropogenic biome map instead of
    a conventional biome or land cover map has major advantages given the better representation
    of the human-environment interactions and its intensity that cannot directly be
    observed from land cover data. The collection of data that assist the representation
    of land use systems may be further elaborated by using available information on
    livestock densities (van de Steeg et al., 2010), production efficiencies (Verburg
    et al., 2000), crop types (Monfreda et al., 2008), cropping periods (Sacks et
    al., 2010), remoteness and land management (e.g., fertilizer application). Acknowledgements

    Abstract An analytic framework for tracing three waves of efforts to provide key
    public services in developing countries is provided. Persistent (though not universal)
    failure has been the product of (a) the imperatives of large bureaucracies to
    discount decisions that are inherently both discretionary and transaction-intensive
    (and thus less able to be codified and controlled), and (b) good and bad reasons
    for believing that, because modern bureaucracies underpin rich country prosperity
    now, simply adopting their institutional form elsewhere is the surest way of facilitating
    development. Contemporary debates regarding the merits of incorporating more “participatory”
    approaches into public service delivery are best understood in this context. Previous
    article in issue Next article in issue Keywords service deliverypublic sector
    reformparticipation [T]he need for popular participation is not just sanctimonious
    rubbish. Indeed, the idea of development cannot be disassociated from it (Amartya
    Sen1). The emphasis on empowerment is troubling [because it is, among other things]
    clearly outside the [World] Bank’s mandate [and promotes its] entry into domestic
    politics… [This is an area in which] it has no experience or competence (T.N.
    Srinivasan2). Impact evaluations show that social fund resources are pro-poor,
    and that targeting has improved over time (Julie van Domelen3). The evidence raises
    questions about the effectiveness of [social funds] as a safety net for the poor
    and, more significantly, about the presumed greater desirability of [social funds]
    as an alternative to traditional government supply, or reformed versions of it
    (Judith Tendler4). 1. Introduction This paper emerges from a puzzle among development
    practitioners and scholars––namely, why so many otherwise reasonable, articulate,
    and experienced people arrive at such vastly different and sharply divisive interpretations
    of the merits of new proposals to improve public service delivery under the broad
    banner of “participatory development.” The variety of items on this new menu is
    broad––“Participation,” “Social Funds,” “Community Driven Development,” “Empowerment,”
    “Decentralization,” “NGO provision,” “Contracting out”––but the reviews of the
    new dishes vary widely. Some rave that the new menu items are the greatest thing
    since sliced bread, other critics pan them as not fit for consumption, and still
    others deem them to be in violation of purity norms. Our rather immodest goal
    in this paper is to outline a conceptual framework that arrays the disarray in
    recent development initiatives, with the goal of improving policy dialogue and
    effectiveness, and with it greater coherence in development research and teaching
    as it pertains to the provision of public services. The paper proceeds as follows.
    In Section 2 we consider the broad areas of agreement and disagreement among those
    proposing strategies for improving service delivery in developing countries, and
    define the limits of what we are, and are not, going to discuss. Our primary concern
    is with key services in which the government has compelling interests in engagement,
    and “how”––rather than “what”––it should deliver. To this end, we distinguish
    analytically between both the degree of discretion and transaction intensiveness
    entailed in providing a given service, using this to frame a discussion of development
    “policies,” “programs,” and (what we shall call) “practices.” We then consider
    the five critical elements of service delivery––resources, information, decision-making,
    delivery mechanisms, and accountability. Variations in how these responsibilities
    are structured are used to array traditional and current proposals for improving
    service delivery. In Section 3 we lay out the basic problem of service delivery
    as it was originally conceived, and the characteristics of the single solution
    that was routinely invoked to solve it; we then explain the common structures
    of the failure of that approach in sector after sector, and the three “solutions”
    that were devised to address those failures. These three “solutions” also failed,
    however, which provides the background for Section 4, in which we outline eight
    contemporary approaches to reforming public service delivery: (a) supplier autonomy;
    (b) single sector participatory; (c) contracting out; (d) decentralization to
    states/provinces; (e) decentralization to localities/municipalities; (f) demand-side
    financing; (g) social funds; and (h) community-driven development. Section 5 concludes,
    with a brief discussion of the implications of our analysis for contemporary development
    problems and program design, using AIDS, education, and research as examples.
    2. Agreements and disagreements in public service delivery debates Despite appearances
    to the contrary, the factions in contemporary development debates share a fair
    degree of consensus (cf. Kanbur, 2001). First, most agree the debate about the
    “Washington consensus” is blown far out of proportion.5 At times 90% of the ink
    spilled addresses 10% of the development battle; in the end, no matter who is
    right about trade policy, fiscal deficits and the like, these policies do not
    add up to anything like a complete development agenda. As Rodrik (1999) and others
    have rightly argued, policies such as trade openness, fiscal probity, etc. need
    to be seen as part of, not a substitute for, a coherent development strategy.
    Even the “augmented Washington consensus” that adds the provision of some key
    services (such as education) to the standard policy agenda leaves wide open the
    question of how things will actually be accomplished. In general economists have
    focused their tools on the question of what governments should do, with relatively
    less attention given to the economics and politics of how to accomplish the “what.”
    Second, most agree that the (perhaps very) long-run goal is to ensure that the
    provision of key services such as clean water, education, sanitation, policing,
    safety/sanitary regulation, roads, and public health is assured by effective,
    rules-based, meritocratic, and politically accountable public agencies6––that
    is, something resembling Weberian bureaucracies.7 We call such a world “Denmark.”8
    By “Denmark” we do not, of course, mean Denmark. Rather, we mean the common core
    of the structure of the workings of the public sector in countries usually called
    “developed” (including new arrivals like Singapore). To be sure, there are numerous
    variations on the core “Denmark” ideal; indeed, remarkably similar performance
    outcomes can be and are delivered by different, and culturally distinctive, institutional
    forms––e.g., Denmark, New Zealand,9 Germany, and Japan. The historical evidence
    is surely that while development is likely to entail a convergence in terms of
    institutional performance outcomes, the precise form those institutional arrangements
    actually come to take in each country will continue to be as varied as the countries
    themselves.10 Indeed, as we argue in detail below, the strategy of “skipping straight
    to Weber”––i.e., of seeking to quickly reach service delivery performance goals
    in developing countries by simply mimicking (and/or adopting through colonial
    inheritance) the organizational forms of a particular “Denmark”––has in fact been
    a root cause of the deep problems encountered by developing countries seeking
    to deliver key public services to their citizens.11 Third, most agree that while
    the solution of “skipping straight to Weber” has had some notable successes, it
    has also often failed–– badly.12 That is, development activities (in general,
    and those supported by development agencies in particular) have almost uniformly
    attempted to remedy problems of inadequate services13 (in infrastructure, education,
    health, law enforcement, regulation) by calling upon a centralized bureaucracy
    to supply a top–down and uniform public service. These decisions to “skip straight
    to Weber” were historical, social, and political processes whereby the interactions
    between citizens, the state, and providers were simply overlooked. The solution
    was a coherent approach to service delivery in which a universal need was met
    by a technical (supply) solution, and then implemented by an impersonal, rules-driven,
    provider. That is, “need as the problem, supply as the solution, civil service
    as the instrument” became the standard organizational algorithm for solving public
    services concerns.14 This approach has had some clear successes (e.g., eradicating
    polio), but the (more numerous and pervasive) failures have caused most practitioners
    in developing countries to doubt its universal applicability as the solution.
    Fourth, most agree that the new solutions to the solution (which has now become
    “the problem”) will have two features: first, they will embody something like
    what is conveyed by terms such as “empowerment,” “participation,” “accountability,”
    “transparency,” or “good governance”; and second, how the principles are actually
    embodied in concrete organizational forms will involve a great deal of institutional
    heterogeneity––one size clearly will not fit all in countries as different as
    Canada, Chad, China, and Costa Rica (cf. World Bank, 2003). These broad areas
    of consensus (which we generously presuppose), however, still leave plenty of
    room for serious disagreement. Beyond a broad agreement that the proposals for
    reforming the institutional mechanisms of service delivery represent an attempt
    to move beyond the “Washington consensus” and to find a way to make institutions
    work, to show that context matters and that one size does not fit all, there is
    tremendous disarray in the field:15 indeed, at times it is hard to even know who
    is disagreeing with whom, and why. Unlike most divides in development (and elsewhere),
    in which partisans line up more or less predictably along disciplinary, methodological,
    or political lines, participatory development seems to have exposed new schisms.
    For example, critics on the “left” such as James Scott (1998), in Seeing Like
    a State, provide damning critiques of the impact of governments, while those on
    the “right” such as Hernando de Soto (2000), in The Mystery of Capital, end a
    book extolling the virtues of property rights with an appeal to the power of marginalized
    people to overcome the established order and create new legal institutions for
    safeguarding their property. At the same time, the debate over the performance
    of social funds in Latin America (Carvalho, Perkins, & White, 2002; Tendler, 2000a;
    van Domelen, 2002) has created sharp division among those with otherwise similar
    political and ideological predispositions (“pragmatic center/left”), while critics
    who ordinarily share none of these said dispositions (e.g., Cooke & Kothari, 2001;
    Srinivasan, 2001) unwittingly find common cause in attacking notions such as “empowerment.”
    “One size does not fit all” does not mean that “any size fits any” or “anything
    goes;” without guidance as to which size fits which, it is merely a platitude.
    Moreover, even if “Denmark” is the agreed upon destination, when the starting
    point is anywhere from Mexico to Moldova to Mozambique it should not be all that
    surprising that attempts to map out the best route for getting there, and identifying
    the necessary provisions for the journey, generate deep differences of opinion.
    Is “participation” the new solution to improving project design, or a new form
    of tyranny (Cooke & Kothari, 2001)? Are “social funds” the new instrument to promote
    local development, or an inconvenient but comfortable detour (van Domelen, 2002)?
    Do services implemented through local community organizations more effectively
    include or marginalize the poor (Gugerty & Kremer, 2002)?16 Is “decentralization”
    the answer to “bringing the government closer to the people,” or a cynical ploy
    to cut deficits (Tendler, 1997, Tendler, 2000b)? Is “social capital” a potentially
    useful analytical tool for designing more effective services, or an attempt to
    avoid politics (Harriss, 2002)?17 Is the increased engagement of non-governmental
    organizations (NGOs) in policy dialogue encouraging openness and accountability,
    or is it (as some have argued) the biggest threat to democracy the world faces?
    With so many alternatives on the table and the free debate of all against all,
    the disagreements cut across disciplinary and even ideological lines (with the
    “hard left” and “hard right” critiques often agreeing against the “soft left”).
    How can one make sense of all this confusion? We propose an array of the disarray
    can be found in an analysis that begins with the evolution of the theory and practice
    of public service delivery, in particular the manner in which manifest failures
    were explained and the corresponding “solutions” justified. We argue that the
    variety of alternatives now on the table is a direct response to the solution
    which itself became “the problem” (Hirschman, 1970). (a). Key, discretionary,
    transaction-intensive services: a basic framework Our focus in this paper is on
    the provision of key, discretionary, and transaction-intensive public services.
    Key services are those for which there is a broad consensus that some type of
    government action is necessary, desirable, and/or inevitable––this includes absolutely
    essential functions such as ensuring law and order and maintaining a means of
    payment, through to development programs that have a strong rationale for public
    sector involvement, such as irrigation, sanitation, improved water supply, and
    components of education and health.18 Even if these services are, in principle,
    able to be provided by the private sector, it is highly unlikely the government
    could escape assuming major responsibility for them if/when they failed (e.g.,
    California’s recent electricity crisis).19 Services are discretionary to the extent
    that their delivery requires decisions by providers to be made on the basis of
    information that is important but inherently imperfectly specified and incomplete,
    thereby rendering them unable to be mechanized. As such, these decisions usually
    entail extensive professional (gained via training and/or experience) or informal
    context-specific knowledge.20 In the process of service delivery, discretionary
    decisions are taken which are crucial to a successful outcome; the right decision
    depends on conditions (“states of the world”) that are difficult to assess (ex
    ante or ex post), and hence it is very difficult to monitor whether or not the
    right decision was taken. Transaction intensiveness refers simply to the extent
    to which the delivery of a service (or an element of a service) requires a large
    number of transactions, nearly always involving some face-to-face contact. School
    lunch programs, for example, require numerous cooks and cleaners to show up every
    day to prepare and distribute individually hundreds of meals in a hygienic environment;
    a small committee at a single meeting, on the other hand, can draw up the monthly
    menu. Key services, then, contain elements than can be either discretionary or
    non-discretionary, and transaction intensive or non-transaction intensive. These
    distinctions generate a simple analytical two-by-two classification (see Table
    1), that in turn helps distinguish between some familiar staples of contemporary
    development discourse, namely “policies,” “programs,” and what we shall call “practices.”21
    Table 1. Classifying modes of decision-making in key public services Empty Cell
    Discretionary Non-discretionary Transaction intensive Practices Programs Non-transaction
    intensive Policies (Procedures, rules) We call discretionary but not transaction
    intensive activities policies. The clearest policy examples are in macroeconomics––lowering
    (or raising) the interest rate, devaluing (or not) the currency, setting a fiscal
    deficit target. These are all actions that intrinsically involve assessing the
    state of the world and taking an appropriate action, but implementation itself
    is not transaction intensive. The politics of policy reform may (or may not) require
    mass support politically, but “10 smart people” can handle the actual decisions
    and mechanics of policy reform.22 Their decisions require considerable professional
    training and judgment, and thus cannot be automated. Alan Greenspan is a maestro,
    not a machine.23 In contrast, programs require thousands or millions of individual
    transactions and hence thousands or tens of thousands of “providers,” but each
    transaction can be (reasonably) carried out with relatively little discretion
    on the part of the agent responsible for implementation. In financial matters,
    an example is retail banking transactions, many of which can be carried out by
    a junior clerk (or for the most routine transactions, a machine).24 To implement
    a “program” the agents of the organization need only to stick to a relatively
    fixed “script” (Dobbin, forthcoming; Leonard, 2002), in which the choices are
    few and judging the choice appropriate to the situation relatively easy. The primary
    problems with programs are technical (finding an effective and least cost solution)
    and logistical (carrying out the mandated actions reliably). The provision of
    those elements of services which are (more or less) discretionary and transaction
    intensive––“practices”––provide the biggest headache for even the most astute
    and well-intentioned practitioner,25 because they are intrinsically incompatible
    with the logic and imperatives of large-scale, routinized, administrative control.26
    An analogy from private sector production is the difference between activities
    that can be either carried out in a large bureaucratic setting (e.g., manufacturing
    production) or via a franchise (e.g., fast food restaurants) versus those activities
    that are not amenable to large-scale routinization––witness the generally small
    size (relative to the national market) of most law firms, physician practices,
    universities, household contractors, counselors, fine restaurants, and coaches.27
    While given sectors have relatively more or less of the three types of activity,
    it is not the case that “education” is discretionary and “health” is not; rather,
    within every sector there are examples of each in different stages of the service
    provision process (see Table 2). In health, for example, providing some individualized
    services, such as immunization, in which the appropriate action is nearly the
    same for each individual of a given age (which is easily observed), can be carried
    out as a program. In contrast, the provision of curative medical or psychological
    services, in which the provider is available for and responds to the complaints
    presented by individuals, requires a practice. Table 2. Examples of discretionary
    and transaction intensive services Sector Discretionary, not transaction intensive
    (technocratic “policies”) Discretionary and transaction intensive (idiosyncratic
    “practices”) Transaction intensive, not discretionary (bureaucratic “programs”)
    Commercial banking Setting deposit rates Approving loans to small businesses Taking
    in deposits Social protection Setting eligibility criteria Determining eligibility
    of marginal/special cases Issuing checks to the eligible Law enforcement Law making
    defining criminal behavior Handling individual conflict situations Directing traffic
    Education Curriculum design Classroom teaching Providing school lunches Health
    Public information campaigns Curative care Vaccinations Irrigation Location of
    main canals Allocation of water flows Providing standpipes “in every village”
    Central banks Monetary policy Banking regulation Clearing house Agricultural extension
    Research priorities Communication with farmers Dispensing seeds Policies, then,
    are primarily technocratic; programs are primarily bureaucratic; and practices
    are primarily idiosyncratic. Large organizations, by nature and design, are essentially
    constrained to operate exclusively in terms of policies (determined by “10 smart
    people”) and/or programs (implemented by “ten thousand bureaucrats”). Successful
    practices, when discovered and appreciated by such organizations, immediately
    give rise to a search for other instances, which can then be scrutinized by experts
    to discern their policy implications, and/or codified by rank and file staff into
    a best practice28 handbook, CD-ROM, and training manual for standardized replication.
    Of course, it is entirely desirable that innovative discoveries and effective
    solutions to universal problems (e.g., hand-washing to avoid disease) be rapidly
    disseminated; as we have defined them, however, practices by definition cannot
    be standardized and (easily) replicated. Diligent teachers might share tips about
    what seems to work in the classroom, and the wider dissemination of those tips
    may have a positive impact, but the everyday act of teaching entails making innumerable
    discretionary and transaction-intensive decisions, the effective execution of
    which are deeply embedded in the teacher’s (idiosyncratic) personality and professionalism,
    and the nature of the particular institutional context. (b). Elements of service
    delivery and the principal-agent problem revisited We argue that effective service
    provision depends on the structure of incentives facing providers and recipients,
    which in turn are shaped by five central elements. Comparing these elements helps
    discriminate between the solution of old (need as problem, supply as solution,
    civil service as instrument) and the new menu of solutions. The five elements
    are: (i) Resources. Where does the budget of the service providers come from?––revenue
    from clients, budgetary allocations, some mix? Who retains control of the budget
    flows at what level?––central allocation to functions, discretion at the point
    of service? (ii) Information. Does information flow to and/or from the top? To
    whom (if anyone) is information disseminated? How accessible is that information?
    (iii) Decision-making. What is the scope of decision-making? Over what items do
    providers have de jure and/or de facto control? (iv) Delivery Mechanisms. To whom
    is the service actually provided?––individuals, groups? By whom?––providers in
    large bureaucratic organizations? Are any third party intermediaries involved?––small
    groups, staff of NGOs? (v) Accountability. To whom are service providers accountable?
    What power do they have?––hire and fire, reassignment, compensation? Economists
    (and others) will recognize these five elements as exactly the central items identified
    in the context of institutional and organizational solutions to the “principal-agent”
    problem, particularly with multiple tasks (e.g., Holmstrom, 1999; Holmstrom &
    Milgrom, 1991; Milgrom & Roberts, 1992). This problem arises whenever one actor
    called the principal (e.g., a firm) with one objective (e.g., profit maximization)
    contracts with another actor, called the agent (e.g., an employee), to undertake
    a task that affects the principal’s objective function, knowing the agent may
    have a different objective function (e.g., leisure).29 In this case the problem
    facing the principal is how to structure the incentives for the agent so that
    the agent’s best interest, given those incentives, leads to desirable outcomes
    for the principal. Even within a purely market organization there are principal–agent
    problems that deal with resources (what does the agent work with?), information
    (how does the principal observe agent effort and outcomes?), decision-making (which
    decisions are made by the agent, which by the principal?), delivery mechanisms
    (who does the agent interact with?), and accountability (how does the payoff to
    the agent depend on the agent’s performance?).30 The provision of key, discretionary,
    transaction-intensive services through the public sector is the mother of all
    institutional and organizational design problems. Service providers with discretion
    over actions that are difficult to observe creates contracting problems even in
    private sector organizations,31 but these are much more difficult in the public
    sector, for three reasons. First, there are many levels of the problem, each of
    which can fail: the multitude of citizens (as “principals”) must somehow constrain
    the government (as an “agent” to the citizen) to provide services. But since the
    problem is in the public sector, multiple levels of interaction must be addressed
    simultaneously: between citizens and the government, between government and agencies,
    between agencies and its employees/contractors (the providers), and between citizens
    and providers, and public authorities. But then the government (as “principal”)
    must constrain the behavior of its many departments (as “agents”) to act in the
    government’s best interest, and then each of these departments (e.g., water, education,
    police) must act as a principal to constrain the behavior of its many employees
    (see Wilson, 1989). This necessarily complex structure of the public sector, with
    millions of citizens and tens of thousands of employees, requires institutional
    and organizational patterns that structure the interactions. Second, many activities
    are in the public sector precisely because the market would fail or because it
    is not desirable for the citizens to bear the full cost of the service. This implies
    that many means of disciplining workers available to a market organization (e.g.,
    competition for sales) or to the market as an institution (e.g., competition among
    alternatively structured organizations) are not available to the public sector.
    So, while making consumers bear the full cost of educational services might improve
    pressures for performance of teachers, it would defeat the very objective of government
    involvement in education (see Pritchett, 2003). Third, we are focusing on services
    where discretion is a necessary part of effective service delivery, so taking
    discretion away from agents as a means of control, while it might have advantages
    in terms of reducing the abuse of discretion, also has disadvantages in terms
    of performance outcomes. Moreover, valuable local “practices”––idiosyncratic knowledge
    of variables crucial to the welfare of the poor (e.g., soil conditions, weather
    patterns, water flows)––get squeezed out, even lost completely, in large centralized
    development programs designed to address these issues (cf. Ostrom, 1990; Scott,
    1998). The myriad informal “practices” that indigenous communities in particular
    have evolved over the millennia to address these concerns may be clearly ill-suited
    to the complexity and scale of modern economic life, but the transition from one
    set of mechanisms to the other cannot be made in a single bound. While not attempting
    the transition at all is a prescription for continued poverty, revolutionaries
    from Stalin to Mao to Nyerere to contemporary “shock therapists” have imagined
    that it was actually possible and desirable to ruthlessly “skip straight to Weber”––but
    with patently disastrous results. In the murky middle ground between the public
    services and risk management systems of “Djibouti” and “Denmark” lies the need
    for a much more delicate articulation of the two, an articulation that the technocrats
    and bureaucrats of large development (and other) agencies inherently and inevitable
    struggle to resolve. These more graphic examples of large-scale bureaucratic disaster,
    however, have their counterpart in a host of smaller everyday instances of repeated
    failure by standardized delivery mechanisms to provide basic services to the poor.
    Some of these problems, of course, stem from the fact that in many instances the
    state itself (for whatever reason) was unable and/or unwilling to provide the
    services that citizens wanted. Our concerns, however, apply to systemic services
    failures that routinely occurred even in settings where intentions and resources
    were reasonably good. These failures, it turns out, had a common structure. 3.
    The common structure of the failure of the solution The basic problem with the
    “needs/supply/civil service” solution is that it treated all problems as amenable
    to the logic of policies and programs. How does the solution structure the key
    elements of resources, information, decision-making, delivery mechanisms, and
    accountability? Resources are centralized and canalized. The center collects nearly
    all resources from general taxes, rents, or aid––there are few user fees or local
    taxes––and then allocates them into budgets of line ministries. Information, if
    it exists at all, is tightly controlled and only flows internally and upward (not
    horizontally). Decision-making is done primarily by government agencies and their
    agents, with the discretion of local agents, at least on paper, tightly controlled
    by rules, regulations, and mandates from the top. Delivery mechanisms are via
    line agencies that reach directly from center to the service provider. Accountability
    of the service providers flows internally and upward, with accountability to the
    citizens occurring only via whatever political mechanisms exist for expressing
    discontent (which are characteristically limited in autocratic, authoritarian,
    and totalitarian regimes). Consider rural water supply. At first glance this seems
    like a perfect case for the “needs–supply–civil service delivery” paradigm. After
    all, what could be more of a “need” than a biological necessity such as water,
    especially when the health consequences from insufficient or contaminated water
    sources are so obviously harmful? What problem could more clearly have a supply-side
    solution, for example, developing a low-cost engineering “appropriate technology”
    such as a public standpipe that can be made available to all at virtually no cost
    (since, after all, no one can be denied a need)? “Safe Water For All”––what agenda
    could be more obviously necessary and more eminently doable? The first round of
    government intervention was to launch discrete (often donor-funded) projects that
    would create simple and inexpensive public standpipes. Sometimes it succeeded,
    but sometimes it failed––badly. One recent review of 12,000 standpipes showed
    that breakdown rates fell from 50% when maintenance was the responsibility of
    the national water corporation, to 11% when it was under community control (Narayan,
    1995). But the importance of community input was not the conclusion reached from
    the first round of failures: rather, they were attributed to proximate causes
    and imperfect project design, and so a new round of “better of the same” solutions
    were launched––better training, better technology, better central funding for
    maintenance. Only after the second round of failures were the failures recognized
    as systemic.32 Three systemic failures were generic in rural water supply projects.
    First, decisions about the location and design of the project were made on a “technocratic”
    and “expert” basis almost exclusively; there was little effort to incorporate
    local knowledge (that was often tacit). This led to insufficient knowledge about
    local conditions being taken into account and hence technological mistakes were
    common. This was systemic in that improvement was not simply a matter of identifying
    “better” expert decisions; failure was inherent in the design of projects that
    did not allow for or encourage beneficiary engagement (Isham, Narayan, & Pritchett,
    1995). Second, the assumption that there was a “need” produced a complete lack
    of attention to what people actually wanted from improved water supplies––i.e.,
    to the demand for improved water services. This meant that the systems often did
    not meet the demands of the users, and hence there was little local commitment
    to the projects by the beneficiaries. This low commitment led to low and improper
    maintenance, and chronic underfunding and underprovision of recurrent inputs.
    Third, providers could abuse their discretion. The difficulty of observing in
    detail the quality of the services rendered from either the beneficiaries themselves
    (who were kept in the dark about costs) or from managers above (who did not know
    about beneficiary satisfaction) meant that projects often had considerable “slack.”
    These monies were often siphoned off in various ways to bureaucrats and politicians.
    There were few pressures for cost-efficiency and actual delivery of services.
    Systemic failures led to a revolution in thinking about water supply––that incorporating
    local knowledge was important, that assessing local demand was important, that
    creating open, transparent conditions of supply was important. In water supply
    the shorthand was that water projects had to be more “participatory” at every
    stage––involving beneficiaries in design, in construction (usually with cost contributions
    to demonstrate commitment) and in maintenance (again, usually with some cost recovery).
    The same pattern of problems emerged in irrigation services––the “needs–supply–civil
    service” model led to technologically inappropriate, socially inappropriate, and
    economically inappropriate systems that had low political commitment (Ostrom,
    1990). Formal, technologically superior public systems often replaced locally
    developed communal systems with no impact on agricultural performance. Not surprisingly,
    many of these large public sector projects were often not maintained, provided
    low quality services, and were even corrupt in their delivery (Wade, 1988). Low
    farmer support for modernized systems led to little maintenance effort, and major
    information problems in water allocation. The same problems unfolded in education––the
    “needs–supply–civil service” approach led to schools with standardized curriculum,
    teachers with little training, low local commitment to the school (which was viewed
    as “the government’s” school), excessive devotion of recurrent expenditures to
    wages, little real learning, and high dropout rates. The same pattern of systemic
    failure is evident in agricultural extension––the “needs–supply–civil service”
    model led to extension agents with “packages” that were often not superior to
    existing practices. Few efforts were made at local adaptation in the field; extension
    agents arrived armed with recurrent inputs (modern technologies and techniques)
    to actually reach farmers, and there was a resultant low adoption of “new and
    improved” methods (cf. Isham, 2002). The same problems emerged in the health sector––the
    “needs–supply–civil service” model ensured that some services were provided and
    that some health conditions did sometimes improve, but often the “discretionary
    and transaction intensive” elements did not. The results were clinics without
    adequate staff and recurrent inputs––not just drugs, but basic equipment such
    as scales, and medical practitioners who could listen to villagers and speak in
    terms they could understand. Consumers did not or could not use the facilities
    provided, resulting in a “by-passing” of public primary care services for private,
    traditional, and higher level public facilities. The same pattern was followed
    in family planning––the “needs–supply–civil service” model with a specific mode
    of family planning as the solution led to low-quality services that were not attuned
    to the women, underutilization of public clinics, and reliance on private sector
    suppliers even when they were more expensive. The same thing happened with sanitation.
    The same thing happened with rural road construction and maintenance (see Table
    3). Table 3. Problems, solutions, and symptoms of the “needs–bureaucratic supply”
    approach Sector The “needs” based problem The solution The common symptoms of
    the problem with the solution The common deep structural problems with the solution
    Rural water supply “Need” for safe water calculated from household volume requirements
    and biology based safety standards Public provision of free water through a public
    works program Lack of maintenance leads to rapid depreciation One size fits all;
    scientific, modern, least cost, solutions lead to mistakes and inappropriate supply
    Low consultation leads to low local “ownership” of facilities and services Lack
    of recurrent inputs and low quality services lead to low utilization and the continued
    reliance on traditional community or private sector alternatives Low local discipline
    leads to excessive cost, inefficiency, patronage, and corruption Top down civil
    service organization leads “accountability” to flow “up” the organizational chart,
    not “down” to citizens Attempt at “free” provision demands little commitment from
    local citizens Free provision combined with low and variable governmental revenues
    leads to periodic or chronic recurrent input (O&M) starvation Attempt to control
    service providers from the top down leads to excessive, though often ineffective,
    regulation and imposition of common rules to limit discretion Irrigation “Need”
    for irrigation water calculated from increased cultivation and productivity requirements
    Public provision of main works and canals Primary health care “Need” for basic
    preventive and curative services deduced by health experts Public provision of
    primary health care at clinics provided free or at low cost Roads “Need” for transport
    services calculated from traffic flows Public provision of roads free or low cost
    Education “Need” for formal schooling to achieve enrollment targets Public provision
    of basic schooling provided free or at low cost The same thing happened in all
    these sectors because the common structure of the solution created the common
    conditions for its failure––namely, the lack of feedback mechanisms and modes
    for engagement of citizens in either controlling the state or directly controlling
    providers allowed systemic problems of organizational design to overwhelm logistics.
    But the logic of the solution is so seductive to governments (and donors) alike
    that is has taken decades of painful and expensive failures in sector after sector
    to see that the problem is not just a few mistakes here and there, but that as
    an approach to development, it can be fundamentally wrong-headed from top to bottom.
    Why is this approach so seductive? There are both good and bad reasons. The first
    good reason is that it demonstrably works: “This is how Denmark does it now.”33
    As development was taking off in the late 1950s and early 1960s, every country
    that was developed delivered the bulk of its public services via a civil service.
    In the United States the triumph of the “Progressive Era” agenda was fresh––and
    part of the triumph was defeating the power of local political machines by making
    public service provision less local, less discretionary, less personalized and
    more rational, more scientific, more “modern” (Ackerman, 1999). Moreover, in many
    former colonies the transferred apparatus for governing was already structured
    in exactly this way. The second good reason is that it makes solutions rational,
    modern, scientific, technological, and controllable, while rendering more “legible”
    a host of complex problems and situations (Scott, 1998)––i.e., it makes development
    an “engineering” problem amenable to modern management techniques. If X thousand
    children are to be educated then we need Y classrooms, Z desks, and W teachers,
    which can then be easily mapped into corresponding budgets, targets, goals, and
    plans. Today, the high-profile (and otherwise laudable) Millennium Development
    Goals––with their straightforward (if ambitious) numerical goals––create a fresh
    political impetus to build the most accurate and efficient “model” for identifying
    the “resources” needed for a given country to reach them. The third good reason
    governments (especially in the poorest countries) adopted this approach (at least
    formally) is that it fit perfectly with the interests of the donor agencies, providing
    the latter with a powerful, coherent, and consistent agenda for action at both
    the macro and micro level.34 Nothing fits the internal organization needs of an
    assistance agency better than an objectively quantifiable gap into which resources
    can be poured. Of course, nothing becomes universal on the basis of good reasons
    alone: there were also bad reasons for the triumph of the “needs–supply–civil
    service” approach. This approach left the direct control over the provision of
    “the supply” in government hands, which served a variety of useful purposes. First,
    there was no need for consultation with, and/or creation of, alternative power
    bases among business owners, labor groups, or other civil society organizations.
    Second, complete government control from the top down meant the central government
    was able to reward supporters and punish detractors. Third, direct supply may
    have supplanted local power structures, but it usually did not fundamentally challenge
    them. A final (though speculative) bad reason for the perpetuation of the “needs”
    approach is the blinding nature of the institutional creation myths in the countries
    of the developed world. de Soto’s (2000) account of his investigation into the
    historical origin of a “good” property rights regime in the United States starts
    from the telling insight that no one who operates the property rights regime has
    any idea about its origin and that the true historical origin was exactly the
    opposite of how it was commonly portrayed. Donor activity often amounts to sending
    “experts” who operate institutions in “Denmark” to design institutions in “Djibouti.”
    At best this would be like sending a cab driver to design a car. But it is worse,
    because institutions come with their own foundational myths that deliberately
    obscure the social conflict the institution was designed to solve. That is, political
    institutions as mediators of interactions between bodies of agents arise to solve
    fundamental social conflicts. Often we would argue that part of the institutional
    solution is to pretend the social conflict never existed, with the creation myth
    of the institution including a false historical account as an intrinsic component
    of the operational institutional and organizational vision (cf. Weick, 1995).
    This means that those who operate currently functioning and successful Weberian
    bureaucracies may be sufficiently blinded by their own institutions’ creation
    myths to lack the historical knowledge and political savvy to successfully create
    institutions elsewhere. For both good reasons and bad, then, most developing countries
    “skipped straight to Weber”––that is, adopted the direct government production
    of public services by a civil service bureaucracy within a large political jurisdiction
    (e.g., country, state, province) as the solution. We call this approach “skipping
    straight to Weber” because this form did not emerge from an internal historical
    process of trial and error and a political struggle (as it did in most European
    and North American countries), but rather was “transplanted” more or less intact
    as a top down decision. While debates raged as to what governments should do––from
    mimimalist in neoliberal capitalist states to maximalist in socialist and Marxist
    states––there was very little debate about how governments should do whatever
    it is they were doing.35 The formal institutional and organizational structure
    of delivering education or police or health looked substantially the same whether
    the locale was Rio or Moscow or Chicago. As we saw above, however, the adoption
    of a uniform bureaucratic “supply” in response to various development “needs”
    failed in sector after sector (although it also had notable successes). (a). Three
    failed remedies to the solution: intensification, amputation, policy reform To
    understand fully the current intellectual and practical disarray, one needs to
    understand not only the common structure of failure of the solution, but also
    the responses to the failure. We discuss three: intensification, amputation, and
    (more) policy reform. (i). Intensification As with the water sector, in nearly
    all cases the initial response to failures was to point to proximate, logistical,
    technical causes and attempt to remedy the failures directly, but within exactly
    the same institutional structure––that is, with exactly the same patterns of interactions
    among the agents and hence exactly the same incentives. If pumps are breaking
    down, find a technological fix––a simpler pump. If classroom pedagogy is terrible,
    provide teachers with “more training.” If maintenance expenditures are too low,
    find more funds for maintenance. If there is corruption, launch a program to root
    out corruption. If the health clinics lack drugs, create a new supply chain. We
    are not criticizing these efforts per se––“intensification” solutions are proposed
    by intelligent, motivated, well-meaning professionals trying to address the very
    real implementation problems that present themselves. Sometimes the problem is
    technical and some of these solutions did work in some places––particularly where
    the systemic problems between citizen and state and between providers and citizens
    or the state were not too overwhelming. “Intensification” is a natural reaction,
    a much more natural reaction than considering fundamental reform, for two reasons.
    First, even if those involved perceived the need for more fundamental changes
    they were not within the mandate of those running a particular “program” and there
    was likely a narrow range of alternatives that were perceived as politically feasible.
    Second, a much deeper problem intellectually is that the shortest distance between
    two points is a straight line. That is, if existing institutional and organizational
    forms of service delivery are de jure isomorphic to those in “Denmark,” and if
    “Denmark” is the desired destination, then fundamental reform is not the obvious
    response to failure––incremental reform is much more attractive. Even if the institutional
    and organizational structure is dysfunctional in “Djibouti,” everyone knows that
    the same forms can deliver services––after all, they do deliver services in “Denmark.”
    In many cases proposals for more local autonomy seem a step backwards in the historical
    sequence followed by the now-developed countries. Only after many rounds of failed
    intensification is it acknowledged that, however well services are delivered via
    this structure in “Denmark,” it is not going to work “here.” (ii). Amputation
    The second failed remedy to failing public services was amputation––namely getting
    the government out of it. This was legitimized under various mottos such as “getting
    prices right,” “scaling back the state,” and “privatization” (Handler, 1996).
    This line of reasoning was given impetus by the fact that resource pressures made
    fiscal retrenchment necessary in any case. But while less of a bad thing is less
    of a bad thing, less of a bad thing is not the same as the good thing. The amputation
    strategy does not work for key discretionary and transaction intensive services
    for two reasons. The first is that governments discovered there were several sectors
    from which they could not disassociate themselves (even if it was possible or
    desirable). There is a whole range of activities in which governments could feasibly
    sell existing assets and in doing so liquidate their entire responsibility.36
    There are other activities, however, that even the complete privatization of all
    assets does not absolve the government of its responsibility for continuing to
    play a role. We are focused on the key services where either the services are
    essential (e.g., policing) or the government has a difficult, if not impossible,
    time disassociating itself for responsibility for the service.37 Take the example
    of electricity––while this activity can be privatized in various ways, no government
    can pretend that it is not responsible for electrical power. If people flip the
    switch and nothing happens, there is almost universally a different response if
    the device is a car versus an electric light. If the car fails to start no one
    would blame the government, but if the homeowner’s lights fail to come on the
    government will be held responsible––whether it owns and operates any part of
    the system or not.38 As discussed above, the latter category is what we mean by
    key services in the first place––the provision of these services cannot be a matter
    of indifference to the government. The second reason amputation did not work is
    that making a weak state weaker does not solve the problems that governments need
    to solve. The primary strategy pursued by the central ministries (finance, economy,
    planning) facing macroeconomic constraints on budgets was amputation, while intensification
    (which usually required more money) was the primary strategy desired by all the
    services ministries (education, health, infrastructure). These are obviously incompatible––not
    delivering services with a large budget is very possible, but delivering services
    with no budget is impossible. The reconciliation of “fiscal protection” of desirable
    sectors (health, education) or subsectors (primary education, public health) or
    components of sectors (O&M) is a less than satisfactory alternative, as protecting
    resources does nothing to promote sustained improvement in services. Amputation
    played out in its most extreme form in the transition from socialism. In some
    of the more extreme cases, creaky and ineffective institutions of communism collapsed,
    and were replaced with … nothing. This caricature of the transition to modern
    capitalism has had disastrous results. Those that have had the slowest transitions
    to capitalist policies or those with the most rapid transitions––but either of
    which have managed to maintain the basic capabilities of the state––have done
    much better than countries with more radical reforms which undermined the state
    (see Bunce, 1999). (iii). Policy reform The third response is to deepen policy
    reform––i.e., continue with the types of reforms that can be implemented by “10
    smart people.” That a small(ish) cadre of high-quality technocrats made a huge
    difference to the success of many of the East Asian tigers and to Chile is indisputable.39
    Moreover, some argue that an important component of the success of these technocratic
    elites is precisely that they did not have to engage in broad, open consultative
    processes in deciding on policies. If they had either sufficiently strong support
    (and direction) from the top (e.g., Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan), or sufficient
    “embeddedness” (e.g., Japan), or both (e.g., Korea), a small cadre of well trained,
    highly committed individuals could design and implement macroeconomic and trade
    policies pretty well (even ones that required discretion). Precisely because the
    proverbial “10 smart people” can manage these particular development decisions,
    there is an almost irresistible temptation for these individuals to assume (or
    be given) levels of political power and stature well beyond what they can ever
    actually accomplish; for educators and lobbyists (of all stripes) to focus attention
    on training or influencing them, in the belief that efforts expended here are
    likely to have a disproportionately high impact; to cast a host of complex but
    qualitatively different development problems as technocratic “policy issues” amenable
    to standardized responses; to let an increasingly narrow set of discretionary
    but non-transaction intensive policies (e.g., trade openness) replace more comprehensive
    (and inevitably messier) efforts at designing a broad development strategy (Rodrik,
    1999); and to imagine that the policies adopted by successful developing countries
    can and should be adopted by laggards elsewhere, and that only ignorance, incompetence,
    or indifference prevents it from happening. Forgotten in all five cases is that
    not only do discretionary, non-transaction-intensive decisions constitute one
    part of one development agenda, but that the very success of the decisions themselves
    rests on (indeed is made possible by) the viability of a vast underlying organizational
    infrastructure (both formal and informal). “10 smart people” can make the difficult
    but correct decision about when to shift from first to second gear, but that matters
    little if they fail to note that the car’s breaks, wipers, and turn signals do
    not work, that the tires are bald, that the driver does not have a license, and
    that the road is wet, winding, steep, and full of deep potholes.40 This is amply
    demonstrated in the debate over the virtues and vices of the “Washington consensus”
    (or “Beyond”), which is explicitly, if not implicitly, and singularly about policies.
    Neither side doubts that countries need effective police and effective schools,
    but as one moves beyond “policy” elements the question is not just “what to do”
    but also “how to get it done,” and in transaction-intensive services (such as
    primary school education) identifying a small cadre of elite technocrats cannot
    be the answer. A small cadre cannot make a difference in even a modestly sized
    educational system if they do not change the daily classroom behavior of thousands
    of teachers; a small cadre cannot create a functioning legal system if they do
    not change the daily behavior of the law’s agents on the streets and in the courtroom.
    There is no necessary connection between the sides in a given debate about policies
    and their stance on the appropriate institutions and organizations for discretionary
    transaction-intensive services (“practices”). That is, some argue that policies
    for reducing discretion is a desirable criteria because of time inconsistency
    or political pressures, that a pre-commitment will produce better results than
    more active discretion with regard to monetary rules or exchange rate regimes
    or uniform tariffs or fiscal deficit protocols. In some circumstances this is
    a powerful argument, although certainly not compelling or universal. But we are
    talking about services in which local, day-to-day discretion is an intrinsic part
    of the service; one cannot imagine non-discretionary education or policing or
    agricultural extension or health care.41 “Street level bureaucrats,” “direct providers,”
    “bare foot doctors,” and “front line workers” all need discretion to do their
    jobs, but with discretion there comes the possibility of abuse of discretion.
    One can easily be in favor of reducing discretion of some actors in policies (e.g.,
    independent central banks to limit discretion on monetization of deficits, uniform
    tariffs to limit rent seeking in trade policy, pegged exchange rates) while still
    favoring more community power in schooling, greater voice in local infrastructure,
    higher levels of user participation in irrigation projects, etc. Or vice versa––sometimes
    those advocating more policy discretion are defenders of service delivery via
    civil service bureaucracies that limit local flexibility and service provider
    discretion. This means that any discussion about “empowerment” or “participation”
    or “accountability” in general is bound for incoherence. A working democracy is
    not a series of continuous referenda but a messy collection of institutions that
    allocate, delegate, and limit powers. The structures will be different for each.
    There is nothing incoherent in choosing zero popular participation in the single
    most important macroeconomic decision-making body (e.g., the Federal Reserve)
    and direct community participation in schooling (e.g., autonomous local school
    boards). There is also nothing incoherent in the converse, with civil society
    (in the European sense) concordat to determine wage setting (and hence inflation)
    and schools with nationally controlled curricula and conditions. 4. Where we are
    today: the (dis)array of alternatives There does seem to be a broad consensus
    on objectives and adjectives. Few would disagree that governments should be responsible
    for the provision of key services: children should learn, roads should be passable,
    bridges should not fall down, people should get healthier, water should arrive
    to crops. There is perhaps more, but still little, dispute that to accomplish
    these objectives the institutions and organizations of service delivery should
    satisfy certain adjectives:42 be “accountable,” “sustainable,” “responsive,” and
    “transparent.” There is tremendous controversy as to exactly how to bring about
    such institutions and organizations. Can “participation” really improve outcomes?
    Will “decentralization” really bring government “closer to the people?” What is
    the best way to get to “Denmark?” In the following section, we explore the characteristics
    of eight different answers to these questions that can be found in the contemporary
    literature. (a). Eight responses to the solutions to the solution To recap, in
    the beginning was the problem of poverty, and the answer to the problem was the
    solution: poverty defined as a series of needs, which could best be met (“supplied”)
    through a centralized civil service bureaucracy. When the solution failed, the
    initial response was intensification, amplification, and policy reform. Now that
    these solutions too have failed, and thereby become the problem, a variety of
    new responses have emerged. These responses in fact cohere into eight alternatives
    (see Table 4): (i) Supplier autonomy (Public sector reform II), (ii) Single sector
    participatory, (iii) Contracting out, (iv) Decentralization to states/provinces,
    (v) Decentralization to localities/municipalities, (vi) Demand side financing,
    (vii) Social Funds, and (viii) Community driven development (CDD). Table 4. “The”
    solution and the new alternatives Alternative How flows are structured Resources
    Information Decision-making Delivery mechanisms Accountability “The” solution
    (National Agency) From government to agency then within agency down to providers
    Internal flows up from provider (neither horizontal, nor to “out”) All decisions

    government provider to citizen From providers up hierarchy 1. Supplier autonomy
    Flows to point of service in a flexible way More horizontal flows Provider works

    participatory Government to agency into “programs” Greater information flows to
    local communities Process specified centrally, decisions made locally Local group
    responsible for some functions Still mostly internal to agency, but new criteria
    3. Contracting out From center to agency to contractor As specified in contract,
    usually to contracting party Parameters specified in the contract; all decisions
    made by contractor By employees of the contractor From contractors to contracting
    party 4. Decentralization to states/regions Block grants from center to states/province
    then via agencies Internal flows up from provider By states/provinces, but subject
    to central control From government provider to citizen From providers up hierarchy
    5. Decentralization to “localities” (As above) 6. Demand side financing Government
    directly to citizen Individualized By citizen and provider By provider chosen
    Citizens choose own provider 7. Social funds Government to SF to “communities”/groups/providers
    Information about availability flows “out” By SF office in response to demand,
    implemented locally Contractors working directly for local group SF to government
    8. Community driven development Straight to communities (not local government)
    Localized at community level (out and in) Community chooses project and provider
    has autonomy By provider chosen by community (with government input) Providers
    to communities These eight alternatives on the contemporary development agenda,
    we argue, are all responses to the same underlying problems in the failure of
    the solution. They are alternative mechanisms for changing how resources, information,
    decision-making, delivery mechanisms, and accountability can be changed to improve
    outcomes. Each of these approaches has its proponents and detractors, but the
    questions often boil down to: will the changes proposed be sufficient to change
    outcomes? Though these alternatives are often associated with a given sector,
    it is also the case that all of them can be (and indeed have been) applied to
    a single sector. Schooling, for example, is one activity that everyone agrees
    is a key public responsibility that is a discretionary and transaction intensive
    service. How should schooling be organized? National control has been the norm,
    but recently nearly every one of the eight above alternatives has been attempted:
    federalization (Brazil, Argentina), localization (Indonesia), school autonomy
    (Nicaragua), vouchers (Chile, Czech Republic), community control (EDUCO in El
    Salvador), increased parental involvement, and contracting out to NGOs (Africa)
    have each been touted as the new, legitimate, participatory, accountable, institutional
    heir to the old (failed) development solution. Are all of these right and universalizable?
    Are none of these right in any circumstances? Are some right in some circumstances
    and others in others––if so, then which are which? What is needed in a diagnostic
    decision tree with nodes so that one can move from a concrete problem (e.g., poor
    schooling quality) through a set of empirical criteria––“Is your country poor,
    low-middle, middle, rich?” “Is your country religiously homogenous?” “Are there
    important regional variations in language?”––to a specific solution. But perhaps
    that is the wrong set of questions, and now, with the existing state of empirical
    knowledge, no one even knows what the most important nodes in the decision tree
    are, much less is able to say what the thresholds are. There is currently no theoretical
    or empirical basis for making any claims about what the “right” solution is for
    any sector in any country that has not itself tried the alternatives. Worse, it
    is not clear that in principle the new consensus can provide concrete answers,
    in two deep senses. First, if institutional conditions really do need to be tailored
    to individual circumstances, then conditions for replication elsewhere may simply
    not exist. That is, suppose the Minister of Education in a poor country learns
    that the community control of schooling in El Salvador (EDUCO) has been empirically
    demonstrated to be successful. Should she adapt EDUCO? Maybe, but maybe not. Perhaps
    El Salvador and her country do not share the same “conditions.” But what are the
    conditions for community control to work well? Having the same political system?
    Common language? Colonial heritage? Ethnic homogeneity? Social capital? Low/high
    inequality? Levels of education? To estimate empirically each of these interactive
    effects would require sufficient experiences in each category, but the possible
    variations will rapidly and inevitably outstrip any conceivably empirical experience.
    So as a policymaker working in particular conditions, the Minister is left to
    make her way forward on the basis of vacuous recommendations that “institutions
    matter,” that she should “learn from experience,” adopt “best practices,” and
    then “adapt to individual circumstances.” (b). A pressing example: “policies”
    to “programs” in the AIDS pandemic Though the efficacy of core services provision
    is central to development, we feel there is insufficient focus on the particular
    issues we have highlighted. Nowhere is this more evident than in the responses
    to the terrible tragedy of the AIDS pandemic in Africa. In certain influential
    quarters the core problem is cast exclusively as a “mercy failure” in the provision
    of antiretroviral drugs to combat the symptoms of AIDS. The solution is beating
    a path to foundations, governments, and citizens’ wallets in order to persuade
    them to provide funds for subsidizing the production and distribution of the necessary
    drugs, which will then (presumably) be made available at low cost to the masses
    of those infected through the national health service and/or private (NGO or for
    profit) clinics. The implicit, if not explicit, assumption is that once the funds
    are available and the “mercy failure” has been corrected, effective drugs will
    be available at last, and those suffering from AIDS will flock to their local
    clinic to purchase the medicines they have heretofore been denied. Game over.
    So, as with so many past and present development problems, the solution is the
    solution. The “need” for cheap drugs is “the problem,” the “supply” of the technically
    appropriate pharmaceuticals with subsidies to ensure they are available to the
    poor is “the solution,” and some form of large-scale public or private bureaucratic
    infrastructure is “the instrument” for delivering the final product to its intended
    recipients. Securing this money and using it in this way doubtless has its place,
    but surely constitutes only a part of a strategy that is likely to be effective;
    it is a classic twin response in which the policy technocrats first calculate
    the size of the “gap” and promote it as a “need,” then hand over to bureaucrats
    to implement the transaction-intensive but non-discretionary “program.” This type
    of response to AIDS is consistent with the logic of “bureaucratic high modernism”
    (Scott, 1998), but unfortunately, as we have seen, it is one which has failed
    early and often whenever it has been applied to a socially complex problem not
    amenable to logistics. Virtually every serious analysis of the political economy,
    anthropology, and epidemiology of the AIDS pandemic in Africa, however, stresses
    as the key elements (i) the enormous social stigma that surrounds the issue, preventing
    politicians and religious leaders from openly addressing the subject, (ii) the
    overwhelming power that men exert over the frequency, diversity, and nature of
    sexual encounters, (iii) the role of particular occupational networks in establishing
    disease vectors that enable rapid transmission of the disease among vulnerable
    populations, and (iv) the onerous economic, social, and psychological toll that
    the prolonged illness and eventual death of young adults is having on children,
    surviving household members, and extended kinship systems. Whether on the “prevention”
    or “cure” side (both of which, of course, are needed), dealing systematically
    with stigma, identity, power, networks, and kinship systems is not something amenable
    to routinization and uniform administrative management, but rather entails a legion
    of discretionary and highly transaction-intensive decisions. If the African public
    health experts (and, importantly, the victims themselves) have a more accurate
    sense of what “the problem” actually is, and if the corresponding “solutions”
    are ones that necessarily eschew grand standardized designs, we should be simultaneously
    skeptical of those promoting such designs, unsurprised that there appears to be
    little coherence among the various particularistic strategies that practitioners
    offer, and yet unrelenting in our quest to build the capacity, autonomy, and accountability
    of those making crucial decisions that are necessarily highly discretionary and
    transaction intensive. 5. Conclusion The old king––that agencies of the nation-state
    organized through a bureaucratic (in the good sense) civil service were the development
    solution, or at least, the instrument for the development solution––is dead, wounded
    by disappointing experience and stabbed fatally from both the political left (Scott,
    1998) and political right (de Soto, 2000). But there is no new king, or at least
    not one with the substantive coherence, to take his place. The consensus around
    a long series of statements––“institutions matter,” “improved governance is central,”
    “there are no magic bullets,” “one size does not fit all,” “development should
    be more participatory,” “service providers need to be accountable”––do not add
    up to a consensus about action. In this paper, we have endeavored to provide an
    analytical and historical framework for understanding why there is––and perhaps
    must necessarily be––an absence of a uniform consensus regarding how to improve
    service delivery. Discretionary, transaction-intensive services intrinsically
    embody the tension between two desirable goals for public services––that they
    be “technocratically correct” and that they be “locally responsive.”43 As with
    the tension in a musical string, going too far in either direction leads to disharmony;
    the “right” creative tension depends on particular context and requires constant
    tuning. It is not the case that one of the eight items currently on the development
    menu is inherently “better” than any of the others, yet neither should we conclude
    that therefore “anything goes.” If our analysis is correct, it is the very search
    for a consensus amenable to technocratic “policies” and bureaucratic “programs”––a
    consensus driven by the powerful logic and organizational imperatives of governments,
    donors, and aid agencies––that must be resisted, since a sizeable element of effective
    delivery in those services central to the well-being of the poor (schooling, health
    care, agricultural extension) resides in precisely that area where “policies”
    and “programs” alone cannot go. It is in the tension between the interests and
    incentives of administrators, clients, and front-line providers that the solutions
    (plural) lie (cf. Lipsky, 1980). These tensions––between specialists and the people,
    planners and citizens, authority and autonomy––cannot be escaped; rather, they
    need to be made creative rather than destructive. Moreover, maintaining this creative
    tension is crucial as historical forces (whether secular or intentional) change
    the balance of power between them. If the incessant quest for the solution is,
    in fact, the problem, development professionals need to help create the conditions
    under which genuine experiments to discern the most appropriate local solutions
    to local problems can be nurtured and sustained, while also seeing them as a necessary
    part of a broader and more holistic country development strategy. Acknowledgements

    USAID respected the canons of participatory approach for development interventions
    by involving members of the Rural Community. The application of this approach
    was also aimed at circumventing corruption-led arrangements through other institutions
    that could interfere with equitable access to forests and charcoal production
    and trade (Pritchett and Woolcock, 2004; Smoke, 2007). The project''s creation
    and recognition of FMCs as entities outside of the formal legal politico-administrative
    structure proved to be effective in achieving efficient handling of administrative
    and technical tasks, thus unburdening the Rural Council of activities that it
    would not have been able to conduct due to lack of resources. Show abstract Impartial

    5 An exception is Fine, Lapavitsas, and Pincus (2001). 6 There are two key terminological
    devices in the sentence that allow us to claim consensus. First, we say that provision
    is assured by a public agency. This is consistent with production being entirely
    in the hands of private firms. Even the most radical proposal for an entirely
    voucher-based system of education with no public production of schooling at all,
    for example, would still have some public agency that supervised and regulated
    the process to assure provision. Second, we refer to key services––without specifying
    any particular model for determining which activities are key. We are not asserting
    that key services are public goods (in the economist sense) nor are we asserting
    any other technocratic definition (e.g., public health specialists designate a
    key set of services), nor that any service that becomes publicly provided as the
    result of any political process is therefore key. We are saying that, however
    one defines key services, public responsibility for provision is a consequence.
    7 We use the term Weberian though, of course, “the West” did not invent the public
    sector bureaucracies that Weber described; China and India have had bureaucracies
    for thousands of years. 8 The real Denmark, it should be noted, is presided over
    not by a cold all-encompassing bureaucratic state, but an interesting mixture
    of (latent) royalty, clean democratic government, and vibrant community input.
    9 We want to stress that we are not ignoring the “new public management” literature
    (e.g., Barzelay, 2001; Moore, 1996) made famous by New Zealand’s sweeping public
    sector reforms or the “reinventing government” (Osborne & Gaebler, 1993) movement
    in the United States. These types of reforms, however, build on a fundamentally
    successful set of public services and seek to make them even better (e.g., more
    cost efficient, flexible), and as such do not directly address the problems associated
    with the dysfunctional or inadequate public services characteristic of most developing
    countries. 10 To be clear: we are not invoking some neomodernization theory argument
    that the institutions of developing countries should aspire to look like or emulate
    the institutional features of the West. Contra the claims of those who fret that
    development amounts to “Westernization” (or “colonialism by other means”), in
    50 years time Vietnam’s institutions for public service delivery will most likely
    just be better versions of what they are today, not pale imitations of those in
    Switzerland. This approach also suggests that it is vital to understand how the
    idea and structure of viable public service institutions evolved historically
    (on this, see Chang, 2002; Szreter, 1997). The United States civil service, for
    example, has not always been a model of what we would now call good governance.
    Until the 1880s, public servants appointments were openly familial and political
    (Wilson, 1989). 11 An explicit historical example is the imposition of more or
    less common forms of governance on the Native American groups in the early 20th
    century. As documented by Cornell and Kalt (1992), the extent to which the de
    jure institutions were compatible with social realities strongly determined their
    functionality. 12 We do not wish to paint an entirely bleak picture, as there
    have been successes. The expansion of educational access and the reduction in
    mortality have led to revolutionary improvements in human welfare. There are however,
    failures of several kinds: pure failure, in which the services do not actually
    function even when the physical facilities are present; and the failure to build
    on earlier successes in the expansion of physical access to basic services, to
    the qualitatively more difficult stages of providing high quality services. The
    analysis below hopes to explain both the successes and failures. 13 As we emphasize
    below the idea of “inadequate services” generally characterized those services
    provided by communities or informal mechanisms (that is, not directly provided
    by the civil service apparatus of the state) as inadequate––or ignored them entirely
    (Ostrom, Gardner, & Walker, 1994). 14 Thus the three steps: (a) Define the goal
    as a need––children need education, people need water, farmers need irrigation,
    citizens need health care. (b) Find the least-cost supply solution to the need.
    To be least cost, the solution will have to be standardized so that it can be
    replicated quickly and reliably, and managed efficiently. This generates an imperative
    toward a standardized format for schools, for primary health clinics, for roads,
    for water supply. (c) Implement this solution nationally via the public sector
    and thus by funding (and if necessary expanding) the civil service––a hierarchical,
    impersonal, rule-based organization. 15 The area we address is a subset of the
    larger issue of the general slow progress in the second generation reforms (Naim,
    1994; Navia & Velasco, 2002). 16 For an extended review of the successes and limitations
    of community-based targeting mechanisms in development projects, see Conning and
    Kevane (2002). 17 On social capital’s intellectual and policy career at the World
    Bank, and the various internal and external debates it has generated, see Bebbington,
    Guggenheim, Olson, and Woolcock (2004). 18 We exclude a variety of services about
    which debate rages as to whether public sector involvement is necessary or even
    desirable, such as provision of finance (or micro finance), provision of housing,
    etc. We exclude these not because we have a strong view as to whether governments
    should or should not engage in these activities, but rather because we wish to
    avoid debate about this question of “what” governments should do in favor of the
    question of how services can be delivered. 19 We are self-consciously linking
    across long-standing literatures about organizational and institutional design
    in economics (Arrow, Simon), public administration (March), and private business
    organizational design (Milgrom, Roberts) to relate these to the problems in the
    delivery of key services. We are trying to create a minimalist vocabulary that
    reflects these concerns. 20 Forgive us the potential confusion as “discretionary”
    more appropriately refers to the mode of the arrangement of an activity (which,
    at some level, is an endogenous choice) while we are using the term to refer to
    the underlying characteristics of the activity that lead it to be provided in
    a discretionary manner (or suffer losses from not being provided with arrangements
    that provide for discretion). 21 We has chosen the term practices as it evokes
    (a) what are typically small scale arrangements for the provision of professional
    services––e.g., medical and legal practices, (b) the notion of informal patterns
    of behavior that rely on local conditions or cultures––the local practice, and
    (c) the idea of repetitive action (unlike policies that might require only occasional
    action) but which cannot be codified into a defined algorithm. The fourth logical
    possibility produced by our table, “procedures” (non-discretionary, non-transaction
    intensive decisions) refers to invariant rules. We do not discuss them in any
    detail because such decisions are usually fully automated (i.e., require minimal
    human involvement of any kind). 22 The classic example is the small core of three
    or four technocrat economists who guided macroeconomic policy in Indonesia for
    almost 30 years (often by holding all of the key cabinet positions simultaneously).
    23 The idea of Greenspan as macroeconomic “maestro” comes from Woodward (2000).
    24 The name “programs” has the advantage of following the usual development nomenclature
    (of policies versus practices) but also invoking the idea of a computer program.
    25 Our rendering of “practices” should not be confused with Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit’s
    (1999) intriguing notion of “second-order decisions,” which they define as the
    various strategies adopted in complex environments (by key actors such as judges,
    politicians, administrators) to avoid actually having to make discretionary decisions.
    Our discussion is more akin to, and in some senses builds on, Heifetz’s (1994)
    useful distinction between technical and adaptive decision-making. 26 In policing,
    for example, “studies identified the enormous gap between the practice and the
    image of policing. They identified problems in policing that were not simply the
    product of poor management, but rather reflections of the inherent complexity
    of the police job: informal arrangements… were found to be more common than was
    compliance with formally established procedures; individual police officers were
    found to be routinely exercising a great deal of discretion in deciding how to
    handle the tremendous variety of circumstances with which they were confronted”
    (Goldstein, 1990, p. 8). 27 The exception, that proves the rule, in the “coaching”
    industry (e.g., music lessons, sports instruction) is the emergence of large organizations
    that provided courses that prepare students for a standardized exam. 28 Less ambitiously,
    it is now becoming increasingly common to talk of “good practice.” 29 For an attempt
    to provide an interdisciplinary account of organizational behavior––one stressing
    game theory, leadership, and cooperation within a core principal–agent framework––see
    Miller (1992). 30 This is not to say, of course, that a principal–agent analysis
    exhausts the complexity of the service provision problem. 31 The same elements
    of the difficulty of observation and the need to create incentives explains why
    some activities are (generally) in large organizations while others are carried
    out in relatively small-scale enterprises. 32 Although we have seen donor documents
    where the evaluation of the second round of failed water supply projects (not
    just second failed project, but second generation of failed projects) concludes
    by proposing more of same with some minor fixes. 33 Even if, as noted above, the
    “Denmarks” did not do it this way then, i.e., when they were “poor countries”
    themselves (cf. Chang, 2002). 34 At the macro level, for example, the constraints
    on development were seen as the “savings” gap and the “foreign exchange” gap;
    therefore, having donor institutions provide loans/grants that augmented investment
    in the form of foreign exchange was the right and proper macro instrument. If
    there were more specific supply requirements to meet the needs––especially that
    required foreign exchange––then these could easily be bundled into discrete projects.
    35 In particular, professional economists were very much absorbed in a normative
    framework about the scope for potential Pareto improving interventions by a hypothetical
    welfare maximizing actor, with, until recently, relatively less analysis of the
    internal logic of the performance of public sector organizations. 36 We are taking
    no view on the desirability of privatization per se as there remains a debate
    about activities in which nearly everyone became convinced a government role was
    not desirable: hotels, beer manufacturing, shoe production, textiles, cement,
    etc. and another set of activities about which there was consensus that government
    involvement in production was not essential to economic development, but for which
    there was continued debate about whether government involvement was desirable:
    retail banking, airlines, housing. 37 This “responsibility” is not deduced form
    a formal model, but is rather itself a complex socio-political outcome. That is,
    we are not just referring to those goods with a well-articulated “rationale for
    public sector involvement” in the sense of an economic normative (“public goods”)
    model. 38 “Privatization” in a sector can mean three very different things: “privatization/liquidation”
    (complete disassociation from government reliability (beyond the basics for any
    industry/sector)), “privatization/contracting out” (in which the government continues
    to provide the service (in the sense of bear direct financial responsibility))
    but no longer produces the service, and “privatization/regulation” (in which the
    government neither provides nor produces but does have sector/industry specific
    regulation). 39 See, for example, Amsden (1992), Evans (1995), Haggard (1990),
    Johnson (1990), and Wade (1990). 40 The masterful book by Power (2002) on the
    tragedy of the US failure to end genocide in (among other places) Rwanda, documents
    powerfully the disastrous consequences of narrow technocratic (e.g., “cost-benefit”)
    decision making by a small cadre of outsiders in situations that patently cannot
    be managed this way. This was also the theme of David Halberstam’s (1973) classic,
    The Best and the Brightest, on how US engagement in the Vietnam War was designed
    and carried out. 41 On the challenges of delivering discretionary and transaction-intensive
    services (e.g., social work, policing, welfare assistance, legal aid) in the United
    States, see the classic study by Lipsky (1980). 42 We rule out lots of the rhetoric
    as unhelpful tautologies, e.g., that “governance” should be “better.” 43 Hayes
    (1968, p. xiii) expressed this tension well in the 1968 preface to the paperback
    edition of his 1959 classic on the history of the conservation movement in early
    20th century America: Examination of the evolution of conservation political struggles,
    therefore, brings into sharp focus two competing political systems in American.
    On the one hand the spirit of science and technology, of rational system and organization,
    shifted the location of decision making continually upward so as to narrow the
    range of influences impinging on it and to guide that decision making with large,
    cosmopolitan considerations, technical expertness, and the objectives of those
    involved in the wider networks of a modern society. These forces tended toward
    a more closed system of decision making. On the other, however, were a host of
    political impulses, often separate and conflicting, diffuse and struggling against
    each other within the larger political order. Their political activities sustained
    a more open political system, in which the range of alternatives remained wide
    and always available for adoption, in which complex and esoteric facts possessed
    by only a few were not permitted to dominate the process of decision-making, and
    the satisfaction of grass-roots impulses remained a constantly viable element
    of the political order. View Abstract Copyright © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

    2013   Published: 5 September 2013 Abstract Physiological and developmental traits
    that vary over time are difficult to phenotype under relevant growing conditions.
    In this light, we developed a novel system for phenotyping dynamic traits in the
    field. System performance was evaluated on 25 Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense
    L.) cultivars grown in 2011 at Maricopa, Arizona. Field-grown plants were irrigated
    under well watered and water-limited conditions, with measurements taken at different
    times on 3 days in July and August. The system carried four sets of sensors to
    measure canopy height, reflectance and temperature simultaneously on four adjacent
    rows, enabling the collection of phenotypic data at a rate of 0.84 ha h–1. Measurements
    of canopy height, normalised difference vegetation index and temperature all showed
    large differences among cultivars and expected interactions of cultivars with
    water regime and time of day. Broad-sense heritabilities (H2)were highest for
    canopy height (H2 = 0.86–0.96), followed by the more environmentally sensitive
    normalised difference vegetation index (H2 = 0.28–0.90) and temperature (H2 = 0.01–0.90)
    traits. We also found a strong agreement (r2 = 0.35–0.82) between values obtained
    by the system, and values from aerial imagery and manual phenotyping approaches.
    Taken together, these results confirmed the ability of the phenotyping system
    to measure multiple traits rapidly and accurately. Additional keywords: cotton,

    Get rights and content Abstract The increasing penetration of renewable energy
    sources (RES) in power systems intensifies the need of enhancing the flexibility
    in grid operations in order to accommodate the uncertain power output of the leading
    RES such as wind and solar generation. Utilities have been recently showing increasing
    interest in developing Demand Response (DR) programs in order to match generation
    and demand in a more efficient way. Incentive- and price-based DR programs aim
    at enabling the demand side in order to achieve a range of operational and economic
    advantages, towards developing a more sustainable power system structure. The
    contribution of the presented study is twofold. First, a complete and up-to-date
    overview of DR enabling technologies, programs and consumer response types is
    presented. Furthermore, the benefits and the drivers that have motivated the adoption
    of DR programs, as well as the barriers that may hinder their further development,
    are thoroughly discussed. Second, the international DR status quo is identified
    by extensively reviewing existing programs in different regions. Previous article
    in issue Next article in issue Keywords Demand ResponseRenewable energy sourcesBenefits
    and barriersEnabling technologiesPractical evidence 1. Introduction One of the
    main concerns of Independent System Operators (ISOs) has been the fact that electric
    power demand may significantly vary during the day, season and year and the production
    facilities should be suitably dispatched in all time periods in order to satisfy
    it. The demand side has been traditionally considered relatively inelastic and
    therefore, the generation side should be adapted in order to fully supply it.
    However, a series of drivers such as the Climate Change, the increasing penetration
    of renewable energy sources (RES) and the consequent increased need for enhancing
    the flexibility in system operations, the target of improving energy efficiency
    and the need to defer costly investments have motivated efforts aiming at enabling
    the active participation of the demand side in power system operational procedures.
    The activities through which the activation of the demand side is attempted are
    commonly referred to as demand side management (DSM). The Electric Power Research
    Institute (EPRI) has defined DSM as follows [1]: “DSM is the planning, implementation
    and monitoring of those utility activities designed to influence customer use
    of electricity in ways that will produce desired changes in the utility''s load
    shape, i.e. time pattern and magnitude of a utility''s load. Utility programs
    falling under the umbrella of DSM include load management, new uses, strategic
    conservation, electrification, customer generation and adjustments in market share”.
    The concept of DSM can be considered mature (especially for industrial consumers)
    with many efforts to reduce or shift the consumption of end-users in order to
    reduce the stress on power system assets, especially in critical peak demand periods.
    Demand side management comprises four actions: energy efficiency, savings, self-production
    and load management [2]. Among the DSM solutions, load management techniques and
    especially demand response (DR) strategies are gaining more attention in power
    system operations recently, driven by the increasing interest in implementing
    the smart grid concept. DR is defined as “changes in electric usage by end-use
    customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the
    price of electricity over time, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower
    electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability
    is jeopardized” by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and comprises incentive-based
    and price-based programs [3]. Facilitated by the advancement in smart grid enabling
    technologies such as the implementation of Information and Communications Technology
    (ICT) in the power system, the growing numbers of intelligent energy management
    systems (EMSs) in end-user premises, smart grid compatible advanced metering infrastructure
    (AMI), etc., DR strategies have been adopted by ISOs in leading countries around
    the world. Apart from technical studies, there is a broad literature of DSM and
    DR reviews considering different aspects, which can be classified in three main
    categories: i) a general DSM/DR overview followed by recommendations for future
    developments, ii) an overview of DSM/DR status focusing on a particular part of
    the world (i.e., a specific country or region), iii) an overview of DSM/DR for
    a specific implementation (e.g., specific consumer type). In the first category,
    Albadi and El-Saadany presented a concise review of the DR benefits from the participant,
    market and reliability perspectives and analysed a DR scheme based on market simulations
    [4]. Babar et al. [5] provided an overview of the applicability of the agility
    concept in DR programs, aiming at increasing customers’ satisfaction and promote
    market responsiveness. O’Connell et al. analysed the benefits (from the operation,
    planning and economic points of view) and challenges (from the perspective of
    market regulation, end-user acceptability and business schemes) related to DR,
    including a broad literature review on DR modelling assumptions without emphasizing
    on real world examples [6]. Li et al. [7] provided a review study on the potential
    of different demand side resources, such as controllable loads and electric vehicles,
    to be engaged in DR activities. Bossmann and Eser [8] focused on the review of
    studies concerning model-based assessment of DR measures. Siano performed a general
    survey on smart grids and DR; however, without giving specific importance to neither
    benefits/barriers nor real-world examples of DR programs [9]. Another general
    review on DSM considering DR, intelligent energy systems and smart loads was performed
    by Palensky and Dietrich [10]. Kotskova et al. performed a review on load management
    including DR strategies, providing also a small number of real examples [11].
    Aghaei and Alizadeh conducted a general analysis of DR strategies, emphasizing
    on the application of DR in accommodating the varying nature of RES, presenting
    also a limited number of DR implementation examples [12]. Gelazanskas and Gamage
    briefly analysed the benefits and the drivers of DSM and proposed a demand control
    strategy without a further overview of other DSM and DR relevant topics [13].
    Wang et al. presented an overview of real-time markets around the world (especially
    in North America, Australia and Europe), focusing on the technical analysis of
    DR integration [14]. Hu et al. analysed the existing dynamic pricing programs
    in the U.S. and Europe, presenting also real examples, program targets, enabling
    technologies and policy issues; yet, incentive-based programs and the analysis
    of the benefits and challenges were not considered [15]. Shen et al. reviewed
    the role of regulatory reforms, market structure changes and technological developments
    in rendering DR more viable in the electric power system [16]. In a detailed review
    study, Varkadas et al. examined DR types, requirements and enabling technologies,
    presenting also some real examples from around the world, as well as optimization
    methods for DR applications with a broad review of relevant literature studies
    [17]. However, [17] did not discuss the drivers that promote DR, available DR
    programs in different regions, as well as the reasons for which DR is not currently
    evenly developed around the world. In the second category, Strbac reviewed the
    benefits and challenges of DSM, specifically for the UK electric power system
    [18]. Similar to [18], Bradley et al. performed a review-based analysis for the
    UK in order to evaluate the possible benefits and required costs for wider penetration
    of DR [19]. Warren considered the UK case from the policy point of view for DSM
    applications [20]. Ming et al. [21] and Harish and Kumar [22] examined the cases
    of China and India, respectively, in terms of historical evolution of DSM applications
    together with future expectations. Dong et al. [23] focused also on the potential
    of DR in China, analysing regulatory issues and providing information about relevant
    pilot projects. In the third category, Gyamfi et al. examined a specific DR application
    area concerning residential end-users by reviewing the impacts of behavioural
    changes of different residential end-user profiles on the success of DR strategies
    [24]. Soares et al. also analysed the residential end-user behaviour focusing
    particularly on DR using domestic appliances [25]. Muratori et al. considered
    residential DR from the electricity market point of view [26]. Khan et al. analysed
    the correlation between the success of DR and the technological advancement in
    Home EMSs (HEMSs) [27]. Esther and Kumar [28] surveyed architectures, approaches
    and optimization models for residential DR. Haider et al. [29] also discussed
    the current status of residential DR and the relevant strategies, as well as the
    ICT requirements. Merkert et al. examined the challenges and opportunities of
    applying DSM solutions in industrial end-users supported by a set of real industrial
    case studies [30]. Finally, Zehir et al. [31] analysed the impacts of volatility
    related to distributed generation and considered different DR approaches to accommodate
    it. The objectives of this study, which also define its main contributions with
    respect to existing studies, are as follows: • To constitute a reference point
    regarding a) the DR enabling control, metering and communication technology, b)
    different DR and consumer response types, c) the potential benefits of DR, d)
    the current status of DR development globally, and e) the barriers to the development
    of DR, by reviewing these aspects in a comprehensive manner. • To present a remarkable
    number of real-life application examples covering several countries and regions
    in order to thoroughly evaluate the global DR status quo and to examine in-depth
    the key-elements that affect the integration of different kinds of DR solutions
    in regions with different economic, environmental and political conditions. The
    remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview
    of DR enabling technologies and DR strategies related to end-user types. Section
    3 discusses the benefits and drivers of adopting DR strategies in electric power
    systems. Section 4 presents a broad analysis of practical evidence related to
    DR across the world with numerous real examples. Section 5 performs a detailed
    analysis of the barriers to DR development from different perspectives. The study
    is concluded with final remarks in Section 6. 2. General overview of DR 2.1. Overview
    of enabling technologies DSM and DR programs have been practically enabled because
    of the evolution of the technology required to physically implement them. In this
    section a discussion on the required metering, control and communication infrastructure
    is provided. 2.1.1. Metering and control infrastructure Among the different components
    of the enabling infrastructure, smart meters and AMI are the vital for implementing
    DR strategies. Smart meters are new generation electronic meters that have the
    capability of bi-directional communication between the end-user and the load serving
    entity (LSE). For DR activities, smart meters can receive signals from the LSE,
    such as the maximum allowed level of power procurement in a certain period (e.g.,
    to reduce the loading of a local transformer) or price signals determined in a
    dynamic way. Besides, AMI is a network of millions of smart meters [32]. Smart
    meter and AMI penetration across the world is increasing rapidly and many pilot
    projects were implemented in the last decade. A mapping of Smart Metering Projects
    across the world can be found in [33]. In order to provide automated control for
    a more effective participation in a DR program, whether it is price- or incentive-based,
    EMS structures in end-user areas (residential, commercial or industrial buildings,
    etc.) are also critical components. A common EMS structure receives information
    signals from the controllable/non-controllable loads of the end-user, including
    the state of the appliance, its power consumption, etc. Also, the EMS may receive
    information regarding the available production from RES or conventional self-production
    units. Besides, all the signals of the LSE including instructions during DR events,
    pricing data, etc., are transferred to the EMS through the AMI. By considering
    all the input information, the EMS decides the optimal operating strategy for
    the end-user, aiming at satisfying both the requirements of the LSE that calls
    for DR and the end-user, in terms of not compromising the fulfilment of the service
    the electricity is used for. As regards the current state of EMS adoption around
    the world, major regional differences can be noticed. The U.S. is a leader in
    the adoption of EMS, and especially in the HEMS market. European utilities are
    also supporting relevant pilot projects [34]. Nevertheless, one may argue that
    since benefits for both the consumers and the utilities have been broadly recognized
    and due to the fact that numerous major companies (including Siemens, Intel, etc.)
    have already rendered commercially available EMS products [35], their penetration
    in the short-term future is likely to increase in residential, commercial and
    industrial areas. 2.1.2. Communication infrastructure A pivotal requirement for
    an effective DR implementation is the capability of handling a significant amount
    of data transfer. A low-latency, moderate bandwidth communication path between
    the parties involved (LSEs, end-user EMS, loads to be controlled, etc.) in a DR
    action is an essential prerequisite to achieve this. Here, latency corresponds
    to the delay between the time that a request is sent by the procuring party and
    the time at which the responding party receives the request and therefore, can
    act accordingly. Moreover, bandwidth corresponds to the data-transfer rate of
    each enabling device in the communication path [36]. The aforementioned low-latency
    and moderate bandwidth specifications are significantly important for the effective
    transfer of DR commands and the rapid implementation of relevant responses to
    ensure an improved performance of a DR strategy. Three domains of data communications
    are considered in the implementation of a DR program: the smart meter domain,
    the Internet domain and the home area network (HAN). Note that the HAN domain
    is a general term that may also refer to residential, industrial and commercial
    end-user premises. The smart meter domain is the AMI structure previously discussed
    and it consists of a network of a large number of smart meters. The Internet domain
    (the cloud) that is used as the computing and information management platform
    by the IT industry is the general public Internet accessed through service providers.
    The HAN is the gateway to the Internet and smart meter domains for controllable
    loads, appliances and their interactions with the EMSs within the end-user premises
    [32,37]. The EMS receives signals from the LSE through the smart meter domain
    and implements actions through the HAN. The Internet is the interface through
    which multiple systems having Internet Protocol (IP) can meet to communicate in
    order to provide a desired task, e.g., direct load control (DLC) over suitable
    loads in the end-user premises. There are also some other definitions for communication
    domains, such as Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN)
    that represent the range of the communication area for the DR enabling communication
    infrastructure [38]. Many communication mechanisms are suitable in terms of being
    able to meet the latency and bandwidth criteria in different data communication
    domains. In general, the aforementioned communication technologies can be categorized
    as wireless and wired technologies. Wireless communication technologies have the
    advantage of lower investment costs due to avoiding additional wiring costs. Besides,
    the flexibility of the end-points is increased because wireless signals can reach
    areas where physical connection is problematic. However, these technologies are
    more prone to signal losses during propagation, a fact that limits their effective
    range. Furthermore, significantly stronger security mechanisms are necessary for
    wireless technologies in order to avoid unauthorized access. ZigBee, Z-wave, Wi-Fi,
    Wi-MAX, cognitive radio and recent cellular technologies can be presented as major
    wireless communication technologies suitable for many communication areas of a
    DR enabling smart grid operation [39]. Wired communication technologies can use
    the existing power lines or an external wiring for signal transmission. Existing
    wired technologies include power line communication (PLC), Fiber-optics, Ethernet,
    etc. Whether wired or wireless technologies are employed, the scalability and
    replicability, availability, reliability and security of the considered solutions
    should be further analysed for the specific application area in order to ensure
    a successful DR implementation [40]. A deeper analysis of communication infrastructure
    technologies and relevant requirements can be found in [38,[41], [42], [43]. 2.1.3.
    Protocols and standards There are many efforts to standardise DR related smart
    grid operational aspects across the world. The U.S. National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) is forming a regulatory framework in order to create common
    smart grid interoperability standards by involving stakeholders and partners from
    the industry, the government, and the academia. In the short-term, the smart grid
    standard version 1.0 is planned to be announced with the aim to be augmented in
    versions 2.0, 3.0, and beyond [44]. IEEE has also numerous standards relevant
    to the smart grid operations available, including a significant number of standards
    having strong relationship to the DR implementation, especially from the communications
    point of view [45]. Apart from the NIST and the IEEE driven standardization approaches
    for DR related smart grid operations, there are also different standardization
    studies taking place. For example, OpenADR is a DoE approved standard developed
    by the “DR Research Center” focusing on the communications data model for sending
    and receiving DR signals from a LSE or an ISO to the customers, and vice-versa
    [46]. Australia and New Zealand have a common AS/NZS 4755.3.2 standard bearing
    the title “DR capabilities supporting technologies for electrical products” [47].
    There are also many other standardization studies regarding DR, especially in
    North America [48] and followed by Australia and Europe, including also the evaluation
    of DR as a business scheme, a fact which indicates that in the near future more
    standards will be available. 2.2. Classification of DR DR programs may be classified
    either by their type (motivation method and trigger criteria) or according to
    the way in which the enrolled consumers respond according to the characterization
    of their load. 2.2.1. Types of DR programs Based on their type, DR programs may
    be categorized as incentive-based or price-based DR programs [4]. The main difference
    between the programs that fall under each of these categories is that in incentive-based
    programs the customers are offered payments in order to deliver a specific amount
    of load reduction over a given time period, while in price-based DR programs consumers
    voluntarily provide load reductions by responding to economic signals. 2.2.1.1.
    Incentive-based DR 2.2.1.1.1. Direct load control The target of DLC programs is
    to engage a large number of small consumers (e.g. residential). Through such programs
    the utility may directly control a specific type of appliances in the end-user
    premises. Typical examples are air conditioners (ACs), lighting, water heating,
    pool pumps, etc. [49]. These programs typically define the number and the duration
    of interruptions in order not to compromise the end-users’ comfort level. The
    participation of the end-user is compensated through discounts or benefits in
    the electricity bill and potentially by extra payments for being called. These
    programs are managed by the utility and as a result the end-user is not pre-notified
    for an interruption. DLC events may be triggered by economic or reliability events.
    2.2.1.1.2. Curtailable load Curtailable load programs are addressed to medium
    and large consumers. Participants in these programs receive incentives in order
    to turn off specific loads or even to interrupt their energy usage, responding
    to calls emitted by the utility. Like in the case of DLC programs, contracts should
    specify the maximum number and the duration of calls. These programs are mandatory,
    i.e. customers may face penalties in case they fail to respond to a DR event.
    Utilities may call the consumer to respond to reliability events; however, load
    curtailments may also be traded in the market [49], [50]. 2.2.1.1.3. Demand side
    bidding, capacity and ancillary services The option of demand side bidding provides
    the opportunity to consumers to actively participate in the electricity market
    by submitting load reduction offers. Large customers may participate in the market
    directly and usually employ sophisticated load management tools and strategies,
    while relatively small consumers can participate indirectly through third-party
    aggregators or LSEs [51]. The demand side may also participate in capacity and
    ancillary services markets, providing a variety of system services in different
    time scales (regulation, spinning reserve etc.) [52]. A demand side bid may have
    the form presented in Fig. 1. Similar to the bids that are submitted by generators,
    the bids from the demand may be single or duplex, simple or complex. A single
    bid pertains the participation only in one market structure, while a duplex bid
    refers to a bid that pertains the coupled participation in two different markets
    (e.g. energy and reserve) [53]. Moreover, the bid may consist of only price-quantity
    pairs, i.e. simple bid, or it may be a complex bid incorporating technical conditions
    such as minimum energy consumption ( ), maximum energy consumption ( ), total
    energy over the considered horizon (e.g. daily), load pickup and drop rates, etc.
    [54]. The only difference between generation side and demand side bids is that
    the latter are downward. In Fig. 1 the negative slope, assuming without loss of
    generality a linear relationship between price and consumption, indicates that
    the demand would accept to consume energy ( ) as long as its bid is less or equal
    to the market clearing price ( ). In case the demand side is eligible to submit
    a duplex bid, then quantity-price offers for upward ( ) and downward ( , ) reserve
    should be also provided. It should also be noted that voluntarily providing reserves
    during emergency situations is also referred to as emergency DR [10]. Download

    Example of demand side bidding. 2.2.1.2. Price-based DR 2.2.1.2.1. Time-of-use
    tariffs Electricity end-users that are charged with flat prices are not aware
    of the varying cost of electricity. Flat rates depict average electricity supplying
    costs and may remain constant for years. The basic idea behind time-of-use (TOU)
    pricing is to better reflect the variations of the electricity provision cost
    with time, in different periods within a day or a season [50]. TOU pricing is
    a stepped rate structure which intends to reflect prices under average market
    conditions with respect to the time of the day during which electricity is consumed
    and does not capture the day-to-day volatility of supply costs. A typical TOU
    structure includes a peak rate, an off-peak rate and potentially a shoulder-peak
    rate [49], for time periods defined by the utility. 2.2.1.2.2. Critical peak pricing
    Time-of-use tariffs reflect the longer term electricity supply costs associated
    with using electricity during a specific period of the day. In order to capture
    the short-term costs of periods which are considered critical for the power system,
    critical peak pricing (CPP) may be employed. The CPP tariff stands for the superimposition
    of a time-independent high rate on TOU or flat rates, triggered by system criteria
    (e.g. unavailability of reserves, extreme weather conditions that cause unexpected
    variations in demand, etc.). The relevant contracts specify the maximum number
    of days per year that may be considered critical and the number of periods for
    which the CPP rate applies. However, the utility communicates a CPP event in a
    very short notice, from several minutes up to several hours before the CPP rate
    applies. There are also two variants of CPP, namely the Extreme Day pricing (EDP)
    and the Extreme Day CPP. EDP charges higher prices for electricity but, unlike
    CPP, once EDP rates are called they remain active for all the 24 h of the “Extreme
    Day”. Extreme day CPP programs use peak and off-peak rates like CPP programs,
    but only on extreme days. For the other days a flat rate applies [4], [49], [55].
    2.2.1.2.3. Real-time pricing Real-time pricing (RTP) is a pricing scheme in which
    the energy price is updated at a very short notice, typically hourly. Through
    RTP customers are directly exposed to the variability of the cost in the wholesale
    power market or to the changes in locational or zonal marginal prices. Currently,
    there are two noticeable RTP programs engaging residential end-users in the U.S.,
    one by PJM [56] and one by the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) [57]. Both communicate
    the day-ahead market prices one day before the actual power delivery; however,
    the way in which they price the consumers differs. In the first program, end-users
    are priced according to the real-time prices that are settled in the end of an
    hour in the actual dispatch day and are the averaged 5-min prices of that hour,
    while in the second program consumers are directly priced according to the day-ahead
    prices. 2.2.2. Customer response 2.2.2.1. Industrial customers The energy consumption
    by industrial customers represents a major portion of the total electric energy
    produced. It has been reported that for many utilities 2–10% of the industrial
    consumers are responsible for at least 80% of the electricity usage [58]. Paulus
    and Borggrefe [59] have investigated the potential of DSM in energy-intensive
    industrial customers in Germany, arguing that the highest economic potential can
    be found in large-scale processes that rely on a single source to satisfy their
    energy demand. In Germany the annual electricity demand of the 250 different branches
    of the industrial sector is 252.6 TW h, while the technical potential of the investigated
    industrial processes for DR (tertiary positive reserves) is 2660 MW. Similarly,
    the Swedish Government has provided the energy-intensive companies the opportunity
    to benefit from reduced taxation on electricity use on the condition that they
    take energy efficiency measures [60]. The aforementioned facts demonstrate that
    the industrial sector is suitable for developing DR programs. However, adopting
    DR programs may be challenging for the industrial firms. For commercial and residential
    customers, DR entails potential temporary loss of comfort (e.g. by controlling
    ACs). On the other hand, industrial customers may reduce their demand by on-site
    generation, energy storage, consumption shifting, non-critical load curtailment
    and temporary shut-down of several processes. Temporarily interrupting one or
    more processes may result in significant load reductions. Nevertheless, several
    constraints such as the criticality of a process, the number of available production
    lines, the required production target, inventory restrictions, etc., may have
    longer term impacts on the process line, rendering DR economically inefficient
    [58]. Due to their technical requirements several processes such as steel production
    using electric arc furnaces, cement milling and aluminium electrolysis are only
    suitable for load shedding, while others such as chloralkali electrolysis and
    mechanical refining of wood pulp can be shifted [59]. To efficiently provide DR
    services, industrial consumers must be equipped with an automated decision system
    that considers the technical constraints of the processes and the alternative
    energy sources available. In [61], Ding et al. have proposed such a system that
    performs optimal scheduling of the industrial load considering constraints posed
    by the processes while considering the possibility of self-generation and energy
    storage. Furthermore, Paterakis et al. [62] have proposed a stochastic optimization
    model through which large industrial consumers can provide energy and reserve
    services in the day-ahead market in order to balance the uncertain wind production.
    2.2.2.2. Commercial and other non-residential customers Commercial and other types
    of non-residential premises can also provide DR for load reduction or ancillary
    services. AC is the most significant load that can be controlled. In [63] the
    capability of providing spinning reserve from a hotel was demonstrated. The preliminary
    tests indicated that apart from the quick response, the load could be curtailed
    up to 37% depending on the outdoors temperature. Furthermore, large commercial
    heating-ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems provide easier access
    to a single, significantly larger demand side resource than aggregating large
    numbers of smaller residential loads, while automation equipment that is already
    present in most large commercial buildings may be exploited in order reduce the
    infrastructure costs associated with the implementation of DR programs [64]. Moreover,
    due to the large space that commercial buildings occupy, they present higher thermal
    inertia, allowing for longer interruptions. Also, HVAC systems employ variable
    frequency drives (VFD), the speed and power of which can be quickly and continuously
    adjusted, following the regulation signal provided by the system operator in order
    to provide regulation reserve [65]. Recently, the idea of energy intelligent buildings
    that monitor their energy consumption and manage locally available resources as
    well as the energy procurement from the grid has been introduced [66]. In [67]
    a control and scheduling architecture for offices was proposed in order to take
    advantage of RTP DR by controlling a range of loads (e.g. lighting). 2.2.2.3.
    Residential customers Residential customers are suitable for DLC and price-based
    DR programs. Apart from shifting load manually in response to price signals, residential
    customers may invest on an automated system, namely a HEMS, which monitors and
    controls the consumption of several appliances [68]. Typical appliances that can
    be found in most households and are suitable for being scheduled by the HEMS in
    response to time-varying prices or to be rendered available for direct control
    by the utility are: electric water heaters, ACs, refrigerators, washing machines,
    clothes dryers and dishwashers. The first three loads are thermostatically controllable
    while the other three when equipped with communication modules are called smart
    appliances. There is an abundant literature suggesting models and identifying
    the potential of the residential sector to participate in DR programs in order
    to provide various system services such as regulation and spinning reserves. For
    example, [69] investigates the potential of a household equipped with a HEMS to
    provide frequency response, [70] examines the potential of load flexibility provided
    by smart appliances in order to participate in reserve services, [71] employs
    a model of ACs in order to provide reserves by DLC through an aggregator and,
    finally, [72] performs a similar analysis for electric water heaters. 2.2.2.4.
    Electric vehicles Currently, the market share of electric vehicles (EVs) is relatively
    low, limited to a few hundreds of registered cars in most industrialized countries.
    As a result, the impacts of the EVs on the power system, namely the increase in
    energy consumption, are not currently evident [73]; however, as the electrification
    of the transport sector is expected to be intensified in the future, significant
    challenges to the integration of large EV fleets may occur [74], [75]. In order
    to facilitate the integration of EVs in the future, two technical measures that
    belong to the category of DR have been proposed: 1) controlled unidirectional
    charging, 2) controlled bi-directional charging, more commonly known as vehicle-to-grid
    (V2G). The foreseen benefits of implementing such techniques are threefold. First,
    a fleet of EVs may be employed in order to perform peak shaving and valley filling,
    improving the economic efficiency of the power system [76]. Second, EVs could
    increase the price elasticity of residential end-users since the EV charging load
    would render electricity procurement an important cost for the households [73].
    Third, fleets of EVs could be used in order to provide balancing services to facilitate
    the integration of RES [77]. 2.2.2.5. Data centers Data centers are an emerging
    type of consumer that in the recent years has known significant growth both in
    size and energy consumption. For this reason, a 2007 report from the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency has suggested that data centers should adopt DR strategies in
    order to reduce the strain on the power system [78]. Irwin et al. [79] have identified
    three main reasons for which data centers are eligible candidate customer types
    for DR. First, data centers are major energy consumers and therefore have a significant
    impact on the power system conditions. Second, their task is tolerant of delays
    and performance degradations, a fact that makes data centers highly price responsive.
    Third, servers are already equipped with power management mechanisms that are
    remotely programmable and therefore, the power may be accurately adjusted according
    to the provided signals. Masanet et al. [80] found that during 2008 the annual
    energy consumption of the data centers could have been reduced by 80%, while several
    other studies address the feasibility of DR provision from data centers [81].
    Data centers are also considered capable of providing a range of ancillary services
    [82]. Regulation services are constantly active and data centers could adjust
    their consumption according to the signals sent by the grid operator every few
    seconds. Furthermore, by transitioning a number of active servers to the sleep
    state, data centers may provide short-term operating reserves or emergency DR.
    After the event, servers are transitioned from sleep mode back to a normal operating
    state. Data centers typically possess two further assets that increase the value
    and the flexibility of the provided reserves: backup generators and uninterruptible
    power sources (UPS). The former may be used in order to provide ancillary services
    to the grid without interrupting the workload, while the UPS could be used in
    order to permit longer time response. 3. DR benefits and drivers DR has the potential
    to offer a diverse range of benefits depending on the design and the aim of the
    specific DR implementation. In this section the benefits of DR are presented and
    discussed, especially focusing on the possible contribution of DR to the integration
    of high amounts of intermittent renewable generation into the power system. The
    benefits for the ISOs, the electricity market and its participants are also identified.
    3.1. The role of DR in facilitating the integration of intermittent generation
    Large scale integration of RES in power systems plays a central role in ambitious
    programs initiated by leading countries around the world, such as the regional
    greenhouse gas emission control schemes in the U.S. and the 20/20/20 targets in
    the European Union (EU) [83]. Among the different RES, wind and solar capacity
    is expected to increase significantly in the future [84], [85]. In the U.S. wind
    is expected to grow from 31 TW h in 2008 to 1160 TW h by 2030, which stands for
    a target of 20% of the total supply, while solar capacity is anticipated to reach
    16 GW by 2020 [86]. Similar tendency is noticed in the EU as well. For example,
    the target for the electricity generation share of the wind in Ireland is set
    to 40% by 2020 [87]. Despite the potential environmental benefits that arise from
    the widespread adoption of wind and solar power generation, their highly uncertain
    nature may jeopardize the security of the power system and pose new technical
    and economic challenges to ISOs. These challenges primarily stem from the fact
    that these resources are highly varying with time, their predictability is limited
    and they are not controllable, i.e. they cannot be modified by instruction in
    order to economically match the load [87]. For example, in Fig. 2 the total hourly
    production of wind and solar parks in the island of Crete, Greece, for three consecutive
    days in April 2012 is presented [88]. As it can be noticed, the wind production
    ranges between 10 and 125 MW in a time span of less than 24 h, while it presents
    significant fluctuations in shorter time frames. On the other hand, despite the
    fact that the solar production is available only during the day-time, it presents
    a more stable hourly pattern in this case; however, its intra-hourly behaviour
    may be significantly variable. Download : Download high-res image (189KB) Download

    island of Crete (10–12/04/2012) [88]. The majority of existing power systems has
    been designed considering the fluctuations of the demand. Nevertheless, it is
    questionable whether the grid can serve both varying loads and high amounts of
    variable generation such as wind and solar. In order to accommodate the additional
    uncertainty, an increased amount of reserves should be maintained. Especially
    regulation and load-following needs, both in terms of capacity and ramping capability,
    are likely to be augmented with the increasing penetration of wind and solar generation.
    Generators providing regulation and load-following reserves incur significant
    costs such as efficiency loss because of ramping, environmental costs due to increased
    emissions, increased wear and tear and, therefore, increased operating and maintenance
    costs. Furthermore, in order to provide reserve services, a generator must operate
    partly-loaded, a fact that entails lost opportunity costs in the energy market
    [89]. As the share of RES increases, peaking and intermediate (cycling) units
    are likely to be displaced. In addition to that, several base load plants may
    need to be operated in a cycling manner, a function for which they are not designed
    because their operation is subject to long start-up, minimum up, down and decommissioning
    times. These issues can be resolved by the participation of the demand side in
    the load following reserves through appropriately designed DR programs. Certain
    types of loads such as ACs and electric space heaters have the ability to adjust
    their power to changes in demand instantaneously [90], while the ramp rates of
    conventional generators are limited. Moreover, it is argued that the ancillary
    services provided by the demand side may prove more reliable since the reliability
    of the response of an aggregation of a significant number of loads is greater
    than the one of a small number of large generators [91]. Another important issue
    that is primarily linked to the wind generation and can be tackled with the utilization
    of DR activities is the wind “over-generation” [92]. This problem appears when
    high wind generation is available during off-peak periods, during the night or
    early in the day. For example, in Fig. 2 one may notice high wind generation in
    the night between April 10 and April 11, 2012. In such cases, due to the fact
    that most markets consider the wind power generators as must-run, either the output
    of the conventional generation must be reduced in order to accommodate the wind
    generation, or the excessive wind energy should be curtailed, an option that may
    bear high penalties, in order to maintain the balance of the system. The situation
    escalates when the system comprises relatively inflexible base load generators
    that are committed to operate near their technical minimum power outputs during
    such periods. In general, operating generating units at lower output or cycling
    base load units may compromise the environmental benefits of integrating wind
    power in the system. Typically, the consumption of fuel and the emissions of generators
    increase when they operate at a low capacity. Evidently, one solution that DR
    can offer is the increase in the demand in periods in which there is excessive
    wind power generation. Loads that can be shifted in such a way that allows the
    otherwise spilled wind energy to be absorbed include water pumping, irrigation,
    municipal treatment facilities, and thermal storage in large buildings, industrial
    electrolysis, aluminium smelting, etc. [93]. O’Connel et al. [6] highlight another
    consequence of increased RES penetration which the coordinated planning and operation
    of generation and DR could ease, contributing to substantial welfare gains. Power
    systems with increased wind penetration tend to depend on the interconnections
    in order to balance the grid. However, the deployment of DR may enable the economically
    efficient use of interconnections, since the spatial characteristics of wind may
    adversely affect the prices of the energy exchange depending on the scarcity of
    wind power generation, because nearby regions are likely to experience high or
    low wind power generation simultaneously. Finally, environmental targets will
    intensify the electrification of the transportation sector in the future in order
    to displace the use of petroleum, a fact that presents a significant opportunity
    for DR activities in favour of a better integration of renewable energy in the
    power system. Fleets of EVs could act as aggregations of distributed energy storage,
    while their charging could be controlled. Through the V2G option they could act
    as an energy buffer to improve the grid regulation and other ancillary services.
    These issues are thoroughly discussed in [94]. 3.2. Benefits for the system DR
    is recognized to have potential system-wide benefits. Many utilities, especially
    in the U.S., are obliged by regulatory or legislative requirements to consider
    DR in their resource planning [95], while the Energy Efficiency Directive [96]
    of the EU states that the planning process should consider the peak shaving effect
    of DR. The traditional approach to network upgrading considers that the demand
    grows gradually and as a result a portion of the added grid capacity will eventually
    remain unexploited since the longer term forecasting of the load growth is uncertain
    and, therefore, network reinforcement tends to be economically inefficient in
    order to be on the safe-side. In general, the network expansion is planned considering
    a long technical life-span (several decades), e.g. more than 50 years for Norwegian
    Transmission System Operators (TSOs) [97]. Typically, new investments are triggered
    because of an anticipated increase in the load. DR can contribute to a reduced
    forecasted peak demand, since long-term DR programs will be implicitly taken into
    account in the peak demand forecasts [98]. Thus, network investments may be postponed.
    Furthermore, the uncertainty in the load evolution can affect the efficiency of
    a system reinforcement investment. More specifically, it is possible that the
    demand for electricity may decline, increasing the idle capacity of the system
    and, therefore, the operating cost of the network per unit of output [99]. On
    the other hand, DR programs may preventively contribute to confront an upward
    deviation of demand [100]. DR programs that aim to enhance the distribution system
    operation can also bring a series of benefits. Problems related to the voltage
    magnitude, distribution substation congestion and losses can be mitigated by DR
    activities at the distribution level. Electrical equipment is designed for optimum
    operation at the nominal voltage. Any deviation from this can result in decreased
    efficiency, damage or severely reduced life of the infrastructure [101]. Furthermore,
    congestion management can reduce the active power losses and improve the overall
    system reliability [102]. The distributed nature and the spatial diversity of
    demand can be exploited in order to eliminate congestions and, therefore, reduced
    loading of transformers and lines can defer or render redundant the need for costly
    upgrades and allow an increased penetration of distributed generation [6]. Also,
    a demonstration on the village of Hartley Bay, British Columbia, Canada, rendered
    evident how DR can be used in order to enhance the economic and supply efficiency
    of a remote community [103]. Currently, the total capacity of installed generation
    must be larger than the system maximum demand in order to guarantee the security
    of supply under contingencies or severe demand variations. Strbac has demonstrated
    that the frequency of large energy deficits is very rare [18]. DR can be a preferable
    choice in order to contemplate relatively small energy deficits. A striking example
    is the crisis in California in June 2000 in which a shortage of 300 MW (around
    0.6% of the total system capacity) caused rolling blackouts [101]. As a result,
    DR may serve as an alternative to the investment in new power plants that would
    be underutilized in order to provide capacity reserves [50]. DR has another important
    side advantage to offer to the system, aiding the ISOs to render the power system
    more environmentally sustainable. Apart from facilitating a better integration
    of renewable generation in the system, as it was previously discussed, DR may
    improve the overall energy efficiency and mitigate the reliance on fossil fuels.
    A recent fact sheet regarding the DR implementation in the MISO [104] has demonstrated
    that DR programs which cycle residential appliances such as ACs can actually decrease
    the overall electricity consumption, promoting energy efficiency. Furthermore,
    the reduced utilization of peaking power plants that are less efficient in order
    to cover high demand may contribute to the reduction of the carbon footprint of
    the system. It is characteristically reported that in California the carbon intensity
    of the power system can be up to 33% higher in peak times in comparison with off-peak
    times. Finally, considering DR as an equal option when it comes to the system
    planning, the construction of more conventional power plants may be avoided. 3.3.
    Benefits for the market and its participants It is widely argued that the active
    participation of demand side resources could improve the performance of electricity
    markets and bring significant benefits to the consumers. Regarding the positive
    effects of DR on electricity markets, three key elements may be identified: •
    Lower and more stable electricity prices. • Control of market power. • Economic
    benefits for the consumers. In order to demonstrate the two first points, without
    loss of generality the simplified example that is presented in Fig. 3 can be employed,
    which corresponds to markets in which the uniform spot price of electricity is
    defined by the intersection of the aggregated supply and demand curves, e.g. Nordpool
    [105]. The market operator collects the generation and demand side bids and sorts
    them with respect to their prices. The aggregated supply curve is upward while
    the aggregated demand curve is downward. Close to the maximum capacity of the
    system the bids tend to increase exponentially [4]. The fact that the supply curve
    becomes steeper as the energy quantity increases may be the consequence of the
    profit maximizing behaviour of the generators or can be attributed to the higher
    operating costs of peaking units. In such cases, a small reduction in the demand
    may induce a significant reduction in the market price [98]. The effect of price
    responsive demand on the market clearing prices was investigated in [106]. A similar
    analysis is carried out for markets that adopt Locational Marginal Prices (LMP)
    in [107]. Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that several crises in electricity
    markets have been linked to the absence of DR programs [108]. For example, it
    has been reported that a small decrease in the demand of the scale of 5% could
    have yielded a reduction of 50% in electricity price during the California electricity
    crisis in 2000 [4]. One of the reasons that lead to the electricity crisis of
    California is related to the structure of deregulated markets and the fact that
    generators do not behave as purely competitive firms. As a result, this market
    design is prone to market manipulation by large generators. Market monitoring
    is a way to address this issue; however, the economic and technical deficiencies
    of this approach have led to the enforcement of price caps, which in turn limits
    the potential of peaking units to recover their investment costs [109]. DR may
    prove beneficial in reducing both supplier and locational market power, limiting
    the ability of large producers to manipulate the price of electricity. The market
    clearing price is the value at which the marginal revenue of the supply equals
    the marginal benefit of the demand, thus constituting an equilibrium point (E1).
    If the demand curve is steep (DC1), i.e. the demand is not price-responsive, then
    the generation side may attempt to manipulate electricity prices by submitting
    more costly bids. This implies shifting the initial supply curve (SC1) upwards
    (SC2) and the new corresponding equilibrium point (E2) corresponds to an increased
    price . However, in case the demand side is price-responsive, then the market
    leverage is limited, achieving a different equilibrium point (E3) that corresponds
    to a lower price . In addition to this, Siano [9] reports several other relevant
    benefits: the increase in the number of suppliers in the market through the improvement
    in the market competition, reduced concentration and restriction of collusion.
    Appropriate price-based DR programs and a sufficient amount of responsive demand
    may alleviate the need for price caps and stringent market monitoring. Download

    An illustration of the effect of responsive demand in electricity markets. Allowing
    consumers to respond to dynamic electricity prices has two anticipated effects
    that are also commonly referred to as “flattening” of the system load profile:
    peak shaving during high price periods and load shifting to relatively low price
    periods. In this way, the magnitude of the wholesale and the retail prices can
    be reduced while the price spikes and the volatility of the spot market can be
    mitigated [110]. As a result, in the long-run, benefits can also emerge for the
    consumers that do not participate in DR programs, since the lower wholesale market
    prices due to sustained DR programs are likely to cause a decrease in the flat
    retail rates as well [101]. Furthermore, the transition from flat tariffs to time
    varying prices is thought to increase the consumer and societal welfare [6]. Regarding
    small customers (e.g. residential), Allcott [111] indicates that the increase
    in consumer welfare is not significant since the electricity costs represent only
    a small portion of their overall expenses; however, it results in an increase
    in the overall social welfare. On the other hand, responding to time varying pricing
    definitely contributes to the increase in the welfare of larger commercial and
    industrial consumers [112]. Besides, a study concerning the DR economic welfare
    analysis in the PJM market has demonstrated a net benefit for the system that
    exceeds the total annual subsidy payments [113]. 4. Practical evidence 4.1. North
    America As it was reported by the Transparency Market Research, North America
    was the leading region in the DR capacity market in 2013, accounting for more
    than 80% of the global market share, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific [114].
    Thus, the analysis of DR examples in North America is significantly useful in
    order to observe the trends in this leading part of the global smart grid sector.
    4.1.1. United States 4.1.1.1. Major States of the U.S 4.1.1.1.1. California California
    is the state with the greatest population in the U.S. reaching nearly 40 million
    people [115] and therefore, offers a considerable potential for the development
    of DR programs. Pacific Gas&Electric Company (PG&E) offers the so-called “SmartAC”
    program to its commercial and residential customers, targeting at controlling
    ACs by cycling aggregated AC load during occasional summer peaks caused mainly
    due to the simultaneous operation of hundreds of thousands of ACs. For commercial
    customers PG&E ensures that the temperature in the working area will not exceed
    the nominal temperature setting by more than four degrees, while in case that
    the AC cycling event happens in an inconvenient time the customer can refuse to
    respond without facing a penalty. From a technical perspective, PG&E realizes
    this program by installing thermostats with communication capability that allows
    remotely raising the temperature setting of the enrolled ACs up to four degrees
    when necessary. A similar program offered to residential end-users provides 50$
    for a 6-month participation period and the SmartAC remotely controllable device
    that directs the AC to run at a lower capacity during energy shortages for free.
    The AC settings can also be manually restored if the response to a DR event is
    inconvenient for the end-user. For larger customers, PG&E offers a range of DR
    programs such as peak day pricing, base interruptible program, demand bidding
    program, scheduled load reduction program, optional binding mandatory curtailment
    plan as business programs, aggregator managed portfolio and capacity bidding program
    as aggregator programs and automated DR incentive and permanent load shift as
    incentive-based programs. In the Peak Day Pricing Program (PDPD), a discount on
    regular summer electricity prices is offered in exchange for higher prices during
    the 9–15 Peak Pricing Event Days per year that normally occur during the hottest
    days of the summer, encouraging energy conservation during these days with higher
    demand. A surcharge is added to the regular time-of-use rate during the event
    and a pre-alert is sent to the end-user the day before in order to plan the energy
    conservation or shifting. A risk-free option is also proposed for the first 12
    months providing a credit for the difference, if more is paid during the first
    year on PDPD. The Base Interruptible Program (BIP) offers an incentive to the
    end-user to reduce the load demand to or below a pre-selected level (firm service
    level – FIL). By giving an advanced notification of 30 min, an incentive of 8–9$/kW
    per month is provided while a monthly incentive payment is also given if no DR
    events occur. However, a charge of 6$/kW is imposed for the extra demand over
    the pre-selected level if the end-user fails to reduce its load to or below its
    FIL during an event. The limit of BIP is 10 events per month or 120 h per year.
    The Demand Bidding Program (DBP) is a day-ahead program that allows submitting
    load reduction bids on an hourly basis without imposing financial penalties if
    the customer fails to meet its committed reduction. DBP ensures a day-ahead notice
    by 12:00 p.m. and offers an incentive payment of 0.50$/kWh of load reduction,
    having the minimum requirement of load reduction bids of 10 kW for two consecutive
    hours. As the PG&E is not obliged to call a DBP event, there is not an incentive
    given if the end-user enrolled in the DBP is not called within the monthly period
    and there is no penalty if the end-user fails to reduce the energy during the
    event periods. The Scheduled Load Reduction Program (SLRP) offers a payment for
    a load reduction during pre-selected time periods for customers with a minimum
    average monthly demand of 100 kW by selecting one to three four-hour time periods
    between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on one or more weekdays with a committed load reduction
    of at least 15% of the average monthly demand. The load reductions are measured
    considering a baseline that is calculated by averaging the load demand of the
    selected time periods in the 10 previous normal operating days. The SLRP offers
    a payment of 0.10$/kWh per month for the actual energy reductions. The Optional
    Binding Mandatory Curtailment (OBMC) Plan of PG&E concerns customers that can
    reduce their electric load within 15 min after a call by achieving 15% load reduction
    below their established baseline that is calculated as in the SLRP. The benefit
    of the customer is not financial. PG&E requests rotating outages from all its
    customers in tight demand periods, while by enrolling in OBMC the customer is
    excluded from these rotating outages. The customers are notified via e-mail or
    text messaging for the load reduction ratio (5–15%) and the beginning and ending
    times of the event, including both holidays and weekends. If the customer fails
    to reduce the load to the specified level in a call, a 6$/kWh penalty for each
    kWh above the power reduction commitment is imposed, while failing to respond
    to a second call entails the interruption of the participation in the OBMC Plan
    for five years. Notably, the Automated DR Program (ADRP) provides incentives for
    customers investing in automatic energy management technologies coupled with DR
    programs (PDPD, BIP, etc.). Customers participating in the ADRP receive signals
    from PG&E and are granted with an incentive of 200–400$/kW of dispatchable load,
    and therefore can recover their initial investment in the required infrastructure
    by a pre-payment of 60% of the total project cost initially and 40% after the
    verification of customer performance in an up-to 12 months period of DR performance
    evaluation session [116]. San Diego Gas&Electric Company (SDGE) offers a BIP based
    on monthly bill credits of 12$/kW or 2$/kW during certain periods of the year
    for customers with a minimum reduction of 100 kW or 15% of their monthly average
    peak demand after a notification lead time of 30 min, granting also a flat credit
    per month even if no DR event is activated. There is a penalty of 7.8$/kWh or
    1.2$/kWh (related to the period of the year) in the BIP offered by SDGE for excess
    energy use above the FIL of the customer. SDGE also offers Capacity Bidding, CPP,
    Permanent Load Shifting and Summer Saver Programs as well as Technology Incentives
    [117]. Southern California Edison (SCE) Company offers a more targeted program
    named “Agricultural and Pumping Interruptible Program” to temporarily suspend
    electricity from pumping equipment of the agricultural sector end-users during
    critical demand periods. A control device is installed to the pumping equipment
    or the meter of the end-user that enables SCE to interrupt the electricity supply
    temporarily, until the critical demand period ends. Eligible customers should
    have a measured demand of at least 37 kW or an agricultural load of minimum 50
    horsepower. The interruption event is limited to 6 h per event, while there is
    a maximum of 25 events or 150 h of interruption per year. The customer is awarded
    with 0.01102$/kWh as a base in the monthly electricity bill in terms of credit
    if enrolled in the program even if no event is called. The customer is also rewarded
    with additional credits up to 16.27$/kWh (in summer average on-peak period) during
    interruption events. SCE also offers ADRP, Permanent Load Shifting, TOU Base Interruptible
    Program, Capacity Bidding Program, DBP, Aggregator Managed Portfolio Program,
    CPP, OBMP, RTP, SLRP, Pumping and Agricultural RTP, as well as a Summer Discount
    Plan [118]. 4.1.1.1.2. Texas With a population of nearly 27 million [115], Texas
    is the second most populated State. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas
    (ERCOT) which is managing the flow of electric power for more than 90% of Texas
    area, enables the direct engagement of end-users to provide offers into ERCOT
    markets or to rationally reduce their energy usage by responding to wholesale
    market prices [119]. Currently, Controllable Load Resources are allowed to participate
    in the Non-Spinning Reserve Service Market after an assessment which qualifies
    them to be dispatched by the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch. Moreover,
    a recent pilot project named “Fast-Responding Regulation Service” allows specific
    fast-acting demand side resources to participate in the Regulation Service Market.
    Moreover, the Four Coincident Peak (4CP) Load Reduction Program that targets the
    four 15-min settlement intervals corresponding to the highest load in each of
    the four summer months (June, July, August and September) is available for Non-Opt-In
    Entities in the ERCOT jurisdiction area. For demand side resources, Emergency
    Response Service program that provides a valuable emergency service during grid
    stress conditions, such as rolling blackouts caused by several reasons including
    severe weather conditions, is also available. Transmission and Distribution Service
    Providers (TDSPs) in the region also provide different load management programs.
    Finally, Price Responsive DR Products including Block&Index, CPP/Rebates, RTP,
    TOU Pricing, Other Load Control and Other Voluntary DR Product are employed in
    the service area of ERCOT [120]. Apart from the DR schemes designed mainly for
    industrial and commercial end-users, ERCOT is also recommended to provide DR schemes
    specifically aiming at involving the residential end-users responsible for more
    than half of the energy usage in ERCOT area during peak summer periods due to
    AC load [121]. As a TDSP in the State of Texas, CPS Energy operates a voluntary
    load curtailment program designed for commercial and industrial customers by incentivizing
    them to shed their loads during extreme system conditions, especially during peak
    summer days. The program focuses especially on weekdays between 3 and 6 p.m. with
    a two-hour advanced notification. Customers willing to participate should demonstrate
    at least 50 kW of curtailable electric load in order to be qualified to enrol
    in the program [122]. CPS Energy has also a Smart Thermostat program for commercial
    and residential end-users, in which the control equipment is installed free of
    cost, while CPS Energy maintains the right to cycle off AC compressors for short
    periods of time by sending a radio signal to the smart thermostats during peak
    demand periods. CPS Energy does not provide the end-users with incentives but
    ensures a reduction in heating/cooling related costs of at least 10% because of
    the deployment of Smart Thermostats [123]. American Electric Power (AEP) Texas
    offers an Irrigation Load Management Program in collaboration with EnerNOC for
    the agricultural end-users with electric irrigation pumps of 50 hp or greater,
    willing to allow their irrigation pumps to be remotely shut down during peak demand
    periods in return for a financial incentive. This Program covers the time span
    from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays with a required duration of 1–4 h per event,
    following an advanced notification interval of 60 min. A maximum of 4 events are
    allowed per month in this program [124]. AEP Texas also provides Load Management
    Standard Offer Programs (SOPs) for customers with an installed power of 500 kW
    or higher, supplying them with incentives for load interruptions on short notice
    during peak demand periods. There are 5 different options in this program regarding
    the maximum number and duration of interruptions [125]. Austin Energy Company
    introduced a “Rush Hour Rewards” pilot program in the summer of 2013, having enrolled
    approximately two thousand customers in Austin, Texas. The aforementioned program
    in collaboration with Nest Company, supplied the participating end-users with
    the purchase amount of smart thermostats together with additional incentives to
    avoid operating their ACs during “Rush Hours” of energy usage in summer periods.
    This was realized with remote control of the installed thermostats by increasing
    the temperature set point [126]. Reliant Energy Company has also a similar DR
    program [127]. Moreover, Austin Energy is currently running a program called the
    “Load Cooperative Program” in which the end-users are offered a payment of 1.25$/kWh
    for their curtailed load with a 60-min notification interval during summer peak
    periods [128]. CenterPoint Energy Company offers a Commercial Load Management
    Program to commercial end-users for mandatory load curtailments in summer periods
    between June 1 and September 30 of each year from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays.
    Participating customer groups are required to provide an aggregated peak demand
    of 750 kW. Furthermore, each of the enrolled group members should have at least
    a normal peak demand of 250 kW plus the capability of curtailing at least 100
    kW for a maximum of 5 curtailments per year. The enrolled customers are paid up
    to 35$/kW for the verified curtailed load. This means the supply of at least the
    amount of curtailment agreed in the beginning of the contract year [129]. El Paso
    Electric Company has a Load Management Program for non-residential customers with
    a minimum of 100 kW of curtailable power capability upon notice between June 1
    and September 30 of each year. The curtailment can last up to 5 consecutive hours
    per event. Nine forced curtailments or a maximum of 50 h of interruption per year
    together with scheduled curtailments are requested by the terms of participation
    in the program. The customers may gain up to 60$/kW for curtailed power during
    events in the mentioned program [128], [130]. Furthermore, Oncor Company has a
    similar program called “Commercial Load Management Program” for commercial end-users
    who can render 100 kW of load available for curtailment [131]. There are also
    other load management programs for non-residential end-users offered by different
    service providers [128]. Another interesting example of DR applications in Texas
    is the “Free Nights or Weekends” program provided by TXU Energy. This program
    offers customers willing to participate, totally free electricity at night or
    during the weekends on the condition that they accept significantly higher daytime
    or weekday rates, which aims to shift more load to off-peak hours. The aforementioned
    program has engaged more than 100,000 participants [127]. 4.1.1.1.3. Florida With
    a population of nearly 20 million [115], Florida is also one of the major States.
    DR programs in Florida are similar to the ones in California and Texas. For instance,
    Florida Power&Light (FPL) Company has a Commercial Demand Reduction Program which
    aims to seize direct control of large scale end-users’ total load demand by an
    installed load control device that sheds the pre-determined loads under a pre-notice
    by the FPL. For each kW of curtailment during events, FPL provides credits to
    the end-user together with a flat monthly payment for being enrolled in the program
    [132]. FPL has also an “On Call Program” for business areas that enables FPL to
    temporarily turn off ACs (15–17.5 min per 30-min period for a maximum 6-h time
    period) remotely in critical periods. FPL pays a flat monthly credit even if no
    DR event is called [133]. Tampa Electric Company (TECO) offers a load management
    program to control the selected equipment (ACs or any specialized equipment) in
    the end-user premises. TECO installs a remotely controllable device to shut down
    the equipment selected by the end-user during critical peak power periods in order
    to operate cyclic or continuous load management programs. As far as cyclic operation
    is concerned, the end-user earns 3$/kW, while for continuous operation of the
    curtailment the end-user earns 3.5$/kW for the curtailed load during an event
    [134]. TECO and Progress Energy Company are also offering on-site generation option
    based programs under two different names: “Standby Generator Program” and “Backup
    Generator Program”, respectively. Both programs aim at enabling the control of
    an available on-site generator by a service provider in order to cover a portion
    of the end-user''s load demand by this generator in order to lower the demand
    from the grid in peak power periods. Progress Energy also offers a DLC program
    that enables the service provider to control selected equipment of the customer
    during critical periods, similar to the program offered by TECO [135]. 4.1.1.1.4.
    New York New York occupies a smaller geographical area compared to California,
    Texas and Florida. However, New York accommodates a population of 20 million and
    therefore is also a major State in terms of population [115]. New York Independent
    System Operator (NYISO) offers four different DR programs named “Emergency DR
    Program (EDRP)”, “Special Case Resources (SCR)”, “Day-Ahead DR Program (DADRP)”
    and “Demand Side Ancillary Services Program (DSASP)”. EDRP and SCR programs offer
    incentives to industrial and commercial end-users in order to reduce their power
    in critical periods. DADRP enables end-users to bid their load reductions in the
    day-ahead market which in turn allows NYISO to determine which offers are more
    economical to pay at the market clearing price. Lastly, DSASP allows retail customers
    to bid their load curtailment in day-ahead and/or real-time market in terms of
    operating reserves and regulation service. The market clearing price for reserve
    and/or regulation is paid for the scheduled load curtailment offers [136]. ConEdison
    Company offers also different DR programs. Customers enrolled in a 2-h or less
    pre-notification program named “Distribution Load Relief Program (DLRP)” receive
    6$/kW or 15$/kW (considering their status) monthly and 1$/kWh for the reduced
    load during an event. As another DR program, the 21-h pre-notification program
    “Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP)” offers 10$/kW per month and 1$/kWh for
    the reduced load during event. The customers enrolled in either DLRP or CSRP are
    required to be involved in an one-hour mandatory test every year and they should
    supply the load reduction for at least 4 h during actual events from 6 a.m. to
    12 a.m., any day of the week [137]. 4.1.1.2. Other states and territories of the
    U.S There are also many DR programs with similar structure with the ones in California,
    Texas, Florida and New York, but with different rules and incentives applied in
    smaller States of the U.S.. For further information on these programs, readers
    may refer to [138], [139]. 4.1.2. Canada Apart from the U.S., Canada also demonstrates
    several applied DR programs and strategies. The Independent Electricity System
    Operator (IESO) of Ontario allows aggregators to manage demand side flexibility
    in order to maintain the balance of the grid together with the applied price-based
    grid balancing strategies. The aggregator pre-notifies its facilities to supply
    the required load reduction in order to ensure the request of the IESO in terms
    of total load reduction in critical periods [140]. ENBALA Power Networks Company
    is a leading aggregator that engages hospitals, wastewater treatment centers,
    universities, cold storage facilities, etc., to ensure the required load reduction
    in critical conditions. ENBALA aggregates specific loads of different end-user
    types such as pumps in water/wastewater treatment plants, compressors, evaporators,
    etc., in refrigerated warehouses, HVAC units including air handling and chiller
    equipment in hospitals, universities and colleges and commercial buildings through
    a platform named “GOFlex” [141]. There are many examples of ENBALA applied demand
    side solutions [142]. One of the most remarkable examples is the enrolment of
    the McMaster University Campus in Ontario in DR aggregation activities through
    GOFlex. GOFlex manipulates the temperature settings and therefore, the power usage
    of five chillers with a 16,000 t cooling capacity within the HVAC system of the
    McMaster University Campus. Through a communication panel employed in the end-user
    premises, the Building Management System (BMS) of the campus receives real-time
    requests and signals from ENBALA GOFlex platform and accordingly adjusts the aggregated
    settings of the chillers in order to reduce consumption in critical periods without
    a noticeable deviation from the normal comfort conditions. Many other LSEs across
    Canada offer classical DR programs. Toronto Hydro Corporation as a LSE and Rodan
    Energy Company as a DRP are such examples [143]. 4.1.3. Other North America countries
    Another part of North America that demonstrates demand side participation actions
    is Mexico, especially with the potential smart grid investments (such as Smart
    Metering project [144]) in Mexico City directed by Comisión Federal de Electricidad
    (CFE) of Mexico. Thus, more implementations in terms of DR solutions can be expected
    from this North American country in the near future. 4.2. South America 4.2.1.
    Brazil As the leading country in South America in terms of demand side solutions,
    Brazil is considered to have a good potential in this area. Brazil has demonstrated
    better progress in terms of energy efficiency improvement efforts; however, there
    is also some progress in DR applications that can serve as a basis for more advanced
    implementations. First of all, apart from the energy efficiency solutions, there
    are other pilot applications concerning the improvement of smart metering infrastructure
    in the service regions of different LSEs. For the implementation of DR solutions,
    AES Eletropaulo Company, which is the major LSE in terms of consumption and revenues
    in Latin America, has launched a smart grid pilot implementation plan aiming at
    implementing DR solutions for different end-user types, especially during critical
    peak periods in order to improve the loading factor of distribution system assets
    [145]. Furthermore, the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) has discussed
    changes in the tariff schemes to motivate price-based DR programs in Brazil [146].
    Thus, Brazil could be considered as a good candidate for wider penetration of
    DR activities in the future within the Latin America region [147]. 4.2.2. Other
    South America countries Apart from Brazil, there are some applications at an initial
    stage in Colombia and Chile regarding demand side applications and with additional
    regulations these markets also seem promising grounds for DR solutions [148].
    4.3. Europe The North American DR market is a leader in what regards the development
    and deployment of DR programs. Nevertheless, Europe holds the second place and
    the EU countries have recently demonstrated interest in occupying a wider portion
    of the DR market in the future. 4.3.1. United Kingdom According to an interview
    published in the Reuters [149], “Longer term, UK''s aggressive renewable energy
    goals, fairly large size, and deregulated market structure make it one of the
    best potential regions for DR”, which clearly indicates the potential of the UK
    taking a leading role across Europe in DR applications. KiWi Power Company offers
    a Demand Reduction Strategy (DRS) that presents similarities to existing programs
    in the U.S., aiming to temporarily reduce the consumption of certain end-user
    systems such as HVAC, lighting, etc. through the installation of a remotely controlled
    equipment in peak energy demand periods. KiWi Power offers different control systems
    for different end-user types in order to provide reductions when necessary. For
    example, airport chillers and air handling units (AHUs) in areas such as baggage
    halls and concourse areas are offered to be turned off while generators serving
    runway lights or communal retail areas can be also utilized during DR events.
    Besides, in the case of supermarkets, temporary reductions in the lighting level
    of retail areas or turning off refrigeration plant compressors in freezers are
    candidate strategies. Different solutions are also presented for hospitals, steel
    manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics, etc. [150]. The UK Power Networks
    Company has developed programs to enable the demand side participation in the
    UK. In the “Low Carbon London” project, the UK Power Networks Company works with
    Flexitricity, EDF Energy and EnerNOC companies as aggregator partners to enrol
    industrial and commercial participants for a DR trial in London aiming at inducing
    load reductions at the MW level during estimated high demand periods. Moreover,
    in the “Smarter Network Storage” project, storage systems in the MW/MWh level
    installed in the distribution system will play an active role in residential or
    commercial DR. Storage units will compensate the deficiency in production during
    peak periods in order to cover the demand, while they will absorb excess energy
    when renewable power plants provide high generation (in sunny or windy days) or
    in times in which the demand is low. The Smarter Network Storage units are planned
    to be integrated in the National Grid''s ancillary services market for providing
    Frequency Response and Short-Term Operating Reserve [151]. There are also different
    demonstration trials of DR solutions in the UK, which are expected to play an
    important role in the DR market both in Europe and globally in the future. 4.3.2.
    Belgium Belgium is a country which has also practically involved DR solutions
    in the daily electricity market operations. ELIA, as Belgian electricity TSO,
    accepts DR capacity to compensate mismatches between production and peak power
    demand [152], in which industrial customers are given vital importance as also
    supported by the Federation of Belgian Industrial Energy Consumers (FEBELIEC)
    [153]. DR aggregator companies, such as REstore [154] and Energy Pool [155], provide
    the required capacities to ELIA under stress conditions, to which hundreds of
    MWs have already been contracted in order to add flexibility to ELIA''s operation
    in the Belgian power system. 4.3.3. Other European countries Many other countries
    in the EU are also progressing towards implementing DR actions into their electric
    power system structures. Apart from the UK and Belgium, France, Finland and Norway,
    Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany have also improved their progress in the development
    of DR activities. A recent report on DR in Europe discusses the status of DR in
    such countries thoroughly and thus readers are addressed to [156] for further
    information. 4.4. Oceania 4.4.1. Australia In Australia many efforts take place
    in terms of developing different DR schemes. The LSEs have announced many short-term
    targets regarding the application of DR strategies. Following the announcement
    of new obligations for LSEs to publish “Demand Side Engagement Strategies”, enabling
    the participation of demand side resources in the market by the Australian Energy
    Market Commission (AEMC) in 2012 [157], the number of DR strategies offered by
    several LSEs has significantly increased. These strategies are firstly implemented
    in pilot projects. Several successful strategies are already applied in a larger
    scale while many are still in a trial phase. The Ausgrid Company regularly announces
    the possible DR strategies and the relevant pilot [158]. One of these possible
    DR strategies under trial is “Dynamic Peak Rebate Trial” for non-residential medium
    to large scale customers, which is basically similar to many different existing
    DR programs around the world, incentivizing customers to reduce their consumption
    during peak periods, approximately 20–30 h during the summer (from December to
    February for Australia). In the first trial in the summer of 2013, 5 demand reduction
    events were requested from February to March 2013 resulting in an average reduction
    of 2500 kV A [159]. A similar test was also conducted in the same period by AusNet
    Services Company for commercial and industrial customers in order to acquire insights
    into the effectiveness of different DR strategies, through which the company also
    aims to evaluate and then potentially actualize strategies such as embedded generation,
    mobile generation, energy storage, tariff and incentive-based DR strategies [160],
    [161]. The Demand Side Engagement Strategy Report of a joint program by CitiPower
    Company and Powercor Company considering different DR options was also announced
    in [162]. Among the currently applied strategies, Endeavour Energy presented the
    “Energy Savers Program” for large consumers in Arndell Park and Rooty Hill areas.
    Even more noticeable are the “CoolSaver”, “PeakSaver” and “PoolSaver” DR programs
    for residential end-users. The “CoolSaver” program is based on mounting the AC
    of the residential end-user with a remotely controllable device that will automatically
    adjust its power during summer periods for a maximum of 6 days, between 2 p.m.
    and 7 p.m., when there is a critical grid power peak due to very high temperatures.
    The enrolled customer is promised not to feel discomfort but is not paid per event
    neither per reduction. On the contrary, the customer is paid a flat 60$/year and
    also 100$ worth free AC service as a Sign-Up bonus for the program. “PeakSaver”
    is a DR program in which Endeavour Energy pre-notifies enrolled end-users via
    SMS, e-mail or recorded voice messages for demand reduction events during the
    Australian summer period and by reducing energy consumption through actions such
    as turning off unnecessary lights and appliances and postponing cloth or dish
    washing during the event. This program rewards the end-user with 1.50$/kWh of
    saved energy with respect to the customer''s baseline. Finally, the “PoolSaver”
    program requests from the end-users to allow the company to install a new circuit
    to the power supply of the customer pool pump, which allows it to work in a pre-determined
    mode during specific off-peak hours. There is no payment for energy curtailment
    but the company argues that operating the pool pump in off-peak hours will save
    more than 40% of the pool pump energy consumption cost. Apart from this, the enrolled
    customers are rewarded with a gift card [163]. Energex Company offers a program
    named “PeakSmart AC” to end-users who are willing to replace their old ACs with
    new PeakSmart capable ACs which are remotely controllable via a signal receiver.
    The implementation of the new PeakSmart program enrols ACs and determines the
    rewards according to their cooling capacity. Customers possessing ACs with a cooling
    capacity of less than 4 kW receive 150$, between 4 and 10 kW receive 250$, while
    for more than 10 kW the payment reaches 500$. Furthermore, households and businesses
    can get separate rewards for up to 5 AC unit replacements. The PeakSmart ACs are
    controlled by the LSE in case of critical summer demand during high temperature
    days (a few days per year) by slightly changing the AC setting without affecting
    the end-user comfort significantly. There are also two programs named “Pool Rewards”
    and “Hot Water Rewards”, for end-users that are willing to enrol their pool pumps
    and hot water systems, respectively, to a specific tariff. Furthermore, Energex
    offers rewards for business centers willing to install BMS or to increase the
    efficiency of specific systems [164]. SA Power Networks deploys pilot projects
    on direct AC load control for residential areas (involving around 1,000 volunteering
    households) by switching off AC compressors but not their fans, in order to maintain
    comfort levels [165]. Pre-notification based residential DR programs are also
    employed by the United Energy Distribution Company for 4,500 households in Melbourne
    for a maximum of 4 events per summer and a reward of up to 25$ per 3-h event [166].
    Western Power Company has also performed trials on direct AC load control, named
    as “Air Conditioned Trial (ACT)” through the Perth Solar City Program of Australian
    Government, in which ACT AC compressors were cycled via wireless communication
    while AC fans continued running to maintain a sufficient end-user comfort level
    [167]. Several smaller scale implementations of different DR strategies which
    are not mentioned here have also taken place in Australia. Relevant information
    and annual reports by LSEs in Australia can be found in the official website of
    the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) [168]. 4.4.2. Other Oceanian countries Among
    other countries in the continent, only New Zealand shows a rather remarkable progress
    regarding DR programs. Transpower Company runs a program for commercial buildings
    (office buildings, hospitals, data centers, etc.) with standby generators which
    are requested to be operated in order to reduce the power drawn from the grid
    in critical peak periods. Besides, Transpower is currently launching new DR programs
    for the Agricultural sector [169]. EnerNOC, through the “DemandSMART” program,
    enrols interruptible commercial and industrial end-user loads into the Instantaneous
    Reserves (IR) market. The program limits are 30 min per event for a maximum of
    6 events per year in the North Island, while 2 events per year are allowed in
    the South Island. The targeted loads include refrigeration compressors and fans
    in cold storage/food facilities, pumps with storage and aerators in water treatment
    facilities, refiners, chippers and fans in pulp, paper, boar and wood processing
    facilities, electric furnaces and smelters in manufacturing facilities, and finally
    HVAC systems in data centers and large buildings [170]. There are also different
    solutions presented by LSEs, DRPs and technological companies in New Zealand [171].
    4.5. Asia Asian countries do not generally have an active DR market. However,
    several pilot projects are in preparation or evaluation phase, especially in the
    Asia-Pacific region. 4.5.1. Singapore Singapore is one of the leading countries
    in Asia in terms of DR applications. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) of Singapore
    has already introduced DR programs to enhance the competition in the National
    Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS), in which consumers can participate directly
    or through retailers or DR aggregators. All customers that can offer at least
    0.1 MW of reduction for half an hour can participate. The consumers participating
    in the program share one-third of the savings obtained by the reduction in electricity
    prices as incentive payments, up to 4,500$/MWh that is the cap of wholesale electrical
    prices. The enrolled consumers can provide temporarily the required reduction
    by switching off non-critical equipment, reducing HVAC or pumping system power
    or even using on-site back-up generators for short periods [172]. The Diamond
    Energy Company has been the pioneering actor in DR applications in the Singaporean
    market, having applied load interruption programs to confront abnormal events
    such as unexpected peak demand or forced outages of power generation [173]. The
    CPvT Energy Company is also a retailer registered with EMA and participates in
    the load interruption program [174]. There are also other market participants
    in the DR market of Singapore, which is currently the most promising for future
    developments amongst the Asian countries. 4.5.2. Japan, South Korea and China
    Japan, South Korea and China are also countries that are expected to develop DR
    programs in order to induce more active demand side participation in the future.
    Kyocera, IBM Japan and Tokyu Community have started an Automatic DR Management
    System pilot project in Japan. In the mentioned project the automatic DR system
    is planned to send a power-saving request (DR signal) to consumers under system
    stress conditions, or even to control the end-user EMSs if necessary [175]. Comverge,
    OpenADR Alliance and Fujitsu have also initiated pilot DR projects [176], [177],
    which aim at developing a considerable DR sector in Japan that has suffered from
    intense energy requirements during high emergency conditions, especially after
    the Fukushima nuclear incident. OpenADR (Open Automated DR) Alliance, being a
    non-profit corporation created to foster the development, adoption and compliance
    of the OpenADR smart grid standard, has also taken significant steps towards developing
    DR applications in South Korea in collaboration with local authorities and associations
    [177]. In China, a collaborative pilot project between the Natural Resources Defence
    Council, Shanghai Electric Power, NARI Group, the State Grid Corporation of China
    and Honeywell as an international partner started in Shanghai in 2014 and is the
    first official DR demonstration project in China. The mentioned pilot project
    has contracted 33 commercial and public buildings, 31 steel, chemical and automotive
    industrial premises, which present an aggregated capacity of 100 MW available
    to be curtailed with a considerable payment per unit of curtailed load. The project
    is in place, demonstrating the economic and technical sides of DR strategies for
    different consumer types [178]. 4.5.3. Other Asian countries Some other DR activities
    also take place in the wider Asian continent, being mostly in the pilot stage.
    CLP Power Company in Hong Kong announced an Automatic DR pilot project in which
    existing BMS facilities in commercial and industrial premises will be integrated
    with the Automatic DR concept that will also enable CLP to curtail some loads
    directly during emergency conditions [179]. Noticeably, a small country in the
    Far East Asia, Bangladesh, currently employs demand side actions mostly by advertisements
    rather than incentive-based programs. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)
    that is the major regulatory entity in Bangladesh power system has established
    motivational advertisement based programs to enhance the awareness of the end-users.
    BDBP has started campaigns through electronic and print mass media to request
    end-users to be more rational and economical in electricity use during peak hours;
    for example, by switching off unnecessary loads at residential end-user premises
    or by shifting irrigation load to off-peak hours. It was estimated that with the
    aid of the campaign around 400 MW of irrigation load was shifted to off-peak hours
    in the last years. Besides, industries operating with two shifts are requested
    to interrupt their operation during peak hours. An interesting piece of evidence
    from BDBP is that it monitors the closing time of shops and obliges them to close
    at 8 p.m., an action that contributes to load shifting from peak to off-peak hours
    by 350 MW and reduces the load shedding necessity [180]. There are also some early-stage
    studies on DR implementations in some other countries such as India, which could
    be developed in the future, depending on the policies of the regional governments.
    At this point, it should be noted that no remarkable DR activity has been noticed
    in the Middle-East and thus no information exists about countries in this region.
    4.6. Africa The African continent is hosting different nations that present significant
    differences in life quality among the population. A very small portion of the
    population has relatively high income, while many others do not even have access
    to electricity. Thus, DR programs in Africa are limited; yet, there are some remarkable
    examples. Eskom Company in South Africa offers different DR programs especially
    to its large customers. The “Standby Generator Program” requests the enrolled
    customers to supply all their load demand by own on-site generators (minimum 1,000
    kW) up to 2 h during any requested day and for up to 100 events per year. The
    control of the generator is not in the responsibility of Eskom. Eskom pre-notifies
    (from 3 p.m. of the previous day to 30 min prior to an event) for the DR event
    period and the end-user is not enabled to use grid power in the mentioned period.
    The end-user is paid a rate for the self-generated power based on the curtailed
    grid power. Another program offered by Eskom is “Supplemental DR Compensation
    Program” for industrial and commercial customers which can reduce their consumption
    by 500 kW or 10% of the average MW of their load demand (whichever is greater)
    during pre-specified critical periods announced by Eskom. The limits are 1–2 h
    reductions on a scheduled day for up to 150 events per year with a pre-notification
    from 3 p.m. of the previous day to 30 min prior the event with a payment for each
    kWh of energy curtailed by the customer [181]. Eskom also started pilot projects
    for residential load management based DR programs. More than 10,000 geyser relays
    have been installed in residential end-user premises to shed appliances remotely
    during a critical peak power period with a credit based compensation for the customer
    [182]. There are also many consulting and technical companies in South Africa
    supporting DR implementations and improvements regionally (e.g. Enerweb Company
    [183]). The DR market is growing in Africa with new pilot studies across the continent,
    especially in the most developed countries. A more complete analysis of the DR
    status in Africa can be found in [184]. 5. Barriers to the development of DR The
    potential benefits of DR and the intensive research recently have been the drivers
    for initiating and developing DR programs around the world. However, one may notice
    considerably asymmetric progress in enabling the active participation of demand
    in the power system procedures between different regions. This situation is related
    to a series of challenges and barriers that limit the active participation of
    demand in electricity markets. In this section the challenges towards the adoption
    of DR, as well as the barriers that are present in different regions are critically
    compiled and discussed. The challenges and barriers are classified in six distinct,
    yet intersecting, categories. 5.1. Barriers associated with the regulatory framework
    The first obstacle towards the integration of DR resources in the electricity
    markets structures is the absence of rules that implicitly consider their participation
    in the provision of different services, or the presence of rules that limit their
    potential. Power system service definitions or security of supply standards refer
    to the way that an ISO, a reliability organization or a balancing authority define
    the services that are required in order to maintain the secure operation of the
    power system. These technical definitions directly define which resources are
    eligible to provide a given service. These definitions may explicitly exclude
    or effectively limit the participation of demand side resources in ancillary services
    markets. In the U.S. the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)
    has provided definitions that are functionally based and technology neutral in
    order to include DR participation. However, several regional reliability organizations
    in the U.S. such as the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) do not
    currently allow the provision of reserves from DR resources [185]. Furthermore,
    ISO New England does not allow DR resources to participate in the regulation markets
    [186]. It is to be noted that although most regional reliability council definitions
    comply with NERC''s standard, there are several issues that could be viewed as
    important challenges yet to be overcome, such as issues of fair treatment of DR
    in comparison with generation when it comes to the qualification of capabilities
    in resource adequacy planning such as in MISO [187]. Despite the fact that in
    the U.S. these issues have been long recognized and are being addressed, the situation
    in Europe is different. The EU policies have generally been more focused on energy
    efficiency and DSM, rather than DR. Evidently, until recently, EU was more interested
    in climate change actions, promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy growth
    and did not perceive DR as a key solution to address its environmental objectives
    [188]. With the Third Energy Package and especially with the Energy Efficiency
    Directive (EED) the European Commission has demonstrated strong interest in DR.
    The main driver seems to be the fact that DR may play an effective role in supporting
    higher penetration levels of the intermittent renewable generation [189] and therefore
    has the potential of becoming a catalyst in achieving the EU''s 2030 and 2050
    energy policy and decarbonisation targets [190]. Article 15.4 of the EED explicitly
    states that DR participation in balancing and reserve markets and ancillary services
    procurement should be promoted, while Article 15.8 states that national energy
    regulatory authorities should encourage DR resources to participate alongside
    supply in wholesale and retail markets and guarantee that DR is treated in a non-discriminatory
    manner, on the basis of its technical capabilities [96]. Although the phrasing
    of the EED could be viewed as progressive and direct, the implementation of DR
    across Europe is not homogenous. This is due to two reasons: firstly, the directives
    of the EU have to be adjusted to national level, considering the particularities
    and the constraints of each system, that is a task that will definitely need time,
    and secondly, the EU does not have an adequate system in place to monitor the
    market [188]. Currently, fewer than 5 out of the EU 27 Member States have created
    regulatory and contractual structures that support DR. France and the UK are the
    only countries with developed DR programs, while Finland, Belgium, Austria, Ireland
    and Germany are undergoing fundamental regulatory reviews; however, they are still
    in the formative stage of this process. The rest of the Member States follow national
    regulations that prohibit consumer participation in balancing, reserve and energy
    markets, as opposed to the countenance of the EED. The Third Energy Package has
    also set common rules for the organization of the energy markets in Europe in
    order to facilitate the completion of the Internal Energy Market [191]. In this
    context, the absence of homogenous DR products in different European countries
    could potentially constitute a barrier for DR. For example, capacity mechanisms
    are considered an attractive market opportunity for DR resources and countries
    such as France, Italy and the UK are currently developing their own national implementations
    [192]. Different motivations and priorities could raise conflicts and confusion
    in contrast with the harmonization targets at European level [193] and as a result
    the development of DR could be hindered. 5.2. Barriers associated with the market
    entry criteria Historically, the qualifications regarding the entrance of new
    market participants into various types of markets (energy, reserve and ancillary
    services markets) have been developed considering that the sole resources of the
    system are large centralized generators, which present similar operational characteristics.
    As a result, the relevant rules are not in position to reflect the diverse technical
    and qualitative characteristics of other resources such as DR and as a result
    the market structures cannot integrate such resources without a revision of the
    existing market entrance criteria. The following issues associated with the requirements
    that a resource should satisfy in order to participate into several markets, if
    not addressed, may constitute a direct practical barrier to the development of
    DR: • Minimum resource bid size. • Possibility of aggregation of multiple small
    consumers and geographic boundaries of aggregation. • Bid direction. • Number
    of call events (e.g. on a weekly, yearly basis). • Load recovery period. • Response
    time. • Duration of response. • Fixed trading charges, membership and entrance
    fees. Traditional generators have relatively large capacities (tenths of MWs)
    and as a result the minimum resource bids that have been set in order to participate
    in several market structures are high in comparison with the individual consumption
    of the majority of the loads, explicitly disqualifying DR to participate in these
    markets. This barrier has been recognized by many ISOs and efforts have been made
    in order to relax this prerequisite. For example, the ERCOT and PJM have set the
    minimum bid size to 0.1 MW, while the requirement in MISO is 1 MW [186]. In contrast
    with the U.S. markets, in Europe this issue is yet to be addressed. Several countries
    have decreased the minimum size that qualifies the participation of a resource
    in a variety of services. Finland provides a good example of a DR friendly country.
    The minimum bid size in order to participate in normal operation reserve program
    is 0.1 MW while in order to participate in the frequency controlled disturbance
    program the minimum bid size is 1 MW. Similarly, in Italy the resource must render
    available at least 1 MW in order to be eligible. In the Netherlands and in the
    UK the minimum allowed resource capacity is 4 MW (regulation, reserves) and 3
    MW (short-term operating reserve-STOR), respectively. In order to evaluate whether
    the minimum resource capacity size constitutes a barrier, the characteristics
    of the system loads should be taken into account. For example, in the Canary and
    Baleares Islands the minimum required reduction potential is 0.8 MW; however,
    the fact that an insular power system structure differs from the mainland grids
    should be taken into account during the evaluation. In contrast with these relatively
    positive developments in some countries, in Denmark and Norway, participation
    in tertiary reserves requires a capacity of at least 10 MW since the instructions
    are manual (the participants are notified by telephone). One could argue that
    this barrier will not be radically addressed in the near future as regards the
    majority of European countries since the entry criteria have been only recently
    revised [156]. Another important factor to consider together with the high minimum
    capacity requirements is whether the market rules allow the aggregation of multiple
    small consumers and to what geographical extent the aggregations are possible.
    In several markets, aggregation is not legal (e.g. ERCOT, MISO, Austria, Spain)
    or it is legal but not practically feasible due to other legislation issues (e.g.
    in Denmark). Furthermore, restricting the geographical extent of the aggregation
    can further bound the capability of aggregators to participate in markets because
    of not meeting the minimum capacity requirements. The combination of high capacity
    requirements and the unavailability of aggregation options exclude residential,
    commercial and small industrial consumers and limit the DR provision option only
    to large industrial consumers, such as in Denmark and the UK [194], [195]. Several
    market structures require that the bids are symmetric. This means that resources
    should provide equal capacity to change in both directions that in the case of
    DR would mean that the loads should be equally able to decrease and increase their
    consumption. This is a requirement that directly restricts the pool of eligible
    DR resources since only a few types of load would be equally flexible in both
    directions. Examples of markets that require symmetric regulation capacity offers
    are MISO, PJM while in Denmark, for this reason DR is not allowed to participate
    in secondary reserves. In Switzerland tertiary control allows asymmetric bids,
    while secondary reserves require symmetric capacity. The German market allows
    asymmetric bids but consumers cannot practically participate in reserves because
    negative deviations (load increase) bear significant penalties. Other service
    attributes such as the number of call events, time between two calls, response
    time and duration of response can potentially hinder the deployment of DR resources.
    The primary aim of demand is not to provide flexibility to the power system but
    to serve the specific needs of the end-user. Furthermore, the existing emergency
    DR programs strictly limit the number and the duration of DR calls per year since
    the deployment of such resources entails interruption of service for the consumers.
    In order not to demotivate the consumer participation, utilities have been conservative
    with the utilization of DR calls. For example, in 2007, California ISO (CAISO)
    has issued DR calls spanning less than 1% of the year, while only in less than
    60% of the highest load periods DR calls were issued. Most markets require the
    resource to maintain its response from 4 to 12 h (e.g. Austria and Germany, respectively)
    during a call. There are also examples of markets that require permanent availability
    of regulating resources such as the Swiss market, which is a barrier for most
    consumers to provide DR except for the case of a few large industrial consumers.
    Nevertheless, it is generally reported that reserves are not typically required
    for more than 1–2 h. This is aligned with the requirement of STOR service in the
    UK in which a call must have duration of 2 h. However, even in this case commercial
    consumers are practically excluded [193]. The majority of existing market structures
    allows the participation of these resources either through direct bidding or through
    bilateral contracts in the day-ahead market. This fact implies that the planning
    of the use of such resources should be performed hours ahead of the real-time
    operation of the system. As a result, the use of such resources is limited to
    emergency situations that can be predicted by the ISO the day before the actual
    operation of the power system, while several calls for DR prove to be unnecessary
    in the real-time. Day-ahead market decisions are connected with high uncertainty
    and ineffective scheduling of DR calls impairs the forecast error as regards the
    generation and load response in comparison with dispatch decisions that are made
    closer to real-time. This situation reduces the competitiveness of demand side
    resources in comparison with flexible generation resources (such as open cycle
    gas turbines - OCGT plants) that have the ability of fast start-up and ramping,
    despite the fact that several load types are capable of adjusting their demand
    instantaneously, and therefore limits their value for the ISO. Furthermore, the
    need for advanced notification for DR calls hampers the participation of demand
    side resources in contingency reserve markets that require short-term response,
    typically between 10 and 30 min, an interval which is shorter than the minimum
    notification time for DR. ERCOT is one of the few examples of markets that allow
    the efficient participation of load in reserves [196], together with the recently
    revised market rules in Norway that require activation of reserves in 15 min.
    Finally, the entrance fees for aggregators or DR providers are generally considered
    to be reasonable, and thus they do not constitute a direct barrier. For example,
    in Finland the aggregators have to pay €200 per month to the TSO, while they have
    to guarantee a bank deposit in order to reduce the risk of bankruptcy [156]. In
    order to effectively revise these rules, the ISOs should firstly realize a fundamental
    difference between the impacts of large centralized generation and highly dispersed
    DR resources on the reliability of the power system, in case that the resource
    fails to respond to an instruction. Currently, the ISOs require stringent monitoring
    of the response of both generation side and demand side resources. However, as
    it was demonstrated in [197], this last requirement may not be necessary for the
    case of DR since the aggregation of small-scale consumers (e.g. residential) statistically
    presents a more reliable response in comparison with a large generator. Furthermore,
    according to [198] several DR resources may have faster response than generators,
    be more resilient to rapid changes in consumption than generators are to changes
    in production (cycling) and do not suffer from increased losses such as generators
    when operating partially loaded. Given these favourable capabilities of DR, not
    revising the existing market entry criteria in order to reflect the diverse technical
    capabilities of loads constitutes a severe underutilization of available system
    resources. 5.3. Barriers associated with market roles and interaction implications
    Competition in electricity markets has been promoted in the past decades. Unbundling
    within electricity markets refers to the separation of electricity generation,
    transmission, distribution and retail sales that have been vertically integrated
    structures. The rationale behind unbundling is the promotion of competition by
    guaranteeing access to the power system for all participants on a non-discriminatory
    basis. Unbundling can be realized in terms of accounting, legislatory framework
    and ownership rights [199]. The liberalized environment has enabled several entities
    in electricity markets that have different roles, responsibilities and objectives.
    This situation may impose barriers towards the uptake of DR, especially because
    of the contrasting views and the absence of an aligned position as regards the
    use of flexibility between TSOs and DSOs. The majority of DR resources are connected
    in the distribution system and as a result the collaboration between TSOs and
    DSOs is important in order to exploit DR. However, issues regarding the purpose
    of DR deployment may complicate the development of DR programs. For instance,
    TSOs would view the flexibility provided by DR as a means of balancing the system,
    while DSOs would use it in order to mitigate local congestions. This implies that
    coordination between these entities should be developed in order to design different
    DR products that would transparently and legally allow the utilization of DR in
    the system and market operations [190]. Another important issue is that despite
    the unbundling process, in many regions TSOs and DSOs are still regulated entities,
    responsible for the technical management of the system and as such, the only entities
    permitted to intervene in investment decisions, excluding the participation of
    private initiatives. However, the investments of a TSO/DSO are limited by the
    allowed remuneration that in general limits the expenses on R&D, having a negative
    effect on the development of new technologies, especially in Europe [200]. The
    effective business/market scheme under which the demand side would participate
    in electricity markets is yet debatable and remains in the forefront of the barriers
    to the uptake of DR. Three main business models can be identified: direct contracts
    with the TSO, aggregation of small consumptions and real time response of demand
    to market prices. There are several challenges associated with each of these demand
    participation options. First, the direct contracts with the TSO allow only the
    participation of a few capable large industrial consumers that are able to meet
    the market entry qualifications as it was previously discussed. Second, aggregating
    demand may compromise the fundamental benefits of dynamic pricing tariff schemes,
    such as RTP, which is the pricing of the end-user with the market price. The reason
    for this is that an aggregator has to bid in the market and fulfil its obligations
    through its portfolio. In order to achieve its targets, this kind of entity could
    alter the prices in order to reflect not the market prices but the requirements
    of the market as regards the behaviour of the aggregator [201]. Given that aggregation
    is an option that would allow the participation of smaller consumers (residential,
    commercial) in the market, unclear definition of the role and the responsibilities
    of an aggregator constitutes a barrier to be addressed. Besides, aggregation of
    consumers is currently illegal or practically infeasible in several markets. Third,
    the response of demand to real-time market prices [202] raises concerns regarding
    the demand and price volatility. This is the result of the asymmetry of information,
    i.e. the time span between the communication of the price and the response of
    the load and as a result the ISO should perform a prediction. Generally, flexible
    consumers tend not to contribute to the mitigation of volatility since they can
    achieve their economic targets, in contrast with relatively inflexible consumers
    that would have incentive to inform the ISO about their intended consumption pattern.
    To deal with this issue, appropriate control regulations should be developed in
    order to define the interaction between demand and the market in order to reduce
    the volatility of demand and price; however, this would deteriorate the economic
    efficiency [203]. Finally, it is important to highlight several implications that
    emerge due to the individual objectives of the different market participants as
    regards the integration of DR resources into the market [18]. The TSOs and the
    DSOs will utilize this flexibility in order to facilitate the satisfaction of
    operational constraints at critical moments. A competitive retailer will use DR
    in order to reduce the risk of being exposed to high prices in the spot market
    [204]. On the other hand, commercial aggregators will focus on maximizing their
    profits, thus expressing their preference to a specific market, a fact that is
    likely to prohibit the participation of DR resources in other markets such as
    in France. The absence of a coordinative framework could provoke competitiveness
    over the utilization of DR. For example, the behaviour of responsive consumers
    may benefit also consumers that are not flexible by inducing lower electricity
    rates, implying transfer of wealth from the generation side to the demand side
    [113]. It is evident that within the liberalized market context, each individual
    entity would more likely aim at utilizing the flexibility of DR for its own benefit
    that is not necessarily aligned with the maximization of the social benefit (improved
    reliability, economic efficiency, no comfort loss for consumers etc.). The diverse
    and conflicting views for DR are the source of a series of further challenges
    such as difficulties in perceiving DR as a crucial system resource, justifying
    and allocating the required investment costs, and finally engaging consumers.
    These issues are covered in the following sub-sections. 5.4. Barriers associated
    with DR as a system resource There is also a category of barriers that is related
    to the effects of the widespread integration of DR resources in the electricity
    markets and power systems. These challenges may be compelling since generator
    shareholders would oppose to the introduction of such resources and the ISOs would
    perceive DR as a complicating factor for the system operation rather than a beneficial
    addition to the system. The most promising application of DR is the balancing
    of the fluctuations that come from the high penetration levels of intermittent
    renewable generation. The response characteristics and the availability of several
    DR resources qualify them for such utilization. However, significant response
    of the load would probably limit the capacity factors of peaking and intermediate
    generators that are currently responsible for regulation, load following and ramping.
    This situation would be favourable for the economic efficiency of the system since
    the services from these units are expensive and base units operate more efficiently
    at constant output. However, the revenues of these generators would significantly
    decrease and therefore it would be harder for their owners to recover their investments,
    leading to a potential decommissioning of such power plants. This outcome would
    not be viewed positively by the ISO since several ancillary services (e.g. voltage
    support, system restoration) cannot be provided by loads [196]. Furthermore, these
    units would be required in order to meet unsatisfied fluctuations that DR fails
    to mitigate. The drop in reserve market clearing prices is another potential outcome
    that would not be viewed positively by the existing stakeholders. Some types of
    DR have little or no opportunity cost to provide certain types of reserves. Thus,
    the entry of a large amount of low cost resources would potentially cause a decrease
    in the clearing price of these services that are an important source of income
    for flexible generators in several regions [205]. From the point of view of the
    ISOs there are three major concerns regarding the introduction of DR in their
    operational practice. The first is the justification of DR as a valuable system
    addition in comparison with other technologies. Strbac [18] argues that the value
    of DR lies both in system operation and system development. The key towards assessing
    the value of DR is the operational status of the system. In a system that is stressed,
    i.e. the system''s loading is close to its maximum capacity, the value of DR could
    be high. Another factor that determines the value of the addition of DR resources
    is the flexibility of the existing generation mix. It is more likely that DR will
    have greater value in systems with significant penetration of non-dispatchable
    renewable generation and relatively inflexible base load generation. Furthermore,
    even in such cases the DR based solutions are not always competitive in comparison
    with traditional approaches such as the OCGT units that are technically proven
    and significantly flexible generation side resources. The economic compensation
    of DR participation in the energy market is the second issue to be addressed by
    the ISOs. This discussion is controversial in most markets around the world [196].
    One argument is that DR providers should be compensated at the full market price,
    similarly to the generators, since the two services are identical, which is the
    case in ISO New England (ISO-NE) and NYISO. However, the decision not to purchase
    energy is not the same as physically supplying energy. The loads participating
    in wholesale markets would receive dual benefits, being paid at the market price
    for their service and achieving retail bill savings because of the reduced consumption.
    In order to promote a more efficient DR compensation from the point of view of
    the ISO, in MISO and PJM the DR is compensated at the full market price minus
    the retail rate [187]. On the other hand, DR providers argue that DR creates positive
    externalities such as economic and environmental benefits, and thus they should
    be granted payments higher than the market prices. The CAISO [206] identifies
    the problem of the compensation of DR as one of the main barriers as well. Insufficient
    compensation of DR may limit its investment recovery capability and thus demotivate
    its development, while excessive subsides may jeopardize the economic stability
    of the market. The third challenge for the ISOs is the lack of suitable and transparent
    tools in order to evaluate, measure and verify the demand reductions [15]. The
    European Network of TSOs for Electricity (ENTSO-E) recognizes that inefficient
    data handling in European electricity markets is a hindrance that may limit the
    growth of DR [190]. Currently, stakeholders have limited access to data that prevents
    them from fulfilling their role, while rendering difficult the coordination and
    the verification of the realization of DR. Furthermore, the existing forecasting
    and planning methodologies are not adequate to investigate the capability of DR
    to serve as an alternative to conventional system expansion approaches [207].
    The absence of standard methodologies to study the cost-effectiveness of DR hinders
    the decisions to perform investments. There are also two problems in identifying
    the size of DR resources. First, it is difficult to evaluate the number of customers
    that are willing to be involved in a DR program and therefore its potential capacity
    [208]. Second, there is not a standard way to determine the customer consumption
    baselines in order to accurately depict the normal consumption of a customer.
    A flawed methodology bears the risk of consumers gaming with their baselines in
    order to get paid without providing real load reductions and would render the
    deployment of DR resources economically unreliable [187]. 5.5. Barriers associated
    with infrastructure and relevant investment costs The key technologies for the
    implementation of DR have already been developed. However, the current levels
    of penetration of control, metering and communication technologies in the power
    systems should be increased in order to enable widespread DR activities [18].
    A range of DR activities may require a small number of limited duration interruptions
    and could be performed manually (e.g. light dimming, equipment shut down, etc.).
    Nevertheless, participation of demand in ancillary services would require more
    frequent and much shorter interruptions. Control and automation technologies must
    be adopted by the consumers to provide such services, especially regulation. This
    implies that consumers, with the potential of being subsided by a utility, would
    have to uptake such investments that bear operating and maintenance costs. Furthermore,
    metering equipment that allows real-time data transmission should be placed in
    order to comply with service verification requirements and this constitutes another
    significant economic burden since telemetry equipment has costs that tend to increase
    with the required speed of response [185]. Stakeholders in MISO [187] and CAISO
    [206] have raised concerns regarding the costs, especially to install equipment
    in order to comply with the telemetry requirements of the available DR programs
    that have been characterized as unreasonable. For example, Alcoa, a metal industry
    that participates as a DR resource in MISO region has reported a total cost for
    the telemetry infrastructure, the EMS, the bidding interface and the database
    system of $750,000. It is evident that such costs are bearable only for large
    industrial consumers, explicitly excluding smaller resources from the participation
    in DR activities. Similarly, the commercial sector perceives the capital costs
    of manual and automatic DR as prohibitive in order to participate in DR programs
    [209]. Finally, the increased cost of residential EMSs is a barrier to the development
    of residential DR [35], while the limited savings from consuming energy in low
    price periods would not meet the investment costs. Currently, automated residential
    DR is viable only for longer term home owners who have the income to support such
    an investment, unlike low income social groups and tenants living in rented residences
    [210]. 5.6. Barriers associated with electricity end-users When it comes to DR
    the greatest challenge is related to the successful engagement of customers in
    DR programs. Despite the fact that in the U.S. DR has been developing for more
    than a decade, only 23% of customers were enrolled in available DR programs in
    2012 [211]. Evidently, lack of customer interest and support is a definite factor
    limiting the development of DR [212]. There is a series of reasons for which the
    engagement of consumers is an impediment towards the evolution of DR programs.
    The first challenge is that unlike the generation side, the electricity consumers
    do not necessarily follow an economically rational behaviour and, therefore, their
    response cannot be predicted using conventional economic models. The majority
    of electricity consumers view energy as a good rather than a commodity and as
    a result minimizing their electricity bill by responding to price signals or raising
    revenue by participating in other types of DR programs may not be their primary
    concern. O’Connell et al. [6] have compiled the main results of studies regarding
    residential customers enrolled in TOU and RTP programs that demonstrate evidence
    for the lack of economic rationality and the need to develop more advanced economic
    models in order to predict the response of the consumers considering factors such
    as the effect of weather on consumption and the asymmetry between information
    and response. There are also several limitations as regards the non-residential
    customers. The basic challenge for this sector is that loss of comfort because
    of consumption limiting or interruption may negatively affect their primary intentions.
    For example, according to a field test in the U.K., hotels are likely to provide
    a considerable short-term response through managing the AC unit load; however,
    the duration of this response is limited by the thermal comfort of hotel guests.
    Also, shopping centers theoretically present comparable DR potential, but perceive
    the loss of comfort linked with DR as a negative factor for the commercial gain
    [193]. Another factor that renders commercial customers reluctant to enrol in
    DR programs is the relatively short warning period that does not allow for efficient
    decision making to take place [209]. Finally, in many regions, especially in Europe,
    the majority of end-users are accustomed with a uniform price of electricity and
    therefore the awareness about the volatile cost of electricity is limited. As
    a result, exposing them to dynamic electricity prices raises concerns about the
    value of postponing the usage of electricity in contrast with the immediate satisfaction
    of their needs as a result of consuming electricity [204]. The second challenge
    is related to the contract design. Different consumers should be offered appropriate
    contracts, tailored to their consumption profiles. Without appropriate and transparent
    information, consumers could be confused with too many unclear offers, complex
    contract handling and the multiple parties involved. The consumer acceptance could
    be raised in the presence of a single billing scheme in which the retail supplier,
    network charges and DR payments are all included in the same bill [190]. As a
    result, absence of tools and mechanisms such as price comparison tools and standardization
    of contract design may pose difficulties to the end-users deliberately choosing
    the most suitable contract for them [213]. Issues regarding the deployment of
    smart meters and consumer protection relate further the end-users to the challenges
    that need to be overcome in order to facilitate the development of DR programs.
    Currently there exists a broad legal framework on privacy and data security at
    the EU and international level regarding data processing for billing purposes.
    However, DR is not specifically covered by this legal framework, since it would
    require a significant increase in processing frequency and data granularity. The
    EU is currently promoting the active deployment of smart meters because of the
    perception that it constitutes the core element towards transparency, yet fixed
    tariff and several varying pricing schemes such as TOU pricing do not require
    two-way communication [204]. Overall, the low physical security of the meters
    and control equipment, the prospect of using the internet for communication and
    services and the increased number of intervening parties should be covered by
    clear privacy laws. The absence of a common framework fosters an instable regulatory
    environment for investors and confines consumers’ acceptance [191]. 6. Conclusions
    The current advancements in metering, communication and control infrastructure
    allows for the development of DR programs targeting at different types of customers
    through appropriate incentives. Engaging consumers in order to shift or forego
    energy during periods of system stress can prove beneficial in many aspects. Mostly,
    DR is likely to prove an important resource in order to enhance the flexibility
    of power systems in order to accommodate increasing amounts of intermittent renewable
    generation. The thorough review of existing DR programs around the world demonstrated
    a highly asymmetrical development between different regions. The U.S. is evidently
    leading in the adoption of DR, offering diverse programs in order to exploit the
    response from various types of consumers. Europe and Oceania are also taking important
    steps towards engaging demand side resources in the system practices. It is interesting
    to notice that despite the lack of homogeneity, efforts to develop DR programs
    are pursued globally, clearly indicating that utilities are starting to perceive
    DR as a useful resource rather than a complicating factor. Given that the required
    infrastructure to implement DR programs targeting at any customer type is nowadays
    available, in order to further promote the activation of the demand side a series
    of barriers, mainly regulatory and economic, are yet to be addressed. Acknowledgement

    1627-1638. (doi: 10.13031/2013.23965) @2007 Authors:   H. J. Farahani, T. A. Howell,
    W. J. Shuttleworth, W. C. Bausch Keywords:   Bowen ratio, Crop coefficient, Eddy
    correlation, Evaporation, Evapotranspiration, Lysimetry, Penman-Monteith, Remote
    sensing, Transpiration, Water productivity This article provides a focused survey
    of progress in crop evapotranspiration (ET) measurement and modeling, with particular
    emphasis on the aspects of interest to the irrigation profession. The significant
    advances in understanding and quantifying crop ET during the past few decades
    are largely due to our increased ability to measure near-surface climate variables
    and surface energy and momentum exchanges, complemented by progress in soil and
    plant sensor technology. However, ET measurement is not commonly practiced, and
    modeling is mostly preferred. Much theoretical progress in ET modeling originated
    with the 1948 work of Penman and the subsequent modification to the Penman-Monteith
    (P-M) equation and to multi-layer and sparse canopy models. These advances strengthened
    confidence in using the combination equation and encouraged a significant step
    forward through the adaptation of the P-M equation to provide a standard estimate
    of reference crop ET for use in the long-established, two-step, crop coefficient
    (Kc) methodology. Recently, there has been a continued progress in this field
    via the one-step application of the P-M equation to estimate crop ET directly
    using effective stomatal resistance rather than Kc. This article concludes by
    drawing attention to a general need to improve crop water productivity by reducing
    non-beneficial soil evaporation and, in this context, the potential value of using
    improved methods and models to partition ET and to aid scheduling limited irrigation.

    a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • First ever national crop mapping
    at 10 m for Mali, Ukraine and South-Africa • Near real time agriculture monitoring
    at parcel level made operational nationwide • Demonstration across the world of
    multi-sensor EO exploitation for crop monitoring • Sentinel-2 time series mapping
    crop type at 10 m resolution along the growing season • Sen2-Agri: an innovative
    system to monitor crops in any country around the globe Abstract The convergence
    of new EO data flows, new methodological developments and cloud computing infrastructure
    calls for a paradigm shift in operational agriculture monitoring. The Copernicus
    Sentinel-2 mission providing a systematic 5-day revisit cycle and free data access
    opens a completely new avenue for near real-time crop specific monitoring at parcel
    level over large countries. This research investigated the feasibility to propose
    methods and to develop an open source system able to generate, at national scale,
    cloud-free composites, dynamic cropland masks, crop type maps and vegetation status
    indicators suitable for most cropping systems. The so-called Sen2-Agri system
    automatically ingests and processes Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series in a
    seamless way to derive these four products, thanks to streamlined processes based
    on machine learning algorithms and quality controlled in situ data. It embeds
    a set of key principles proposed to address the new challenges arising from countrywide
    10 m resolution agriculture monitoring. The full-scale demonstration of this system
    for three entire countries (Ukraine, Mali, South Africa) and five local sites
    distributed across the world was a major challenge met successfully despite the
    availability of only one Sentinel-2 satellite in orbit. In situ data were collected
    for calibration and validation in a timely manner allowing the production of the
    four Sen2-Agri products over all the demonstration sites. The independent validation
    of the monthly cropland masks provided for most sites overall accuracy values
    higher than 90%, and already higher than 80% as early as the mid-season. The crop
    type maps depicting the 5 main crops for the considered study sites were also
    successfully validated: overall accuracy values higher than 80% and F1 Scores
    of the different crop type classes were most often higher than 0.65. These respective
    results pave the way for countrywide crop specific monitoring system at parcel
    level bridging the gap between parcel visits and national scale assessment. These
    full-scale demonstration results clearly highlight the operational agriculture
    monitoring capacity of the Sen2-Agri system to exploit in near real-time the observation
    acquired by the Sentinel-2 mission over very large areas. Scaling this open source
    system on cloud computing infrastructure becomes instrumental to support market
    transparency while building national monitoring capacity as requested by the AMIS
    and GEOGLAM G-20 initiatives. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res

    promoted as a key data source for operational agriculture monitoring. The coarse
    to medium resolution optical instruments on board of SPOT-Vegetation, MODIS and
    PROBA-V satellites play a major role in operational near real-time crop monitoring
    thanks to their daily revisit cycle, their global coverage, their long-term archive
    and their access at no or limited cost. The Landsat satellite series permitted
    developing operational crop type mapping at high resolution for some specific
    agricultural landscapes characterized by large fields such as in the United States
    (Boryan et al., 2011; USDA, 2018; Yan and Roy, 2014) and Canada (McNairn et al.,
    2009; Fisette et al., 2015; Davidson et al., 2017). However, the 16-day revisit
    cycle was found problematic for near real-time crop type mapping and in regions
    with persistent cloud cover due to the limited number of valid observations (Blaes
    et al., 2005; Johnson, 2014; McNairn et al., 2009; Whitcraft et al., 2015b). Furthermore,
    the 30-m spatial resolution does not allow resolving the individual fields in
    many agricultural landscapes, preventing any parcel-based application on most
    cropping systems around the world. For instance, the advanced crop monitoring
    system developed over India (Ray et al., 2016) is only possible thanks to a combination
    of the Indian Resourcesat-2 AWiFS and LISS-IV instruments (i.e. spatial resolution
    of 56 m and 5,8 m respectively). Commercial satellite constellations such as RapidEye
    allow monitoring agricultural landscapes with a spatial resolution higher than
    5 m (Lussem et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016). However, their small scene footprint
    combined with rather poor radiometric and atmospheric correction were identified
    as significant issues preventing operational wall-to-wall consistent coverage
    over large areas in addition to the cost constraint (Davidson et al., 2017). SPOT
    6&7 imagery is similarly used over targeted areas for commercial crop advice programs
    (e.g. FARMSTAR service in France (WWW4)) or specific applications like nitrogen
    management (e.g. MasAgro GreenSat project in Mexico (WWW6)), but cannot be generalized
    due to their significant cost and still limited scene footprint. Building on the
    Landsat and SPOT missions'' legacy, the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite constellation
    and its MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) were designed in the framework of the European
    Copernicus program for land surface and agriculture monitoring to measure the
    reflected solar spectral reflectance in 13 bands ranging from the visible to the
    ShortWave Infrared (SWIR) bands. The spectral bands include three narrow bands
    for cloud screening and atmospheric correction at 60 m, three red-edge bands and
    two SWIR bands at 20 m providing key information about vegetation, as well as
    the classical blue, green, red and near infrared bands at 10 m (Gascon et al.,
    2017). Since late 2015, the Sentinel-2A (S2A) satellite provides a revisit time
    of 10 days over Europe and Africa and of 20 days elsewhere while the successful
    launch of Sentinel-2B (S2B) in March 2017 ensures a 5-day revisit time above all
    landmasses since February 2018. The S2A and S2B space component was designed as
    a global consistent and long-term solution, whose continuity is ensured beyond
    at least 2030 with the forthcoming Sentinel-2C and 2D satellites. Unlike the previous
    Earth Observation (EO) missions, the wide-swath of S2 combined with its 5-day
    revisit cycle opened the door for revisiting agricultural mapping and monitoring,
    and for addressing new challenges, related to the diversity of cropping systems
    at global scale. Indeed, the Copernicus open and free access policy coupled with
    the S2 great image quality performance (Gascon et al., 2017) provides the opportunity
    to build dense and consistent time series over a growing cycle in most regions
    of the world. Yet, a key research question concerns the scientific feasibility
    of a generic exploitation of the S2 time series for agriculture monitoring across
    the world. Indeed, up to now, no high spatial resolution agriculture application
    has been considered beyond national scale for systematic, regular and wall-to-wall
    monitoring (Fritz et al., 2018). Since decades, comparative analysis of Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Dry Matter Productivity (DMP) or biophysical
    variables (e.g. fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR)
    or Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series) derived from 1-km or 250–300 m daily observations
    has been applied at global scale. Anomaly detection with regard to the last 10 years
    or profile similarity analysis based on these remotely-sensed biophysical variables
    are operational for early warning systems in various contexts, for instance the
    Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Global Information
    and Early Warning System (GIEWS), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS-NET)
    from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Monitoring
    Agriculture by Remote Sensing (MARS) project of the European Commission Joint
    Research Centre (JRC), and the CropWatch Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
    However, these approaches always consider the agricultural landscape in a broad
    sense (Vancutsem et al., 2012), trying to un-mix natural and cultivated vegetation
    in the best case (Genovese et al., 2001), but never separately monitoring the
    different crops in the landscapes. The diversity of agricultural practices and
    cropping systems observed around the world has already been highlighted by Biradar
    et al. (2009). More recently, Waldner et al. (2016) demonstrated that the classification
    performance is much more dependent on the type of cropping systems, than on the
    classification method. This result, based on the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment
    and Monitoring network (JECAM) (WWW5), relied on the comparison of five different
    cropland mapping methodologies over five contrasting JECAM sites of medium to
    large field size, using the same time series of 7-day 250 m Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) mean composites. In this new context, the European
    Space Agency (ESA) funded the Sentinel-2 for Agriculture (Sen2-Agri) project (WWW3),
    which aimed at developing an open-source system based on generic time series analysis
    methods for crop mapping and monitoring, and which could be applied anywhere,
    taking advantage of the global availability of EO high resolution time series
    acquired by S2 and Landsat 8 (L8). The scientific challenge was to design an EO
    exploitation strategy globally applicable and able to ingest time series in a
    generic and systematic way, in order to make the most of the new EO high resolution
    acquisition systems. The methodological design of this ambitious strategy follows
    previous inter-comparison of classification methods of high resolution and frequent
    EO data available from the SPOT-4 (Take 5) initiative. These benchmark studies
    were conducted across the JECAM network that provides sites distributed across
    the world (Inglada et al., 2015; Matton et al., 2015; Valero et al., 2016). The
    Sen2-Agri open source system design and development addressed the top priority
    crop monitoring needs in support of the national reporting capacities for the
    “Sustainable Development Goal 2 – Zero Hunger” (SDG-2) and the GEOGLAM initiative
    (Whitcraft et al., 2015a, Parihar et al., 2012). The objective of this paper is
    to investigate whether the generic time series analysis methods provided by the
    Sen2-Agri platform can be successfully applied to various cropping systems to
    deliver key agriculture information in a timely and accurate manner at 10 m resolution
    over large areas (i.e. national scale). The study provides an overview of the
    methods and algorithms implemented in the Sen2-Agri system, presenting for the
    first time the underlying innovative ideas specifically designed to high resolution
    nation-wide agriculture monitoring. Then, the paper reports and discusses the
    performance of the Sen2-Agri system through local and national scale cases studies
    over sites spanning a wide range of crops, landscapes and agricultural practices
    for the agricultural season 2016–2017. 2. Overall approach 2.1. Requirements and
    challenges for a high-resolution nation-wide agriculture monitoring system The
    top priority information required by the stakeholders in charge of crop monitoring
    has not evolved much since the early days of satellite remote sensing. Again in
    2015, several surveys and stakeholder meetings organized at international level
    defined four basic products expected from the current EO systems (Bontemps et
    al., 2015): (i) regular cloud-free surface reflectance images at high resolution
    to distinguish the individual fields; (ii) an early cropland mask allowing the
    operational early warning systems to focus on the medium resolution NDVI time
    series analysis on the land actually cultivated; (iii) a crop type map at a spatial
    resolution compatible with field size to locate the crop distribution and to possibly
    serve as early area indicator for the main crop groups; (iv) wherever possible,
    a continuous time series of NDVI and LAI at high resolution to describe the vegetation
    development on very regular basis. Any nationwide remote sensing solution aiming
    to address these agricultural user requirements faces four underestimated challenges
    largely unresolved for processing high spatial resolution EO time series. First,
    a significant agro-climatic gradient spanning over the national territory gradually
    shifts the cropping calendar of most crops, as well as the crop type distribution,
    making the scaling up to national level rather problematic. Second, overlapping
    and interweaving growing seasons for a given area makes the concept of an annual
    cropland mask rather irrelevant as the identification of the start and the end
    of an agricultural season is very arbitrary or impossible. For instance, in Northern
    European countries, winter wheat of the next growing season is sowed months before
    the harvest of spring crops like maize or sugar beet; not to mention the nitrogen
    fixing and cover crops planted between the main crops or the complexity of multiple
    growing cycles irrigated all year round. Third, unlike medium resolution daily
    observations providing consistent 7-day or 10-day composite time series, high
    spatial resolution EO time series suffer from spatially irregular image density
    and heterogeneous distribution of observation dates due to the occurrence of clouds,
    orbit cycle, and overlapping observations, thus increasing the complexity of model
    calibration and pixel classification. The last and fourth issue is the large discrepancy
    between cadastral parcels and agriculture management units preventing the use
    of any up-to-date field boundary layer valid for the ongoing growing season, even
    in most developed countries. Such an annually updated layer would be instrumental
    for processing 10 m time series in a much more constrained approach. 2.2. Key
    principles for a high-resolution automated processing system As a contribution
    to properly answer these four unresolved challenges, a combination of innovative
    elements were developed and implemented in the Sen2-Agri system with the aim to
    move from data set processing on a yearly basis, to a continuous delivery of information,
    not only of NDVI or vegetation conditions but also of cropland masks and crop
    type maps. These developments rely on the following basic ideas. 1. The methods
    implemented in the Sen2-Agri system should make a maximal use of the EO time series
    information, and should not rely on single date images nor on seasonal composites.
    2. In order to have homogeneous time series, a regular sampling of observations
    is necessary. Temporally interpolated surface reflectance values (with a time
    step equivalent to the sensor revisit cycle) could maintain the information content,
    deal with the spatial heterogeneity of time series density and observation date,
    and fill the gaps due to clouds or missing values. A high quality cloud mask and
    atmospheric correction is necessary to get consistent and smooth time series.
    3. A monthly updated cropland mask provides dynamic cropland information in order
    to deal with the overlapping cropping seasons, with possible cropping calendar
    shifts along agro-climatic gradients, and with asynchronous cropping patterns
    due to irrigation. The relevant cropland mask corresponding to a given month will
    be selected to address a specific application. 4. The monthly cropland mask should
    be produced based on a 12-month rolling period (i.e. EO time series corresponding
    to the last 12 months) to enhance the cropland discrimination accuracy and to
    cope with the frequent co-occurrence of the growing season and the cloudiest periods.
    5. The availability of in situ data is key for cropland and crop type mapping.
    A methodology providing a cropland mask without any in situ data is implemented
    for areas not accessible on the field for various reasons (e.g. conflict, flooding).
    It is based on spectral features calculated at specific stages of the growing
    cycle rather than for any a priori date or any given time interval (more detail
    in Section 2.4.2). In this way, surface reflectance values are composited based
    on specific events or typical characteristics of annually cultivated fields (e.g.
    bare soil period, fast growing period, etc.), thus addressing the challenge of
    the agro-climatic gradient. 6. The decoupling between cropland mapping and crop
    type discrimination corresponds to a hierarchical approach to take advantage of
    different classification strategies in the absence of pre-existing field boundaries
    layers like the Land Parcel Information System available in most European countries
    (JRC, 2001). 7. While the EO data near-real-time processing should be based on
    tiles to be fully scalable and run in parallel, the machine learning classification
    models (for both cropland and crop type maps) must be trained over larger areas
    corresponding to agro-climatic zones rather homogeneous in terms of climate, agro-ecological
    conditions (relief, soil, etc.), cropping systems and agricultural practices.
    The use of such a stratification avoids requiring a complete set of in situ data
    for each tile and therefore ensures the validity of the trained models over large
    areas. It also allows coping with agro-climatic gradients inducing a very diversity
    of crop calendars and growing conditions. 8. The machine-learning algorithm to
    be selected must be able to cope with the diversity of spectro-temporal signatures
    for a given crop due to various planting dates, cultivars, and weather conditions,
    still present in any agro-climatic zone. All these principles have been embedded
    in the design of the Sen2-Agri system to deliver a flexible and highly performing
    tool. While the Sen2-Agri system has been fully documented (ESA Sen2-Agri, 2016)
    and already found uptake by operational stakeholders, it is the first time that
    these underlying innovative ideas are consistently explained, as well as applied,
    validated and discussed through different case studies. 2.3. The Sen2-Agri system
    The ESA Sen2-Agri system is an operational standalone processing system made of
    modules generating agricultural products from S2 L1C and/or L8 L1T time series
    along the growing season. The use of only S2 or only L8 or combining S2 and L8
    time series is a choice offered to the user. These different products consist
    of: (i). monthly cloud-free composites of surface reflectance at 10–20 m resolution;
    (ii). monthly dynamic cropland masks, delivered from the agricultural mid-season
    onwards; (iii). cultivated crop type maps at 10 m resolution for main crop groups,
    delivered twice during agricultural seasons; (iv). time series of vegetation status
    indicators, NDVI and LAI, describing the vegetative development of crops each
    time a cloud-free observation is recorded. The Sen2-Agri system is based on machine
    learning algorithms and relies on in situ data to map the cropland and crop type
    classes (even if a solution to generate cropland mask without any in situ data
    is also provided). The Sen2-Agri system is open-source, allowing any user to generate
    near real-time products tailored to his needs at its own premises or on cloud
    computing infrastructure (Fig. 1). It is composed of a set of independent processing
    modules orchestrated by a data-driven approach. Before generating any product,
    L1 Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (S2 L1C and L8 L1T product) is converted
    to accurate Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance, with a good quality cloud
    mask (L2A product). Download : Download high-res image (534KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Diagram of Sen2-Agri processing system made of independent
    processing modules orchestrated by a data-driven approach, i.e. running according
    to the data flows coming from S2 and L8 catalogs. The main goal of the system
    is to enable handling large volumes of EO data in a timely manner and to be easily
    scaled up to cover the whole region of interest. The Sen2-Agri system has been
    designed to facilitate the expansion of the hardware or software configuration
    without redesign and with almost no downtime, being able to support additional
    processing needs. The building blocks of the software solution for the modules
    rely on the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) (Grizonnet et al., 2017; WWW8), a high-resolution
    image processing toolbox, open source, portable and able to be extended to complement
    the suite of the already developed algorithms. These blocks are organized into
    several processing chains while being coordinated by a custom developed orchestrator
    which can dispatch the processing jobs to several nodes via SLURM, an open source
    resource manager (https://slurm.schedmd.com/). The level-3 and level-4 processing
    blocks are fully compatible with the S2 Toolbox (WWW2) and can be integrated in
    the common Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP) through external tool adapters,
    thereby allowing their usage either independently or as a processing chain outside
    the Sen2-Agri system. 2.4. The Sen2-Agri module functionalities The Sen2-Agri
    algorithms allowing the generation of each product were selected based on comprehensive
    benchmarking, described in detail in Bontemps et al. (2015). This benchmarking
    took place before the S2 era, based on the SPOT 4&5 (Take 5) time series, which
    mimicked the “Sentinel-2 like conditions” (Hagolle et al., 2013; Hagolle et al.,
    2015). Inglada et al. (2015), Matton et al. (2015) and Valero et al. (2016) described
    the respective methods and the benchmarking results. During this research, methods
    were adjusted to S2 data and fine-tuned to near real-time operational conditions.
    All algorithms are designed to run with S2 and/or L8 images that have been atmospherically-corrected
    using the Multisensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud-Screening (MACCS) algorithm,
    included in the Sen2-Agri system. The specific strength of MACCS is to use multi-temporal
    criteria to build the various masks (land, water, snow, cloud and cloud shadow)
    and to detect the aerosols before the atmospheric correction (Hagolle et al.,
    2008; Hagolle et al., 2010). MACCS was selected for the high quality of its cloud
    and cloud shadow mask, which is of critical importance for operational applications.
    Indeed, the Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (WWW1) pointed out
    its high performance for water vapour retrieval and showed that MACCS provided
    accurate and robust surface reflectance estimates for all test sites (Doxani et
    al., 2018). The only limitations identified during this exercise concern (i) a
    slightly heavier processing cost than other state-of-the-art atmospheric correction
    processors due to the basic requirements of the underlying multi-temporal algorithm
    and (2) some difficulties to retrieve the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOT) when the
    surface reflectance is high, which corresponds to arid sites and should have a
    limited impact for agriculture applications. The methods implemented in each processing
    module corresponding to the respective product are briefly described in this section.
    2.4.1. Monthly composites of surface reflectance Monthly composites are generated
    using a weighted average algorithm, which consists in averaging cloud-free surface
    reflectance values over a given period (Vancutsem et al., 2007a; Vancutsem et
    al., 2007b). The method relies on the repetitivity of observations to statistically
    reduce errors that could happen due to undetected clouds or cloud shadows or atmospheric
    correction errors. For each monthly composite, a compositing period longer than
    a month is used (50 days) to promote a lower amount of remaining cloudy pixels.
    The reference date of the composite corresponds to the first day of the month,
    and the algorithm makes use of the 25 days before and the 25 days after this reference
    date. L2A images are first pre-processed to remove directional effects, using
    a model based on Maignan et al. (2004) and Bréon and Vermote (2012). The directional
    model is Ross-Thick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal BRDF (Li and Strahler, 1992; Ross, 1981),
    following the study of Roy et al. (2016). There is no inter-calibration performed
    between the S2 and L8 sensors. L8 spectral bands are resampled to the spatial
    resolution of the corresponding S2A spectral bands (10 m for L8 bands 2, 3 and
    4 and 20 m for the L8 bands 5, 7 and 8). Neither the blue band nor the 60-m S2A
    bands are provided in the composite. Averaged observations are weighted pixel
    wise in a way to favour dates with low aerosol content, low cloudiness and pixels
    far from clouds (Hagolle et al., 2015). A greater weight is also given to acquisitions
    closer to the central date and acquired by the S2A sensor. In order to meet the
    challenges of near real-time delivery and being able to deliver the monthly composite
    a few days after the end of the acquisition period, the algorithm has been implemented
    as a recurrent process. The algorithm is not run once for all acquisitions at
    the end of the acquisition period, but at each acquisition, generating a first
    intermediate composite from the first image and updating it each time a new image
    is available. These intermediate products are not delivered by the system. The
    overall process is illustrated in Fig. 2. The algorithm is applied over all pixels
    identified as “Land” or “Water” by the MACCS algorithm. “Snow”, “Cloud” and “Cloud
    shadow” pixels are added at the end of the process if no “Land” or “Water” pixel
    has been observed during the acquisition period. Download : Download high-res

    average compositing process. 2.4.2. Monthly cropland masks While the class “cropland”
    has no clear definition in the literature, the research relies on the “cropland”
    definition proposed by the JECAM network in the framework of GEOGLAM: the “annual
    cropland from a remote sensing perspective is a piece of land of a minimum 0.25 ha
    (minimum width of 30 m) that is sowed/planted and harvestable at least once within
    the 12 months after the sowing/planting date. The annual cropland produces an
    herbaceous cover and is sometimes combined with some tree or woody vegetation”
    (JECAM, 2018). In this definition, perennial crops and fallows are excluded from
    the cropland class. There are three further important considerations to this definition:
    1) sugarcane plantations and cassava crops are included in the cropland class
    even though they may have a longer vegetation cycle than 12 months and are not
    planted yearly; 2) small fields taken individually, such as legumes, do not meet
    the minimum size criteria of the cropland definition; 3) greenhouse crops cannot
    be monitored by satellite remote sensing and are thus excluded from the definition.
    The developed method to map the cropland class starts from the original L2A time
    series (not from the above-mentioned composites), fills the data gaps and relies
    on a supervised Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Two options are implemented to build
    the RF model depending on the availability or not of in situ data (Fig. 3). Download
    : Download high-res image (367KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3.
    Workflow of the method developed to generate the cropland mask for each agro-climatic
    stratum separately. The first option assumes the availability of in situ data,
    corresponding to (i) a set of crop type samples characterizing the diversity of
    the cropland class and (ii) a set of non-cropland samples corresponding to the
    main other land cover classes (vegetation, water, bare soil, etc.). In this case,
    the RF model is built on statistical and temporal features for each crop type.
    Temporal features are derived from the NDVI time series while statistical features
    are extracted from Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), brightness (defined
    as the Euclidean norm of the surface reflectance values in green (ρ0.560), red
    (ρ0.665), NIR (ρ0.842) and SWIR (ρ1.610)) and S2 red-edge indices. The S2 red-edge
    indices are as follows (with ρ being the reflectance value in a spectral channel
    given by its central wavelength) (Hatfield and Prueger, 2010): Red edge NDVI = (ρ0.842 − ρ0.740)/(ρ0.842 + ρ0.740)
    (Gitelson and Merzlyak, 1994) S2 Red Edge Position = 705 + 35 × (0.5 × (ρ0.783 + ρ0.665) − ρ0.705)/(ρ0.740 − ρ0.705)
    Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI) = (ρ0.665 − ρ0.490)/ρ0.705 (Merzlyak
    et al., 1999) Chlorophyll Red − Edge = ρ0.705/ρ0.842 The reader is referred to
    Valero et al. (2016) to get a detailed description of the whole set of features.
    Since the NDVI temporal features are calculated for all dates of the time series,
    it is critical to get the same dates on the whole area of interest, independently
    from the sensor orbits. A temporal resampling is therefore implemented along with
    the gap filling, at a sampling rate corresponding to the sensor revisit cycle.
    In the second option, in the absence of any in situ data, calibration data are
    selected from an existing reference map (i.e. a general land cover map at local,
    regional or global scale) and cleaned using an iterative trimming process (Desclée
    et al., 2006; Radoux et al., 2014) before being used by the RF algorithm. The
    by-default reference map currently available in the Sen2-Agri system is the ESA
    Climate Change Initiative (CCI) global Land Cover Map from 2010 (Land Cover CCI
    Product User Guide, 2017), but the users have the possibility to upload their
    own map if preferred. Land cover maps often do not provide crop type information
    and it is important to define features as generic as possible in order to be independent
    of the crop growing calendar and to allow dealing with the cropland diversity
    and the gradient across landscape. In this case, the RF model is built based on
    temporal features corresponding to specific stages of the growing cycle: (i) the
    date of the maximum and minimum NDVI slopes, (ii) the date of the maximum and
    minimum NDVI values, and (iii) the date of the maximum red band value (Matton
    et al., 2015; Lambert et al., 2016). The gap filling step is coupled with a smoothing
    using a Whittaker filter, to make possible the robust extraction of these temporal
    metrics. In the case users select both S2A and L8 sensors, their respective L2A
    surface reflectance time series are pre-processed independently. S2A and L8 L2A
    time series are then concatenated, providing to the RF algorithm a mixed S2A and
    L8 cloud-free time series. In both options, with and without in situ data, an
    a posteriori optional step allows filtering the cropland mask, using majority
    voting over objects delineated by a mean-shift algorithm, applied on the outcome
    of a Principal Component Analysis of NDVI time series (Valero et al., 2016). For
    large-scale monitoring, the Sen2-Agri system also allows the user to define a
    stratification of the considered region into independent sub-regions or strata
    which are assumed to be homogeneous regarding climate and agro-ecological conditions
    (relief, soil, etc.) as well as agricultural practices. All in situ samples (coming
    either from field data or from the reference map) within a stratum are considered
    to build a stratum-specific RF model, which is then applied to all tiles belonging
    to this stratum. Such stratification is to be defined by the user. The proposed
    algorithm makes full use of the S2A high observation frequency by relying on temporal
    features. It is therefore recommended to wait for the mid-season to get meaningful
    temporal features and thus, a more satisfactory result. 2.4.3. Cultivated crop
    type maps L2A surface reflectance time series are interpreted into a crop type
    map, based on supervised learning with RF or Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers
    (Fig. 4). The experience carried out in the benchmarking (Inglada et al., 2015)
    showed that RF performs generally better, but SVM is expected to provide better
    classification results in the specific case of classes with few calibration samples.
    RF is therefore the by-default classifier in the Sen2-Agri system. Download :

    of the method developed to generate the crop type map for each agro-climatic stratum
    separately. The method requires the availability of in situ data. Linear interpolation
    and gap filling of surface reflectance time series are first applied like for
    the cropland mask based on in situ data. These two steps are applied independently
    for S2 and L8 time series which are then concatenated before feeding the RF or
    SVM classifier. Features extracted for the classification are surface reflectance
    values in the S2 bands 3 (ρ0.560), 4 (ρ0.665), 5 (ρ0.705), 6 (ρ0.740), 7 (ρ0.783),
    8 (ρ0.842), 11 (ρ1.610) and 12 (ρ2.190), NDVI, NDWI and brightness (defined as
    the Euclidean norm of the surface reflectance values in green (ρ0.560), red (ρ0.665),
    NIR (ρ0.842) and SWIR (ρ1.610)) calculated for each date of the resampled and
    gap-filled time series. These features and the crop type in situ data are then
    used to train the RF or SVM classifier and generate the crop type map. The reader
    is referred to Inglada et al. (2015) for a complete description of the method.
    Like for the cropland mask, in the case of large regions of interest, the user
    is invited to provide a stratification to allow the classifier being learned for
    each individual stratum. The diversity of crop conditions is clearly related to
    the different cropping systems, the variability of associated crop management,
    and the impact of agro-climatic conditions interacting with the soil properties
    and the agricultural practices. 2.4.4. Vegetation status maps based on NDVI and
    LAI The vegetation status product consists in NDVI and LAI maps generated for
    each S2 or L8 acquisition. S2A and L8 sensors are processed independently, resulting
    in distinct NDVI and LAI time series for each sensor. NDVI computation relies
    on the S2 band 8 and not 8a, thus being resampled at 10 m. The difference between
    S2 and L8 bands and the absence of intercalibration between sensors prevent the
    use of any quantitative combination of both NDVI time series. On the other hand,
    LAI retrieval is performed using a non-linear regression model established separately
    for S2 and for L8. The well-known BV-NET approach developed and validated by Weiss
    et al. (2002) allows computing the regression model based on satellite surface
    reflectance values simulated using the ProSail model (Feret et al., 2008; Jacquemoud
    et al., 2009). Fig. 5 illustrates this LAI retrieval process. Download : Download

    the method used to retrieve single-date LAI. Besides, the Sen2-Agri system proposes
    two reprocessing options of the single-date LAI products in order to take benefit
    of the multi-temporal information in the LAI estimation (Fig. 6). First, a near
    real-time algorithm allows adjusting the LAI estimate based on the two previous
    acquisitions, weighting them using the LAI retrieval error estimation. The second
    reprocessing option applicable at the end of the season smooths all the retrieved
    LAI values by fitting a semi-mechanistic phenological model, i.e. the Canopy Structure
    Dynamic Model (CSDM) (Koetz et al., 2005). Download : Download high-res image

    to generate reprocessed and fitted LAI based on single-date LAI. 2.5. Strategy
    for in situ data collection and accuracy assessment In situ data are mandatory
    to generate the crop type map and desired for the cropland mask. The two main
    purposes of in situ data collection are the classifier calibration and the output
    validation. For the cases studies, the campaigns for in situ data collection were
    distributed over the entire area of interest, whether it was a local site or a
    full country (more information in Section 3.1). The data were then randomly split
    into calibration (75%) and validation (25%) sets. These splits were done at the
    field level (i.e. polygons) and not on individual pixels, to ensure the independency
    of the validation samples. In order to encompass the cropping diversity and the
    agro-climatic gradients observed over large areas, the national territories were
    stratified into few strata according to agro-climatic gradients and the corresponding
    agro-ecosystem types, crop type distributions, and cropping calendars. A two-stage
    sampling strategy was applied to ensure a large distribution of the samples and
    a random component in the sample selection. First, the random selection of Primary
    Sampling Units delineated by ancillary data (typically, administrative regions)
    were distributed in the different strata according to their cropland area reported
    in existing agricultural statistics (e.g. FAOSTAT portal (WWW7)) (cropland area-weighted
    sampling probability). Then, within each Primary Sampling Unit, the sampling proceeds
    as a “windshield survey” identifying Elementary Sampling Units (minimum 1 ha)
    along the roads as described in the JECAM guidelines (JECAM, 2018). It is worth
    mentioning that in the case of cropland mapping, the calibration dataset should
    encompass the diversity of all land cover types as well. The validation must provide
    statistically sound estimates of the overall products accuracy based on independent
    reference data sets collected during the course of the season. The number of samples,
    the sampling design, the response design, and the reliability of the data source
    define the quality of the accuracy estimate. While the in situ data are collected
    as polygons, the accuracy assessment is performed at the pixel-level, over pixels
    selected randomly amongst all pixels belonging to the polygons specifically set
    aside for the validation. Two different metrics based on the confusion matrices
    were selected to evaluate the performances of the cropland masks and crop type
    maps. First, the Overall Accuracy (OA) quantifies the overall agreement between
    the map and the reference information. It is calculated as the total number of
    correctly classified pixels divided by the total number of pixels: (1) with n
    being the number of pixels and r the number of classes. Second, the F-Score for
    the class i (also known as F-1 score or F-measure) measures the accuracy of a
    class combining the User Accuracy (UA or Precision) and Producer Accuracy (PA
    or Recall) measures. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of the UA and PA and
    reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0: (2) UA for class i is the fraction
    of correctly classified pixels regarding all pixels classified as class i in the
    output: (3) PA for class i is the fraction of correctly classified pixels regarding
    all pixels identified as class i in the reference data: 3. Study areas and available
    datasets 3.1. Study area The performances of the Sen2-Agri system were demonstrated
    through eight local and national scale experiences spanning a wide range of crops,
    landscapes and agricultural practices. These demonstrations were carried out from
    February 2016 to June 2017, thus making the full exploitation of the first satellite
    of the S2 mission. Three nationwide demonstration exercises, respectively in Ukraine,
    Mali and South Africa, were successfully completed including nationwide in situ
    data collection and production of the respective Sen2-Agri products, then submitted
    to national stakeholders in the context of three national workshops for assessment
    and discussion. The Sen2-Agri system has also been run over five 300 × 300 km
    sites distributed all over the world (Fig. 7). The diversity of the cropping systems
    and conditions of observations was well covered by these sites as described in
    Table 1. For each site, the main crops were identified with the national or local
    partners, as well as the dates of the monitoring period. In particular, the mid-season
    date was defined, on a case-by-case basis, to reflect the key moment where early
    information is useful while ensuring a minimum of 2 months after the start of
    the season. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    collected in each of the study sites. Thanks to a collaborative effort led by
    the respective national or local partners, spatial polygons indicating the crop
    presence and the crop type were obtained from field observations during the main
    growing season. In Mali and South-Africa, in situ data were provided by regular
    national agriculture statistical surveys, then quality-controlled and harmonized.
    Samples for non-agricultural land cover classes were obtained by visual interpretation
    of very high spatial resolution imagery available on line (e.g. Google Earth®
    or Bing Map®) regularly cross-checking with recent S2 cloud-free images. Table
    2 characterizes the cropland and non-cropland samples. The distribution of the
    different land cover classes covered by the cropland and non-cropland samples
    are provided in Fig. S1 (Supplementary Materials), as well as the crop type classes

    through two successive campaigns, at the middle and at the end of the season.
    Over the other sites, a single dataset was collected and delivered at the end
    of the growing season. 3.3. Agro-ecological stratification Stratifications were
    defined over Mali, Ukraine, South Africa and Morocco. In Mali, the stratification
    was designed using the Projet d''Inventaire des Ressources Terrestres (1986),
    which is recognized as the most reliable pre-existing agro-ecological stratification
    at the country-scale. Five agro-ecological strata were defined from the original
    dataset for the cropland and crop type classification. The stratification used
    in Ukraine is aligned with the four agro-ecological strata commonly used to describe
    the country (Bogovin, 2001): “Polissia” in the north which is composed by a mixed
    of natural vegetation, pastures, hayfields and cultivated land, “Forest Steppe”
    in the country centre, presenting very favourable conditions for agriculture (good
    moisture conditions and fertile soils), “Steppe” in the south-east also intensively
    composed of agricultural land, and “Mountains” located in the extreme south-west
    presenting a low percentage of cultivated land. In Morocco, the stratification
    was defined manually to separate the Tensift and the Oum Er-Rabia watersheds.
    In South Africa, the stratification merely corresponds to the Winter Grain Region
    (WGR) and Summer Grain Region (SGR) since they are geographically separate. 3.4.
    Satellite time series All existing S2 L1C and L8 L1T acquisitions covering the
    spatial extent of the sites and the temporal window of the growing season were
    automatically downloaded from the ESA Sci-Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)
    and United States Geological Survey (USGS) (https://landsat.usgs.gov/) servers
    by the Sen2-Agri system. The atmospheric correction and the cloud screening produced
    surface reflectance values and snow, water cloud and cloud-shadow masks using
    the MACCS algorithm for all available images with less than 90% cloud cover at
    the tile or scene level. The S2A acquisition plan first followed the ramp-up phase
    with an observation frequency gradually increased, starting from Europe and Africa.
    As a result, the 10-day observation cycle was available over the European and
    African demonstration sites, while the Chinese one was first covered every 20 days
    and then by three out of the four nominal images in autumn 2016. No S2B data was
    included as the study was completed before the end of the commissioning phase
    of this second satellite. As examples, the amount of S2 and L8 images processed
    over the national demonstration sites are described here below. The time series
    quality is also shortly described. The spatial distribution of the cloud-free
    observations during the growing season in the S2 and L8 time series is illustrated
    for each site in Fig. S2 (Supplementary Materials). For Mali, the L2A surface
    reflectance time series is made of 1793 S2A tiles (6.27TB) and 477 L8 scenes (0.81TB).
    The density of the EO times series is generally good and reasonably well distributed
    along the growing season (Fig. 8(b) and (c)) except in the South-West of the country
    (Fig. 8(a)). Download : Download high-res image (319KB) Download : Download full-size

    of the cloud-free images distribution along the season and cloud-free percentage
    for (a) Bougouni - S2 tile 29PPN, (b) Mopti region - S2 tile 30PUA and (c) Nioro
    du Sahel – S2 tile 29PMS. For Ukraine, the L2A time series is made of 3006 S2A
    tiles (10.52TB) and 558 L8 scenes (0.99TB). Due to its latitude, Ukraine takes
    advantage of a large orbit overlap for both S2A and L8 satellites. More than 78%
    of the Ukraine territory is covered by two L8 orbits in a 16-day Landsat cycle.
    The quality of the EO time series is generally good with around 20 cloud-free
    observations per pixel over the season. However, a high heterogeneity in the number
    of observations can be observed especially along the strips where satellite orbits
    don''t overlap each other. For South-Africa Winter Grain Region (WGR), the L2A
    time series is made of 970 S2A tiles (3.39TB) and 183 L8 scenes (0.32TB). The
    quality of the EO time series is very good. The cloud-free observations are abundant
    and very well distributed along the growing season. For South-Africa Summer Grain
    Region (SGR), the L2A time series is made of 2605 S2A tiles (9.12TB) and 678 L8
    scenes (1.2TB). The quality of the EO time series is generally moderate with around
    13 cloud-free observations per pixel and the density of the time series is drastically
    decreasing from west to east. 4. Sen2-Agri product assessment The suite of Sen2-Agri
    products obtained over the eight study sites, except the composites and the LAI
    maps, which are not locally trained, were quantitatively assessed based on in
    situ data. For the sake of conciseness, the results analysis does not detail all
    products over all sites but focuses on the most relevant results to allow assessing
    Sen2-Agri system performances and its capacity to be relevant for crop monitoring
    in very different cropping systems. 4.1. Cloud-free surface reflectance composites
    Cloud-free surface reflectance composites were generated on a monthly basis during
    the growing season over all sites except the Chinese one where the revisit frequency
    was too irregular due to the ramp-up phase. Every monthly composite was produced
    from a 50-day period in two versions, using S2A data only, and combining both
    S2A and L8 acquisitions, with the exception of Ukraine where the L8 added value
    was not assessed for the months of May and June 2016. Fig. 9 shows the composite
    time series obtained over Mali from July to November 2016. It illustrates the
    capacity to provide spatially-consistent cloud-free multispectral composites at
    10 m resolution over a country like Mali, characterized by significant cloud cover
    during the growing season. It also shows how this 10 m resolution enables the
    discrimination of individual fields even in a Sudano-Sahelian context with highly
    heterogeneous crops growing conditions. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    composites at 10 m resolution along the 2016 growing season over Mali and for
    a zoom (1:25.000) illustrating the dynamics of local agricultural patterns. UTM
    coordinates are expressed in meters. The same kind of series was obtained over
    all sites, with varying proportions of artefacts and remaining clouds, depending
    on the conditions of observation. Table 3 quantifies the remaining gaps (clouds
    and cloud shadows) in terms of pixel proportion in each generated composite, showing
    both the challenging regions for optical observations and the useful contribution
    of L8 acquisitions. It allows identifying the sites where the availability of
    cloud-free observations from S2A and L8 can be critical, as for instance in Mali,
    South Africa – SGR and Madagascar. It is worth mentioning that the system is designed
    to use L8, S2A and S2B imagery, but that in our experiment, only L8 and S2A were
    available, which is not the case anymore, starting from July 2017. Table 3. Missing

    the Chinese site because of the 20-day revisit cycle). From green to red color
    to highlight the nearly cloud-free composites (no missing values) to very cloudy
    ones and the effective contribution of L8 to complement S2 time series. 4.2. Monthly
    cropland masks Cropland masks were generated, using both S2A and L8 time series,
    over all the sites starting from the middle of the season and then monthly updated
    until the end of season. Fig. 10 shows the cropland mask obtained over Mali at
    the end of season (November 2016) as the very first 10 m mapping product for this
    country ever delivered. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    at the end of the season using S2 and L8 data. White and black represent cropland
    and non-cropland classes respectively. For the 3 national demonstration sites,
    Table 4 reports very high values for the accuracy metrics (i.e. OA and F1-Score
    for cropland and non-cropland classes) computed for cropland masks delivered at
    the end of season. These OA estimates reaching very high standards reflect the
    unique density and quality of the EO time series and the performances of the proposed
    methods. These results are also related to the spatial distribution and the quality
    of in situ data used for calibration. The lower performances observed in South-Africa
    are clearly due to a poor regional stratification (differentiating only between
    WGR and SGR), mixing agro-climatic conditions that were too different in landscapes
    with extensive grasslands. It is also explained by some remaining mismatches between
    the Sen2-Agri and the national crop nomenclatures. Last but not least, the high
    accuracy estimates were also enabled by the good matching of the 10-m spatial
    resolution with cropland patterns, which significantly reduces the proportion
    of ambiguous mixed pixels. Table 4. F1-Scores and OA achieved by the end-of-season
    cropland mask over three national territories. Site F1 cropland F1 non-cropland

    Africa – SGR 0.88 0.70 83 The accuracy evolution of cropland masks generated with
    in situ data along the season is presented in Fig. 11, over four 300 × 300 km
    sites located in France, Madagascar, Morocco and Sudan. The accuracy metrics at
    the end of the season are rather similar to the ones obtained for the national
    demonstration sites (Table 4). For all sites except Sudan, high accuracy values
    are obtained right at the middle of the season (the corresponding date being defined
    for each site in Table 1) and a saturation plateau is reached as early as one
    or two months after the mid-season. The additional observations acquired later
    do not improve the accuracy figures until the end of the growing season. These
    results clearly demonstrate the feasibility to deliver accurate cropland masks
    as early as the mid-season, independently to the complexity of the cropping systems.

    (a) F1-Score of the cropland class, (b) F1-Score of the non-cropland class and
    (c) OA. Finally, the cropland masks produced by the classification method running
    without any in situ data and using the by-default ESA CCI global Land Cover Map
    from 2010 reference map, were assessed over Ukraine, France, Sudan and China based
    on the whole in situ data set. In Sudan, a second cropland mask was generated
    using a local Land Cover database generated from 20-m SPOT and 30-m Landsat data
    in 2011. In spite of the fully autonomous nature of this method and the 300-m
    resolution of the ESA CCI land cover map, high accuracy results were obtained
    for most of the sites as shown in Table 5. In all sites, except Sudan, the 300-m
    ESA CCI land cover map proved to be enough to allow getting a cropland mask with
    an OA higher than 80% and F1-Score for cropland and non-cropland classes higher
    than 0.75. In Sudan, the F1-Score for the non-cropland class could be increased
    from 0.49 to 0.57 using the local database at higher spatial resolution. Table

    Fig. S3 (Supplementary Materials). 4.3. Crop type maps Crop type maps were generated
    for all sites, except for China and Mali, at the middle and at the end of the
    growing season, from the combined S2 and L8 time series. This production strongly
    depends on the availability and the quality of in situ crop type information available
    in a timely manner for the calibration. This experience highlights the critical
    importance of the quality control process regarding the data collected in situ.
    In Mali, the official statistical survey was expected to provide relevant field
    information about crop type but it finally emerged that the dataset contained
    significant geolocalization errors, which did not affect the data relevance at
    the village-level, but certainly prevented from using it for crop type mapping.
    Because of the S2 operations ramp up phase, the time series acquired over the
    Chinese site was not dense enough to produce a crop type classification for the
    season. For each site, the legend includes the five main crop types or crop groups,
    as defined by the teams working on the field and in charge of the in situ data
    collection. As an example, Fig. 12 shows the crop type map obtained at the end
    of the season in South Africa – WGR. The legend includes “winter wheat”, “fodder
    crops”, “oilseed crops”, “barley” and a fifth class of “other crops”. Obviously,
    the very challenging discrimination between cereals like winter wheat and winter
    barley is driven only by the difference in crop calendar and leads to a poorer
    accuracy performance in Ukraine (Table 6). In South Africa, this plant similarity
    between winter wheat and winter barley also impacts to a lesser extent the discrimination
    performance. In both countries, winter barley is mostly classified as winter wheat
    (omission error). This is not so visible through the winter barley F1 Score given
    the predominance of this crop in the region. Download : Download high-res image

    crop type maps accuracy assessment over the four local sites of France, Morocco,
    Sudan and Madagascar. It also distinguishes between the crop type maps generated
    at middle and end of the season. Looking at the end-of-season products, the same
    kind of conclusions can be drawn here as for the national products: with the exception
    of Madagascar, OA values are higher than 80% and the F1-Score of the different
    crop types range between 0.6 and 0.98 with the exceptions of “soybean” in Madagascar
    and “sesame” in Sudan. The “sesame” class proved to be very difficult to classify,
    being affected by significant omission and commission errors with sorghum, and
    to a lesser extent with some non-cropland classes. The lower accuracy generally
    observed in Madagascar can be easily explained by very small field sizes (down
    to 20 × 20 m), not so compatible with the 10 m resolution of the S2 instrument.

    metrics but still reach a quality level already useable for early operational
    monitoring. The class that suffers most from this early discrimination is the
    “soybean” in France. Conversely, some specific crops, like “winter rapeseed” in
    France and “alfalfa” in Morocco, are better identified at the middle of the season
    than at the end, most probably because of their specific crop calendar. 4.4. Vegetation
    status maps Unlike the other Sen2-Agri products, NDVI and LAI maps were continuously
    generated over all sites for each S2 and L8 image acquired with less than 90%
    of cloud cover. These NDVI and LAI time series provide the evolution of the green
    vegetation in near real-time. They can be masked with the Sen2-Agri cropland masks
    or crop type maps to highlight the growing condition of all crops or of a specific
    crop vegetation, as illustrated in Fig. 13 for winter wheat fields in Ukraine.

    5. Discussion This research demonstrated the utility of the Sen2-Agri system for
    large-scale agriculture monitoring in various cropping systems widely distributed
    over the world. It provided quantitative results over three entire countries (Ukraine,
    Mali, South Africa) and five local sites and discussed the performances in relation
    to analyzed agro-ecosystems and quality of in situ data. The cropland and crop
    type maps generated with in situ data show that all the crops could be mapped
    with the Sen2-Agri system. It is however important to mention that only the main
    crops were considered during this study. Minor and marginal crops would require
    special attention for their respective representativeness in the calibration as
    well as in the validation dataset. From the experiments carried out in this study,
    it could be recommended to collect, for the calibration dataset, between 75 and
    100 samples for each main crop and between 20 and 30 samples for each minor crop,
    for each stratum. Yet, these figures need to be interpreted cautiously, since
    it really depends on each site characteristic. To some extent, the crop type mapping
    accuracy is driven by the crop calendar. Crop types are classified twice along
    the season, at the middle and at the end. The legend is the same for both periods,
    including crops with very different calendars and growing cycles. Lower mapping
    accuracy values can therefore come from the fact that some crops are not easily
    discriminated at the specific periods corresponding to the middle and the end
    of the season. Over the French site for instance, it was the case for (i) the
    soybean which is planted in April–May and which is logically not well discriminated
    in the map from the end of May and (ii) the winter rapeseed which is harvested
    in July and thus better mapped in May than at the end of the season, defined as
    the 30th of November. Alfalfa in Morocco is harvested several times during the
    year and is therefore also challenging to discriminate accurately. A first solution
    to deal with the variety of crop calendars might come from the use of different
    legends between mid- and end-of-season products to reflect what is effectively
    visible on the ground. A mid-season crop type map could focus on the discrimination
    of summer vs winter crops, of irrigated vs rainfed crops and of crops which are
    fully developed at that stage while the end-of season map could provide the detailed
    “crop specific” legend. A second solution would be to increase the flexibility
    for the dates at which the crop type maps are generated, either by manually defining
    the dates or by increasing the number of the maps along the season. Like for the
    cropland mask, which is generated every month from the mid-season, it would thus
    be the responsibility of the user to select the best product to use depending
    on a specific application. More generally, the good accuracy estimates obtained
    for crop mapping can be related with the performance of the methods developed
    to specifically address large-scale agriculture monitoring applications, with
    the density and quality of the EO time series and with the quality of in situ
    data collected over each site (quality referring to their accuracy in geolocation
    and in crop type identification and their spatial sampling regarding agro-climatic
    conditions and crop types). While these accuracies are rather high by remote sensing
    standards for crop mapping, they could still be improved by tuning the calibration
    dataset. The accuracy figures were obtained using a validation in situ dataset
    spatially independent of the calibration dataset, as each reference polygon was
    included either in the calibration or validation set. While this is often considered
    as a product validation as soon as the data are independent, this should be only
    the case when the validation samples are distributed over the whole area covered
    by the product. The representativeness of the validation sampling has been carefully
    designed and completed for all nationwide demonstration where a very comprehensive
    in situ data collection campaign insured the national coverage. Over the local
    sites, the representativeness of the field sampling plan varied according to logistic
    and unexpected constraints like political unrest (e.g. Madagascar) and flooding
    events (e.g. Sudan). The validation datasets can be considered representative
    of the entire 300 × 300 km site only over France and Morocco. In the other sites,
    the accuracy figure should be interpreted in light of the actual spatial distribution
    of the validation dataset. Because of the automated nature of this validation
    process fully embedded into the Sen2-Agri system, specific attention to the representativeness
    of the reference data collection is required as it always delivers accuracy figures,
    regardless the spatial distribution of the reference data. Large-scale agriculture
    monitoring has to deal with significant agro-climatic gradients and crop calendars
    diversity and overlapping, making it very difficult to define the start and the
    end of a growing season. The research introduced the concept of rolling cropland
    masks based on the last 12 months, with a monthly update. The binary map delivered
    each month from the middle of the season proved to be capable of capturing cropping
    calendar shifts along an agro-climatic gradient, as shown with the accuracy evolution
    of the cropland masks along the season. Yet these masks were generated only during
    agricultural seasons shorter than one year (see Table 3) and it would be of interest
    to further investigate its performance all the year round. The stratification
    a priori applied to the area to classify is also a key aspect of the crop mapping
    strategy, allowing dealing with the S2 wide-swath coverage encompassing agro-ecological
    gradients while being locally relevant thanks to the user knowledge. The too coarse
    stratification of South Africa had a significant negative impact on the crop type
    classification because it forced to consider, all together, too many different
    management systems and agro-ecological conditions. This stratification was applied
    both for the cropland and crop type classification and ensured high spatial consistency
    between tiles belonging to a same agro-system. The unique properties of S2, particularly
    well-suited for agricultural applications, have also contributed to the promising
    results of this research. The temporal resolution is the first key asset of S2
    for agriculture, even if this study benefitted only from S2A and its 10-day (20-day
    in China) revisit cycle. The successful launch and operation of the S2B further
    improves the data availability, thus reducing the gap-filling role of the 30-m
    Landsat time series, much required for this demonstration. Along with the S2 Global
    Reference Image enabling a more accurate co-registration between S2 images, the
    enhanced availability of the S2 data will surely improve the quality of the results
    as well as their timeliness despite the higher volume of data to process. Such
    an evolution should improve the Sen2-Agri performances in cropping systems with
    very small fields and heterogeneous agriculture landscapes, where even the 10-m
    resolution time series faces some challenges to capture specific signal for each
    parcel. It is worth mentioning that the China and the Mali demonstration sites
    were successfully processed in spite of the majority of smallholder farmers with
    small fields thanks to the relative homogeneity of the agricultural landscape
    largely dominated by very few crops. The typical temporal co-occurrence between
    the crop growing period and rainy season with frequent cloud cover certainly calls
    for the use of the S2B time series to enhance the reliability of observations
    availability. Table 3 provided a first insight of the regions and periods within
    the year for which it is challenging to get enough cloud-free observations. In
    some regions, it is expected that only the all-weather observation capacity currently
    provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation could reach the required level of observation
    reliability to ensure timeliness, in particular for mid-season cropland mask and
    crop type maps. In spite of the very different nature of the active microwaves
    signal, SAR-derived features can indeed be jointly used with optical features
    for classification purpose (Hütt et al., 2016; Kussul et al., 2014; Navarro et
    al., 2016). The collection of high quality in situ data according to a statistically
    sound sampling design over a large-scale region and their quality control in a
    timely manner is a significant challenge. The accuracy of the LAI products has
    not been assessed locally for the different study sites because of the lack of
    resources. Yet, this would be relevant at least once to support appropriate products
    uses. This requires measuring in situ a set of fields of each main crop about
    4 to 6 times over the growing cycle to sample the full values range of the biophysical
    variables in actual farms fields. It is important to mention that the remotely
    sensed LAI estimate concerns all plants observed in a pixel including weeds, hedges
    and possibly trees as it is the case in Mali. Another key challenge about in situ
    data is related to the near-real time operation and the need for their timely
    provision. As already mentioned, the near-real time conditions were only tested
    in South Africa while the other case studies were retrospective exercises. Near-real
    time production requires two delivery of in situ data representative from the
    cropland and crop type classes at the middle and at the end of the season. A unique
    in situ data set is enough for the non-cropland class, assuming it does not change
    during the year. These constraints were fully met for the demonstration in South
    Africa and it allowed delivering the first cropland mask and the first crop type
    map respectively 5 days and 2 weeks after the mid-season date. In the other case
    studies, the same in situ dataset was used for the generation of all products
    during the season. It is worth mentioning that the Sen2-Agri system partly responded
    to the difficulty of getting reliable in situ data, with the development of an
    unsupervised algorithm for cropland mapping. Collection of in situ data might
    become a problem for varying reasons: data not available before the end of the
    season while early estimates are needed, sites just starting to develop monitoring
    capabilities using remote sensing data which will need a few seasons to learn
    and get reliable field data, and most importantly, sites over which field data
    is never available for security reasons, which are typically the ones concerned
    by food security issues. The method was successfully validated, with promising
    results even if the accuracy estimates are logically a bit lower than the ones
    obtained using in situ data. OA values were still higher than 80% and F1-Score
    for cropland and non-cropland classes higher than 0.75. As for the in situ data,
    the quality of the classification is driven by the quality of the reference map
    used to extract training samples. The by-default map is a global land cover map
    from 2010 at 300-m spatial resolution. The use of a more recent map and/or with
    a higher spatial resolution, better matching the 10-m S2 data will surely improve
    the quality of the results. A local map, will also help a lot, because of (i)
    a more meaningful legend better capturing the local landscape patterns and (ii)
    hopefully, a higher accuracy over the specific area to map. The processing related
    to these demonstrations over the three national and five local sites was implemented
    on a cloud computing infrastructure. The scalability of the Sen2-Agri system allowed
    handling unusual remote sensing data flows in a near real-time manner. This system
    delivered for the very first time nationwide 10 m resolution products for several
    countries within the year of observation thanks to a very high level of automation.
    It should be mentioned that the near real-time specification was only fully met
    for the Southern Hemisphere sites (South Africa and Madagascar) thanks to the
    lessons learnt from the Northern Hemisphere experiences in the previous months,
    which was the first with S2 coverage acquired and available during the crop season.
    In addition to the processing performances, the timeliness of the large-scale
    in situ data collection and the necessary quality control were also identified
    as significant bottlenecks for near real-time delivery. In South Africa, the Sen2-Agri
    products for the large WGR were delivered early May 2017 for the agriculture season
    ending late April. In a cloud-computing environment, the most demanding processing
    module requires only up to 5 days for a 500,000 km2 country because the surface
    reflectance time series are calibrated, cloud screened and atmospherically corrected
    along their availability. These full-scale achievements were made possible thanks
    to the development of the very first open source operational system providing
    large scale near real-time production capabilities using the full time series
    of S2 and L8. The full integration of the different workflows from download to
    validation was found instrumental for large-scale operational production but this
    comes at the cost of limited flexibility. Unlike toolbox providing a choice of
    algorithms for every processing step, the Sen2-Agri system is optimized for predefined
    sequences of operations and only few intermediary products are stored to reduce
    the required storage capacity. Two main operation modes are available in the system
    providing some flexibility: • an automated mode, in which S2 L1C and/or L8 L1T
    data are downloaded as they become available, and the processing chains are scheduled
    to execute accordingly; • a user-oriented mode, in which a human operator can
    trigger the execution of any of the processing chains via a friendly user interface
    with custom configuration parameters. The Sen2-Agri system along with Software
    User Manual and product description sheets are available for download since July
    2017 (WWW3). Next versions of the Sen2-Agri system is expected to use the new
    version of MACCS, renamed MAJA (for MACCS-ATCOR Joint Algorithm) (MAJA, 2017).
    6. Conclusion The proposed key principles for high-resolution crop specific monitoring
    at national scale allows addressing the new challenges associated to the processing
    of agricultural vegetation observation at 10 m, over large-scale regions from
    various orbits associated to different platforms and instruments. The automated
    processing design taking advantage of cloud computing infrastructure successfully
    met the near real-time requirements in spite of the volume of dense time series
    covering up to national territories. Thanks to the quality of the S2 and L8 observations,
    the four top priority products requested by many end-users have been successfully
    demonstrated for a set of cropping systems around the world. The automated orchestrator
    releases the burden of big EO data processing associated to the high spatial and
    temporal resolution of the current observing systems. The open source Sen2-Agri
    system was designed and implemented to enable agriculture monitoring in most countries.
    However, this system, based only on decametric optical observations, will face
    major constraints in the agricultural regions very frequently covered by clouds
    during the growing season, made of very small fields (less than 0.5 ha) or with
    mixed cropping in many fields. While the system runs automatically, products performances
    vary according to the temporal distribution of the S2 and L8 observations and
    to the spatial distribution of quality-controlled in situ data collected during
    the season. The high uptake of the Sen2-Agri system by different operational stakeholders
    confirms its relevance to support national monitoring like in Ukraine, to enhance
    official agriculture statistics as experienced in Mali, and for commercial agriculture
    outcome management like in South Africa. The potential or actual availability
    of these basic agriculture products requested for a long time by many stakeholders,
    calls now for the development of specific expertise to assess at high resolution
    the emergency in food insecure countries, to report agriculture production for
    the SDG-2, and to develop EO monitoring capacities at national to regional scale
    as promoted by the GEOGLAM initiative. Acknowledgements This research was supported

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,

    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    A review [45]; How blockchain technology along with other technologies such as
    AI, IoT, Big Data revolutionize the current agri-food industry As blockchain technology
    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction

    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value
    chain information security. Authors Involved technologies Architecture Advantages

    and data would be increased Hybrid approach (1) Part of the data are stored in

    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain

    time of the network. 2. More expensive for managing larger blocks. 1. Holistically
    consider this problem to find the optimal solution for integrating Bitcoin-NG
    consensus algorithm and appropriate size of each block. Lack of skills Not addressed
    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future studies in the
    area of blockchain technology and agri-food value chain management. Acknowledgment

    Science & Technology Abstract The promise of collecting and utilizing large amounts
    of data has never been greater in the history of urban water management (UWM).
    This paper reviews several data-driven approaches which play a key role in bringing
    forward a sea change. It critically investigates whether data-driven UWM offers
    a promising foundation for addressing current challenges and supporting fundamental
    changes in UWM. We discuss the examples of better rain-data management, urban
    pluvial flood-risk management and forecasting, drinking water and sewer network
    operation and management, integrated design and management, increasing water productivity,
    wastewater-based epidemiology and on-site water and wastewater treatment. The
    accumulated evidence from literature points toward a future UWM that offers significant
    potential benefits thanks to increased collection and utilization of data. The
    findings show that data-driven UWM allows us to develop and apply novel methods,
    to optimize the efficiency of the current network-based approach, and to extend
    functionality of today’s systems. However, generic challenges related to data-driven
    approaches (e.g., data processing, data availability, data quality, data costs)
    and the specific challenges of data-driven UWM need to be addressed, namely data
    access and ownership, current engineering practices and the difficulty of assessing
    the cost benefits of data-driven UWM. This publication is licensed under the terms

    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To One of the earliest powerful demonstrations of how increased
    data availability can help to transform urban water management (UWM) is the work
    of John Snow in 1854. (1) With the aid of precise spatial data about cholera victims
    in London, Snow provided evidence to support the hypothesis of a drinking-well
    being the source of the outbreak. His data-driven approach illustrates how important
    the availability and interpretation of data can be for public hygiene, which is
    one of the essential UWM services along with the provision of safe drinking water,
    protection against flooding and water pollution control. Since the middle of the
    19th century, major improvements in these services were made in many places in
    the world. However, today’s challenges in UWM have not been solved on a global
    scale. (2, 3) The various challenges (e.g., population change, aging infrastructure
    or economic change) facing national water and wastewater infrastructures (4) bring
    to light an urgent need for innovation and a change in the UWM framework to provide
    more sustainable UWM services. (5-8) Especially in the industrialized world, many
    challenges are endemic to the traditional and currently prevailing approach to
    UWM, which can be traced back to antiquity. (9) This approach is based on the
    fundament of centralized conveyance infrastructure that provides drinking water
    for and evacuates waste and stormwater from urban areas. In the majority of cases,
    this infrastructure is built to passively provide a defined transport capacity
    at a given peak load and has little flexibility to adapt to new demands. (10)
    The most widely discussed changes affecting UWM infrastructure, such as urban
    development or climate change, albeit generally slow processes, can still cause
    inadequate system performance within the long lifespan of UWM infrastructure.
    (11, 12) Further consequential downsides of centralized infrastructure are its
    strong dependence on large water quantities, its vulnerability to excessive rainfall,
    high investment costs, and vast and complex pipe networks. Increasing evidence
    questions whether and in what form the prevailing UWM practice can be the best
    solution for the world, as it has been since the beginning of the 20th century.
    (13-16) Today, both existing UWM services as well as the absence of such services
    are incurring increasing economic, social and environmental costs, even in countries
    that have successfully built up a functioning UWM infrastructure. (17) The aim
    of this review is 3-fold: First, to explore the potential of increased data availability
    to tackle today’s challenges, bringing about new and fundamental changes in the
    way UWM services can be provided by data-driven UWM (Figure 1). Second, to review
    key challenges of data-driven UWM. Third, to relate data availability and its
    utility in UWM on a schematic basis. Data-driven infrastructure transformation
    is not limited to UWM, but is happening also in other infrastructure sectors such
    as, for example, the energy sector. (18) Notwithstanding the potentially valuable
    insights that could be gained from a thorough comparison of UWM to other sectors,
    such an enterprise is beyond the scope of the current review. Figure 1 Figure
    1. Scope of UWM as illustrated by example variables of interest that will be affected
    by the current data and sensing revolution. Clearly, more and better data alone
    are not sufficient to solve today’s many UWM problems. However, the argument will
    be made that data are a necessary precondition for addressing some of the most
    pressing problems, be it by increasing efficiencies or by enabling novel and “smarter”
    approaches. (19-21) On the basis of the available literature, we will show that
    data-driven UWM, that is using different measurement techniques and collecting
    large volumes of data, carries the potential to expand the functionality of the
    UWM system beyond its traditional conveyance purpose. 2 The Current Revolution
    in Data and Sensing ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Whereas in the times of Snow, data
    collection was rudimentary and tedious, in today’s information age it is possible
    to generate and manage enormous amounts of data relatively cheaply and easily.
    This change has been mainly driven by UWM-independent advances in analytics, sensing,
    transmission, computing and data management. This section only touches on recent
    advances and does not provide a comprehensive overview of the literature: Analytics
    and Sensing Data can originate from various sources and rely heavily on measuring
    devices. Advances in measurement techniques have made huge leaps in the past few
    years. Three different trends in the production of data can be observed: First,
    novel sensors and measurement devices have been developed; second, measurements
    devices are available at increasingly lower cost; and third, thanks to miniaturization,
    sensors can be mounted on mobile platforms. (19, 22, 23) Examples in the field
    of UWM are autonomous drones used for surface characterization, (24) sensor mounted
    on mobile platforms floating downstream networks, (25) fast counting and identification
    of bacteria by flow cytometry (26) and lab-on-a-chip biosensors. (27) However,
    sensing capabilities have been enhanced not only by direct sensing technology,
    but also by soft sensing via software-based data processing. (28) Furthermore,
    today’s spatially enabled societies and “smart cities” (29) are increasingly equipped
    to actively or passively collect data on a voluntary or nonvoluntary basis, and
    constitute thereby a fundamentally new type of resource. (30) Examples of these
    new and upcoming data sources are crowdsourcing, (31) using microwave links from
    telecommunication networks to identify rain intensities, (32) harvesting social
    media (33) or surveillance data to identify urban flood events. (34) Transmission
    Independently of UWM, major investments are being made in various data transmission
    technologies and networks. (35, 36) They range from mobile communications, smart
    metering networks to the “internet of things” and specific sensor networks. (37,
    38) This phenomenon is highly relevant, as the possibility of piggybacking on
    these existing transmission infrastructures substantially lowers data costs. Computing
    and Data Management Ubiquitous computing, automation and efficient data management
    have advanced by several orders of magnitude in the past decade. Computational
    power and data storage are becoming cheaper and data processing techniques are
    becoming much more powerful. Various aspects of our daily lives have been deeply
    influenced by this ongoing revolution in data and sensing. In the following, we
    show that adopting a more data-driven approach offers the potential to enable
    radically different practices in UWM and serves as a precondition for a shift
    toward novel and possibly more sustainable UWM services. 3 Approaches to Data-Driven
    UWM ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To A number of data-driven approaches appear promising
    for initiating fundamental changes in UWM. In the following sections, we discuss
    these approaches with the help of key examples that illustrate the relevant challenges
    and opportunities in UWM. Although additional examples could potentially be identified,
    we argue that the selection represents decisive trends and shows the potential
    of data-driven UWM in an exemplary way. 3.1 Spatial and Temporal Variability of
    Rainfall Rainfall is one of the main agents that influence UWM. (39) It determines
    the number and duration of sewer overflows, (40) the hydraulic load of the drainage
    system and to a certain extent also the performance of wastewater treatment plants
    (WWTP). (41) Thus, challenges such as flooding of urban areas, suboptimal WWTP
    operation and pollution of water bodies through sewer overflows are directly linked
    to rainfall data. Rainfall is highly variable in nature and varies significantly
    over time and space. (42) One of the main hurdles to achieving smarter management
    of sewer systems is thus our limited ability to accurately measure and predict
    rainfall at relevant spatial (generally subkilometre) and temporal (around minute-resolution
    or less) scales. (19) There has been a surge in improving conventional rainfall
    measurement techniques and introducing novel sensing methods to account for the
    spatial variance of rainfall. (43) The design of point measurement instruments
    like rain gauges has been improved, for example, electronic floating-device rain
    gauges that capture rainfall intensities better, (44) or the rain gauges have
    been supplemented with more sophisticated instruments such as disdrometers providing
    the drop size distribution of rainfall. (45) Land and satellite-based radar has
    been increasingly used to provide a more spatially explicit picture of rainfall.
    (46) Weather radars designed specifically for urban application have a shorter
    range and provide a finer resolution of rainfall measurements. Additional information
    on rainfall can be acquired by measuring the signal attenuation in telecommunications
    microwave links; the data of such commercial links have been used from several
    urban catchments, for example, in Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Switzerland,
    to obtain path-averaged rainfall intensities. (32, 47, 48) Furthermore, new attempts
    have also been made to increase the density of point measurements by crowdsourcing.
    (49-51) While new measurement techniques, such as radar systems and microwave
    links, are addressing the demand for finer spatiotemporal resolution of rainfall
    data, the measurement accuracy of these devices is still somewhat insufficient
    and needs improvement so that their full potential for UWM can be harnessed. (52,
    53) The big challenge, however, is integrating all these different sources of
    rainfall data into a coherent and usable data collection. Measurement and interpolation
    uncertainties need to be adequately considered, (54, 55) and large amounts of
    data need to be processed. Significant work is being done to merge rain-gauge
    and radar data to produce more reliable rainfall fields. (56-58) Although rainfall
    measurements are of major importance to smarter management of urban drainage systems,
    the ability to efficiently control urban drainage systems needs to be addressed
    likewise (see Section 3.3). Additionally, the flexibility to control the drainage
    system is strongly constrained by the capacity of the existing infrastructure.
    3.2 Urban Flood Risk Management Urban pluvial floods potentially have a high social
    and economic impact, but they are by their nature one of the least predictable
    challenges facing UWM. (59) Consequently, flood-risk management can also be described
    as ‘a process of decision making under uncertainty’. (60) Additionally, urban
    flooding is expected to grow in importance in line with climate change and urbanisation.
    (61) Besides infrastructure planning and flood risk assessment, early warning
    systems are also becoming more and more relevant for flood-risk management. Hydrological
    and hydraulic modeling is the basis for urban pluvial flood-risk management, and
    relies on different forms of input data: (i) layout data allows the topography
    of the model to be established, (ii) rainfall and flood data represent observed
    or anticipated rainfall events and the system’s reaction to the rainfall, respectively.
    (i) Layout data consists of information about the drainage infrastructure and
    the terrain (e.g., elevation, surface characteristics). Whereas information about
    the drainage infrastructure is often considered as given but may not be available
    with the desired accuracy and completeness, (62) terrain data are more widely
    available. The impact of elevation data resolution is however essential: For example,
    a certain resolution (∼2–5 m raster cell size in general) and accuracy is required
    for the realistic representation of surface flow between buildings or along the
    side of roads. (24, 63) Today, elevation data can be easily collected at very
    high resolutions due to advances in remote sensing, and their application to urban
    flood modeling has been shown to potentially improve flow path delineation. (64)
    However, their use is still not widespread for two reasons. First, the computation
    time for larger catchments is inhibitive. Second, urban environments contain a
    large variety of mobile and temporary elements, such as vehicles or construction
    sites, which are visible in very high-resolution remote sensing data but are not
    modeled adequately. (65) Relevant surface characteristics such as perviousness
    and roughness are typically estimated by classifying aerial images into land use
    types and using lookup tables to assign surface characteristic values to each
    land use class. Recent land use classification methods perform very well even
    with minimal human supervision, but the incremental gains at the level of the
    modeling results are not significant, in part because of the integrative nature
    of the rainfall-runoff models. (66) While the spatial distribution of surface
    characteristics may be sufficiently resolved, we see development potential for
    methods that allow more direct inference of surface characteristics, in lieu of
    land use lookup tables. (67) (ii) High-resolution rainfall and flood data are
    particularly important for urban flood modeling. Flood data are particularly difficult
    and costly to obtain, which in combination with the rarity of flood events, explains
    their scarcity. (68, 69) This has motivated the exploration of new measurement
    techniques such as robust and cheap binary sensors. (70, 71) Moreover, researchers
    are now looking into social media as a platform for obtaining such data, for example
    by using Twitter to collect flood information for a decision support tool to decision-makers
    in Jakarta, (31) or by using YouTube videos and crowdsourcing to estimate flash-flood
    volumes to better understand flood risks. (72, 73) While the above-mentioned data
    collection modes are still in a phase of development and do not solve the issue
    of flood event rarity, we find in the examples that they can provide valuable
    information about flood events that are challenging to measure with conventional
    sensors. Detailed and accurate flood models will potentially provide improved
    flood hazard maps. By using historic rainfall and flood data, the uncertainty
    of model prognosis can be reduced through calibration. A Bayesian framework also
    allows this reduction to be expressed formally. (74) Many studies have also shown
    clear increase in the performance of hydrological models with the increase in
    the layout detail (75) and the quality of input data. (76) Also, it has been demonstrated
    that for proper parameter estimation of models, longer time series of flood data,
    which captures more flood events, is desirable. (77) A very attractive application
    of flood models is that of early flood-warning systems. The usefulness of a hydrological
    model for an early flood-warning system depends on how far ahead in time (lead
    time) a reasonably accurate prediction can be made. However, the prediction uncertainty
    of models increases with increasing lead times. (78) Improved flood modeling will
    lead to higher lead times without a significant drop in the prediction accuracy.
    It is important to stress that the increased availability of the above-mentioned
    data can only improve the well-being of society (e.g., safer cities, fairer insurance
    policies or better flood evacuation measures) if the required technologies and
    engineering methods are adopted by practitioners and society (cf. Section 4.1).
    3.3 Drinking Water and Sewer Network Operation and Management Massive resources
    were invested to construct today’s UWM network infrastructures. However, investments
    are increasingly falling short, (79) making it essential to increase the efficiency
    of existing systems. Only limited knowledge is currently available about the performance
    of water supply and sewer networks at any given moment in time and across the
    whole network. There is a strong and growing literature that supports the notion
    of using performance indicators, including customer satisfaction data, to guide
    and improve infrastructure management. (80, 81) In this review, we are assuming
    that this is the current state of the art and will explore more advanced possibilities
    of data collection and the potential of novel data for UWM. In the following,
    we outline novel approaches aiming to improve network management and operation,
    namely (i) real-time control (RTC) modified with model predictive control (MPC),
    (ii) smart (water) metering, (iii) structural (pipe) health monitoring, and (iv)
    quality control through detecting source contamination. (i) RTC and MPC allow
    us to go beyond considering sewers as passive transportation infrastructure since
    they can be used to increase the efficiency of existing infrastructure, thereby
    postponing or eliminating the need for investments in completely new infrastructure.
    RTC (82, 83) makes stormwater systems “smart” (23) and significantly improves
    utilization of the existing drainage infrastructure. (84) The release of untreated
    sewerage into receiving water bodies during rain events can be reduced by dynamically
    controlling the flow and retention volumes in sewers with sensor networks and
    automated valves, for example. (85) The high temporal and spatial variability
    of pollution flow would require RTC to distinguish between highly polluted and
    less polluted flows. Pilot studies show promising results using conductivity and
    turbidity sensors as real-time surrogates for pollution potential. (86) Such information
    coupled with RTC, in the near future, would allow stormwater discharge to be managed
    on the basis of the impact potential on the receiving water body. MPC is an advanced
    RTC technique, in which the optimization is based not only on the knowledge of
    the current state of the system but also on its forecast state. Thus, MPC allows
    us to improve the monitoring process and to optimally utilize the storage capacities
    of rainwater reservoirs, detention ponds and in-sewer storage volumes by considering
    anticipated rainfall (thus, e.g., reducing sewer overflows). Advanced control
    logic is being used in field studies to regulate storage capacities with information
    from water level sensors and real-time weather forecasts to create dynamically
    controlled rainwater reservoirs. (87-89) Model results suggest that up to 92%
    of releases to the combined sewer could theoretically be reduced with dynamically
    controlled cisterns. (87) The computational resources required for RTC and MPC
    have significantly improved in the past decade (90, 91) and studies confirm the
    robustness of MPC algorithms for complex (nonlinear) systems. (92, 93) (ii) Smart
    (drinking water) metering (94-96) opens up promising new approaches to network
    management which rely on the availability of detailed water-related activity data
    from the customers. Smart metering allows frequent and high-resolution use patterns
    to be recorded at different positions in the network. (97) Case studies suggest
    potential residential water use reductions of at least 10% and monthly peak demand
    reductions of 10%. (96) Reduced water demand and peak water demand alleviation
    also means that downsized water supply infrastructure could be built, which translates
    into potential capital cost savings which were recently estimated to be between
    11% and 51%. (98) Excessive water usages, breakages, abuse or water theft, (99)
    can then be detected anywhere in the network. Additionally, water end-use models
    can be created and the quantification of wastewater production improved. Another
    attractive feature of smart metering is its promise to switch from pure supply
    to demand management. This would allow the available infrastructure to be utilized
    more efficiently by influencing customer demand based on capacity. Examples include
    differentiated tariff structures designed to reduce peak hour and day demand by
    ‘peak‘ or “drought pricing”. (100-102) The alignment of prices along free market
    lines in real-time has been predicted to be especially effective for outdoor water
    use given its greater price elasticity. (103, 104) However, less research has
    focused on domestic indoor water use, where price elasticity is low. (105) One
    option might be to provide customers with direct feedback, for example, through
    on-site displays or by wireless communication via mobile phones or email. (106-108)
    However, it is unclear how effective such measures are in the long run, that is,
    there is little evidence how smart metering will affect long-term consumption
    behavior. Furthermore, most applications of smart metering to date have been proposed
    in the context of industrialized countries and less applications can be found
    for low-income markets where a critical set of enabling factors need first to
    be addressed. (21) Nevertheless, smart metering is not restricted to network-based
    water delivery and has already been applied in a pilot field study in the context
    of developing countries, for example, by equipping hand pumps with sensors to
    monitor water levels and charge customers adequately. (109) (iii) Structural (pipe)
    health monitoring addresses UWM challenges such as groundwater contamination,
    local flooding, sinkholes and high water consumption. Pressure or vibration sensors
    and microphones are available to allow network management to be improved by remotely
    collecting data and thus monitoring the structural health of sewer and drinking
    water pipes. (110, 111) The miniaturization of sensors and the possibility of
    mounting them on mobile platforms are driving new network exploration methods
    (e.g., inline mobile sensor technology). (112) Furthermore, we are witnessing
    the apparition of alternative monitoring approaches that rely on crowdsourcing
    to gather information about the network (e.g., water leaks or water levels) via
    smartphones. (113) Increased knowledge about the condition of sewer and water-supply
    networks contributes to reduced water loss and prevents local flooding or sinkholes,
    for example, by automatic leak detection, (114-116) and enables improved rehabilitation
    planning and modeling thanks to reduced uncertainty about pipe conditions. (117)
    (iv) Quality control through source contamination detection is essential in view
    of threats to human and environmental health due to discharges of untreated wastewater
    into receiving waters and wastewater intrusion into storm drainage and drinking
    water resources through leakages, wrong connections or intentional contamination
    (compare Section 3.5 in case of water reuse). (118, 119) However, it remains a
    challenge to monitor water quality and especially to identify the precise source
    of the pollution, as wastewater and water supply networks are highly distributed,
    have many entry points and have to deal with a wide variety of potentially harmful
    contaminants. Reliable water quality control and rapid detection of contamination
    sources is particularly vital in water supply networks. It could be achieved by
    real-time monitoring of selected contamination indicators and optimal sensor placement–two
    highly topical research topics. (120, 121) Approaches relying on simple indicators,
    such as a distributed temperature sensor cables, have been successfully used to
    identify incorrect wastewater connections to stormwater sewers. (118, 122) Panasiuk
    et al. conclude in a comprehensive review of human waste monitoring methods that
    the most promising approaches are based on chemical indicators and biological
    markers (cf. Table 1 in Section 3.6 for potential wastewater indicators). (118)
    Nevertheless, further research is needed on innovative sampling methods, such
    as online-monitoring or passive sampling. (118) Additionally, the monitoring of
    biological markers via, for example, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (123)
    requires further development before being field ready. (124) Contamination warning
    systems in water supply systems that combine real-time monitoring data with crowdsourcing
    using customer feedback on water quality via smartphones have been tested but
    require extended pilot field studies before implementation. (125) Further, remote
    mobile sensors moving along the pipe with the flow could increase the likelihood
    of detecting contamination and fully functional prototypes should be available
    in the near future. (25) The data-driven approaches above outlined allow the management
    and operation of network-based infrastructures to be improved by saving water
    and protecting environmental and human health. Generally, the main aim is to minimally
    delay premature rehabilitation (e.g., by identification of pipe health) or even
    replace the creation of infrastructures (e.g., by switching from supply to demand
    management). To date, the literature does not provide us with clear proof that
    such a strategic shift from hardware to data actually leads to the desired savings,
    flexibility or long-term increase in performance. However, the cited literature
    does show many promising examples that these hopes might be justified. 3.4 Water
    Productivity Urbanisation in combination with climate change is expected to influence
    the spatial pattern of water availability and demand in complex ways. (3) One
    related challenge is enhancing efficiency and optimizing water allocation and
    usage in order to address water scarcity, especially in growing cities and regions
    affected by drought. The successful construction of water sensitive cities relies
    on increased data availability via measurement devices. (126) In order to use
    less water, water productivity needs to be improved, that is, the value of goods
    and services produced per unit of water used. (127) Water can be saved in many
    different manners: by conservation, efficiency, sufficiency, substitution, reuse,
    recycling, or harvesting. (128) Not all of these water saving strategies can be
    influenced by data-driven approaches to the same degree: For example, the practice
    and acceptability of water conservation is generally culturally dependent. (128)
    In the following, we therefore only outline strategies for which the availability
    and leveraging of data plays a significant role: (i) increasing water use efficiency,
    (ii) reusing and reclaiming water, and (iii) rainwater harvesting. (i) Increasing
    efficiency: The simplest way to increase water productivity is to use less water
    for the same service or to incentivise and inform on water-saving behavior, for
    example, by means of smart metering (cf. Section 3.3). Another data-driven way
    to reduce water consumption is “smart irrigation”, where irrigation systems are
    operated on the basis of humidity sensors, soil moisture sensors and real-time
    weather forecast data to allow precise watering depending on actual watering needs.
    (35, 129) Whereas smart irrigation is driven mainly by the agricultural sciences,
    these technologies and approaches are equally suitable for residential areas and
    are already available on the market. (ii) Water productivity may be further increased
    by reusing or reclaiming water. (130, 131) Currently, only 1.7% of the urban water
    use is reused. (17) The (direct or indirect) potable or nonpotable reuse of water
    from various sources requires robust and comprehensive monitoring and control
    systems for risk management to ensure human and environmental health. (132-134)
    Successful large-scale implementation beyond niche applications of nonpotable
    water in drought-affected regions such as California is data-driven and will rely
    among many other factors (135) on detailed real-time water quality assessments
    measuring pathogens and chemical constituents. Whereas software for the timely
    detection of treatment failures has recently been successfully developed such
    as the CANARY event detection software, (136) direct potable water reuse still
    lacks reliable monitoring techniques. (137) (iii) Finally, water productivity
    is not increased only by saving water but also by harvesting rainfall. When harvested
    rainwater is put to a different use (e.g., for toilet flushing, cloth washing,
    irrigation or drinking after adequate treatment), data are drawn from various
    sources (e.g., tank-level sensors or rain forecasts). (138) Another further way
    in which the revolution in data and sensing has innovated rainwater harvesting
    is by providing better information about estimates of harvesting sites and harvesting
    potential. (139, 140) Quigley and Braun (87) showed in several demonstration projects
    that using rain forecasts to control the filling level of retention structures
    can optimize rainwater utilization and harvesting without compromising the retention
    capabilities of the investigated “green infrastructure” elements. Overall, the
    data and sensing developments enabling these different approaches promise to improve
    water productivity and could potentially lead to the acceleration of the trends
    for increasing water productivity. 3.5 Infrastructure Design and Management Socio-economic
    changes frequently outrun the lifespan of existing water infrastructures. (10,
    12) Thus, estimates indicate that the global urban areas will grow by 60–200%
    between 2000 and 2030. (141) Good design concepts that maintain flexibility and
    can achieve overall goals over the long-term are and will continue to be important.
    It is not surprising that several such concepts can be found in literature and
    in practice. Examples are low impact urban design and development (LIUDD), sustainable
    urban drainage systems (SUDS), water sensitive urban design (WSUD), and integrated
    urban water management (IUWM), all of which emphasize the importance of a more
    integrated or holistic approach to UWM. (142) These approaches demand significant
    integrated modeling. This quantifies the interaction between subsystems (i.e.,
    freshwater production, stormwater runoff, wastewater treatment) within the wider
    urban system (e.g., water, energy, solid waste, agriculture) and assesses their
    performance under changing conditions. (62, 143, 144) However, integrated modeling
    requires highly consistent data, of the kind commonly processed by geographic
    information systems. (145, 146) It needs spatially explicit input data of very
    diverse type and from many different sources (e.g., local climate, soil characteristics,
    elevation data, groundwater depth, land use, geology, water needs, system performance,
    water quality, sewer system characteristics, etc.). (140, 147, 148) The increased
    availability of manifold data will therefore allow the reliability of integrated
    models to be improved. (149) Highly integrated models play an important role as
    input for decision support systems (see also Figure 2). More comprehensive ones
    such as structured decision-making or multicriteria decision analysis in particular
    make very high demands on the volume of the data and modeling results. (150, 151)
    Another interesting approach in this field is the use of artificial intelligence
    for decision support: the integration of numerical or statistical models achieves
    higher accuracy and reliability, but imposes a corresponding toll on the amount
    and quality of the underlying data. (152)Figure 2 indicates the different layers
    of data demand for modeling and decision-making. An illustration is provided by
    “green infrastructure designs” (e.g., green roofs, constructed wetlands, mixed-use
    stormwater collection and infiltration sites) which have a broad range of effects,
    such as altering the quality or the amount of stormwater runoff, effects on groundwater,
    air quality and ambient temperatures (cf. heat island effect). (153, 154) An Australian
    example of spatially explicit modeling suggest that 10% of park area allocation
    may result in 62% of nitrogen reduction from stormwater, (146) and experimental
    studies show positive effects of vegetated roofs on stormwater retention by reducing
    rainwater volume (52–95%). (153) However, the influence of green roofs on urban
    microclimate remains negligible unless they are combined with vegetation areas
    at street level: integrated models revealed a temperature cooling of up to 2 °C.
    (154) Figure 2 Figure 2. Integrated models in UWM and their data need (in adaptation
    to Bach et al.). (62) Integrated design concepts and modeling encounter many obstacles.
    Various obstacles (e.g., conflicting objectives, reluctance in investigative data
    collection or confidentiality of existing data) to integrated planning have already
    been described and most of them are still highly relevant today. (155) Nevertheless,
    the adoption of integrated modeling seems to be progressing as the growing number
    of modeling tools indicates. (62) Data availability for the calibration of such
    models is certainly not the only bottleneck, but it is an important precondition
    for their useful application. 3.6 Wastewater-Based Epidemiology Wastewater is
    a reflection of the society producing it. It contains a mixture of human excreta
    and substances used in households for daily living. Novel technological opportunities
    such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (123) lab-on-a-chip biosensors,
    (27, 156) in situ chemical analysers (157) or fluorescence spectroscopy (158)
    will allow us to harvest information from this complex sewage matrix (almost)
    in real-time. With these new data sources, the opportunity arises to use wastewater
    to gain insight into i.) the prevention of epidemics, ii.) the assessment of human
    health and lifestyle and iii.) the monitoring of drugs via indicator substances
    (Table 1). (i) Pathogen monitoring would allow early warning systems for infectious
    diseases to be implemented. Successful attempts have been made to identify and
    quantify viruses, protozoa and bacteria in wastewater. However, a review article
    about the applicability in practice also concluded that “the molecular techniques
    available today and those under development would require further refinement in
    order to be standardized and applicable”. (123) The potential benefits could be
    substantial, as many pathogens are excreted before symptoms of infections appear
    and can be detected if only a small percentage of a population is infected. (159)
    Monitoring studies show the potential of detecting infectious viruses, for example
    at the inflow of WWTPs. (160-162) Improvements in measurement technology, such
    as high-throughput mass sequencing or biosensors for rapid and on-site monitoring
    of disease biomarkers, can facilitate the detection process. (163) Biosensors
    hold the promise to develop into a cheap and easy-to-handle option for developing
    countries, where few suitable laboratories are available and hygiene is a major
    concern. (164, 165) However, successful development and implementation require
    the consideration of various barriers present in real-world settings, and must
    be field tested (cf. Section 4.1). (166) (ii) Next to the prevention of epidemics,
    the status and change of human health and lifestyle characteristics can be assessed.
    First research attempts are the monitoring oxidative stress indicators (167, 168)
    or the measurement of microbial gut communities in sewage to predict the obesity
    levels of cities. (169) If sewer systems exist, such human health and lifestyle
    indicators (cf. Table 1) can be identified on different spatial scales, for example,
    on a city or single household level. New sensor technologies might one day enable
    real-time monitoring of vital health parameters in smart toilets, for example,
    as described in a patent entitled “Toilet device with system for inspecting health
    conditions”. (170) This would enable users to assess their personal state of health
    and share information via online networks or report it to physicians. In addition,
    valuable information about human lifestyle is gained by monitoring household-specific
    discharge patterns (see Section 3.3). (iii) By analyzing wastewater for drugs
    (illicit or legal), the variety of knowingly and unknowingly consumed drugs may
    be assessed. Novel approaches enable tobacco and alcohol usage in sewage (171,
    172) to be monitored or drug consumption across European cities to be compared
    via lab-based analysis of 24 h composite samples. (173, 174) Such information
    can be used to develop prevention campaigns or to assess their success for entire
    populations without depending on strongly biased and time lagged surveys. (175)
    While many real-time sensors for monitoring water quality are still at the research
    and development phase, the assessment of drug consumption does not necessarily
    need this data in high temporal resolution. Table 1. Non-Exhaustive Selection

    caffeine) aThe distinction between legal and illicit is arbitrary and only matters
    in that there may be alternative ways to quantify the consumption of most legal
    substances, e.g., sales data. Sewage is full of valuable information and represents
    a dynamic picture of human societies in time and space. Monitoring wastewater
    data in conjunction with spatial and demographic data are particularly promising.
    Wastewater-based epidemiology has so far been applied mostly in the field of illicit
    drug consumption, but it has the potential to assess the improvement of overall
    human health. (176) For wider applications, there are still open questions to
    be solved, such as obtaining information about the behavior and stability of substances
    and pathogens of interest in the sewers (177) or the accurate estimation of the
    number of people at a given time in the sample catchment for normative purposes.
    (178) Even more importantly, while the use of chemical monitoring is in a field-applicable
    phase, further research and development on microbial markers is needed. (118,
    123, 124) In a review on new microbial markers assays, the authors considered
    the field of microbial markers as still rapidly evolving. (124) 3.7 On-Site Drinking
    and Wastewater Treatment Most of the examples for data-driven UWM so far address
    challenges in highly urbanised environments with extensive and complex network
    infrastructures. Impressive as the outlined application examples are, due to limitations
    of the traditional networked approach, UWM service provision is and will not be
    network-based everywhere. On-site treatment - also called distributed or decentralised
    treatment - is so far used for niche applications, in areas with low population
    densities or fast demographic change, or as a stop-gap solution in densely populated
    unserved settlements. (182) However, on-site treatment has been suggested as a
    complement or fundamentally different alternative to conventional centralized
    network-based systems. (13, 147, 148, 183, 184) We argue that data-driven UWM
    allows on-site treatment to go beyond niche applications and constitute a widespread
    customized and flexible engineering solution. We do not contrast on-site and centralized
    solutions here (cf. Section 4), but review the potential for improving on-site
    technologies by the revolution in data and sensing. Three main on-site applications
    can be found in the literature: (i) On-site or point-of use treatment of water
    is the most effective way to provide safe drinking water in areas with insufficient
    water quality. (185, 186) This approach does not require extensive infrastructure
    investments and only a fraction of the total water consumption needs to be treated.
    (187, 188) The main challenge from a sensing and data point of view is to reliably
    identify the treatment performance (mainly hygiene, but also contaminants such
    as arsenic) and to detect the point for rehabilitation or replacement of critical
    decentralised infrastructure elements. (ii) On-site water treatment for reuse
    is an attractive option to increase water productivity (cf. Section 3.5). (187)
    The US-NRC identified several research areas that hold significant potential to
    advance the reuse of municipal wastewater. (188) They include the identification
    of “better indicators and surrogates that can be used to monitor process performance
    in reuse scenarios and develop online real-time or near real-time analytical monitoring
    techniques for their measurement”. (188) (iii) On-site wastewater treatment. Even
    though on-site WWTPs are already widely applied in OECD countries, (189, 190)
    they are often seen as a stop-gap. On-site systems are perceived to have low technical
    reliability (191) and their overall treatment performance is often unconvincing
    or unknown. (192) Kaminsky and Javernick-Will however concluded, that “system
    software is more likely to be the root cause of system failure than the hardware
    itself”, (193) implying that on-site systems are not limited by the available
    technology but by institutional and organisational factors. Barriers toward widespread
    successful implementation of on-site systems are multifaceted and a technological
    transfer demanding (see Section 4.1). However, there are two important barriers
    for which data-driven approaches are especially promising, namely the lack of
    information about the treatment performance and the cost of operation and maintenance.
    The latest developments in sensor technology, data acquisition and computation
    are already applied to some centralized approaches, (194) but they could also
    pave the way with respect to performance and costs for on-site systems. In the
    following, these two issues are specifically discussed for on-site wastewater
    treatment. However, they also apply in a similar way to on-site water treatment.
    Treatment Performance Most on-site treatment plants are scarcely monitored today,
    for example, in Germany small-scale WWTP are monitored twice or three times annually.
    (195) The treatment performance of on-site WWTPs could be improved significantly
    by more frequent monitoring, which serves as a basis for detecting malfunctioning
    systems. (192, 196) Enhanced monitoring would additionally improve the understanding
    and optimization of on-site treatment systems. (197) Furthermore, improved monitoring
    techniques may enable the application of more complex and demanding treatment
    technologies such as autotrophic ammonium oxidation. Continuous monitoring approaches
    to centralized WWTPs exist, but are not yet sufficiently low-maintenance for direct
    implementation on on-site WWTPs. First promising tests for on-site systems have
    been made with SAC254 (the spectral absorption coefficient at wavelength 254)
    and dissolved oxygen measurements, while turbidity showed no correlation with
    biological oxygen demand. (198) Soft sensing may be another promising way to generate
    useful information out of easy-to-collect data. (199, 200) Maintenance Costs High
    maintenance costs are a common problem in massively modular infrastructure, (201)
    because of the costs of regular inspections, cleaning, sludge collection or repair.
    (202) Their operation will consequently benefit substantially from developments
    in sensoring and automation. (203) For centralized infrastructures, lower costs
    can typically be achieved with scheduled, planned and pro-active maintenance.
    (204, 205) This generally also holds true for on-site systems: For example, tank-filling
    sensors could lower the cost of managing sludge and scum collection management
    by enabling the implementation of scheduled management schemes. (206) Greater
    knowledge about maintenance requirements would allow operation and maintenance
    to be targeted and would optimize the allocation of personnel and resources, that
    is, a shift toward pro-active and planned maintenance. Lower maintenance would
    then lead to lower overall decentralised treatment costs. The revolution in data
    and sensing is thus breaking new ground for the application of on-site technologies
    in regions where a rethinking of the most suitable UWM system is needed due to
    infrastructure costs and resource efficiency. (207) Performance monitoring is
    not only imperative to ameliorate the poor reputation of on-site systems, but
    also to provide a defined level of performance and to reduce overall costs by
    enabling a more targeted and efficient maintenance and repair regime. 4 Discussion
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To So far, the focus of this review has been on approaches
    and examples showing where more data have the potential to substantially improve
    the efficiency of current UWM practice. This would enable a switch from pure infrastructure
    generation to the active operation and management of UWM systems and leading to
    enhancing the utility of existing infrastructures (e.g., RTC of sewer overflows)
    or the active management of risk and threats (e.g., urban pluvial flood warnings
    or water supply contamination). This is especially relevant in a changing world
    where demand generally changes faster than the lifespan of critical infrastructure
    elements. (12, 208) However, the most promising prospect is that a data-driven
    UWM could offer fundamentally novel ways of water related services. The ability
    to provide high levels of water productivity and sanitation with fewer investments
    in network-based infrastructures could be a key tool in a strongly urbanising
    world. This is particularly true for areas which are becoming depopulated and
    areas with low population densities. (209) However, careful multicriteria evaluations
    need to accompany the implementation of appropriate on-site systems, and the optimal
    treatment scale needs to be determined with respect to costs, energy consumption,
    greenhouse gases, drinking water reuse or resources recovery. (147, 210-213) Another
    exciting prospect is that wastewater-based epidemiology can bring added value
    to operating and monitoring sewer systems and permit intimate insights into societal
    health and wellbeing. However, the availability of more data also raises concerns
    that need to be addressed. The aim of Section 4.1 is to summarize the most pressing
    concerns of data-driven UWM rather than giving a complete picture of all conceivable
    hurdles. In Section 4.2, the role of data and its utility for UWM is discussed
    in more generic terms. 4.1 Challenges of Data-Driven UWM Challenges relating to
    generic data and technology, that is, successfully taking advantage of data-driven
    UWM, include turning data into information in a timely manner (data processing),
    making useful information available to users and utilities (data availability),
    addressing the issues of data-quality and uncertainty of different data sources
    (data quality), achieving low operation and maintenance costs for sensors and
    measurements (data costs) and the lack of general standards and protocols or data
    management. (37, 96, 97, 214) The increased demand on data processing and modeling,
    for example, for detailed forecast generation or detailed flood risk assessments
    is more specific (but also not necessarily exclusive) for UWM. It requires advanced
    computational power. (90, 91) Advances in technology and methods are catching
    up with these needs - improved hardware and new mathematical techniques including
    the introduction of emulators to bypass inhibitive computational times. (215,
    216) These challenges are more or less common to all types of “smart” initiatives,
    such as smart electricity grids. (217) In addition to these generic issues, we
    suggest that three challenges need special consideration, namely (i) data access
    and ownership, (ii) changes in engineering and management practice, and (iii)
    the trade-off between benefits and costs. Although these three issues may also
    apply to other thematic fields, they manifest themselves in specific ways in UWM:
    (i) Privacy is a key societal issue surrounding data-driven UWM, namely the ownerships
    of the data and who has (open) data access. The end of privacy has been declared,
    (218) but in view of the examples outlined above, there is a need to reflect on
    Orwellian critiques in UWM. Of course, not all data are sensitive, such as for
    example, rainfall data. However, the availability of more personalized data increases
    its potential for abuse: thus detailed water consumption patterns could help burglars
    to identify currently noninhabited homes, (219) or wastewater-based epidemiology
    would allow geospatially explicit health information to be revealed that might
    be exploited by insurance companies. Furthermore, a dependence on “smart” or “intelligent”
    systems increases the potential vulnerability to cyber-crime. (220, 221) Safe
    UWM systems therefore need to function reliably and be cyber-secure, for example,
    to prevent the unauthorized manipulation of critical infrastructure elements.
    Introducing common standards is one way of dealing with the widespread scepticism,
    although this needs to be addressed by a legitimation portfolio approach. (135)
    Ethical guidelines and legal regulations must also be developed, such as suggested
    for (illicit) drug monitoring. (222) Whereas this is of lower importance for aggregated
    data collection (e.g., in the main sewer), data collection at household level
    is especially sensitive. (ii) Data-driven UWM requires a change in practices ranging
    from network operation to decision-making. (5) Professionals working in UWM are
    generally not used to dealing with an abundance of data and dynamic systems. The
    adaptation to increased data availability thus requires a change in engineering
    and management practices which considers the adaptation of new types of models
    and takes into account uncertainty and risks. However, the general tendency to
    risk aversion and the restricted time available to utility managers in UWM are
    not conducive to promoting innovative change. (223) The introduction of new practices
    is obviously complex and time-consuming and will require changes such as institutional
    transitions. However, the complex and multidimensional process of changing dominant
    professional cultures and forming new industries with different practices such
    as on-site treatment or RTC needs to be discussed elsewhere. (8, 224) Nevertheless,
    it is interesting to note that in the electricity sector for instance, IT and
    communications technology companies, and not the utilities themselves, are a key
    driver for the transition toward smart grids. (225) (iii) Data acquisition is
    not free and its costs need to be justified with the potential benefits it provides.
    For example, the RTC of drainage systems requires reliable actuators, energy provision,
    sensors, transmission, SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) equipment
    and corresponding operation and maintenance efforts. This can be compared directly
    with the more traditional approach of investing in static retention tanks and
    conveyance capacity. However, the trade-off between the potential benefits and
    the necessary investments is often difficult to quantify, as the forecasting benefits
    of increased data are not easily foreseeable and their advantages, such as greater
    flexibility, are difficult to monetize. (226, 227) This difficulty in assessing
    the benefits of change is also discussed in other infrastructures analogous to
    UWM: thus Moretti et al., for example, concluded in a review about the environmental
    and economic benefits of smart electricity grids, that they “are energy efficient
    and reduce greenhouse gas emissions” but also warn that “investments in smart
    grid systems may not yield any benefits”. (228) In contrast, Niesten and Alkemade
    reviewed the literature about value creation in smart grids and concluded that
    corresponding business models could be profitable. (229) The above listed issues
    demonstrate that the application of data-driven approaches in UWM is not limited
    to techno-economic innovation. A whole-system perspective is necessary for the
    transformation of UWM systems and technologies need to be adapted to local conditions.
    (7, 166) Very different barriers need to be addressed as a myriad of factors affect
    innovation processes (21, 214, 223, 230) and they “typically depend on the codevelopment
    of new socio-technical configurations, new market structures, new actors and new
    institutional settings”. (231) 4.2 The Utility of Data-Driven UWM With respect
    to data, more are not necessarily better–especially considering the costs involved.
    It is necessary to decide on which data to collect and to which resolution in
    view of a specific purpose. The relationship between the amount of data and the
    utility derived from it may differ for different data-driven applications. Different
    trajectories can be described (two characteristic examples are shown in Figure
    3). The three data regions presented there are characterized as follows: in the
    data-scarce region, the utility of the data is small despite the cost and effort
    involved. An example is rain data, where a few high-resolution events do not provide
    much useful information for the design of the system. After several years of collecting
    rain events, the data moves into the optimal region, where it offers enough variability
    to allow design decisions to be made (trajectory A). In the data-abundant region,
    the additional gain in information and therefore the increase in utility with
    greater data availability is comparable small. Data-driven UWM should aim to reach
    the region of optimal data availability. Figure 3 Figure 3. Schematic representation
    of two example trajectories demonstrating the relationship between data and utility
    with respect to different data regions. Another simplified didactic example for
    this relationship can be taken from the assessment of urban flood risk: better
    elevation data increases the gain in information, especially if only a limited
    resolution is so far available (data-scarce region). Once the resolution of the
    elevation data is good enough to detect streets, a substantial gain in utility
    can be achieved, resulting in a “sigmoid” relationship (exemplary trajectory B
    in Figure 3). After a certain resolution is reached (optimal region), the additional
    information gain of higher resolution levels out. As discussed above, the exact
    shape of the trajectory may vary for different data-driven applications. While
    elevation data often offers the desired data availability (see Section 3.2), we
    suggest that most utilities are still in the data scarce-region as regards most
    other UWM applications. 5 Conclusions ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To This review has
    explored the possibility and benefits of creating more data-driven UWM by utilizing
    the ongoing push for smart infrastructures. The main findings are The compiled
    evidence indicates that i.) considerable research documented in the literature
    points toward more data-driven UWM, and ii.) the potential benefits are significant.
    Increased data availability from conventional and new data sources is a precondition
    for many novel methods developed within the UWM literature. Examples include efficiency
    gains through real-time control, improved risk assessment though sensor-based
    contamination detection or credible early pluvial flood-warning systems. Utilization
    of the current network-based UWM can be substantially optimized. Making use of
    more data improves its efficiency and expands its functionality beyond the passive
    conveyance of water and wastewater. Novel sensoring and smart meter technologies
    can lead to radically different approaches to UWM. Prominent examples are on-site
    water and wastewater treatment and the introduction of demand management in water
    supply. Wastewater-based epidemiology can add value to operating and monitoring
    sewer systems and permit intimate insights into societal health and well-being.
    Diverse, consistent and spatially explicit data are essential for integrated modeling
    and deciding on more sustainable design and management of UWM infrastructures.
    The provision of a high level of water productivity and sanitation with less network-based
    infrastructure requires more data-driven UWM. This allows defined levels of performance
    and lower costs for on-site systems to be achieved. An evolution toward data-driven
    UWM faces several obstacles extending from privacy concerns to the requirements
    of institutional changes in the legal and operative framework. Most importantly,
    clear evidence for a beneficial cost-benefit ratio that would justify widespread
    implementation of a more data-driven UWM is generally missing. Author Information

    \ \n \nAbstract: This paper reviews the drivers, development and global deployment\
    \ of \nintelligent water metering in the urban context. Recognising that intelligent\
    \ metering (or \nsmart metering) has the potential to revolutionise customer engagement\
    \ and management \nof urban water by utilities, this paper provides a summary\
    \ of the knowledge-base for \nresearchers and industry practitioners to ensure\
    \ that the technology fosters sustainable \nurban water management. To date, roll-outs\
    \ of intelligent metering have been driven by the \ndesire for increased data\
    \ regarding time of use and end-use (such as use by shower, toilet, \ngarden,\
    \ etc.) as well as by the ability of the technology to reduce labour costs for\
    \ meter \nreading. Technology development in the water sector generally lags that\
    \ seen in the \nelectricity sector. In the coming decade, the deployment of intelligent\
    \ water metering will \ntransition from being predominantly “pilot or demonstration\
    \ scale” with the occasional  \ncity-wide roll-out, to broader mainstream implementation.\
    \ This means that issues which \nhave hitherto received little focus must now\
    \ be addressed, namely: the role of real-time \ndata in customer engagement and\
    \ demand management; data ownership, sharing and \nprivacy; technical data management\
    \ and infrastructure security, utility workforce skills; \nand costs and benefits\
    \ of implementation. \n \n \nOPEN ACCESS\nWater 2013, 5 \n1053 \n \n \nKeywords:\
    \ intelligent metering; urban water; smart metering; review; sustainable; end\
    \  \nuse; AMR \n \n1. Introduction \nThe water industry is confronted by changing\
    \ drivers in the sustainable management of urban water. \nExternal factors, including\
    \ the impacts of climate change, drought, population growth and \nconsolidation\
    \ in urban centres [1–3] have all been increasing the onus on water service providers\
    \ to \nadopt more sustainable approaches to urban water management as the era\
    \ of cheap water fades [4–7]. \nCovering costs, monitoring non-revenue water and\
    \ meeting customer demands for equity in billing in \nthe face of rising water\
    \ prices are some of the core challenges [8,9]. \nWhile financial sustainability\
    \ remains critical, the accompanying challenge to achieve sustainable \nurban\
    \ water management (SUWM) has also become a goal of strategic planning for water\
    \ utilities. \nIndeed, many water service providers have been gradually evolving\
    \ from their traditional supply \noriented role as providers of water to embrace\
    \ a variety of demand management strategies towards \nmore sustainable urban water\
    \ management [10] including the use of distributed and decentralised \nsystems\
    \ [11]. Measures that have been implemented to manage water demand include metering,\
    \ water \naccounting and loss control, pricing and education. However, the success\
    \ of these strategies critically \nrequires accurate, adequate and reliable data\
    \ that can be meaningfully and cost-effectively interpreted \nto help utilities\
    \ improve customer services, reduce water losses and manage demand [12,13]. Add\
    \ to \nthis public discourse that suggests resource consumption and management\
    \ is not only the \nresponsibility of industry and governments, but also the responsibility\
    \ of the individual, and the need \nfor improved information at the consumer level\
    \ becomes apparent [14]. To promote individual \nresponsibility (whilst noting\
    \ that context, culture and water-use habits are also important), residential\
    \ \ncustomers in particular need access to timely, relevant and comprehensible\
    \ information that can assist \ndaily decision-making processes around resource\
    \ use [9,15]. Whilst recent developments in mobile \ncomputing and telecommunications\
    \ (e.g., smartphones, 4G networks) are improving this situation, the \nusefulness\
    \ of this feedback is ultimately constrained by the frequency and resolution of\
    \ data generated \nat the source, in this case, water meters. \nEnter intelligent\
    \ water metering (IM) which offers the potential to transform urban water \nmanagement.\
    \ IM enables the determination, in real-time or near real-time, of water consumption,\
    \ and \nprovides the possibility to read consumption both locally and remotely.\
    \ Both in Australia and \ninternationally, the discourse and the use of IM technology\
    \ are being shaped by the interests of a \nnumber of key social, economic and\
    \ political actors, with water service providers, consumers, \ntechnology vendors\
    \ and regulators, in particular, contributing to the development agenda. This\
    \ paper \nreviews the global development of intelligent metering for urban water\
    \ with a particular focus on \nAustralia. Whilst review studies have been undertaken\
    \ in relation to use of intelligent metering in the \nelectricity sector (e.g.,\
    \ [15–21]) and in water end-use analysis [22], a review of intelligent metering\
    \ in \nurban water service provision, with an eye to perceived prospects, trials\
    \ and deployments, has been \nlacking. The aim of the paper is to provide an overview\
    \ of practices, prospects and pitfalls based on a \nWater 2013, 5 \n1054 \n \n\
    \ \nreview of IM deployments in Australia and abroad—from both the customer and\
    \ utility perspective—\nand in doing so, identify a research agenda to ensure\
    \ IM makes a purposeful contribution to SUWM. \nThe paper is arranged in five\
    \ sections. The remainder of the introduction outlines the historical \ndevelopment\
    \ of water metering, including intelligent metering. Given the differences in\
    \ definitions and \nuse of the term, the following section reviews and reconciles\
    \ definitions of intelligent metering. We then \nsynthesise applications of IM\
    \ in the water sector with an Australian focus, but global outlook, to better\
    \ \nunderstand the rationale for its adoption. Drawing on perspectives from the\
    \ energy sector and the goal \nof SUWM, we conclude by outlining future challenges\
    \ and opportunities for intelligent water metering. \n1.1. A Brief History of\
    \ Metering \nEarly interest in measuring water can be seen in first century writings\
    \ on the urban supply of water \nin Rome by water commissioner, Sextus Julius\
    \ Frontinus. His texts included details on the sources, \nlength and function\
    \ of each of the city’s aqueducts, yet struggled with the critical issue of measuring\
    \ \nwater flow [23]. Important contributions by engineers in Western Europe and\
    \ the U.S. beginning from \nthe 18th century to the present day have aided progressive\
    \ developments in water flow measurement, \nallowing the science and technology\
    \ for water supply, distribution and measurement to reach its \npresent state\
    \ [23]. \nThere has been a gradual development in the deployment and use of customer\
    \ flow registration \nmeters. Since the mid 1900s economists have argued for water\
    \ service providers to move towards a \nmore commercial approach to water service\
    \ delivery through dedicated water bills rather than the \nrecovery of supply\
    \ costs through rates and taxes [24]. The main drivers for this were the need\
    \ to \nrecover costs directly from the customer, to cut out an intermediary body\
    \ and to ring fence the \nfinancial operations from other government activities.\
    \ Secondly, it was viewed to be more equitable to \nthe customer, where the associated\
    \ water bill was linked to the volume consumed, rather than a flat \nrate or a\
    \ fee based on the size of property serviced [24,25]. Individual metering also\
    \ allowed the \nintroduction of rising block tariffs based on a differentiated\
    \ volume of consumption to firstly allow for \ncross-subsidisation of poorer low\
    \ users by the usually wealthy high users, and secondly to encourage \nthe high\
    \ end users to reduce their consumption in resource constrained regions through\
    \ market  \nforces [26]. Empirical analysis has shown that in developed countries\
    \ such as Canada, USA, Australia, \nUK and Israel, the price elasticity of demand\
    \ for water by households is between −0.3 and −0.7  \n(i.e., a doubling of the\
    \ price of water would reduce the consumption by between 30% and 70%) [27]. \n\
    The gradual realisation of the true value of potable water to society has made\
    \ water metering a \ncritical activity for many water utilities, integral to the\
    \ management of both water resources and \ninfrastructure. Water metering essentially\
    \ offers the opportunity to improve the balance between \nproviding access to\
    \ potable water, a utility’s right to receive payment for services rendered, and\
    \ the \njoint responsibility of all to preserve scarce water resources [28]. \n\
    More recently, utilities have become interested in demand side management and\
    \ water efficiency in \nan attempt to delay expensive capital investments for\
    \ supply options [29,30]. Just as in the electricity \nindustry, where “least\
    \ cost planning” and “integrated resource planning” were developed to compare\
    \ \nenergy conservation to increased supply, so too have these principles been\
    \ emerging as priorities and \nare now widely applied the water sector [10]. \n\
    Water 2013, 5 \n1055 \n \n \nDespite the increasing recognition of its value,\
    \ there are wide variations in the penetration of \ncustomer water metering internationally.\
    \ For example, two-thirds of homes in the UK remain \nunmetered for water consumption,\
    \ although the Environment Agency wants all homes in Britain \nmetered by 2030\
    \ [24,31]. In the U.S. water metering is widespread and there are plans for universal\
    \ \nupgrades to intelligent metering [32]. In Australia, water metering has now\
    \ been present for more than \na century and residential metering is almost universal\
    \ in the country’s major urban centers for single \ndetached dwellings [33]. Important\
    \ exclusions remain however, including the majority of established \nmulti-unit\
    \ dwellings (apartments). Multi-residential blocks generally have a single water\
    \ meter which \ncaptures aggregate usage across all apartments. Sub-metering for\
    \ individual units/apartments is on the \nrise however, bolstered by the recent\
    \ introduction of legislative requirements in some Australian states. \nFor example,\
    \ sub-metering is now compulsory for all new residential multi-unit developments\
    \ in \nQueensland [34], and in New South Wales, the Residential Tenancies Act\
    \ 2010 allows landlords to \ncharge tenants for water usage on sub-metered units\
    \ [35]. \nIt is this history and familiarity with metering, together with the\
    \ push for sustainable urban water \nmanagement, which primes Australia for the\
    \ next generation of metering: technology premised on \nmore frequent, higher\
    \ resolution, remotely accessible data generation. As with any new technology,\
    \ \nmany issues remain to be negotiated, particularly concerning costs. Hence,\
    \ this paper ensues with a \ndiscussion surrounding the prospects and pitfalls\
    \ of IM technologies in this new frontier of digital \nwater resource management.\
    \ \n1.2. The Arrival of Intelligent Metering \nDevelopments in intelligent water\
    \ metering technology have evolved to a large extent from the \nenergy sector,\
    \ where smart electricity and gas meters and communications infrastructure have\
    \ already \nbeen more widely introduced [36–39]. In 2009, intelligent water metering\
    \ projects accounted for only \naround 18% of the total number of intelligent\
    \ metering projects across water and energy  \nworldwide [40]. In recognition\
    \ of the value of conventional metering and tempted by the opportunities \npresented\
    \ by the new technology (e.g., reduced labour costs for meter reading), utilities\
    \ are \nprogressively turning towards the consideration of intelligent metering\
    \ as a potential way to secure \nwater supply, minimise waste and control costs\
    \ in addition to transforming the customer-utility \nrelationship. It is within\
    \ this context that an assortment of intelligent metering technologies have \n\
    emerged to accommodate a diverse range of applications (e.g., households, schools,\
    \ industrial, \nmunicipal) and varying geographical, technical and resource constraints\
    \ [41]. Whilst a comprehensive \nreview of IM technologies is beyond the scope\
    \ of this paper, the following section introduces some \nfundamental terminologies\
    \ of IM to frame subsequent discussion around the uptake of the technology \n\
    in Australia and abroad. We then turn to unpack rationale for the uptake of IM.\
    \ \n2. Technology and Terminology \n2.1. Intelligent Metering: A Data Generation\
    \ and Management System \nThe terms “intelligent” and “smart” metering are often\
    \ haphazardly deployed with reference to \nsome combination of technology that\
    \ is superior to conventional metering. This inherent ambiguity is, \nWater 2013,\
    \ 5 \n1056 \n \n \nhowever, indicative of the plethora of technological configurations\
    \ which intelligent metering covers, \nand its relevance to both the energy and\
    \ water sectors. Intelligent metering may refer to any “new \nsystems employing\
    \ the latest in communication capabilities and enhanced functionality” for \n\
    monitoring water use [42]. Taking stock of its component parts provides further\
    \ clarification: “(it) \nembraces two distinct elements; meters that use new technology\
    \ to capture water use information and \ncommunication systems that can capture\
    \ and transmit water use information as it happens, or almost as \nit happens”\
    \ [43]. That is, a standard or high resolution water meter linked to a data logger\
    \ that allows \nfor the continuous reading of water consumption by the utility\
    \ and/or third party [44]. Critically, it \nallows for remote meter reading by\
    \ the water service provider. The data may also be provided in a \nmore accessible\
    \ format to the customer through a range of feedback channels. In essence, IM\
    \ signals \nan intention to better integrate improved data sets into water planning\
    \ processes, and in doing so, \nimprove customer engagement and the management\
    \ of precious water resources [45]. \nIntelligent metering is, in effect, an assortment\
    \ of components and procedures configured for the \non-going monitoring and evaluation\
    \ of water use to inform strategic planning processes. Put simply, \nIM is an\
    \ information feedback system, a tool to aid decision-making. This system is bound\
    \ by four key \nprocesses: the (i) measurement; (ii) data transfer; (iii) processing\
    \ and analysis; and (iv) feedback  \nof water use data, as described in Table\
    \ 1. Between these processes also lies the storage of data.  \nThe means by which\
    \ these processes unfold is best described in terms of mode (means of measurement\
    \ \nor delivery), resolution (granularity or density of data) and frequency (regularity\
    \ of data). Data \nresolution is typically a function of mode, and the relationship\
    \ between mode and frequency is \ngenerally one of interdependence. Together these\
    \ elements provide a framework to assess the \nopportunities provided by IM through\
    \ an enhanced understanding of how and when water is used [46]. \nThis conceptualisation\
    \ illuminates the role of the IM “information supply chain” and the various \n\
    technologies and stakeholders that operate within this system (the utility, third\
    \ parties, regulators, \ntelecommunication companies, data management firms, and\
    \ the customer) [47]. \n2.2. Metering Technologies \nThere are a range of metering\
    \ technologies, employing different principles to capture and record \nwater use\
    \ (see [48] for a comprehensive introduction). Common technologies broadly fall\
    \ within one \nof four categories: (i) displacement meters; (ii) velocity meters;\
    \ (iii) compound (or combination); or \n(iv) electromagnetic meters [48,49]. Displacement\
    \ (or mechanical) meters require the movement of \nwater to mechanically displace\
    \ components within the meter to record water flow. They have the \nadvantage\
    \ of being inexpensive and accurate at low to moderate flow rates. Velocity meters,\
    \ such as \nmulti-jet, magnetic flow and ultrasonic measure the velocity of flow\
    \ through a meter of a known \ninternal capacity. Speed of flow is then converted\
    \ into volume of flow for usage [50]. Combination \nmeters utilise the strengths\
    \ of displacement and velocity technologies in the one meter, in cases of \nvariable\
    \ flow rates (i.e., both high and low flow rates need to be recorded accurately).\
    \ Electromagnetic \nflow meters harness the electromagnetic properties of water,\
    \ which, as it flows, generates voltage as it \ncrosses the force lines of a magnetic\
    \ field [49]. With no moving parts, these meters are well-suited to \nflows with\
    \ contaminants or debris that could otherwise damage a mechanical meter [49].\

    \ \nWater 2013, 5 \n1058 \n \n \nThere are three methods for recording the volumes\
    \ measured: accumulation, pulse and interval, \nwhich differ in how consumption\
    \ is recorded (Figure 1). Australian domestic water meters typically \ncomprise\
    \ of 20 mm mechanical accumulation meters (some can also be reconfigured to give\
    \ a pulse). \nThe accuracy of these meters in terms of measurement of flow is\
    \ typically 0.25%–0.50% [51], \nhowever the frequency at which they are read is\
    \ generally on a monthly or quarterly basis. Hence, \nwhile inexpensive, they\
    \ offer little data to assist in urban water management other than for monitoring\
    \ \ncumulative total water use—a practice with its roots in supplier revenue generation\
    \ and demand \nmanagement through consumer price signaling [52,53]. \nFigure 1.\
    \ Displacement meters [54]. \n \nPulse and interval meters are commonly associated\
    \ with residential IM. Pulse meters record a pulse \nwhen a (configurable) quantum\
    \ of water (e.g., 1–100 L) passes through the meter. The number of \npulses recorded\
    \ by a meter and the time at which these pulses are recorded are stored in an\
    \ integrated \nor attached data logger. Residential pulse meters 20 and 25 mm\
    \ in diameter commonly pulse at every  \n5 L, whilst large pulse meters capable\
    \ of recording high volume flows may produce a pulse every 100 L. \nMore advanced\
    \ meters are capable of recording higher granularity of water use at reduced and\
    \ \nprogrammed intervals, but this spectrum of granularity varies considerably.\
    \ A high resolution pulse \nmeter, for example, will generate more than 20 pulses\
    \ per litre (0.05 L/pulse), a low resolution pulse \nmeter 1–2 pulses per litre\
    \ [55]. \nInterval or time-of-use meters are comparatively more expensive than\
    \ pulse meters as the meter is \nrequired to constantly monitor the water flows\
    \ through the meter [54]. After a certain time period (e.g., \n15 min) the volume\
    \ of water that has passed through the meter is recorded. \n2.3. System Sophistication\
    \ \nIntelligent metering may be classified as Automated Meter Reading (AMR) or\
    \ Advanced Metering \nInfrastructure (AMI). The fundamental difference lies in\
    \ the level of sophistication of measurement \nand control, or operability. AMR,\
    \ also known as remote meter reading, involves the automated transfer \nof recorded\
    \ water consumption data, typically via public (e.g., GPRS, CDMA, GSM) or private\
    \ radio \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nV \nT \nV \nV \nT \nT \nAccumulation meters\n\

    \ recorded at specific time intervals.\nWater 2013, 5 \n1059 \n \n \ntransmission,\
    \ to servers for the storage and subsequent processing of data by the utility\
    \ and/or third \nparty [56]. Usually, this involves the manipulation or “smartening”\
    \ of existing compatible “dumb” \nmeters (e.g., mechanical accumulation meters)\
    \ [57], resulting in “smart enabled meters” [32,36,58], \nalthough pulse/interval\
    \ meters may also be used in an AMR scenario. Whilst AMR results in improved \n\
    timeliness and accuracy of data, it is said to only offer a notional increase\
    \ in data density, e.g., one read \nper month, although higher frequencies are\
    \ possible [59]. Hence, some authors do not even grant AMR \nthe status of “intelligent\
    \ metering” [60]. \nAMI similarly involves these steps, but also allows for two-way\
    \ communication between the meter \nand utility or other third party via the data\
    \ logger and critically, much higher data density. AMI \neffectively creates a\
    \ data stream (termed by the industry as “big data” [47,61]) that enables real-time\
    \ \nmonitoring and analysis, although end-use analysis at present still requires\
    \ retrospective examination \nusing trace software (e.g., TraceWizard™) to produce\
    \ meaningful insights [44,55]. In addition to more \ndata, the Victorian Water\
    \ Trust adds that AMI also provides a higher granularity of consumption data \n\
    (i.e., a greater number of pulses recorded in smaller intervals by the data logger)\
    \ [54]. Two-way \ncommunication denotes the ability of the meter operator to “at\
    \ a minimum, obtain meter reads on \ndemand, to ascertain whether water has recently\
    \ been flowing through the meter and onto the premises, \nand to issue commands\
    \ to the meter to perform specific tasks such as disconnecting or restricting\
    \ water \nflow” [62]. In the energy sector, AMI is said to enable communication\
    \ between all hardware, software, \nassociated data retrieval and data management\
    \ systems, though it is unclear whether AMI speaks to \nthis level of integration\
    \ in the water sector. Put simply, AMI offers more control, more information,\
    \ \nmore often. Both AMI and AMR are not without their pitfalls however, with\
    \ numerous studies \nencountering issues with the emerging technology, particularly\
    \ concerning data continuity as a result \nof disruption at generation and transfer\
    \ points [63–66]. As will be revisited, the transition from a “data \npoor” to\
    \ “data rich” environment requires a significant paradigm shift for water service\
    \ providers [59]. \nWhilst AMR and AMI can be distinguished in theory, the level\
    \ of advancement of IM can be \nlikened more to a spectrum as opposed to a binary\
    \ due to the range of technological variants and \ncommunication pathways that\
    \ fall under the banner of intelligent metering. Second, this continuum is \n\
    blurred by the pros and cons of these variants relative to context—what works\
    \ in one situation may be \nless effective, or less cost-effective, in another\
    \ (e.g., the geographical implications of urban/semi-rural \nsettings for data\
    \ transmission, or the type of premises being metered and extent of water use).\
    \ Third, \nthe terms AMR and AMI have essentially been borrowed from the energy\
    \ sector, where two-way \ncommunication pathways are of more strategic significance\
    \ in regulation of peak demand [16]. \nNonetheless, as the technology matures\
    \ so will its associated lexicon, as water service providers come \nto identify\
    \ configurations conducive to their needs. What seems clear, however, is an apparent\
    \ vision  \nof increased connectivity and system flexibility. To this end, IM\
    \ is also positioned as an integral \ncomponent of the intelligent urban water\
    \ network (IUWN). An IUWN may be defined as “a network \nmanagement system that\
    \ exploits new technologies to monitor performance, remotely sense asset \ncondition,\
    \ assess water availability and monitor real time water use to improve delivery\
    \ of water, \nwastewater and stormwater services for the benefit of all stakeholders”\
    \ [67]. The IUWN model signals \na higher level of sophistication in monitoring\
    \ not only of water use, but also water quality, pressure \nand asset condition\
    \ that enables for the more efficient and sustainable management and delivery\
    \ of \nurban water [68]. It may be likened to the “smart grid” of the energy sector,\
    \ which speaks to the \nWater 2013, 5 \n1060 \n \n \nconcept of the integrated\
    \ “smart city”—a complex, yet manageable and adaptable system of fine \ngrained\
    \ monitoring, automation and control of distributed infrastructure, enabled by\
    \ advanced \ntelecommunications infrastructure [21,59,69]. Figure 2 illustrates\
    \ the relationship between AMR, AMI \nand an IUWN. \nFigure 2. Conceptualising\
    \ intelligent metering as Automated Meter Reading (AMR), Advanced \nMetering Infrastructure\
    \ (AMI) and within an intelligent urban water network (IUWN). \n \n3. Deployments\
    \ \nWe now turn to examine the uptake of IM both in Australia and abroad. The\
    \ purpose of this \nexercise is one of navigation, to explore the objectives of\
    \ IM deployments and in doing so arrive at a \nmore nuanced understanding of drivers\
    \ underpinning the adoption of the technology. This allows us to \nlocate the\
    \ significance and use of IM relevant to broader utility operations and consider\
    \ the potential \nopportunities and limitations of IM in the following section.\
    \ \nTable 2 provides an overview of IM deployments. The list is not intended to\
    \ be an exhaustive \naccount of every installation, but rather a comprehensive\
    \ snapshot of an evolving sector. Australian \napplications of IM vary in scope\
    \ and scale, though most have been limited to small-scale pilot projects \nwith\
    \ only a few larger scale roll-outs (for example, 13,800 in Kalgoorlie-Boulder,\
    \ Western Australia, \n20,000 AMR meters in Wide Bay Water, Queensland and 30,000\
    \ currently being installed in Mackay, \nQueensland). The majority of projects\
    \ sampled in this paper are residential-focused, however the \nnumber of industrial,\
    \ municipal and commercial deployments is also rising. Internationally, many \n\
    jurisdictions are pushing ahead with large-scale roll-outs of many thousands of\
    \ meters following  \nsmall-scale trials, typically rationalised in terms of remote\
    \ access benefits (e.g., reduced labour costs \nfor meter reading, reduced health\
    \ and safety risks from hard-to-access properties requiring reaching \nover fences\
    \ or confronting pet dogs) and enabling improvements to network efficiency. Most\
    \ IM \ndeployments to date have occurred in Europe and North America, with these\
    \ two regions accounting \nfor 89% of the global IM market in terms of module\
    \ shipments [32]. For example, New York has \n834,000 m, while Global Water in\
    \ Arizona has many thousands and has recently entered into a \npartnership with\
    \ Thames Water in the UK to extend roll-out there [70]. More widespread \nimplementation\
    \ appears to be on the horizon and market forecasts predict large-scale adoption\
    \ in urban \ncentres internationally, including developing economies such as India\
    \ and Africa [32]. \nWater 2013, 5 \n1061 \n \n \nTable 2. Intelligent water metering\

    \ as “trials”, quantifiable water \nsavings achieved as a result of efficiency\
    \ gains made with the introduction of IM (explored below) are \nnot always available,\
    \ as trials are on-going or in the process of being evaluated. For example, the\
    \ two-year \nKalgoorlie-Boulder trial of 13,800 m is “on track” to achieve annual\
    \ savings of 900 million L or a 12% \nreduction in water use through leak detection\
    \ and more detailed water use feedback to the  \ncustomer [77]. In an 18 month\
    \ long trial conducted by Sydney Water, water savings water calculated at \nan\
    \ average reduction of 7%–10% or 16 kL per property [85]. These and other trials\
    \ are considered in \nthe following section in relation to the objectives of IM\
    \ deployments (also noted in Table 2) and a \ndiscussion of technology drivers\
    \ and opportunities. \n4. Drivers \nUtilities stand to benefit from enhanced water\
    \ meter data for a two key reasons. Firstly, it provides \nthe necessary security\
    \ of supply through demand-side management when confronted by seasonal \nvariations\
    \ in rainfall, and secondly, it provides a mechanism to defer capital investments\
    \ through \ndemand reduction mechanisms [42,85]. These include scarcity based\
    \ pricing and education and \nawareness programs [76,108–110]. Higher resolution\
    \ metering data would provide the utility with \ninsights into how customers are\
    \ using water and therefore be in a position to target specific \ndiscretionary\
    \ end uses, such as outdoor use, with the aim of changing consumer water conservation\
    \ \nand consumption attitudes and behaviours [111,112]. This data can also be\
    \ conveyed back to the \ncustomer in the interests of improving water literacy\
    \ and prompting behaviour change. However, \nassuming that increased water-use\
    \ information being available for customers will necessarily result in \nchanged\
    \ behaviours is simplistic. Notwithstanding, improved frequency of data collection,\
    \ together \nwith higher resolution of volumetric flow capture, would allow utilities\
    \ to better identify and reduce \nwater losses within the system network and low\
    \ level leaks beyond the customer meter [113].  \nA reduction in customer and\
    \ network leaks would further reduce the overall water demand on supplies \nas\
    \ well delay any network capacity upgrades [102,114]. \nThese “IM-enabled” water\
    \ management strategies are considered further below, drawing on the \nobjectives\
    \ of IM deployments. Objectives allude to rationale for the adoption of the technology,\
    \ \nproviding a window into its perceived potential benefits. Here we consider\
    \ those opportunities, first \nsituating them within the broader discursive framing\
    \ of sustainable urban water management and the \nfinancial operability of water\
    \ service provision. \n4.1. IM as a Tool for Achieving Demand-Side Management\
    \ \nInterest in SUWM reflects a more recent and progressive shift in Australia’s\
    \ cultural and political \ndiscourse that continues to emphasise an environmentally\
    \ responsible use of water [115]; a product of \nAustralia’s growth with respect\
    \ to environmental constraints, principally that of an erratic, drought \nprone\
    \ climate, marginal rainfall and limited fresh water resources [116,117]. SUWM\
    \ thus introduces \nthe concept of scarcity and associated responses [118,119].\
    \ Accordingly, the central tenet of SUWM is \nfor the efficient use of water resources.\
    \ The use of planning instruments that balance supply \naugmentation and demand-side\
    \ management (DSM) options in terms of costs, yield and environmental \nand social\
    \ externalities, such as integrated resource planning (IRP) and least cost planning,\
    \ is therefore \nWater 2013, 5 \n1064 \n \n \nimplicit in the pursuit of SUWM\
    \ [120]. IM provides the necessary data to both query and progress \nDSM in this\
    \ regard. The Australian pursuit of SUWM reflects an international trend in continued\
    \ \nefforts to minimise environmental and social costs associated with securing\
    \ water supply via demand \nmanagement techniques [120,121]. \nSUWM is said to\
    \ be one of two overarching “strategic imperatives” of utilities; the other being\
    \ \nfinancial viability. Ensuring financial viability is inherent to the provision\
    \ of water fit for purpose and \nforms the fundamental operating logic of enterprise:\
    \ the need to secure supply via the efficient \nallocation of capital. Most water\
    \ service providers today “operate in the reality of decreasing supplies, \nincreasing\
    \ costs and revenue reductions” [9]. \nDSM strategies may be characterised as\
    \ technical, behavioural or managerial responses. Technical \nchanges such as\
    \ improvements in end-use (appliances, fixtures and fittings) and network efficiency\
    \ \nthrough active leak detection and repair for example, and behavioural changes\
    \ such as shorter showers \nor mulching the garden to reduce moisture loss, are\
    \ examples of direct strategies that can be progressed \nwith the analysis of\
    \ high data resolution provided by intelligent metering. Indirect strategies concerned\
    \ \nwith managerial responses relate to planning, monitoring and evaluation, and\
    \ subsequently inform the \nexecution of direct strategies. These include demand\
    \ forecasting and improved modelling using \nenhanced end-use datasets provided\
    \ by IM, integrated resource planning (IRP), and on-going \nmonitoring and evaluation\
    \ and refinement of demand management programs [10]. Central to the \nrhetoric\
    \ of IM is thus the claim of the technology as a necessary (if not inevitable)\
    \ tool for \nstrengthening demand management strategies and in achieving the broader\
    \ strategic aims of water \nservice providers. As more accurate information on\
    \ how and when water is consumed is critical to \neffective demand management\
    \ [69], the provision of more frequent, higher resolution data—the core \npromise\
    \ of IM—positions the technology as the essential tool for achieving the directives\
    \ of water \nservice providers as shown in Figure 3. \n4.1.1. Limitations of Focusing\
    \ on Individuals When Considering Water Use Behaviours \nSupporters of IM technology,\
    \ including those within utilities and those researching their use often \nput\
    \ great focus on the functionality of the technology and too little on the context\
    \ in which the \ntechnology and water itself is used. Assumptions that householders\
    \ receiving information about \npatterns of water use may lead to a change in\
    \ awareness and behavior are contested in  \npractice-centred approaches (see\
    \ for example [122]). The authors recognize that understanding the \ncultural,\
    \ historical and emotional variables that drive water use is essential to gain\
    \ insight into how and \nwhy water is used. Presenting consumption information\
    \ offered by intelligent meters is only one \napproach within a suite of methods\
    \ to work towards sustainable water use futures. Engagement with \nhousehold water\
    \ technologies needs to be contextualized within the broader social and cultural\
    \ \nenvironment to maximize changes towards more sustainable water use. These\
    \ issues are explored \nfurther in a companion paper [123]. \n \n \nWater 2013,\

    \ IM Deployments \nWith these DSM strategies in mind, the objectives of IM deployments\
    \ can be more clearly \narticulated and their relevance to SUWM or financial viability\
    \ noted (Table 3). \nTable 3. Objectives of IM deployments. \nObjective \nSUWM\

     \n \nEnable remote accessibility \n \n \n4.2.1. Cost Benefit Analysis (IM\
    \ Trials) \nCommonplace of IM trials is an exploration of costs and benefits as\
    \ an overarching objective. Often \nhowever, costs and benefits are problematised\
    \ in discussion rather than value weighted. This may be \nowing to the fact that\
    \ many benefits of IM are of non-market value and thus require imputed valuation.\
    \ \nWhilst the cost-effectiveness of IM remains in a state of flux [54] it is\
    \ important to note the technology \nWater 2013, 5 \n1066 \n \n \ncontinues to\
    \ evolve and its potential value will be subject to the context of application\
    \ (i.e., cost of \nDSM relative to supply) and on-going research (e.g., in the\
    \ field of feedback and behaviour change). \n4.2.2. End-Use Analysis and Efficiency\
    \ \nUse of IM for end use analysis purposes reflects a growing interest in improving\
    \ end use efficiency \nover the last decade and more recently, to evaluate the\
    \ savings of DSM [55,81,90,93,124] and \nalternative supply programs (such as\
    \ the performance of rainwater tanks) [65,125]. Studying appliance \nefficiencies\
    \ and “water behaviours” is core to demand forecasting and evaluation as water\
    \ use patterns \nchange over time with demographic shifts and the introduction\
    \ of new technologies [10]. The use of \nIM to provide end-use level detail has\
    \ the potential to provide rich information to both the utility as \nwell as the\
    \ consumer. By capturing high resolution data from individually metered households\
    \ and \nnetwork zone meters, utilities have been able to gain an understanding\
    \ of daily and seasonal residential \nconsumption patterns. This information is\
    \ useful for optimising operational processes and planning for \nnetwork improvements\
    \ [47]. The data is also critical for integrated resource planning, which benefits\
    \ \nfrom end-use modelling for demand forecasting and the design, implementation\
    \ and refinement of \ndemand management programs. This provides the opportunity\
    \ for the utility to reduce its operational \ncosts through asset management efficiency\
    \ and upgrade deferrals [24]. In other words, the upsizing of \nthe network due\
    \ to increases in the number of customers due to population growth and influx\
    \ can be \ndelayed through the offsetting of increased demand through demand reduction\
    \ mechanisms. \n4.2.3. Feedback and Customer Service \nTo date, end-use data collected\
    \ has typically been for the sole benefit of utilities and the information \n\
    has not been made available to customers, other than in the form of their periodic\
    \ bill. There is \nincreasingly a view that by empowering customers with information\
    \ about their consumption patterns \nand uses will allow them to make informed\
    \ decisions about how they use water in future. Water \nutilities recognise the\
    \ importance of meeting growing customer expectations, which are inextricably\
    \ \nlinked with technological innovation, in promoting utility reputations that\
    \ are consumer-focused. By \nproviding more information about water use, which\
    \ can then be filtered into more meaningful \ninformation for the customer, IM\
    \ presents an opportunity to improve water literacy within the \ncommunity and\
    \ to empower households to develop a greater understanding of their consumption.\
    \ For \ninstance, rather than estimated (average) daily use based on historical\
    \ consumption data, IM can potentially \noffer real-time monitoring of consumption\
    \ and anything in-between, e.g., monthly, weekly, daily. \nFew projects have tested\
    \ the role and potential for behaviour change through “IM-enabled” \nfeedback\
    \ to date however. A study funded through the European Union FP7 (2012–2015) will\
    \ \npotentially fill this gap in knowledge [126]. It aims to develop customised\
    \ intervention and awareness \ncampaigns to influence behavioural change through\
    \ the use of intelligent metering and data [126].  \nIn Australia, residential\
    \ trials include several hundred households in Melbourne, Sydney and the Mid \n\
    North Coast of NSW [72,81,85,127]. Sydney Water’s 18 month trial involving 468\
    \ AMR fitted \nproperties, 161 of which were equipped with a simple in-home display\
    \ (IHD) providing customers \nwith near real time information about their water\
    \ use, found an average reduction of 7%–10% or 16 kL \nper property for example.\
    \ A number of school programs have also involved usage feedback to staff  \nWater\
    \ 2013, 5 \n1067 \n \n \nand students [91,128–130], although the relationship\
    \ between reduced consumption and feedback in  \nthis instance is more complex,\
    \ with savings largely hinged upon effective leak management [66].  \nOne Melbourne\
    \ study, for example, calculated savings of between 10% and 29% as a result of\
    \ the \nintroduction of IM [91]. \nThe provision of more detailed water use information\
    \ to customers is gaining traction, drawing on \ndevelopments in the energy sector\
    \ [131]. Research into electricity use feedback, for example, suggests \na 5%–15%\
    \ reduction in demand is achievable [15]. The US has been particularly active\
    \ within the \nenergy sector and has already adopted some highly developed customer\
    \ feedback methods. For \nexample, Opower, a U.S. software company, has partnered\
    \ with some 75 utilities to create \nindividualised home energy reports for utility\
    \ customers that analyse their energy usage and offer tips \non how to achieve\
    \ cost and energy savings [132]. In late 2012, Opower announced a new partnership\
    \ \nwith an Australian energy retailer to provide households with hourly consumption\
    \ feedback via an \nonline interface [133]. \nAdvancements in mobile computing\
    \ are making it easier for the management of personal and \nhousehold activities,\
    \ which are dependent on the delivery of relevant and useful information, \naccessible\
    \ at the discretion of the individual. The increased availability of this type\
    \ of information in \nconjunction with the emergence of the “internet of things”\
    \ [134] is shifting cultural expectations of the \nconvenience, detail and accessibility\
    \ of consumption information. Such advancements are set to shape \nthe future\
    \ of consumer access to information, a future that will necessarily draw the attention\
    \ of water \nutilities and in doing so, potentially alter the nature of the customer-utility\
    \ relationship. An implicit \nbelief in this scenario, at times unquestioningly,\
    \ is a critical factor underpinning the uptake of IM. \n4.2.4. Pricing Reform\
    \ \nWhilst the elastic range of various end-uses remains the subject of on-going\
    \ deliberation [135–137], \nthe role of water pricing in regulating water consumption\
    \ behaviours is well established. Australian \nelectricity retailers already employ\
    \ time of use tariffs (TOUTs) in their pricing structures and in \nhelping to\
    \ regulate peak demand. IM offers this same potential for the water sector—by\
    \ shifting \nconsumption from peak periods to non-peak periods through information\
    \ access and peak usage \npricing such as TOUTs based on hourly consumption data,\
    \ infrastructure constraints can be avoided \nand infrastructure upsizing can\
    \ be further delayed [58,76]. TOUT regimes can also be used to reduce \npeak day\
    \ and peak month consumptions, thereby further reducing overall demand on supply\
    \ and also \ncontributing to reducing the required network infrastructure to meet\
    \ these peaks [76]. \n4.2.5. Network Efficiency: Leak Management, Illegal Use\
    \ and Asset Management \nNetwork efficiency encompasses a suite of DSM strategies\
    \ targeted at reducing system losses  \n(non-revenue water). Improved leak management\
    \ in homes, the commercial and industrial sector, \nmunicipal buildings (particularly\
    \ schools) and the water supply network is at the core of improving \nnetwork\
    \ efficiency, to which IM for mitigating and reducing losses is essential [42,47,56,93,102,138].\
    \ \nNetwork water losses may vary between 5% and 55% of total supply and is dependent\
    \ on many factors \nsuch as number of connections, geography of the water supply\
    \ network, asset condition and  \nclimate [139]. Sydney Water’s IM trial identified\
    \ leaks in 80% of households, with 10%–17% of \nWater 2013, 5 \n1068 \n \n \n\
    households having a leak at any given time and leakage accounting for 3% of total\
    \ usage [85]. In a \nstudy of leakage in 52 Australian schools equipped with IM,\
    \ the top ten highest consuming schools \nwere found to account for 77% of total\
    \ leakage [66]. Given the significance of leakage, it is not \nsurprising the\
    \ majority of IM deployments reviewed identified leak management as a key justification\
    \ \nfor adopting the technology. \nA related aspect of leak management is pressure\
    \ management. Water pressure can fluctuate with \nreservoir levels and when high,\
    \ the risk of leakage may increase. IM can be employed to help \nunderstand and\
    \ manage network pressure and mitigate leakage. One Australian study found reduced\
    \ \npressure had a positive impact on leaks, with savings of 2 ML/year across\
    \ 141 households from \nreductions in long-term leaks [86]. \nBeyond leak management,\
    \ a number of other elements to network efficiency have been identified. \nFor\
    \ example, the need to better manage and improve response times to issues of non-compliance\
    \ \n(illegal use), particularly during times of water shortage [45,61,140]. Core\
    \ to network efficiency is also \nthe monitoring of asset condition, with IM having\
    \ the ability to provide data on meter performance and \nfailure [45] and broader\
    \ network operations [101]. \n4.2.6. Remote Access \nRemote access to water use\
    \ data was identified as a core objective of many IM deployments, \nparticularly\
    \ in large high density urban centres [88,141]. Remote accessibility attempts\
    \ to address \nissues of inaccessibility, labour costs and occupation health and\
    \ safety risks associated with manual \nmeter reading, and the constraints manual\
    \ reading places on data frequency [45,102]. \n5. Challenges \n5.1. Meeting Water\
    \ Supply-Demand Balance Objectives: The Role of Demand-Side Management \nAs discussed\
    \ earlier, intelligent metering provides an opportunity for water service providers\
    \ to \nmanage the consumption patterns of customers with the view of saving operating\
    \ and capital \nexpenditure, whilst at the same time meeting their supply objectives.\
    \ However, a key barrier to this \nstrategy in areas where drought or population\
    \ growth put focus on water efficiency and demand side \nmanagement programs have\
    \ been implemented (and indeed the role which smart metering could play) \nis\
    \ that water planners often believe that the potential for DSM to achieve further\
    \ savings has reached \npractical limits and therefore supply side options are\
    \ better to pursue. In Australia, for example, a \nnumber of water utilities have\
    \ in the past invested large amounts of money in demand management \nprogrammes\
    \ because of the high costs of bulk water supply, economic benefits of deferring\
    \ large \ncapital works, and notably in some cases due to regulatory requirements.\
    \ In Sydney, the Sydney Water \nCorporation was regulated to reduce demand per\
    \ capita by 25% in 2001 and 35% by 2011 from 1991 \nlevels [29]. However, even\
    \ with a long history of demand side management in Australia, there is \nlimited\
    \ evidence of real long-term commitment as drought eases [142]. Further, the most\
    \ prominent \nlesson from the demand management literature is that programmes\
    \ to encourage DSM activities do not \nguarantee that the desired activities will\
    \ actually take place or be maintained. Many programme plans \nwill assume a high\
    \ uptake of an initiative, when in practice DSM programmes have lower uptake \
    \ \nWater 2013, 5 \n1069 \n \n \nrates [143]. A shift in behaviour patterns is\
    \ difficult irrespective of the level of education, wealth or \nsize of the domestic\
    \ unit. All water saving measures are not applicable to everyone, since their\
    \ \nattitudes towards water differ [144]. Therefore the probability of success\
    \ is a very important \nconsideration in determining the cost effectiveness of\
    \ an intervention. Considerations of customer \nbehaviour, bounce back and tariff\
    \ structures are necessary to make an informed decision. \nA key challenge is\
    \ ensuring that there is benefit for both the utility and the customer. During\
    \ the \nhistorical introduction of water metering of unmetered consumption, both\
    \ utility and customer clearly \nbenefited. For most customers (except the profligate\
    \ users), the result was a reduced bill and for the \nutility much more information\
    \ becomes available for understanding water use, which is essential for \neffective\
    \ future planning. However, it is currently not clear what the benefit to customer\
    \ is with  \nthe introduction of intelligent metering. Unless tariff structures\
    \ change or intelligible feedback \nmechanisms lead to customers becoming more\
    \ aware of their usage and reducing it, the bill may stay \nthe same (or perhaps\
    \ even rise to cover the cost of the technology). Where tariff structures do change\
    \ \n(as in the case of the electricity sector in Victoria, Australia) a mix of\
    \ customers were adversely \naffected, rather than a minority. A potential advantage\
    \ is the ability to have more information about \nwater use patterns in closer\
    \ to real time—is this likely to be perceived as a benefit which all customers\
    \ \nwill appreciate? Certainly identifying leaks early and having them repaired\
    \ before they cost lots of \nmoney would be useful, but more research is required.\
    \ As digital natives become the next generation \nof bill payers the question\
    \ is whether customers will come to expect to be able to access online billing\
    \ \nwith detailed water use information, not unlike online banking allows a detailed\
    \ transaction history. \nNow, enter issues of privacy and use of data. \n5.2.\
    \ Privacy Issues \nThe collection and distribution of user behaviour patterns\
    \ as they relate to water use, will introduce \nthe need for regulations that\
    \ govern the privacy of customer information and data, and the levels of \nthird\
    \ party access permissible. The area of privacy with respect to smart metering\
    \ has been identified \nas needing further attention by Giurco et al. [111]. Whilst\
    \ there may be fewer concerns when the data \nis owned by the utility, one could\
    \ imagine further potential concerns if there data were managed by  \na third\
    \ party. There could also be unintended consequences of giving householders (e.g.,\
    \ in a share \nhouse) access to their own data, which could then be downloaded\
    \ and posted on the internet or social \nmedia (“John has the 30 min shower...”).\
    \ Alternatively water utilities themselves may use the \nintelligent metering\
    \ data to undertake data mining and customer profiling. If water efficiency is\
    \ being \npursued and this leads to reduced revenues, an entrepreneurial chief\
    \ executive may look to augment \nrevenue streams through targeted advertising.\
    \ This could be for items such as garden products for high \ngarden water users,\
    \ beauty products for high shower users, health products for high toilet users,\
    \ \ncleaning products for high clothes washer users. Alternatively, IM data could\
    \ be for services at the \nsuburb or street level, even if household level data\
    \ is not given, for example plumbers could be alerted \nto the fact that this\
    \ area / street has a high prevalence of water leaks and the plumbers may choose\
    \ to \ntarget their advertising in this area or water utility customers may even\
    \ be offered a discount. The use \nof data from intelligent metering will have\
    \ implications for potential data mining business \nopportunities, to the foreseeable\
    \ aversion of some customers. \nWater 2013, 5 \n1070 \n \n \n5.3. Costs and Benefits\
    \ of IM \nWhilst some studies have occurred [54] the full implications of IM are\
    \ not yet fully understood and \nthe cost-benefit ratio for IM is not yet viable\
    \ for large-scale roll-outs. Indeed, the adoption of IM \ntechnologies has been\
    \ relatively slow in the water sector. This is mainly a consequence of the lower\
    \ \nunit cost of water and, until recently, the high costs of the technology.\
    \ It is currently cheaper for \nAustralian water service providers to manually\
    \ read customer water meters, for example [42]. As a \nresult, water consumption\
    \ is generally only read monthly or quarterly and accepted as an accumulation\
    \ \nfor this period. However, water prices and labour costs for meter reading\
    \ are rising whilst costs for \ntechnology and data transfer are coming down which\
    \ will see changes to the cost-benefit equation for \nutilities over the next\
    \ decade. \nImportantly, the cost and benefits (including non-monetary costs and\
    \ benefits) for customers need \nto be carefully elaborated. For example, the\
    \ use of smart meters to manipulate the time of water use by \nconsumers, for\
    \ example, in order to reduce peak demand has the potential to alter social norms\
    \ \nregarding water use (e.g., time of showering, irrigation and clothes washing).\
    \ \n5.4. Ownership \nRegulations will be needed that cover the rights of the customer\
    \ as well the utility, specifically \naround issues of ownership of the assets\
    \ and associated data. Regulators will need to consider the \nmerits of passing\
    \ the costs of the intelligent metering onto the customer or whether it is viewed\
    \ as an \ninvestment that results in efficiency gains that therefore make the\
    \ business case viable. Currently in \nAustralia, water service providers often\
    \ purchase water meters outright, which an employee or \ncontractor will be required\
    \ to read. If intelligent metering is introduced, the setup may involve logging\
    \ \nequipment (one company) and then a telecommunications provider to transfer\
    \ the data (second \ncompany). A third party may also be involved in the storage\
    \ and/or processing of data, whilst a fourth \nmay be may assist in targeted advertising,\
    \ as noted above. The transaction costs of dealing with \nmultiple parties—especially\
    \ when things go wrong for the customer—become more involved and may \nrequire\
    \ more specialised skills sets to undertake repairs. \n5.5. Technology Challenges\
    \ \nIntelligent metering networks would require the ability to transfer thousands\
    \ of data packets per \nday. Whilst these transmission networks are available,\
    \ issues with respect to wireless network \nreliability, black spots, power source\
    \ and battery life, damage by users, water proofing, cross \nconnections, to name\
    \ a few, could pose reliability problems [63,66,112]. To a large extent, the \n\
    reliability of the technology and communication between the various components\
    \ has been addressed, \nhowever there is a point of distinction between using\
    \ mobile telephone frequencies versus unlicensed \nradio frequencies and the long\
    \ term stability of both systems differs, as does data security. \nThe key obstacle\
    \ from a technological perspective is the relative cost in comparison to the do\
    \ \nnothing approach. This is likely to change in the future as other customer\
    \ services (electricity, gas, \ntelephone, broadband, etc.) see value in higher\
    \ resolution data, the pooling of resources may see these \ncosts come down. This\
    \ is however, also linked to the effectiveness of the intelligent metering to\
    \ save \nWater 2013, 5 \n1071 \n \n \nboth water service providers and customers\
    \ money in order for the business case to stack up. Further \nresearch in this\
    \ field is also required as discussed above. \n5.6. Data Management \nInformation\
    \ systems that can store and manage large volumes of data do not pose as much\
    \ of \nproblem as does the question of what water service providers will do with\
    \ all this data. Representative \nsamples are sufficient for infrastructure planning\
    \ purposes and trend analysis. The challenge for water \nservice providers is\
    \ to be clear what data is needed for operational and planning requirements, and\
    \ to \nelicit from customers what type and frequency of information is best suited\
    \ for their needs. Based on \nthis the appropriate storage and management processes\
    \ can be designed. \n5.7. Data Analysis and Reporting \nThe development of automated\
    \ reporting tools that utilise the processed data to create tailored \nreports\
    \ at the request of the water service provider and/or customer on issues such\
    \ as peak hourly \nconsumption, end-uses, or comparative analysis, is still at\
    \ the formative stage. \nAutomated and reliable processing of flows into end use\
    \ data categories require further \ndevelopment. Pattern matching algorithms need\
    \ to be written and tested to achieve highly accurate \ncategorisation. This is\
    \ the most critical challenge requiring urgent research attention as the current\
    \ \napproach to water end use analysis requires time consuming manual processing\
    \ [112]. \n5.8. Customer Buy in \nFollowing on from the previous point, for DSM\
    \ to be successful and for customers to utilise the \ninformation, customer buy-in\
    \ is imperative. A core obstacle to IM uptake is consumer back-lash as a \nresult\
    \ of misinformation and concerns of privacy, health and costs. The extent of public\
    \ unease is \nreflected in the rise of community “anti-smart meter” groups in\
    \ the UK, the U.S. and Australia, be they \nfor electricity or water [145,146].\
    \ Issues featured on these websites related to cost, privacy and health \neffects\
    \ from electromagnetic radiation. Public engagement is thus a critical element\
    \ of successful IM \nadoption. Customer benefits need to be clearly articulated\
    \ and information platforms should cater for \nthe vast majority of customer preferences\
    \ if successful uptake is to achieved. Water service providers \nmust take heed\
    \ of a fast-changing landscape of personal and mobile communications technologies\
    \ \n(e.g., the rise of smart phones), whilst concurrently negotiating the role\
    \ of traditional modes of \ncommunication pathways (such as postal quarterly bills).\
    \ Customer preferences vary from region to \nregion and therefore, customer preference\
    \ and information needs surveys should be undertaken for \neach proposed implementation.\
    \ The concept of “social license in design” [147], which has been \napplied in\
    \ heavy industry to anticipate social issues associated with the development and\
    \ deployment \nof disruptive technology and revising the technology design to\
    \ overcome them, may also be helpful to \naddress the future social challenges\
    \ and opportunities of the IM technologies. \n \n \nWater 2013, 5 \n1072 \n \n\
    \ \n5.9. Technical Capacity \nIntelligent metering will increase the diverse training\
    \ and education requirements of utilities, \nspecifically the up-skilling of the\
    \ maintenance staff with regard to this new electronic and \ntechnological field.\
    \ The review of literature to date shows that few of these fields have been \n\
    comprehensively analysed. We therefore conclude with an exploration of future\
    \ opportunities and a \nresearch agenda to guide intelligent metering to hold\
    \ a useful place in SUWM. \n6. Conclusions \nIntelligent metering should not be\
    \ viewed as an end in itself, but has the potential to meet supply and \nend-use\
    \ information needs, which in turn can satisfy sustainable urban water management\
    \ objectives. \nMore detailed, more frequent and more accessible data opens up\
    \ the potential to support SUWM. \nThe higher resolutions offered by IM allows\
    \ for water use to be interpreted in terms of end-use, that is, \nthe water consumed\
    \ by a particular appliance for a specific activity. End-use detail is critical\
    \ to \nrefining demand forecasting models and in identifying opportunities for\
    \ improving efficiency [148]. \nWhilst offering greater flexibility, improved\
    \ resolution and higher frequencies of data collection  \nand communication present\
    \ new and complex challenges for the water sector, in particular, data \nmanagement,\
    \ interpretation and analysis requirements. The issue of data privacy is also\
    \ of mounting \ncontention and one that will demand the attention of utilities\
    \ and regulators. \nThere appears to also be some incentive for technology vendors\
    \ to drive the use of smart metering. \nBesides the obvious drive for technology\
    \ vendors to capture a portion of the market in this field and \nfurther improve\
    \ their product through monitoring the effectiveness and user needs based on real-time\
    \ \nfield trials, vendors may see some future business potential in gaining customer\
    \ profiles and usage \npatterns in a world hungry for potential market information.\
    \ \nConsequently, it can be concluded that intelligent metering will be a larger\
    \ and more influential \npresence in the urban water sector over the coming decade\
    \ than it is presently. The challenge is to \nensure that its broad scale introduction\
    \ occurs with a focus on the needs of both customers and utilities \nand that,\
    \ in the longer term, public good must prevail over shorter term profits for vendors\
    \ of \ntechnology and data. \nAcknowledgments \nThis research has been supported\

    Abstract The data science technologies of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet
    of Things (IoT), big data and behavioral/predictive analytics, and blockchain
    are poised to revolutionize government and create a new generation of GovTech
    start-ups. The impact from the ‘smartification’ of public services and the national
    infrastructure will be much more significant in comparison to any other sector
    given government’s function and importance to every institution and individual.
    Potential GovTech systems include Chatbots and intelligent assistants for public
    engagement, Robo-advisors to support civil servants, real-time management of the
    national infrastructure using IoT and blockchain, automated compliance/regulation,
    public records securely stored in blockchain distributed ledgers, online judicial
    and dispute resolution systems, and laws/statutes encoded as blockchain smart
    contracts. Government is potentially the major ‘client’ and also ‘public champion’
    for these new data technologies. This review paper uses our simple taxonomy of
    government services to provide an overview of data science automation being deployed
    by governments world-wide. The goal of this review paper is to encourage the Computer
    Science community to engage with government to develop these new systems to transform
    public services and support the work of civil servants. Issue Section: Section
    C: Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Analytics 1. INTRODUCTION
    The data science ‘tsunami’ led by multinational companies like Amazon, Google,
    Facebook, Uber, Alibaba, Tencent, etc. is radically changing how we work and socialize,
    and is disrupting employment. The disruption caused by the key technologies—namely
    artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, behavioral/predictive
    analytics and blockchain technologies—offers the greatest potential in the public
    sector to transform the way governments engage with citizens, make policy-decisions
    and manage the national infrastructure. Sophisticated data and analytics infrastructures,
    when combined with trusted record keeping concepts such as blockchain distributed
    ledger and smart contract technologies, may provide a feasible framework to redefine
    public services in a decentralized, lower cost, more efficient and personalized
    manner. Many governments have established digital government or eGovernment programs
    to introduce data science technologies into the public sector [1, 2]. Leading
    examples include Estonia, Singapore and the UK [3–5]; however, most comprise individual
    AI or blockchain projects. Arguably the most comprehensive program is Estonia’s
    e-Estonia (e-estonia.com) infrastructure where every citizen has a digital identity,
    digital signature and personal record, and virtually all government services are
    digital and online [6]. Estonia’s latest initiative is e-Residency [7]; a transnational
    digital identity that anyone in the world can apply for to obtain access to a
    platform built on inclusion, legitimacy and transparency. E-residents then have
    access to the EU business environment and can use public e-services through their
    digital identity. Data science technologies pioneered in the private sector are
    ripe for transforming the public sector [8–13]. Applications can include public
    engagement through natural language text and speech Chatbots [13] and intelligent
    assistants [14]; support of civil servants via AI-based Robo-advisors [15]; securing
    public records using blockchain distributed ledgers [16]; and encoding and codifying
    laws using blockchain smart contracts [17]. Further application areas may include
    using big data and behavioral/predictive analytics for public policy development;
    automating the courts using AI-based judicial systems and online dispute resolution;
    and managing the national infrastructure in real-time using the Internet-of-Things
    technology. As the basis for discussion of public sector automation, we use a
    simple taxonomy of government (see Fig. 1) as follows: Public Services—interaction
    with and delivery of service to citizens; answering enquiries, automating services,
    election processes, etc. Supporting Civil Servants—intelligent tools to support
    civil servants; Robo-advisors for civil servants, case management, impact / performance
    monitoring. National Public Records—maintaining public records and correspondence;
    forms & submissions, correspondences, personal/citizen data. National Physical
    Infrastructure—maintaining and operating the public infrastructure; smart environments,
    Infrastructure planning, transport/communication/environment/health/education/security.
    Statutes & Compliance—maintaining laws and statutes, and managing courts, judiciary,
    police, etc.; laws & statutes (codifying, verifying, simulating), trials & prosecution,
    dispute resolution. Public Policy Development—developing public policy, supporting
    civil servants and politicians; evidence base (data, experts, public opinion),
    Robo-advisors for policy makers. Figure 1. Open in new tabDownload slide Automation
    of government services. Although we mainly focus on the technological automation
    of the public sector in this paper, further cross-sector disussions should also
    be undertaken to consider other major societal dimensions in relation to the way
    citizens engage with government. More qualitative and technological work around
    the issues of the fairness, transparency, privacy and accountability would be
    complementary to build comprehensive systems in the public policy space [18, 19].
    2. DATA SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGIES In transforming government, important new data
    technologies include Government Data Facilities—online facilities of public data
    collected by national and local governments, and often open for public access
    and analysis (e.g. www.data.gov, https://data.gov.uk). Internet of Things (IoT)—is
    the inter-networking of ‘smart’ physical devices, vehicles, buildings, etc. that
    enable these objects to collect and exchange data. Artificial Intelligence (AI)—systems
    able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. Big Data—are the
    process of examining very large data sets to uncover hidden patterns, unknown
    correlations, etc.; data sets that are so complex that traditional data processing
    application software is inadequate to deal with them. Behavioral/Predictive Analytics—the
    analysis of large and varied data sets to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    customer preferences, etc. to help make informed decisions. Blockchain Technologies—technology
    underpinning digital currency, that secures, validates and processes transactional
    data. In the following sections, we explore these technologies in more detail.
    2.1. Government data facilities The open-source and open data movements [20, 21]
    across the globe encourage governments to make their data available through online
    platforms such as www.data.gov, www.data.gov.uk and www.data.europa.eu [22]. Governments
    providing the infrastructure to access, use and share data are a major driver
    of innovation in the public sector [23]. A good exemplar is the popular transport
    app, Citymapper (https://citymapper.com/), initially built from the open data
    provided by the Transport for London [24]. Open data platforms also serve as mediums
    to increase citizen engagement and transparency, and facilitate collaborative
    practices of the public sector with commercial and non-profit stakeholders. The
    government data landscape is defined by a range of sources including official
    records and statistics; secondary data obtained through administrative operations
    from front-end services; user-generated data often in the form of web content
    such as blogs, chats, tweets and videos; sensory data gathered by connected people
    and devices; tracking data such as CCTV, GPS or traffic data, or satellite and
    aerial imagery; and transaction data from shopping or banking records etc. Other
    categorizations can be made based on whether it is geospatial, economic, demographic
    or other statistical data; or whether it is real-time or historical data; or by
    the formats of data such as text, numerical, network, image and video. If the
    data provided from government departments and agencies, public bodies and local
    authorities can further be expanded with other commercial or non-profit data sources,
    it provides countless opportunities for economic, political, scientific and social
    innovation [25]. 2.2. Internet of Things (IoT) IoT provides a unique opportunity
    for government to interconnect and dynamically manage the public infrastructure.
    Essentially, any device with an on/off switch will have an identifier, communicate
    and be managed by ‘intelligent’ software. This involves not only real-time monitoring
    and control but also maintaining the infrastructure without human intervention.
    Two important developments related to IoT and managing the public infrastructure
    are the following: Building Information Modeling (BIM)—BIM [26] is a shared knowledge
    resource or model for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for
    decisions during its life-cycle; defined as existing from earliest conception
    to demolition. Besides supporting Computer Aided Design (CAD) during construction
    or refurbishment, the digital model will also be used to manage the facility or
    infrastructure in real-time using the IoT resources. Blockchain Smart Contracts—is
    a computer program that directly controls a transaction or an IoT device. Elements
    of blockchain technology originally conceived for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    are now recognized to have far-reaching potential in other areas, including IoT
    [27]. 2.3. Artificial intelligence technologies AI technologies power intelligent
    personal assistants, such as Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa [28], ‘Robo’ advisors [15,
    29] and autonomous vehicles. AI provides computers with the ability to make decisions
    and learn without explicit programming. There are two main branches: Knowledge-based
    systems (KBS)—are computer programs that reason, and knowledge is explicitly represented
    as ontologies or rules rather than implicitly via code. KBS can be subdivided
    into o Rule-based systems—is one whose knowledge base contains the domain knowledge
    coded in the form of event-condition-action, such as using IF-THEN or IF-THEN-ELSE
    rules. o Case-based reasoning—a form of the so-called expert systems that base
    decision-making on prior case experience, instead of on a pre-defined rule set.
    Machine Learning—is a type of AI program with the ability to learn without explicit
    programming, and can change when exposed to new data. Subdivisions include o Supervised
    learning—is the task of inferring a function from labeled training data, where
    training data consist of a set of training examples. o Unsupervised learning—is
    the task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled data.
    Other AI technologies important for government-citizen interaction are natural
    language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis: Natural language understanding—the
    application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural
    language and speech [30]. Sentiment analysis—the process of computationally identifying
    and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text [31]. These technologies
    are important for applications such as monitoring public opinion, policy and fraud
    detection. Recent implementations with social implications are covered in [32,
    33]. 2.4. Big data Government, as discussed, collects huge volumes of data (increasingly
    published as open data) and thus has major opportunities for the so-called big
    data (analytics). In general, big data provide the opportunity of examining large
    and varied data sets to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, customer
    preferences, etc. Big data encompass a mix of structured, semi-structured and
    unstructured data gathered formally through interactions with citizens, social
    media content, text from citizens’ emails and survey responses, phone call data
    and records, data captured by sensors connected to the Internet-of-things and
    so on. The notion of ‘big data’ is both increasing in volume, variety of data
    being generated by organizations and the velocity at which that data are being
    created and updated; referred to as the 3Vs of big data [34]. More recent literature
    provide alternative descriptions adding other features such as veracity, value,
    complexity and unstructuredness and a comprehensive review is provided in [35].
    Big data encompasses a number of associated technologies: Big data lakes—a ‘data
    lake’ is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native
    format until it is needed [36]. Cloud computing—the practice of using a network
    of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process data, rather
    than a local server or a personal computer [37]. Unstructured data & NoSQL databases—refers
    to information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized
    in a pre-defined manner; an NoSQL database is a mechanism for storage and retrieval
    of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational
    databases [38]. Hadoop—an open source, Java-based programming framework that supports
    the processing and storage of extremely large data sets in a distributed computing
    environment [39]. In-memory analytics—the queries and data reside in the server’s
    random access memory (RAM), so increasing the speed, performance and reliability
    [40]. 2.5. Behavioral and predictive analytics Closely related to big data is
    behavioral and predictive analytics that focuses on providing insight into the
    actions of people [41]. Behavioral analytics centers on understanding how consumers
    act and why, enabling predictions about how they are likely to act in the future.
    It enables providers in the private or public sector to make the right responses
    to the right consumer segments at the right time. Mainstream private sector uses
    are in eCommerce platforms, online games, web and mobile applications, and the
    IoT. Predictive analytics is the practice of extracting information from historical
    and real-time data sets to determine patterns and predict future outcomes and
    trends. Predictive analytics ‘forecasts’ what might happen in the future with
    an acceptable level of reliability, and includes what-if scenarios and risk assessment.
    The defining function is the predictive score (probability) for an agent (individual,
    vehicle, machine, orgnizational unit, etc.) to aid with decision making in complex
    organizational processes. A representative example would be ‘credit scoring’ in
    financial services which uses customer’s credit history and current data to rank
    their likelihood of future credit payments on time. These technologies also show
    significant potential to aid decisions in government operations including law
    enforcement. 2.6. Blockchain technologies Elements of blockchain technology, as
    discussed, originally conceived for Bitcoin are now recognized to have far-reaching
    potential in other areas, especially for government. The core technologies are
    Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)—a decentralized database where transactions
    are kept in a shared, replicated, synchronized, distributed bookkeeping record,
    which is secured by cryptographic sealing. The key distinction between ‘distributed
    ledgers’ and ‘distributed databases’ is that nodes of the distributed ledger cannot/do
    not trust other nodes—and so must independently verify transactions before applying
    them. Smart Contracts—are simply the rules, possibly computer programs, that attempt
    to codify transactions and contracts with the intent that the records managed
    by the distributed ledger are authoritative with respect to the existence, status
    and evolution of the underlying legal agreements they represent. Smart contract
    technology can automate transactions, such as supply chains, and have the potential
    to automate laws and statutes. Governments are increasingly launching projects
    that apply blockchain technologies to transform regularatory compliance, contract
    management, identity management and government records [42, 43]. Other potential
    uses in facilitating elections and direct democracy models are also covered in
    recent literature [44, 45]. We now look at the major areas for Algorithmic Government
    outlined in Fig. 1. 3. PUBLIC SERVICES Here we define ‘public services’ as interaction
    with and delivery of services to the general public. Broadly technologies supporting:
    (a) comprehensive digital government services; but also (b) using intelligent
    virtual assistants to answer questions; (c) automated form filling and registration;
    (d) automated payments from and to citizens; (e) gathering public opinion to drive
    policy; (f) citizen-to-citizen community engagement; (g) detecting abuse of public
    services and fraud; etc. 3.1. Overview A question that might be asked: ‘if Amazon
    or Google were automating public services, how would the services operate?’ Probably
    the first thing would be to create a digital identity, digital signature and personal
    citizen record for every citizen, and a government portal for access. With these
    requirements in place, when a citizen interacts with any service the civil servant
    would be able to handle multiple enquiries and service functions. As discussed,
    a pioneering role model is Estonia’s digital government e-Estonia. 3.2. GovTech
    exemplars Most developed countries are investing in digital government services,
    they include Singapore’s SingPass single sign-on system (https://www.singpass.gov.sg/)
    providing access to an holist range of government services, such as a citizen’s
    electronic health record; the UK’s ‘digital by default’ strategy [46]; Germany’s
    Bundesagentur für Arbeit (https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/), virtual labor market
    platform to reintegrate jobseekers into the labor market; Korea’s KONEPS online
    e-procurement system (http://www.pps.go.kr/) consolidating 120 government procurement
    systems; India’s Aadhaar (https://uidai.gov.in/) unique identity card; Norway’s
    Offentlig Elektroiisk Postjournal (https://www.oep.no/) electronic public record
    system, a portal for all citizen documents; Saudi Arabia SADAD (https://www.sadad.com/)
    digital payment system; and Dubai’s Smart Dubai (http://www.smartdubai.ae/) initiative.
    The US Department of Homeland Security uses a virtual assistant, Emma (https://www.uscis.gov/emma),
    to respond to citizen enquiries. In response to this global push for digital government
    services, a growing number of GovTech start-ups are emerging. Support for these
    start-ups includes specialist GovTech funders (http://govtechfund.com/), GovTech
    associations (http://govtechalliance.org/) and meet-ups, such as Angelhack’s GovTech
    hackathons called Code 4 Coexistence. 3.3. Case study As discussed, Estonia’s
    e-Estonia [10] is an ideal case study of a comprehensive move to digital government
    or eGovernment. When Estonia regained its independence in 1991, less than half
    its population had a telephone line. Two decades later, it is a world leader in
    technology. Estonian geeks developed the code behind Skype and Kazaa (an early
    file-sharing network). In 2007, it became the first country to allow online voting
    in a general election. It has among the world’s fastest broadband speeds and holds
    the record for start-ups per person. Its 1.3 m citizens interact with government
    services (universally) online; pay for parking spaces with their mobile phones
    and have their health records stored in the digital cloud. Filing an annual tax
    return online, as 95% of Estonians do, takes about 3 min. The key infrastructure
    components are a citizen’s e-Identity and the e-Services portal. 4. SUPPORTING
    CIVIL SERVANTS ‘Public Services’ discussed above centered on engagement with citizens
    through a digital identity, personal record and a government portal. Now we look
    at support for civil servants, in particular professional Robo-advisors. 4.1.
    Overview With regard to supporting civil servants, two key technologies are domain-specific
    Robo-advisors to support professional work and IoT for real-time management of
    the national infrastructure. Currently, Robo-advisors almost exclusively focused
    on financial investment and asset management advice. ‘Financial’ Robo-advisors
    illustrate possible support for civil servants: Account aggregation—these provide
    a unified view from the Robo-advisor of client’s (banking, trust and brokerage)
    accounts through a single sign-on via Web and mobile. In the Public Sector, a
    citizen might receive unified advice on benefits (e.g. tax credits, disability
    allowances, retirement, energy efficiency), services (e.g. health checks, housing),
    registrations (e.g. voting, parking permits), etc. Auto investing—again with finance,
    clients want the option to automatically transfer a set amount or percentage from
    their savings or bank account into their investing account and have it automatically
    invested. In the Public Sector, a citizen might have the option to automatically
    transfer a set amount to their pension, or to a charity, etc. or receive pension
    planning and saving advice. Consult an advisor—another feature for financial clients
    is the ability to consult (cf. triage) a human advisor about their investment
    approach and other financial matters. In the Public Sector, a citizen might consult
    a Robo-advisor which passes the query to a human advisor when specialist help
    is required. The lesson from finance is that digital advice services are not a
    ‘one-size fits all’ model; there are benefits to develop hybrid models that combine
    the best of AI ‘high-tech’ and human ‘high-touch’. 4.2. GovTech exemplars Clearly
    the line between systems providing Public Services and Support for Civil Servants
    is blurred. An example is SGT STAR (https://www.goarmy.com/ask-sgt-star.html)
    used by the US Army to improve the efficiency of their recruitment process [47].
    Other potential systems to support Civil Servants might include detection of abuse
    and fraud. Govtech Solutions (www.govtechsolutions.co.uk) is an exemplar company
    which offers two products: webCapture that transforms content from online self-service
    web forms using a fully automated process, which validates the data and updates
    your back office; and eCapture that converts content from paper form images, PDFs
    and structured emails into a format for a back office system, and also automatically
    checks claims. 4.3. Case study An unusual example is ‘Legal robots’ being deployed
    on thousands of cases in China to help decide sentencing. The robots—which are
    about three feet tall and have heads shaped like toasters—review documents and
    identify problems with cases. They also advise on sentencing, and can generate
    arrest warrants and ‘approve indictments’, said prosecutors in the eastern province
    of Jiangsu, where the robots are being piloted. A ‘case management’ legal robot
    named Wu Xiaolu, who worked with prosecutors in Suzhou Credit: Jiangsu Province
    People’s Procuratorate. Almost 15 000 legal cases have been reviewed by the robots
    since they were deployed last September. 5. PUBLIC RECORDS Although blockchain
    is currently being driven by financial service, in the long term, the impact will
    be even greater in government for securing public records and managing the national
    infrastructure. As the blockchain-based public services are scaled and updated
    continuously, data emerging from such services will also be aggregated as an additional
    source of ‘open data’ that governments are increasingly offering to their citizens.
    5.1. Overview Blockchain offers a new approach to enhancing transparency and collaboration
    between governments, business and citizens [48]. The key blockchain attributes
    for securing records are (a) Resilience—blockchains operate as decentralized networks
    as opposed to a central server with a single point of failure; (b) Integrity—blockchains
    operate using distributed open-source protocols removing the need to trust a third
    party for execution; (c) Transparency—public blockchains have inherent transparency
    features, since all changes are visible by all parties; and (d) Unchangeable—records
    in a distributed public blockchain are largely ‘immutable’, allowing applications
    and users to operate with a good degree of confidence. Here two important issues
    are Permissioned blockchain—a private or permissioned blockchain only allows known
    nodes to participate in the network. Typically, it is internal to an organization,
    such as a bank, or consortium of organizations. Permissionless blockchain—an open,
    unpermissioned, or public, blockchain network and allows any node to participate
    in the network. 5.2. GovTech exemplars There are a growing number of exemplars
    that integrate public records and provide citizens with a consolidated personal
    record, utilizing digital blockchain technologies. Examples include [49] the UK
    for payment of Welfare benefits [50]; Georgia’s use for land titles; Singapore
    where each citizen has a personal healthcare record; and Delaware storing business
    documents in a single location. For example, the government of Georgia uses blockchain
    to register land titles and validate property-related government transactions.
    A custom-designed blockchain system has been integrated into the digital records
    system of the National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR), and anchored to the Bitcoin
    blockchain through a distributed digital timestamping service. The digital timestamping
    service allows the government to verify and sign a document containing a citizen’s
    essential information and proof of ownership of property. The system will boost
    land title transparency, reduce the prevalence of fraud, and bring significant
    time and cost savings in the registration process. 5.3. Case study The Dubai government
    has launched Smart Dubai (www.smartdubai.ae/) with the goal to conduct a majority
    of the emirate’s business using blockchain, which it expects will make government
    services more efficient and help promote enterprise in Dubai as it will become
    easier to do business there. Dubai has set up the Global Blockchain Council to
    explore current and future blockchain applications. The council currently consists
    of 47 members from both the public and the private sector and launched seven blockchain
    proofs-of-concept trails, covering health records, diamond trade, title transfer,
    business registration, digital wills, tourism engagement and shipping. The Dubai
    government has partnered with IBM to trial the use of blockchain for a trade and
    logistics solution. The solution transmits shipment data, allowing key stakeholders
    to receive real-time information about the state of goods and the status of the
    shipment, and replaces paper-based contracts with smart contracts. 6. NATIONAL
    PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE Potentially the biggest impact for managing the national
    infrastructure is the unification of Smart Cities, Building Information Modeling
    (BIM), IoT and Blockchain. A Smart city is an urban development vision to integrate
    information and communication technology (ICT) and IoT technology in a secure
    fashion to manage a city’s assets. These assets include local departments’ information
    systems, schools, libraries, transportation systems, hospitals, power plants,
    water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement and other community services
    [51]. At the next level that of individual facilities, BIM will provide a digital
    model of the facilities and infrastructure available for modeling and management;
    and IoT will provide intelligent communication with every device; literally with
    an on/off switch. Finally, blockchain distributed ledger technology will secure
    the information; and blockchain smart contract programs will operate the system.
    6.1. Overview National and local physical infrastructure is being driven by smart
    cities at the urban level and BIM at the facilities level with IoT and blockchain
    providing the IT infrastructure. A smart city [52] uses urban informatics and
    technology to improve the efficiency of services. ICT allows city officials to
    interact directly with the community and the city infrastructure and to monitor
    what is happening in the city, how the city is evolving, and how to enable a better
    quality of life. Through the use of sensors integrated with real-time monitoring
    systems, data are collected from citizens and devices—then processed and analyzed.
    The information and knowledge gathered are keys to tackling inefficiency. The
    World Smart Cities Community (www.worldsmartcity.org) is a community of city professionals
    exploring the most important factors that hinder the broad roll out-of Smart Cities
    today. 6.2. GovTech exemplars Examples of Smart City technologies and programs
    have been implemented in Milton Keynes, Southampton, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid,
    Stockholm and in China [53]. In NY, data analysis predicts which buildings are
    most likely to have a fire, enabling fire safety inspections to be prioritized.
    In Seoul, mobile phone and geospatial data are used to provide a night bus service
    to a city of 10 m people with just 30 vehicles. The marketplace of the European
    Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC) (https://eu-smartcities.eu/)
    is a platform to drive transition of the European public infrastructures towards
    a low carbon, resource efficient and competitive economy. The 11 Priority Areas
    which have been set up so far to develop smarter cities are Sustainable Urban
    Mobility, Sustainable Districts and Built Environment, Integrated Infrastructures
    and processes across Energy, ICT and Transport, Citizen focus, Policy and Regulation,
    Integrated Planning & management, Knowledge Sharing, Baselines, Performance Indicators
    and Metrics, Open data governance, Standards, Business Models, Procurement and
    Funding. 6.3. Case study Barcelona was named European Capital of Innovation in
    2014 by the EU and hosts the annual Smart City Expo World Congress [54]. It has
    more than 100 active smart city projects ranging from smart traffic lights, telecare
    services and electric cars to ubiquitous public Wi-Fi. Barcelona’s smart city
    platform, known as the Urban Platform, brings together data from the open-source
    Sentilo sensor network, the city’s information systems, as well as social networks
    and web 2.0, allowing it to solve urban challenges across silos. These include
    the sustainable and computerized management of infrastructure, garbage collection
    and recycling, and public spaces and green areas, among others. Smart LED streetlamps
    activate only when movement is detected, producing 30% energy savings, and are
    equipped with sensors to collect data from the environment. Over 70 000 elderly
    and disabled are connected to the city’s Telecare service that proactively checks
    on residents. Sensors monitor rain and humidity to determine how much water is
    needed to irrigate parks. Municipal smart bins monitor waste levels and are cleared
    only when they are full, optimizing waste collection operations. Digital bus stops
    provide bus arrival times, free Wi-Fi and USB charging ports, while a smart parking
    system guides vehicles to available parking spaces, reducing congestion and emissions.
    7. GOVERNMENT LAWS, STATUTES AND COMPLIANCE Government judiciary, legal services,
    regulators and law firms are entering a period of major disruption caused by new
    legal technologies (LawTech). In the Public Sector, an example is ‘digital’ courts,
    such as using automated online dispute resolution (ODR—https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/),
    and Regulators automating online compliance and regulation. The goal is to use
    LawTech (https://law-tech-a2j.org/) to fully automate and interlink the judiciary,
    court and legal practices. 7.1. Overview Online dispute resolution has traditionally
    been used for consumer ODR to facilitate the resolution of disputes between e-commerce
    parties, typically online suppliers and consumers. The best-known private consumer
    ODR service is eBay, which resolves 60 million disagreements every year. eBay
    offers two services: a free web-based forum which allows users to attempt to resolve
    their differences on their own or if necessary, the use of a professional (human)
    mediator. In the public sector, the EU consumer ODR Platform is a web-based platform
    developed by the European Commission to help consumers and traders resolve their
    contractual disputes about online purchases of goods and services out-of-court
    at a low cost in a simple and fast way. In the private sector, online ‘judicial’
    services and commercial example services include (a) VirtualCourtHouse—disputing
    parties can choose from a directory listing over 300 neutrals, ranging from family
    mediators to construction arbitrators, and retired judges, who mediate the dispute
    or render an arbitral award (www.virtualcourthouse.com); and (b) SmartSettle—applies
    techniques from game theory to resolve disputes. It uses six processes, supported
    by a facilitator: (a) the process is explained and parties agree to the guidelines,
    (b) parties identify interests in dispute, (c) the demand and value are rated
    by both parties, (d) software proposes settlement, (e) software optimizes settlement
    based on negotiation and (f) the parties sign the framework agreement (www.smartsettle.com).
    7.2. GovTech exemplars In the public sector, examples include (a) Money Claim
    Online (MCOL)—is the UK HM Courts & Tribunals Service Internet-based service for
    claimants and defendants; and (b) Rechtwijzer 2.0—Rechtwijzer (Netherlands)/MyLawBC
    (British Columbia) is an ODR system for divorce and separation, landlord-tenant
    disputes and employment disputes etc. 7.3. Case study A prominent exemplar in
    the public sector is the European Union (EU) Consumer ODR Platform the interactive
    website offering a single point of entry to consumers and traders seeking to resolve
    disputes out-of-court that have arisen from online transactions, allowing consumers
    and traders to submit complaints by filling in an electronic complaint form and
    to attaching relevant documents, transmit complaints to an ADR entity competent
    to deal with the dispute concerned, and offer an electronic case management tool.
    8. PUBLIC POLICY DEVELOPMENT New technologies provide powerful tools for future
    policy development and modeling. Public policy spans areas such as (a) online
    monitoring of public opinion; (b) community partition in policy development; and
    (c) modeling proposed policies and statutes. 8.1. Overview We are entering a new
    era of technology-enabled policy development: Monitoring public opinion—online
    and social media are increasingly being ‘scraped’ and sentiment analysis used
    in the public sector to monitor public opinion and also the impact of laws and
    regulation. Community participation—another major paradigm is the engagement with
    the general public through online voting, referenda, petitions, blogs and forums
    in policy development. Policy modeling—complex systems technologies, such as Agent-based
    systems, can be used to model policy before deployment. 8.2. GovTech exemplars
    Current efforts to enable citizens’ engagement have led to a plethora of tools
    and platforms, with a growing number of pervasive technologies [55]. Several tools
    and platforms have been developed to communicate with, integrate and empower citizens.
    The aim of these platforms is to encourage and facilitate partnerships between
    citizens and civic authorities, enabling individuals to play a greater role. For
    instance Civic Lab (www.civiclab.us) performed over 2 years as a co-working space
    in Chicago. This space served as a meeting place, hub and educational facility.
    Other platforms such as Neighborland (https://neighborland.com), Citizinvestor
    (www.citizinvestor.com) and CitySourced (www.citysourced.com) were designed to
    report and share citizens’ ideas and issues and to keep citizens in the loop of
    what was being done about the issues reported. Some projects focused on transparency
    as a key to engage citizens, for instance, the Sunlight foundation (www.sunlightlabs.com)
    makes use of the tools of civic tech, open data, policy analysis and journalism
    to make their government and politics transparent to all. Some other projects
    focused on involving citizen in voting, such as Citizinvestor (https://angel.co/citizinvestor),
    Civinomics (https://civinomics.com/) or PeakDemocracy (www.peakdemocracy.co),
    where citizens and officials are involved in the discussions. In their work, EngagementHQ
    (http://engagementhq.com/) drew a spectrum to represent the means through which
    citizens can be informed and civic engagement can be triggered. EngagementHQ is
    a digital engagement solution to help share stories, gather community feedback
    and analyze stakeholder needs. Another interesting example is the Northern Bridge
    public policy engagement toolkit (http://toolkit.northernbridge.ac.uk/), which
    introduces arts and humanities researchers to the public policy development processes.
    8.3. Case study Indonesia provides a policy development case study. Each year,
    forest and peatland fires spread across Kalimantan and Sumatra, mostly due to
    peatland drainage and the conversion of land to palm oil cultivation. Besides
    the damage caused to biodiversity and the ecosystems, according to UN Global Pulse,
    over 10 million people in Southeast Asia are affected by haze. Indonesian forest
    and peat fires in 1997—1998 were estimated to have caused over US$4.5 billion
    in damage, mostly health-related, across the region [56]. UN Pulse Lab Jakarta
    has developed ‘Haze Gazer’ [57] a web-based crisis analysis and visualization
    system which harnesses multiple sources of data including open data (fire hotspot
    information from satellites and baseline information on population density and
    distribution), citizen-generated data (the national complaint system in Indonesia
    called LAPOR; citizen journalism video uploads to an online news channel) and
    real-time big data (text-, image- and video-oriented social media), to provide
    insights on haze disaster dynamics for disaster management authorities. The platform
    offers real-time insights on the response strategies of haze-affected populations,
    informs longer term development interventions by capturing insights on health-related
    concerns and issues and enhances the existing functionalities of the current system
    used by the Indonesian disaster management authorities by adding new functions
    and insights based on multiple new digital data sources. 9. CHALLENGES AND PUBLIC
    DEBATE In parallel to the public sector opportunities reviewed in this paper,
    these digital transformations also come with a number of political challenges
    and public unease. The ownership and stewardship of data is increasingly becoming
    a public concern [58], especially given the recent major data breaches including
    the alleged case of Cambridge Analytica harvesting 87 Million Facebook profiles
    to manipulate voter behavior in the US [59] and previously the hack that exposed
    data of 57 million Uber users and drivers [60]. Given the even further sensitivity
    involved in the public sector, the technology solutions for trusted data sharing
    and linkage is, therefore, a core issue. Blockchain as a foundational technology
    [61] emerges as the natural solution to the secure data sharing. The technology
    offers many potential applications in managing all types of contracts, transactions
    and the records efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. However, the
    technology is still at its infancy, especially with regards to security and privacy.
    The lack of standards, scalability, storage, access, change management and security
    against cyber criminals can be mentioned as some of the key areas of concern [62].
    Permissioned systems may, therefore, be preferred over public ledgers as in many
    cases a smaller number of records might suffice. Bacon et al. [63] provides an
    overview of the different ways blockchain technology can be implemented depending
    on the application and the legal considerations around different permutations
    of the features involved. There are also unintended consequences in particular
    regarding the environmental and sustainability impacts of the technology [64],
    such as the fact that one Bitcoin transaction alone uses as much electricity as
    the average American household in a week’s time and the excessive carbon emissions
    especially when the coal-based power is used to generate the computer calculations
    [65]. For the public sector, the promise of the IoT is the automated high-quality
    data collection and distributed processing through the connected sensors and remotely
    controlled objects. However, this also raises a number of security and privacy
    concerns both in virtual and physical terms. Within the Smart Cities framework
    for example, the trade-off might be between the advantages of monitoring a city’s
    infrastructure for energy efficiency, real-time management of traffic flows or
    the increased neighborhood safety, and the potential attacks against critical
    infrastructure, such as the power-supply networks, is a crucial question. In the
    case of artificial intelligence technologies, a main argument against their use
    in the public sector is their dependence on the data that is often biased, incomplete
    and/or imperfect; and their lack of transparency of the processes that produce
    the outcome. A useful overview of the AI and policy landscape is provided in [66].
    Also, in her award-winning book ‘Weapons of Math Destruction’ [67], Cathy O’Neil
    asserts how the data-driven decisions through AI systems may be harmful throughout
    the important life events of individuals from job applications, to loan and insurance
    decisions, and to sentencing criminals. Beyond the issues mentioned, the use of
    new technologies in the public sector introduces a number of philosophical discussions,
    such as the changing public perception of privacy, security and surveillance;
    or the ownership and exploitation of personal data, therefore, providing a rich
    domain for further interdisciplinary discussion. In promoting debate, the Open
    Government Partnership (www.opengovpartnership.org) is a multilateral initiative
    that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency,
    empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen
    governance. The Open Government Partnership formally launched on 20 September
    2011, with the eight founding governments (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway,
    the Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States). OGP
    action plans can be evaluated on the following criteria: (a) Process: How open,
    participatory, and meaningful is government-civil society dialog in developing
    action plans?; (b) Commitments: How clear, relevant, and ambitious were action
    plans? Were ambitious commitments implemented? If not, why?; (c) Impacts: Can
    we see linkages between OGP action plans and major changes in governance?. UK
    is also a member of the Digital 7 or D7 (previously called Digital 5, or D5) initiative
    along with Estonia, Israel, New Zealand, South Korea [68], and the most recent
    additions of Canada and Uruguay [69]. 10. CONCLUSIONS What we refer to as Algorithmic
    Government—the Data Science revolution in the Public Sector—will have a bigger
    impact on society that than on finance, due to the pervasive nature of the Public
    Sector. We have attempted in this paper to provide a review and a full technology
    framework on how the emerging technologies could be utilized in the public sector
    based on a number of studies and projects across the globe. Estonia’s e-Estonia
    provides a pioneering role model. However, as discussed, this is arguably just
    for the blockchain technologies. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a more comprehensive
    technology stack should include an upper artificial intelligence layer complete
    with technologies like Chatbots to engage citizen enquiries, Robo-advisors to
    support civil servants, IoT to collect high-quality real-time data and manage
    the public infrastructure, behavioral/predictive analytics to gain enhanced insights
    into public sector challenges, policy modeling and big data to transform the decision-making
    processes under the ongoing digital revolution. We also realize that automation
    in the public sector should be balanced with human expert intervention where and
    as necessary. Figure 2. Open in new tabDownload slide Algorithmic government technology
    stack. Although the scope of this paper has mainly been on the technology, we
    also recognize the major societal challenges in this domain. Within the UK context
    in particular, identifying a comprehensive public sector infrastructure and retrofitting
    the new digital technologies into that infrastructure are both major challenges,
    given the long established culture and the sizable population in comparison to
    young nations like Estonia.1 Also the fact that interests and working practices
    of computing and policy domains typically tend to be very different, there is
    also the need to educate a new generation of civil servants and to re-train existing
    workforce in embracing new technologies to ensure efficiency and continuity in
    the public sector. Furthermore, the issues around the use of private citizen data,
    fairness of algorithmic decision-making practices, transparency of public operations,
    the accountability for any damages caused by computer-assisted processes and the
    natural threat of potential job-losses are all extremely valid and timely considerations.

    • Technology is an integral component of many of the proposed mitigation measures.
    • There exists an urgent need for education on e-waste impact on the environment.
    • Greater focus is needed on responsible digitalization to engender sustained
    change. • Alignment of smart initiatives to SDGs is an underdeveloped research
    area. • Greater awareness is needed on lived in realities of environmental tradeoffs.
    Abstract The UN COP26 2021 conference on climate change offers the chance for
    world leaders to take action and make urgent and meaningful commitments to reducing
    emissions and limit global temperatures to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels
    by 2050. Whilst the political aspects and subsequent ramifications of these fundamental
    and critical decisions cannot be underestimated, there exists a technical perspective
    where digital and IS technology has a role to play in the monitoring of potential
    solutions, but also an integral element of climate change solutions. We explore
    these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based
    insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges
    through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its
    forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and
    wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly,
    researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate
    the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral
    component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires
    pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate
    friendly society. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Climate

    Development Goals (SDGs) 1. Introduction The 2021 United Nations (UN) Climate
    Change Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow UK, brings together many of the worlds’
    leaders to address the critical aspects of global warming. The conference aims
    to gain commitment for sustained progress towards the Paris Agreement and UN framework
    convention on climate change, by limiting increased global temperatures to 1.5
    °C above pre-industrial levels (COP26, 2021). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change (IPCC) identified in its 2018 report that global emissions would need to
    be at net zero by at least 2050 to retain a “high confidence” level of limiting
    temperature increases to sustainable levels (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). In
    her speech at the conference, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that -
    “rising to this challenge will require the wholesale transformation of our carbon-intensive
    economies," and that "addressing climate change is the greatest economic opportunity
    of our time." (COP26, 2021). The transition toward net zero requires significant
    changes at a societal and industrial level and governments, as well as corporations,
    are increasingly turning to technological innovations to meet net zero emission
    targets (Miller, 2020). Digital technologies offer the potential to deliver sustained
    solutions to many of the seemingly intractable societal challenges relating to
    climate change (George, Merrill, & Schillebeeckx, 2021). The World Economic Forum
    (WEF) in its - Harnessing Technology for the Global Goals report, jointly authored
    with PwC, identifies the significant role that digital technology can play in
    improving resilience to global warming related, natural hazards, reducing emissions
    and enhancing the ability for humans to take the necessary steps to realize net
    zero. The WEF report identifies how digital technologies can help to automate
    and significantly improve the efficiency of industrial, manufacturing and agricultural
    processes and that Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems could contribute
    to a reduction of 4% in global emissions by 2030 (World Economic Forum & PwC,
    2021). Although advancements in technologies are closely associated with offering
    solutions to global warming, the digital discourse also highlights the negative
    impacts of the widespread use of technology in the context of waste products,
    resource usage and CO2 emissions. The widely reported impact of vast bitcoin mining
    farms in various parts of the world and their appetite for significant energy
    consumption - 121.36 terawatts hours per year (CBECI, 2021) – illustrates the
    dichotomy of rapid technological advancement and potential barriers to net zero
    by 2050 (Mora et al., 2018). The debates surrounding the convergence of the digital
    and net zero imperatives are beginning to gain traction within the academic literature,
    where studies have started to focus on the role of digital technologies through
    a positive contribution lens, but also a reflective perspective, recognizing some
    of the negative aspects of the rapid adoption of technology (George et al., 2021,
    Merrill et al., 2019). What is clear is that, whilst the emerging diverse and
    disparate discourse has offered insight to many of the significant challenges
    and barriers to net zero from the digital perspective (George et al., 2016, Luo
    et al., 2016), there exists a limited contribution from a wider and more informed
    multiple perspective context. This study contributes to the digital technology
    and climate change discourse, via the individual discussions on a multitude of
    interrelated sub-topics. Each invited expert has offered their own unique insight
    to the myriad of complexities and dependencies to attaining net zero by 2050.
    The remaining sections of this article are organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    a brief review of existing literature in this space. Section 3 presents the experts’
    perspectives related to core themes surrounding information management (IM)/information
    technology (IT)/information systems (IS) and climate change. Section 4 - presents
    an overview of the key perspectives from the submitted full opinion articles.
    The main discussion section is presented in Section 5, where we assess the significant
    challenges and key contributions from the invited expert submissions. Section
    6 concludes the paper by discussing implications for both research and practice.
    2. Background literature review The primary database used for the literature search
    was Scopus. Keywords such as “information systems” or “information technology”
    or “IT sector” were combined (AND operator) with keywords “environment”, “sustainability”,
    “sustainable” and “climate”. The search taxonomy retrieved articles that had the
    combination of keywords in the article title, author keywords, or abstract. Via
    a process of filtering to eliminate non-relevant studies, a total of 372 articles
    remained. These articles were evaluated via their abstract to assess their suitability
    against the following two research questions. • RQ1: Does the digital technology
    and IS/IT sector have a negative impact on the environment and how can it be reduced?
    • RQ2: How can digital technology and IS/IT be utilized to mitigate the causes
    and impact of climate change? After a further process of scanning of the title
    and abstract for the relevance of the article to the research questions, 88 articles
    remained. Additionally, ScienceDirect and Web of Science were also used, following
    similar approaches which resulted in 16 additional articles. 2.1. (RQ1) Does the
    digital technology and IS/IT sector have a negative impact on the environment
    and how can it be reduced? Despite the contribution of the IS/IT industry toward
    the economic and social welfare of society, IS/IT has often been criticized for
    having a negative environmental impact. Concerns surrounding the adverse effects
    both hardware and software have on the environment date back to the Y2K era which
    led to the massive adoption of enterprise systems (Miyamoto, Harada, & Fujimoto,
    2001). These negative impacts include high levels of energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions and toxic disposal of IS/IT systems (Muregesan, 2008). The disposal
    of electronic waste (e-waste) while following recycling processes has been widely
    viewed as not being environmentally friendly, especially the impact of fossil
    fuels or respiratory inorganics (Barba-Gutiérrez, Adenso-Diaz, & Hopp, 2008).
    Refurbished ICTs are often used in developing countries where devices tend to
    have a short life-span and subsequently create environmental damage during disposal
    (Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). Studies have argued that electricity is a major cause
    of climate change, as many power stations throughout the world still rely on fossil
    fuels to generate electricity (Asongu et al., 2020, Tamburini et al., 2015). Energy
    hungry technologies such as applications of blockchain in the form of bitcoin,
    has been widely criticized for producing over 22–29 million metric tonnes of carbon
    dioxide emission each year. These figures are comparable to the carbon dioxide
    production of entire countries such as Jordan and Sri Lanka (Marr, 2018, Stoll
    et al., 2019). Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and
    actuators have a shorter lifespan which leads to increased waste in the environment
    (Chakraborty and Gupta, 2016, Chakraborty et al., 2014, Nižetić et al., 2020).
    Digital transformation initiatives such as smart cities have concerns surrounding
    ICT waste management, energy management and emission management which needs to
    be addressed for achieving long term sustainability and viability (Ismagilova,
    Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019). From an IS/IT perspective, IoT and Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) could potentially offer solutions for reducing the impact of
    technology projects (Salam, 2020). High ICT-driven initiatives need to plan for
    sustainability by thinking from the perspective of social welfare and e-waste
    impact (Kar, Ilavarasan, Gupta, Janssen, & Kothari, 2019). Wireless communication
    technologies need adaptations so that emissions can be further reduced. AI can
    operate with such technologies to enhance the usage of bandwidth and energy consumption
    to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the telecom sector Ullah et al.
    (2020). Similarly, AI integrated with blockchain has been found to positively
    impact water management and climate control (Lin, Petway, Lien, & Settele, 2018).
    AI can manage and reduce energy consumption within smart cities (Şerban & Lytras,
    2020). Studies have identified that blockchain applications can improve sustainable
    practices in supply chain management and agricultural practices (Kshetri, 2021).
    Similarly, within nano-technology applications, AI has provided benefits through
    better precision in agricultural water distribution delivering positive impacts
    on efficient use of natural resources. The communication of sustainability related
    messages within social media has greatly increased during the pandemic (Grover
    et al., 2019, Grover et al., 2021, Yadav et al., 2021). The literature has highlighted
    that during crisis periods IS research can provide “signposting” for sustainability
    actions through improved digital monitoring, tackling information flow and paranoia,
    and orchestrating data ecosystems for improved decision making (Pan & Zhang, 2020).
    The focus towards renewable energy has increased dramatically. The IRENA (2021)
    report indicates that jobs in sustainability and cleaner energy are increasing
    exponentially year on year, especially in solar and wind energy. This shift towards
    greener energy consumption is common across industries producing and consuming
    technology products and services. There is evidence that if stakeholders are convinced
    about energy management, their engagement in Green IS/IT programs will increase
    (Nyberg, 2018). The literature highlights the use of theories such as: Institutional
    Theory, Resource Based View, Technology Organization Environment framework, Theory
    of Planned Behavior and Motivational Theory as the dominant models used in the
    IS literature (Asadi & Dahlan, 2017). Lesser used theoretical lenses such as:
    Upper Echelon Theory, Self Determination Theory, Green Theory, Norm Activation
    Model, Elaboration Likelihood Model, Dynamic Capability Theory, Actor-Network
    Theory and Expectancy Theory. could be used to explore future research relating
    to environmental impacts of technology. (Table 1, Table 2). Table 1. Snapshot

    2.2. (RQ2) How can digital technology and IS/IT be utilized to mitigate the causes
    and impact of climate change? As early as 2008, Murugesan (2008) provided directions
    towards a greener IS/IT strategy. A holistic focus towards Greener IT entails
    reducing the energy consumption of computational devices. It also gives directions
    on reuse, refurbish and recycling of IS/IT products. Such a focus requires an
    organizational imperative as indicated by Butler (2011), whereby the study draws
    on institutional theory to explain the multitude of forces acting on organizations
    from the institutional, environment and organizational fields for environmental
    sustainability. Reduction of carbon based energy consumption directly leads to
    reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The study by Simmonds and Bhattacherjee
    (2012) indicates that existing IT infrastructure, alignment of business strategy
    and relative advantages of green IT initiatives, have an overall positive impact
    on the adoption of IT initiatives within firms. Recent IT/IS literature indicates
    that technology can be a solution for better environmental management and sustainability.
    For example, Wang X. (2015), Wang Y. (2015) highlights that IS/IT competence enables
    the integration of technology within the environmental management processes to
    improve performance. The same study demonstrated the positive impact of IT competence
    on IT-environmental management integration. The research by Jnr (2020) indicates
    that there is a significant relationship between integrated technologies and Green
    IS/IT innovation. The study by Ojo and Fauzi (2020) indicates that environmental
    awareness and leadership commitment positively impacts engagement in Green IS/IT
    practices. Further Marques et al. (2019) highlight that universities now consider
    emissions and Green IT principles to reduce the adverse impacts on the climate,
    while designing their curriculum. Audits in Green IT in enterprises help to enhance
    focus towards maintaining environmental orientation and better impacts on climate
    (Patón-Romero et al., 2021). These audits offer a view on the organization''s
    position along the green IT capability maturity model from ISO/IEC 15504 to ISO/IEC
    33000. Within workplace infrastructure management, sensors and actuators are often
    being used for water management and energy consumption in smart buildings (toilet
    management, ventilation and air quality management) and smart devices (like air
    conditioners and lighting systems). These technologies have been observed to have
    brought in wide positive impacts on the climate within the existing literature
    (Zarindast, Sharma, & Wood, 2021). For example, blockchain applications are not
    always energy hungry, and often applications in different use cases such as SolarCoin
    and VerdePay may actually help in reducing carbon footprints (Howson, 2019). Applications
    of analytical models for information management enables more efficient energy
    management in smart cities (Gellert, Florea, Fiore, Palmieri, & Zanetti, 2019).
    Blockchain applications may enable a more efficient IoT ecosystem and thereby
    reduce energy consumption (Sharma et al., 2020). AI technologies such as deep
    learning together with big data analytics have been used for image mining for
    underwater environment management and air quality management (Kushwaha et al.,
    2021, Nair et al., 2021). Driven by the pandemic, working from home has significantly
    increased, which has drastically reduced travel to workplaces, thereby reducing
    the carbon footprint from travel and maintaining office infrastructure. This change
    toward a work from home culture has been facilitated using video conferencing
    and collaboration systems enabled through ICTs (Chakraborty and Kar, 2021, Galanti
    et al., 2021, Richter, 2020). A recent review on AI and its possible impacts towards
    sustainability argue that AI will play a critical role beyond enabling better
    consumption of energy, water, and land usage, and it will facilitate environmental
    governance with greater effectiveness (Nishant et al., 2020). Whilst the literature
    has exhibited an emerging focus on Green IS and sustainability within the information
    management literature, there is still tremendous scope for impactful research
    on many aspects of the use of technology to combat climate change. 3. Multiple
    perspectives from invited contributors This section, in alignment with the approach
    set out in previous studies (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021a, Dwivedi et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015), develops a set of
    unique expert contribution narratives that explore many of the key topics related
    to digital and IS technologies and climate change. This topic has numerous threads
    and interdependencies as many of the invited experts offer their own perspectives
    and viewpoints on the topic. The expert contributions are largely presented in
    an unedited form, as expressed by each of the contributors. The perceived unevenness
    of the logical flow inherent with this approach is countered by the capturing
    of the distinctive orientations of the expert perspectives related to the chosen
    topic (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Dwivedi

    Johan Olaisen 3.1. Behavior and attitudes 3.1.1. Contribution 1 – Climate change
    and information technology – Professor Robert M. Davison 3.1.1.1. Some issues
    I think that IM/IT/IS has a profoundly negative impact on the environment in ways
    that are largely invisible. For instance, the devices that we use, particularly
    batteries, require the inclusion of rare earth elements, notably tantalum. This
    is mined from Coltan. Major deposits of coltan are found in DR Congo (Wikipedia,
    2021) where open cast mines blight the landscape. In addition, hundreds of small
    scale independent miners look for their own spoils. The impact on the environment
    is considerable, and this includes the local wildlife that used to live in the
    area, notably the Eastern Mountain Gorilla. Militias are often employed to protect
    the mines and their all-too valuable minerals, but these militias may abuse the
    local people, wildlife and more (YouTube, 2017). At a more visible level, the
    devices that we use require huge amounts of electricity, whether for the extraction
    and refinement process, the manufacturing process or the simple use of the end
    products. Where does the electricity come from? Well, that depends on where you
    live. You might be fortunate enough to live in a country that depends to a large
    extent on renewable energy resources (or at least gives you the option to source
    your electricity from such sources) – solar, hydro, wind, geothermal or wave for
    instance. But you might also live, as billions of people do, in a country that
    relies on coal or oil for energy production. Thus, to operate your devices, you
    are directly contributing to the coal economy and to further global warming via
    the CO2 that is emitted when coal is burned. How can the negative effect be reduced?
    The answer is simple but painful: we need to keep our existing devices in use
    for much longer than we currently do. We need to avoid the temptation to update
    our devices as soon as the next version is available. Here devices include: phones,
    tablets, notebooks, cameras, electric cars and any other device with significant
    battery use. We can’t eliminate the negative effects but we can reduce them. 3.1.1.2.
    Research agenda I think that a valid research agenda has to include the concept
    of sustainability. Tan B. (2021) are currently editing a special issue of the
    ISJ on IS and Sustainable Development. They note that the 2015 UN Agenda for Sustainable
    Development includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 associated
    targets to be achieved by 2030 (United Nations Department of Economic & Social
    Affairs, 2015). These goals and targets constitute a research agenda in their
    own right, though not all are immediately applicable to IM/IS/IT. Meanwhile, Walsham
    (2012) argues that there is a need to undertake IS research that demonstrates
    how we can make the world a better place. To provide some other context, however,
    Clarke and Davison (2020) noted that almost no IS research, at least as published
    in the Association for Information Systems’ basket of eight journals (EJIS, ISJ,
    ISR, JAIS, JIT, JMIS, JSIS, MISQ), included the environment as a key stakeholder
    or treated the environmental perspective as a matter of importance. Thus, the
    track record in IS is not particularly rosy. We have a long way to go. 3.1.1.3.
    Education I teach Green IS issues to my MBA students: we identify and discuss
    issues concerning how green IS really is, including many of the issues raised
    in this editorial. We look at the topic from a policy perspective and consider
    what actions organizations can take to ensure that they genuinely adopt a green
    culture and implement green measures. This is particularly relevant to corporate
    social responsibility and the triple bottom line (Elkington, 1997). 3.1.2. Contribution
    2 – digital platforms in combating climate change: user engagement tools and digital
    traces of climate footprints – Professor Ioanna Constantiou and Professor Morten
    Thanning Vendelø In spite of the increasing awareness about the consequences of
    climate change, many individuals continue to fail in adjusting their behaviors
    and lifestyles in order to lessen their impact on the climate. While mottos like
    “think globally, act locally” urges people to consider the health of the entire
    planet and to take action in their own communities and cities, they do not seem
    to significantly contribute to combating climate change. Many individuals appear
    to experience difficulties in understanding how their behavioral patterns and
    choices affect the climate of the planet, although the most recent UN Climate
    Report shows that with no changes in greenhouse gas emissions the increase in
    the global temperatures will rise to 2.7 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100
    (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). Hence, alternative means of influencing
    consumer behavior are required. Digital technologies can support individuals in
    developing connections between their behavioral patterns, and the ongoing changes
    in the global climate as well as identify and choose alternatives to these behavioral
    patterns (Schroder, Prockl, & Constantiou, 2021). Digital platforms can support
    combating climate change by providing marketplaces where transactions can be made
    in more cost efficient and climate friendly ways, promote sustainable product
    innovation or inform consumers about their climate footprints. The abundance of
    data available to digital platforms can be used for activities that promote sustainable
    options and motivating climate friendly behaviors. For example, applications tracking
    user physical activity can quantify climate impacts and thereby nudge users to
    consider more sustainable options of public transportation (e.g., based on CO2
    emissions of different means of transportation). Another area of interest is reduction
    of food waste. A number of digital platforms have recently emerged with related
    visions. Building on the logic of collaborative consumption and social entrepreneurship
    (Schroder et al., 2021), digital platforms such as Eat Grim provide a marketplace
    for selling vegetables and fruits that do not match industry standards based on
    appearance to consumers. Their aim is to change the consumers’ perceptions of
    appearance related quality standards of what is edible and nudge their users to
    eat vegetables and fruits by focusing on other criteria such as freshness, or
    nutrition value of the vegetables and fruits. By redistributing these products
    to their consumers from restaurants or other retail shops, they reduce food waste.
    Another example is the digital platform Too Good To Go that connects customers
    to restaurants and stores, mainly bakeries, that have unsold food surplus. The
    surplus food is sold to consumers at discounted prices instead of being wasted.
    Finally, Plant Jammer is another platform that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
    and fight climate change through sustainable cooking and plant-based food. Consumers
    reduce waste in their home by using ingredients that would normally be wasted
    due to lack of knowledge on how to combine through recipes in their daily meals.
    These platforms provide multi sided marketplaces (Parker, Van Alstyne, & Choudary,
    2016) governed by loose control mechanisms and apply pricing structures for cost
    compensation, hence display low intensity of competition (Constantiou, Marton,
    & Tuunainen, 2017). Based on the data they collect they can develop new mechanisms
    to engage users. Customer engagement, is a multidimensional tool, rooted in marketing
    and social psychology, and described as “the level of an individual customer’s
    motivational, brand-related and context-dependent state of mind characterized
    by specific levels of cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity in direct brand
    interactions’’ (Hollebeek, 2011, p. 790). These dimensions cover three key activities
    that can support consumer transition to more climate friendly behaviors. Techniques
    displaying a quantified climate footprint based on the individual behaviors that
    are tracked by platforms, could stimulate cognitive activities towards combating
    climate changes, for example considering the impact of specific food choices,
    e.g., daily consumption of meat. This can lead to behavioral changes when multisided
    platforms make more environmentally friendly options easily accessible and economically
    attractive as observed with platforms combating food waste. Finally, gamification
    or other nudging techniques that stimulate emotions, either positive or negative,
    can reinforce consumer engagement with different platforms combating climate changes.
    The success of such mechanisms is reliant on increasing levels of user engagement
    with the platform where user behaviors can eventually be replaced with more climate
    friendly ones. 3.1.3. Contribution 3 – faith and climate change – Dr. Iyad Abumoghli
    While the world''s religious and spiritual traditions did not traditionally face
    climate change in the way society has come to know it since the mid-20th century,
    peoples throughout history have always lived through and had to deal with extreme
    and erratic weather events. Comparable notions of climate change have been expressed
    in the world’s different religions through their texts and teachings. There is
    no singular perspective or monolithic view of climate change within highly diverse
    faith and religious traditions. Within the same religion, adherents may hold different
    views and perspectives on climate change and humanity''s relationship with nature.
    However, there are general perspectives developed in consultation with adherents
    of represented faith groups. Naturally, they are taken from those who accept the
    scientific consensus on climate change. The Buddhist perspective on climate change,
    for example, is presented as the ecological consequences of our own collective
    karma. Therefore, it is not just an ecological crisis, but a spiritual one too.
    Within the broad sphere of Christianity, Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si,
    provides a high-level perspective on Catholicism’s views on climate change. He
    argues that climate change is a global problem and that humanity has a moral obligation
    to address it at all levels of society (UN News, 2015). Climate change can be
    explained through the Daoist concepts of Ying and Yang. The carbon balance between
    the earth and sky is off balance causing instability and disasters. Thus, climate
    change can be viewed as a manifestation of humanity’s failure to maintain harmony
    with nature. The Hindu Declaration on Climate Change states that “today we call
    on all Hindus to expand our conception of dharma (duty). We must consider the
    effects of our actions not just on ourselves and those humans around us, but also
    on all beings. Addressing climate change from an Islamic perspective, is about
    assuming the role as trustee or steward (khalifa) of creation that God bestowed
    upon humanity. This trusteeship applies to all life forms and ecosystems, in their
    full diversity and richness, reflecting the glory of their creator. Today, the
    balance (mizan) of nature has been disturbed by human activity and choices which
    have resulted in overconsumption, overexploitation and overuse of resources, ultimately
    leading to environmental degradation and climate change. Climate change is already
    manifesting itself in highly localized contexts, directly impacting Indigenous
    ways of life. Therefore, climate change does not just represent an abstract scientific
    issue, but rather a very real and dangerous threat to livelihoods and culture.
    Adherents from all the world’s religions and faith traditions agree that climate
    change represents an immense threat that must be overcome, for the sake of humanity,
    the environment and all living beings we share Earth with. This common understanding
    has led to an increase in faith, intrafaith and interfaith efforts to address
    it. These serve as an acknowledgment of the overwhelming scientific evidence that
    climate change is indeed human-induced. Faith actors can play a crucial role here
    given that faith permeates into all areas of life and can inspire the behavioral
    changes necessary to address climate change. As a testament to growing faith engagement,
    in the lead-up to COP21, held in Paris at the end of 2015, many Faith leaders
    and organizations called on governments to take climate change seriously and commit
    to addressing it. This formed part of a much broader global advocacy movement
    that helped lead to the creation of the Paris Agreement and the climate measures
    contained within it. In October 2021, in the lead up to COP26, more than 40 faith
    leaders met at the Vatican and submitted a Faith Appeal to the president of COP26
    linking Faith to Science and calling upon nations to increase their ambitions
    and committing their organizations to take action to reduce their carbon footprint.
    This process has been only effective in engaging faith leaders over a period of
    seven months through information technology systems and online capabilities of
    applications. UNEP’s Faith for Earth Initiative was founded to accelerate and
    solidify precisely this spirit of interfaith collaboration, ensuring that faith
    actors had a voice at the highest level of environmental governance and greater
    access to the UN system. The interfaith initiative introduces the cultural, spiritual
    and ethical dimensions of sustainable development that faith actors bring into
    the implementation of the SDGs, particularly those related to the environment.
    Since its founding Faith for Earth has hosted and participated in multiple interreligious
    conferences, workshops, webinars and events, encouraging faith actors to come
    together and tackle common issues of climate change and environmental degradation.
    Faith actors can play an important role by providing a moral voice to the climate
    change crisis. Combining spiritual ethics with climate knowledge and science can
    serve to drive behavioral change amongst adherents, more than either one can alone.
    Substantial and widespread changes in public attitudes are essential to tackle
    climate change. Given that faith permeates into all areas of life, authoritative
    faith voices can be strong drivers in motivating people for action. Indeed, given
    that many religions already advocate environmentally friendly behaviors as part
    of their core values such as living with fewer material luxuries, caring for creation
    or dietary restrictions, there are strong traditions to draw upon. Faith groups
    across the globe are bringing religious teachings into thousands of projects on
    the ground to protect people and nature from the effects of climate change and
    pollution. By leading by example, FBOs can inspire positive action in communities
    to begin the transformation to a carbon-neutral sustainable society from the bottom
    up. Faith-based organizations have been using information technology to communicate
    with the world and pass their messages online, either directed to their congregations
    or to others through mainly social media and networks. Sharing publications, articles
    and courses has become easier for the faith communities. Climate change campaigns
    are among the most active ones among the faith communities. 3.1.4. Contribution
    4 – the pros and cons of IM/IT/IS on climate change and future directions – Professor
    Bhimaraya Metri 3.1.4.1. How the IM/IT/IS sector is having a negative impact on
    the environment and how it can be reduced The IS/ICT sector is a net source of
    global greenhouse gas emissions. The data centers used to power digital services
    now contribute approximately 2% of global GHG emissions – on par with the aviation
    sector (UNFCCC, 2016). The digital technology industry is one of the least sustainable
    and most environmentally damaging industrial sectors in the modern world (Junior,
    Majid, & Romli, 2018). If we are aiming to utilize technology as a mitigating
    factor for climate change we need to reform the way technology is used at different
    sectors, causing substantial damages: 3.1.4.2. Replacement rather than repair
    A consistent shift in the consumption pattern which pushes replace over repair
    is causing huge overheads on the environment. Companies like Apple are systematically
    discouraging self-repairs or repair at affordable prices thus pushing for replacement.
    3.1.4.3. Software upgrades pushing hardware replacements Innovation and upgradation
    in the technologies sector are simultaneously pushing the hardware upgrades. These
    upgrades often leave the legacy hardware unusable leading to e-waste. 3.1.4.4.
    E-waste Increasing digitalization is giving rise to the problem of e-waste. Much
    e-waste contains concentrated amounts of potentially harmful products, and this
    shows little sign of abating. In the absence of clear policy on e-waste flow management
    (Frazzoli, Orisakwe, Dragone, & Mantovani, 2010), the world produces about 50
    million tonnes of e-waste, with only 20% of it being dealt with sustainably (UN
    report, 2019, WEF report, 2019). 3.1.4.5. Technology driving electricity demand
    The overall demand for electricity from the digital technology sector is growing
    rapidly (Jones, 2018). It is further predicted that ICT networks could use about
    20% of the world’s electricity by 2025. The World Economic Forum (WEF, 2021) report
    stated, “by 2020, Bitcoin mining could be consuming the same amount of electricity
    every year as is currently used by the entire world”. Currently at the start of
    2020, Bitcoin alone has a carbon footprint of 34.73 Mt CO2 (equivalent to the
    carbon footprint of Denmark), it consumes 73.12 TWh of electrical energy (comparable
    to the power consumption of Austria), and it produces 10.95 kt of e-waste (equivalent
    to that of Luxembourg). Future projections relating to Smart Cities, 5 G and the
    Internet of Things give rise to additional concerns over energy demand Carroll
    and Heiser (2010). The negative outcomes of IT on the environment are further
    going to be increased with the advent of these new technologies. Even proliferation
    of Satellite Constellations could be a challenge (David, 2017). 3.1.4.6. How IM/IT/IS
    can be utilized to improve situation regarding climate change Recent reports have
    highlighted that IT/IS can lead to a more efficient and sustainable energy consumption
    using smart grids, smart housing and smart logistics. Statistics suggest a possible
    fifteen percent reduction in the emission of green-house gases- close to the annual
    emissions of China. There are many initiatives to reduce energy consumption and
    carbon emissions. Japan’s $32 million Green IT Project promotes highly energy
    efficient ICTs in three areas. It aims to reduce energy consumption of network
    components and data centers by more than 30%. And Japan is experimenting with
    organic light-emitting diodes to cut the power consumption of displays by 50%
    (GZR, 2020). Technology can also offer cost-effective market-driven solutions,
    using sensors, software and networks. Technologies can also help monitor and evaluate
    climatic conditions and change and may help mitigate natural disasters. We also
    need to have supported policies and regulations for green energy. Supporting demand
    for green technologies is only one step. Certain pacts undertaken by regulatory
    bodies such as the European commission and united nations, also pave the way to
    regularize sustainable technology development. One such pact is the European Green
    Digital Coalition between the European Commission and United Nations Environment
    Programme. We have to ensure that new technology development is cognisant of impending
    climate changes. One of the ways to enable technology development that conforms
    to environment and sustainability goals is for governments to penalize technology
    developers that fail to adhere to global warming constraints. Leaders in the IT
    sector need to ensure that new technology developments and innovations are guided
    by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prescribed by the UN. Further, government
    and regulatory authorities may promote climate friendly IT innovations by prescribing
    the necessary guidelines and incentives for better e-waste management and lower
    energy demands. 3.1.4.7. A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS
    and climate change Climate-change mitigating technology is a wide research area
    where researchers are attempting to gain more insights into the technology portfolio
    which can be utilized to mitigate the climate changes such as carbon emission,
    energy consumption and e-waste (McLaren and Markusson, 2020, Wang et al., 2018).
    Some of the other relevant research areas are. • Reuse/ recycle and sustainable
    manufacturing • Closed supply chain and e-waste removal • Reducing waste and efficient
    consumption using technology • Monitoring of natural disasters using technology.
    • Zero power ICT solutions • e-waste management • Circular economy • Green IT
    • Energy Management for data centers and telecommunication networks • Leveraging
    data science and Artificial Intelligence for predicting climatic changes and natural
    disasters 3.1.4.8. How IS/IT education should reflect this There is a need for
    including the impact of IT/IS on climate change in the curriculum across all disciplines
    (Perkins et al., 2018). There is a severe lack of awareness around the topics
    of climate change and how it connects to digitalization and technology transformations.
    There is a very swift adoption of new courses such as industry 4.0, blockchain
    technologies and IoT across premier educational institutions. However, courses
    discussing the flip side of these technologies in the context of climate change
    and sustainability are scarce. In addition to this, courses that introduce climate
    change mitigation technologies can be a good addition to start a conversation
    around climate change issues. 3.1.5. Contribution 5 – the role of online communities
    in supporting digital activism on climate change – Professor Niki Panteli COP26
    gives us the opportunity to reflect on our role as IS researchers on how IS/IT
    can support climate change. I draw on my personal interest and knowledge of online
    communities and digital platforms, to posit that IS has an enabling and empowering
    role in the promotion of climate change. My position in this editorial was triggered
    by an article in which the Swedish teenager and activist Greta Thunberg wrote
    in the Guardian (Thunberg, 2021), where she criticized world leaders for being
    in denial over the climate crisis. Indeed, there seems to be a catastrophic myopia
    among world leaders on current and emerging environmental threats and the challenges
    that climate change is causing to our planet. Instead of government and officials
    leading these debates, transparency of the challenges that humanity faces has
    been achieved by school children, teenagers and young adults around the world.
    The role of IS has been invaluable in providing a platform for these young activists
    to be heard, to form a community, to grow a collective voice and ultimately to
    lead on debates and protests and increase awareness on the climate crisis. A notable
    example of an IS-enabled climate change movement is the “School Strike 4 Climate”
    which was initiated and led by Greta Thunberg. Boulianne, Lalancette, and Ilkiw
    (2020) studied one of the school strikes in 2019 which was linked to this specific
    social movement and found that the online media in particular Twitter were used
    to share diverse sets of information such as local events, tactics for protesting,
    and opinions of climate change and blame of governments and other institutions
    for inaction and compliance on issues related to climate change. According to
    the same study, online platforms are transforming political engagement whilst
    offering the younger generation the means to express their ideas and voice their
    concerns to a global audience. Activism has been portrayed as a collective action
    (Landzelius, 2006), which can be orientated towards challenging the status-quo,
    and putting pressures on world leaders, corporations, communities, groups and
    individuals to make much needed changes. Digital activism can maintain activism
    traditional characteristics namely its collective nature and transformational
    purpose (George & Leidner, 2019), whilst its dynastic feature is that it relies
    on the use of online media and digital platforms with the purpose of reaching
    global audiences and mobilizing large-scale protests worldwide (Askanius & Uldam,
    2011). Online communities (OCs) offer the ground for breeding activism as they
    provide opportunities for individuals who regardless of their location voluntarily
    form a social aggregation through an online platform for sharing interests, knowledge
    and experiences (Rheingold, 1993). OCs can be used for providing a shelter for
    their members (Vaast & Levina, 2015) and a sense of place where members feel empowered
    to freely express themselves and get involved in stimulating discussions (Panteli,
    2016). The growth and sustainability of these communities depends on members’
    involvement. Mutual understanding among members (Ma & Agarwal, 2007) as well as
    group attachment and identification (Panteli and Sivunen, 2019, Ren et al., 2007)
    have been found to be crucial for OC success. In our research on digital activism,
    we studied the case of MedicineAfrica, an online health community (see Chamakiotis,
    Petrakaki, & Panteli, 2021), which had the aim to provide medical education and
    improve clinical practices in fragile, post-war countries. Findings showed that
    it is not so much the technological affordances of digital platforms—namely to
    inform, to network and to organize (Tim, Pan, Bahri, & Fauzi, 2018)—but it is
    primarily their potential to set up an online collective of like-minded individuals
    that allows this form of digital activism to succeed. Similarly, Cardoso, Boudreau,
    and Carvalho (2019) posited that though digital platforms can be used to organize
    collective action, the extent to which these are successful depends on the capacities
    and intents of their members, which the authors referred to in their study as
    resourcefulness and agency. It is not surprising therefore that IS researchers
    have shown an interest in OC members’ behaviors and practices, and how OC users
    interact with and influence each other within this online setting. Founded by
    passionate and enthusiastic individuals, OCs can be used to develop networks of
    support as a way for responding to emergencies (e.g. Nan & Lu, 2014); indeed climate
    change is not just a phenomenon that deserves to be understood, but an emergency
    that requires immediate action. With an understanding that OC knowledge flows
    travel beyond the community itself (Mozaffar & Panteli, 2021), there is a need
    to explore the direction and distance of the knowledge flows generated within
    OCs on climate change, and the impact that these are making on individuals, groups,
    organizations and governments worldwide. Further, digital climate activism offers
    the opportunity to study cross-generational differences on the use of online platforms
    and within OCs. Cross-generational differences have been evident in the use of
    social media platforms (Panteli & Marder, 2017) and a study on these differences
    is particularly relevant and topical with the increasing number of young digital
    activists globally. Research therefore on the interactions within OCs founded
    and led by teenagers and young adults should fall part of the agenda for future
    IS research. This should shed further light on who is indeed leading the climate
    crisis!. 3.2. Education, awareness and changed working practices 3.2.1. Contribution
    6 – Climate change and the emergent role of IS: an agenda for IS against the background
    of COP261 – Dr Rohit Nishant and Dr Thompson S.H. Teo Climate change is an existential
    threat facing humanity today.2 The recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought
    an important realization that humanity needs to be prepared for impending challenges
    such as climate change. Leaders from different countries assembled at the 2021
    United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, between October
    31, 2021- November 12, 2021. Political leaders as well as business leaders are
    expected to commit to ambitious goals and targets relating to emissions reduction.
    This COP26 comes after the recent working group report titled “Climate Change
    2021: The Physical Science Basis” as a part of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)
    of the United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The
    report has been described as the starkest warning of irreversible and inevitable
    climate change (Harvey, 2021). The report is a call to humanity to come together
    and face this challenge, and academia also needs to focus on climate change. The
    role of IS has become more pronounced due to the increasing digitalization of
    our society, accelerated by COVID-19 pandemic. Exponential technologies such as
    AI and ML have the potential to combat climate change (George et al., 2021). However,
    the success of any technology is dependent on the people and processes surrounding
    the technology. IS, being at the intersection of people, process, and technology,
    is therefore well poised to play a key role in combating climate change. IS research
    has been focusing on socially relevant issues as well as examining green IS (Nishant
    et al., 2017, Watson et al., 2010). These researches have highlighted both the
    positive and negative aspects associated with IS. Nevertheless, recent conversations
    surrounding climate change offer new opportunities and avenues to IS research
    to contribute to this fight against climate change. These conversations and development
    surrounding COP26 are on specific goals and targets, economic models and recognition
    of specific areas as critical in our fight against climate change. Companies and
    different nations are increasingly talking about “Net Zero” where the addition
    of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the environment is nullified by equivalent reduction
    of GHGs from the environment. Companies such as Microsoft are showing their commitment
    to net zero by paying for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However,
    net zero also faces several challenges including measurement (Joppa et al., 2021)
    as net zero requires precise, consistent, and automated measurement. IS research
    can contribute to this endeavor by focusing on how IT used for automated measurement
    can help companies achieve the goal of net zero. It can focus on processes that
    increase the effectiveness of IT as well as the design of IS that facilitates
    automated measurement. Another related development is the Science Based Targets
    initiative (SBTi), which helps companies to set emissions reduction targets in
    line with scientific assessment in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement
    (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level and focus
    on efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degree Celsius).2 Over 1000 companies are working
    with SBTi.3 IS research can focus on understanding the role that the intersection
    of people, processes and IT is playing in SBTi. It can also focus on developing
    an understanding of conditions under which IT is effective in helping companies
    implement SBTi as well as challenges in leveraging IT. Another development is
    the increasing focus on the circular economy as a new economic model. The inherent
    objective is to minimize waste as much as possible relative to a linear economy,
    where products ultimately end up as waste. IS research has started to focus on
    the circular economy, but the focus has been primarily on the potential of IS
    to facilitate circular material flows (Zeiss, Ixmeier, Recker, & Kranz, 2021).
    As data increasingly flows through the digital economy, data flow has its own
    carbon footprint and the proliferation of data can lead to redundant data. IS
    research can focus on how the idea of circular economy affects data generation
    and data flow, and how IS research can help minimize the carbon footprint of IS
    artifacts. Data also forms an essential component of AI/ML. As our society increasingly
    uses AI/ML and other exponential technologies, their own carbon footprint cannot
    be ignored. IS research can help companies and societies to redesign processes
    such that these technologies can be used effectively without damaging the environment.
    In terms of recognition of specific areas as important in the fight against climate
    change, there is also an increasing emphasis on biodiversity. In fact, the COVID-19
    pandemic has brought out an important realization that deforestation and loss
    of biodiversity can trigger new pandemics (Tollefson, 2020). Climate change can
    also facilitate zoonotic spillover (Rodó, San-José, Kirchgatter, & López, 2021).
    IS research has generally not focused on issues relating to biodiversity. Nevertheless,
    projects such as Half-Earth Project Map, that maps biodiversity exemplifies how
    IT can play a key role in conserving biodiversity. IS research can focus on the
    design of IS artifacts that support biodiversity. It can also focus on IS use
    for biodiversity conservation by companies, government, and different agencies
    and explore the factors that contribute to the success of such initiatives. Besides
    research, the IS community can contribute by making students aware of issues relating
    to climate change. Other disciplines such as management are increasingly focusing
    on climate change related issues.4 The IS community has contributed to increasing
    awareness of issues related to climate change through courses on green IS and
    IS for sustainability. The current debates surrounding climate change provide
    an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment. Students are increasingly interested
    in courses on data analytics, AI, and ML. We can make students aware that data,
    AI, and ML also have a carbon footprint, and thus they should be used in an optimal
    manner such that their carbon footprint does not diminish the benefits realized
    from them. In summary, we see that IS research and teaching can make a strong
    contribution to our fight against climate change through a focus on issues that
    have become topical due to COP26 and increasing digitalization of society. 3.2.2.
    Contribution 7 – dematerialization is so material! The contrasting impacts of
    IT on the environment and climate change – Professor Yves Barlette 3.2.2.1. How
    the IM/IT/IS sector contributes to a negative impact on the environment and how
    it can be reduced IT and IS correspond to dematerialization, but only to some
    extent. If we create digital copies of documents and save paper (and trees), we
    still have to store the data we create. Moreover, data which was stored on our
    devices (smartphones and computers) or on DVD/Blu-Rays, USB sticks (e.g., movies
    and music) or just broadcasted (radios and TV), are now increasingly decentralized
    ‘in the cloud’, i.e., data centers. Data exchanges also involve emails, texts,
    and all that we exchange using social media. Even if emails seem “old-fashioned”
    today, some companies can send the same message including 10 MB of attached files
    to 1500 employees, generating 15,000 MB, which will never be deleted for most
    of us. If these are ‘dematerialized’ and almost ‘virtual’ documents, they require
    storage, and instead of removing old data, the size of our mailboxes keeps on
    increasing and is measured today in GB. Hence, streaming and data exchanges have
    become the norm. Instead of waiting for broadcasting by TV channels and watching
    a movie, or by radio listening to a song, each of us can separately obtain the
    content on-demand and stream the same song over and over. The Korean series “Squid
    Game” from Netflix generated such a huge demand, that SK broadband sued Netflix
    over the resulting surge in network traffic (Campbell, 2021). The rollout of 5
    G will multiply by 100 the traffic capacity offered by 4 G and will in turn increase
    the volumes of exchanged data. Although the climate impact of streaming and data
    exchanges may have been overrated, they nevertheless remain significant (Kamiya,
    2020). To solve these problems, education seems to be the main solution, however,
    a tax related to bandwidth consumption could be created for streaming and cloud-based
    companies. This would in turn increase cost for users. Options such as a tax for
    other kinds of companies or even a tax on the users themselves could be created,
    specific to bandwidth consumption and/or storage volume. Storage rationalization,
    also known as “Green storage”, is also a possibility. Google is able to show its
    users their carbon footprint within the cloud (Lardinois, 2021). However, these
    data exchanges and distant storage of data require data centers and data transmission
    networks: First, company IT infrastructures, data centers and data transmission
    networks, including computers and storage, that must be manufactured. The manufacturing
    of computers requires a large amount of fossil fuels, chemicals, and raw materials.
    The mining of raw materials for electronic products includes copper, lead, and
    gold and contributes to increased environmental problems. For example, gold mines
    are the leading source of mercury air pollution in the U.S. (Gerson, Wadle, &
    Parham, 2020). Mining also pollutes the water of surrounding communities. When
    the various devices are discarded, they are sent to landfills overseas in Africa,
    China, India, Vietnam and the Philippines. Computers contain heavy metals like
    lead and toxic chemicals that pollute the soil and contaminate groundwater when
    they are dumped into landfill. Some solutions to mitigate these issues include
    (1) increasing recycling, (2) stopping greenwashing that includes cessation of
    waste recycling to countries that cannot actually recycle and (3) mitigate planned
    obsolescence and increase the reparability of devices. Second, IT devices, data
    centers and data transmission networks need power to operate thereby generating
    significant levels of heat. Several possibilities have been tested, for example
    underwater data centers and data centers located in northern countries. This does
    not reduce the heat generated but at least reduces the required energy for cooling.
    Even if the problem related to heat is not addressed, the use of carbon-free but
    polluting energies such as nuclear, must also be solved. 3.2.2.2. How IM/IT/IS
    can be utilized to improve situation regarding climate change I see several aspects:
    • IT/IS permits the use of more efficient products and designs that save raw materials
    and energy. For example, digital twins can help to better design improved products,
    e.g., car batteries (Merkle, Pöthig, & Schmid, 2021). • Processes can be more
    efficient and supply chains can be improved, reducing energy used during manufacturing,
    reducing fuel requirements and food waste during transportation. • Big data analytics
    offer possibilities for precision agriculture, reducing water waste, use of fertilizers,
    pesticides and other pollutants. • Work-from-Home possibilities, reducing business
    trips, encouraging ‘virtual’ companies. • Super calculators allow us to improve
    weather models and offer insights on what factors are the most important to regulate
    climate change. • The solution to controlled thermonuclear fusion power, could
    solve the energetic component of IT/IS impact on climate change. Fusion is only
    possible when scientists are able to compute the shape of magnetic confinement
    devices of Tokamaks and Stellarators (Klinger, 2021) or to perform simulations.
    3.2.2.3. Research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change • Improving methodological
    innovations in greenhouse gas emissions calculations. • Improving weather models
    to mitigate climate change and risks related to this change. • Development of
    awareness campaigns dedicated to mitigating our personal and professional environmental
    impacts related to IT and IS. • Increasing the conception and use of new big data
    analytics tools to mitigate the impacts of our society on climate change. • Developing
    charters in companies including best practices (see below). • Developing tools
    for smart buildings (lighting, heating, ventilation) and energy management (statistics,
    diagnostics). 3.2.2.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this IS/IT education
    could act in several ways: • Disseminate knowledge and create awareness-raising
    campaigns about the negative impacts of IT/IS on environment and how they can
    be reduced by adopting best practices including for example: • Automatic sleep
    mode and turning of the devices during nights and weekends. • Workers and home
    users should know that ‘dematerialization’ and ‘virtualization’ does not exist
    and that data is always ‘materialized’ somewhere. • Future CIOs and members of
    IT staff should be offered during their education awareness-raising campaigns,
    including the same as above plus IT/IS-specific elements: for example, the fact
    of checking that all audiovisual devices are turned off every evening. The same
    for all the laser printers in a company, even if some monitoring is deactivated.
    Turning off the monitors of their computers, even if some systems must always
    run. 3.2.3. Contribution 8 – emerging technologies to mitigate supply chain disruption
    due to climate change – Professor Manoj Kumar Tiwari Climate change has become
    one of the most important concerns in recent years at nearly all tiers of decision-making.
    Climate change is a set of worldwide phenomena caused mostly by the burning of
    fossil fuels that release greenhouse or heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere
    such as methane, carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, and nitrous
    oxide. These factors have resulted in changing global weather patterns, with frequent
    occurrence of hurricanes, droughts and rising temperatures causing habitats to
    vanish, and altering ecosystems. Climate change has a worldwide impact. As a result
    of such calamities, homelessness is on the rise, putting vulnerable communities
    at risk of food insecurity, disease, and civil upheaval. Climate change, as a
    result of global warming, is a universally acknowledged reality that affects human,
    industry, business, and the environment in a variety of ways. Supply chain and
    Logistics providers among all the industries being aware of the consequences of
    climate change are most conscious about the deterioration happening due to variation
    in weather patterns, storms, altered sea routes, and environmental changes will
    all have a significant impact on their operations, forcing them to alter conventional
    business models and trading routes. If logistics companies are on the front lines
    of climate change, they are also huge contributors to the crisis. Transportation
    industry accounts for nearly 25% of all CO2 emissions from fuel combustion around
    the world (IEA, 2019). While value addition to the product as it passes through
    the supply chain, each SC link causes environmental deterioration, especially
    climatic pollution, via GHG emission. In return, each channel in the supply chain
    faces opportunities and risks in the form of severe occurrences such as waterlogging
    or windstorms, higher temperature, soil erosion, rising sea levels, storms, impact
    on local weather conditions, increased storm frequency and intensity, drought,
    and so on. As a consequence, both climate change and supply chain activities are
    simultaneously impacted. Mitigation (cutting emissions) and adaptation (preparedness
    for inescapable circumstances) are two aspects of dealing with climate change.
    Both of these challenges are multidimensional. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    changes are required in power grids, buildings, transportation, land use and industry.
    Given a better knowledge of climate and catastrophic occurrences, adaptation necessitates
    disaster management and resiliency. Presently, Machine learning (ML) has gained
    popularity as a versatile tool for technological advancement. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and ML techniques can contribute to reduce emissions in several ways such
    as by speeding up the development of low-carbon technologies, better demand predictions,
    reducing system waste, remote sensing, improving energy efficiency, vehicle emission
    estimation from smartphone GPS traces, single building optimization, identifying
    behavioral patterns, and planning and operating low-carbon infrastructure. The
    impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is becoming more essential
    as people become more aware of climate change and its obvious implications. It
    provides simple and faster problem resolution using simulations and a large variety
    of different options. Climate change concerns can be monitored, mitigated, and
    adapted with the use of ICTs. Some inventions of ICTs are Wireless Sensor Networks,
    Satellite Technology, GIS, Remote Sensing, Mobile Technology, and Web-based applications.
    Climate change mitigation and adaptation can be more efficient and successful
    with the use of ICTs, if integrated strategically; it contains knowledge centers,
    mobile phones, and interactive media. By educating and raising awareness at the
    community level, sharing theoretical and practical knowledge, and empowering people
    to have access to knowledge and relevant data, it can assist vulnerable populations
    in reducing the risk of climate change. Micro-sensor Wireless Network is among
    the most prominent technologies in the twenty-first century, with a wide range
    of applications. Commercial or human-centric applications, robotics, military
    applications, and environmental monitoring are all using the applications of wireless
    sensor networks. Sustainable Environmental Management Information System (IS)
    can maintain the decision-making process for supportable climate control and develops
    Earth-friendly design. Emergence of big data and AI/ML techniques allows climate
    solution research to design policy and its implementation at the building and
    household scale, street, urban areas, modified to specific circumstances but scalable
    to worldwide mitigation possibilities. Furthermore, the wide application of ICTs
    also adds to the depletion of limited energy supplies and the increase in greenhouse
    gas emissions. It is one of the causes contributing to rising CO2 levels for producing
    ICT machinery and devices, energy usage, and electronic waste recycling. We are
    living in a phase of rapid transformation, where technological advancements are
    transforming the way of our living, at the same time directing us to face several
    challenges in the form of climate change and resource scarcity. Although these
    technologies contribute to greenhouse gas emissions to some extent, they aid in
    the reduction of considerably larger amounts released by all other industries.
    By establishing smarter cities, industrial processes, electrical grids, transportation
    systems, and energy savings benefits, ICT can cut CO2 emissions on a worldwide
    scale. ICT may be used to investigate and manage natural resources in a variety
    of ways, both locally and worldwide. As a result, information and communication
    technologies constitute a critical component in combating climate change and mitigating
    its effects. Some ICT tools used to mitigate climate change are: • Computer-controlled
    devices are used in a variety of ways to reduce energy consumption in the home,
    at work, and in manufacturing; • Telecommunications are critical in response to
    natural calamities caused by climate change; • Sensor networks can be used to
    monitor vulnerable or dangerous environments. • Satellite observations give critical
    information on climate and vegetation trends. Oceans and land can be monitored
    by sensors either on the ground or remotely through satellite. The state of the
    atmosphere can be examined for wind currents and greenhouse gas emissions that
    may indicate the impending arrival of a storm. Data on tsunamis and sea-level
    changes can be communicated via satellite via ocean buoys. • Geographic information
    systems can understand and visualize data. • Better study and modeling of complex
    environmental and climate systems are possible due to increased computing capability
    and innovative techniques. • Distributed (grid) computing helps scholars to dig
    deeper into themes. Natural catastrophes affect around 200 million people each
    year, according to United Nations figures. ICT plays a critical role in providing
    early warnings for natural disasters. It provides essential data on the effects
    of climate change that might lead to disasters, in addition to the usage of sensor
    networks to monitor hazards such as active volcanoes. Among these include increasing
    sea levels, depleting freshwater resources, deforestation, and ecosystem concerns.
    The Famine Early Warning System Network is one example of how ICT may help. Its
    goal is to reduce the possibility of food shortages by alerting people to early
    warning signals of famine. The system monitors and analyses data about climate
    and weather, as well as their impact on crops, utilizing information technology.
    The data is subsequently delivered to decision-makers in the form of monthly food
    security updates, predictions, and alarms, as well as assistance with emergency
    preparedness and long-term policy decisions. A variety of sensor systems created
    for weather monitoring (ocean buoys) and earthquake detection are used in tsunami
    warning systems (seismic sensors). Data is collected and delivered into real-time
    analysis and detection systems via satellite. Grid computing makes it possible
    to share data in order to do in-depth analysis. The Global Earth Observation System
    is available for all policymakers to get access to the data. There are free programs
    that allow us to zoom in on satellite photos that map the world. Geographic information
    systems (GIS) are one of the most powerful — and extensively used — tools for
    visualizing environmental data. Overall, using technology into climate change
    assessment, prevention, and adaptation can help save the ecosystem from damage
    and degradation. 3.2.4. Contribution 9 – facing the negative environmental digital
    impact: time to change values? Professor Frantz Rowe To examine whether and how
    the IT sector can have a negative impact on the environment, following the evolution
    of our awareness of the issues, I will address first the aspect of the question
    which concerns how the use of IT products is affecting the environment, before
    turning to the issue of IT production itself. The world has drastically changed
    since the end of the last century. In the 1980s, the first oil crisis was just
    behind. Society, including researchers with my transportation engineering and
    my economics background, saw enormous benefits in telecommunications to reduce
    transportation negative impacts on the environment such as pollution and CO2 emissions.
    Our first studies on the use of the telephone in households, that had been adopted
    lately in France in the 1970s, demonstrated some substitution effects on urban
    trips. However, the main lesson was that, at the scale of a large city, a) the
    net substitution effect was low since the telephone also induced some trips, and
    b) the main effect of telephone-transportation interactions was an accompanying
    or “management” effect (Claisse & Rowe, 1993). Unless we take and accept restrictive
    measures on our liberties to move, like the recent lockdowns, the effects of new
    communication tools such as video conferencing meetings, will not reduce transportation
    demand. This is notably due to an induction effect linked to the opportunities
    and more largely to a “digital rebound” effect (Coroama & Mattern, 2019), whether
    for business or social life, generated by interactions with communication technology.
    Hence my spontaneous answer to the question - how can (the) IT (sector) have a
    negative impact on the environment? - is that, unless we voluntarily reduce our
    activity and do less, the only significant gains from IT use will occur if we
    can reduce the negative impacts related to the efficiency of transportation systems.
    This means that we should design transportation systems so that their use is more
    environmentally efficient, i.e. they pollute less than others when used and have
    the best possible environmental footprint (for instance in terms of CO2 emissions)
    when produced (Teubler, Kiefer, & Liedtke, 2018). Typically IS researchers can
    contribute to such “green” designs for “greener” use by examining how IT/IS can
    help support the use of such transportation systems and more generally support
    more environmentally efficient supply chains. We looked at this, studying how
    Carrefour had redesigned its supply chain, but gains were not spectacular (Antheaume
    et al., 2018, de Corbière et al., 2016). This revision of the supply chain is
    what we would call a " second order " revision. It involved using IT based solutions
    to improve the use of trucks and supply chain restructuring with an additional
    layer of consolidation centers. It did not involve “first order” transportation
    modes improvements such as the use of trains, or river-boats which generate fewer
    GHG emissions per t.km but may be more expensive, at least to start with. This
    is because what corporations seek is to be more efficient economically, while
    ideally showing that they are environmentally conscious. However, in the large
    retailing industry for instance, becoming environmentally efficient is not their
    main concern. Unless they are forced to do so, they will not really optimize CO2
    emissions or other environmental indicators. A set of interviews on the impact
    of e-commerce on retailers supply chains shows that senior managers just want
    to be politically correct (de Corbière, Durand, & Rowe, 2010). However, we believe
    that the potential of information systems to reduce pollution is very large. Here
    again, we can distinguish between first order and second order changes. First
    order changes might be, for example: “combined truck-train transport, where for
    long distances trucks will travel on train carriages (as is done in Switzerland),
    or assisting with local manufacturing solutions, based on 3D printing, rather
    than subcontracting to a third party in another country. These first order changes
    also involve challenges which IT can help resolve. Second order changes might
    be, for example, to control cargo or to optimize vehicle routes regardless of
    the type of transportation mode considered. Regularly, containers are lost at
    sea and cargo and ships can be better controlled before their cargo falls overboard.
    Satellites, RFID technologies and web portals can be important to support these
    aims. There are many other avenues for improvements in that direction. But again,
    the issue is not just about what type of digital technology we should invest in
    to help traditional businesses reduce their environmental impact; what counts
    is to find appropriate production solutions and institutional mechanisms so that
    firms really aim at reducing harmful emissions in a significant manner and not
    always put profitability first. Like the retail or transportation industry, the
    problem is that the IT sector itself is engaged in a worldwide competition where
    profitability and convenience innovations for the consumer are key. Typical of
    these innovations the smartphone is only 14 years old, but its appearance also
    has very negative implications simply because it needs to be produced and incorporates
    rare materials that are extracted in terrible conditions in some African and Asian
    countries. In short, the ecological imprint of IT may be negative because IT products
    also have drastically changed: by becoming “smart”, and more precisely due to
    the introduction of manipulable screens, our telephones have also become very
    destructive of scant resource (Ritthof, Rohn, & Liedtke, 2002). In parallel the
    speed at which we renew corresponding infrastructures such as 5 G and soon 6 G
    won’t help. Our dream of the world being cleaned from pollution by an immaterial
    economy was just a very naïve dream. Many other examples abound such as servers
    farms for the cloud and other data centers that demonstrate huge environmental
    costs. Worse than that with the internet of things, machine to machine communication,
    automated vehicles and bots in finance may make environmental pollution uncontrollable
    or at least many times superior to that created with human-controlled processes.
    For instance, researchers recently demonstrated that training an artificial intelligence
    could explode CO2 emission costs (Strubell, Ganesh, & McCallum, 2019). Not only
    are we exhausting resources, but there are huge geopolitical implications related
    to the sometimes unique locations of these resources on the planet and related
    to where chips or materials for certain of our digital equipment are produced
    (to the extent that children’s lives are destroyed as in Congo, see Lebrun, 2020).
    These geopolitical risks may in turn generate other ecological risks because we
    unfortunately know that wars are never clean. Unless we take and accept measures
    to get sober in what we consume and what we produce, digitization alone may not
    be such a good solution for saving our environment. This goal implies making value
    choices (Rowe, 2018) and requires rethinking the design of our activities at multiple
    levels in an interdisciplinary and systemic manner (Nishant et al., 2020). 3.2.5.
    Contribution 10 – from cradle to grave – impact of IT on climate change and the
    relevant research agenda – Professor Ramakrishnan Raman 3.2.5.1. How the IM/IT/IS
    sector is having a negative impact on the environment and how it can be reduced
    IT and its applications have made business processes efficient, but the rapid
    growth of technology and its applications has also negatively impacted the environment.
    Whilst green IT practices have advocated to minimize the negative impact of IT
    on the environment, there is still a huge scope for changes to be brought into
    manufacturing, logistics and operations, usage and disposal of information technology
    equipment, which can make every process sustainable and environmentally-friendly.
    Manufacturing of Information technology products can be environmentally-friendly
    if the production adopts environmentally friendly processes. Process innovation
    is needed which can help in creating products which use fewer natural resources
    and also reduce pollution. Recycling and reuse of material and zero emission should
    be the goal of every IT manufacturing process. IT manufacturing can become environmentally
    friendly by using energy from renewable sources and also by focusing on energy
    efficiency. Innovation in business processes that can help in achieving zero pollution,
    remove greenhouse gas emissions and also eliminate waste. Focus on conserving
    natural resources can help in making manufacturing of Information technology products
    environmentally-friendly. Logistics and supply chain processes used by the IT
    sector cause hazardous air emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. Logistics and
    operations can be environmentally-friendly if manufacturers shift to green suppliers
    and partners who provide green logistics and supply chain processes and also handle
    reverse logistics. If organizations focus on consolidated shipments and reduce
    packaging by redesigning products, it can immensely help in reducing the negative
    impact on the environment. IT products have an impact on the environment even
    during the ‘use’ stage of their life cycle. The energy consumed by the product,
    the lifetime of the product, the heat dissipated and the digital frequency noise
    have a negative impact on the environment. Creating products that are more durable
    and reusable can help the environment. Less resource intensive gadgets which work
    with low power and solar power and IT gadgets will not only help protect the planet
    but also will help in the well-being of all. Responsible and environmentally friendly
    disposal of IT products can help the environment. In several developing nations
    the practise of disposing IT waste in landfills is the most popular disposal method,
    which has a colossal negative impact on the environment. Stringent regulations
    applicable for every end consumer, which mandates safe disposal of e-waste to
    certified e-waste recyclers can help in reducing the negative impact of IT disposal
    on the environment. 3.2.5.2. How IM/IT/IS can be utilized to improve situation
    regarding climate change Application of IT can immensely help in managing climate
    change. Use of IT while developing smart cities can help reduce annual global
    greenhouse gas emissions. For example, smart energy meters and smart electric
    systems help in managing climate change by optimal use of energy consumption.
    This in turn can also help in smart electric grid management which helps in reducing
    the losses. This is a simple example to showcase the use of smart IT systems which
    can help utility companies, end-users and society at large and also help also
    in managing climate change. Internet and Internet technologies are a force to
    reckon with for managing climate change. IT can infuse intelligence in transportation
    and logistics and make them smart. The Internet of Things (IoT) can make the supply
    chain smart and agile and hence can help in reducing the emission of greenhouse
    gases. Internet and Internet technologies can also help in monitoring the environment
    to reduce energy use in real time. IT can be used to harness and create green
    homes, green industries and hence can help in managing climate change. 3.2.5.3.
    A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change Information
    Technology and Internet of Things (IoT) are vital in confronting climate change
    problems and help in managing the threats posed by climate change. IT and IoT
    are part of the solution as their applications are being used to cut greenhouse
    gas emissions and they help countries manage climate change. IT and IoT are needed
    for precipitous transfer of information concerning risks of climate change. In
    this context a few questions which need deeper research include - How can information
    needed for decision making be collected and disseminated in an efficient manner
    which can help to advance the integration of climate risks into plans and policies,
    which can be useful for those who need it most? How can a low-cost IoT infrastructure
    be created in the urban and rural areas of developing countries which can enable
    authentic and speedy dissemination of real time data related to greenhouse gas
    emissions? How can IT and IoT be used to enable countries to adapt to climate
    change? 3.2.5.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this Education is vital in
    enabling people to understand the impact of climate change on life on this planet.
    Educating and creating awareness can help to change the attitude and behavior
    of people. Education alone can help in ensuring that people start adopting a sustainable
    lifestyle and also develop skills that can help in managing climate change. Education
    can not only inspire people to change their attitudes and behavior, but also helps
    them to make informed decisions which can have an impact on climate change. A
    deep-seated shift in pedagogy is needed for IT and IoT to enhance teaching and
    learning for sustainability. Teaching about climate change needs an interdisciplinary
    and cross disciplinary approach to synthesize diverse ideas. The information about
    climate change and its impact must be introduced within the school curriculum.
    IT must be used to create interactive activities on climate change which can help
    students to understand and learn in a better fashion. Projects related to sustainable
    development and climate change must be introduced at the high school level. IT
    tools which can help measure carbon emission must be taught along with practical
    application of the same. Teaching and learning which has hands-on experiences
    with technology must be emphasized. At the undergraduate and graduate level, educating
    and giving opportunities to students to work on environmentally sustainable projects
    to attain sustainability objectives using IT and IoT technologies can immensely
    help in bringing out of the box solutions to climate change problems. 3.2.6. Contribution
    11 – How has the IT sector negatively influenced the environment? Remedies, role
    of IT education and future research agenda – Professor Nripendra P. Rana 3.2.6.1.
    How information management (IM)/information technology (IT)/information systems
    (IS) sector have any negative impact on environment and how it can be reduced?
    The IT sector is constituted of companies that produce software, hardware or semiconductor
    equipment or the companies that provide Internet or related services (Miller,
    2021). Technological advancement has transformed the way we live our lives. Many
    would argue that the growth of the number of electronic devices such as laptops,
    desktops, high performance computing servers, and other most powerful data-intensive
    computing solutions (e.g., supercomputers) have brought us numerous benefits,
    there is no denying that the proper and continuous functioning of these technologies
    have come at a cost to the environment (Okafor, 2020). The heavy use of these
    devices present concerns when it comes to resource use, energy use, carbon footprint
    and waste. The negative impact of the IT sector on the environment could well
    be traced right from the manufacturing of these devices as a large proportion
    of materials come from finite natural resources and precious metals. Procuring
    raw materials and precious metals for manufacturing technological devices and
    electronic equipment comes with a high carbon cost usually powered by fossil fuels,
    deforestation, landscape degradation, water pollution and the release of vast
    quantities of carbon dioxide into the air (Mensah et al., 2015). For example,
    silicon, plastic, iron, aluminium, copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, barium are
    some of the most important materials used for manufacturing the technological
    equipment for which the mining of these poses serious threats to our environment
    (Williams, 2010). Similarly, manufacturing of these equipment requires massive
    energy to convert them into complex and sophisticated technological products.
    Subsequently, the transportation of these finished products also comes with a
    high carbon cost. Finally, massive servers and data warehouses that enable these
    technologies to work also consume a vast amount of energy and this threat does
    not stop there. These products also pose setback at the end of their lifespan
    and globally we throw away electronic waste (e-waste) of approximately $62.5 billion
    every year and only one-fifth of the electronic waste generated globally is currently
    formerly recycled, which undoubtedly an enormous threat to the environment (Amos,
    2020, Okafor, 2020). It is therefore very evident that the entire lifecycle of
    technological evolution to disposition adversely affects the environment and technological
    companies are largely responsible for this threat. This negative impact of the
    IT sector on the environment could be reduced to a certain extent by adopting
    the responsible practices of the circular economy, which signifies reusing some
    of the raw materials of the disposed equipment for a more sustainable approach
    to consumption. The governments and local authorities also have the larger responsibilities
    by legislating the circular economy model, promoting eco-friendly manufacturing
    and by adopting a responsible way of sustainable consumption. This could be achieved
    by implementing effective laws and regulations on e-waste (Geissdoerfer, Savaget,
    Bocken, & Hultink, 2017). 3.2.6.2. How can IM/IT/IS be utilized to improve climate
    change? Technological developments – particularly the discovery of use of fossil
    fuels, have contributed to climate change. Rising temperatures are essentially
    blamed by scientists for human-generated gases (primarily CO2), concentrations
    of which have been enhanced by almost 50% since the industrial revolution started.
    Innovations such as carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies are being
    used to reduce CO2. During the time of the Coronavirus pandemic, many office jobs
    were being done from home resulting in reduced emissions of CO2 from transport
    and office buildings (Sky News, 2021). The technological innovations to support
    remote working has been swiftly embraced as businesses endeavored to manage the
    effect of Covid-19. Greater use of data centers and cloud computing services by
    some of the leading technology giants including Amazon, Google and Microsoft are
    also an example of energy efficient services. With many of the latest technology
    efficient products such as smart LED light bulbs, smart outlet and power adapters,
    smart thermostat, etc. responsible for reducing energy consumption available in
    the market not only help households to save decent amounts of money in their annual
    bills but also reduce the CO2 emissions (Oberhaus, 2019). 3.2.6.3. A brief discussion
    on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change? Although the technology
    improvement with an environmental attribute reduces overall CO2 has been discussed
    in the prior research, how the role of technology change in lowering carbon emission
    intensity needs to be further researched for the overall reduction of CO2 (Li
    & Wang, 2017). While the low-carbon energy technologies contribute toward mitigating
    climate change (Schmidt & Sewerin, 2017), there is a need for further research
    on how social-psychological factors, lifestyles, behavioral patterns, etc. will
    help organizations and individuals to adopt such technologies that can reduce
    the CO2 emission and serve toward the climate change. The future researchers could
    also look to explore the adoption of such technologies in different contexts for
    both well-aware and less aware consumers about using such technologies for the
    purpose of supporting climate change action. Future research can also explore
    individuals'' pro-environmental behavior toward using such technologies. 3.2.6.4.
    How IS/IT education should reflect this? Information technology education could
    be a key component of raising awareness of climate change mitigation and adaptation.
    One suggested solution could be the collaboration between the scientists and the
    students at the pre- and post-college levels to make them aware of how modern
    emerging technologies could help reduce hazardous emissions and reduce the threat
    of global warming. The pre-college school system is the right place to disseminate
    such scientific information on the key global climate change issues. School teachers
    should be provided with the necessary advanced level of educational and hands-on
    training from scientists from local research bodies on climate change and governments
    should take the necessary steps to make it a part of the curriculum. Climate change
    is not only the knowledge that should be taught to children right from an early
    age, but they should also be made aware of how to responsibly use technologies
    in a way that helps reduce carbon emissions becoming ambassadors for sustainable
    living. 3.2.7. Contribution 12 – technology, information systems and sustainability:
    a public interest research agenda – Professor Katina Michael and Dr Roba Abbas
    3.2.7.1. The negative impact of technology and information systems on the environment
    The coupling of natural and human systems is defined by highly integrated and
    complex system dynamics resulting from human-nature interactions (Liu et al.,
    2007). This has presented significant global challenges and wicked problems (Buchanan,
    1992, Brown et al., 2010) that require immediate attention in view of sustainability,
    particularly given the centrality of technology and information systems (IS) to
    these interactions. A multifaceted feature of the natural system that is integral
    to all forms of life is biodiversity, which can be considered at three levels:
    genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity (Chapin III et al.,
    2000). Biodiversity is both implicitly and explicitly linked to health and wellbeing,
    in addition to sustainable development programs (Naeem et al., 2016, World Health
    Organization and Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2015).
    Human actions, notably decisions concerning technology and information systems,
    increasingly impact biodiversity. In line with the 26th UN Climate Change Conference
    of the Parties (COP26) Sustainability Governing Principles, there is a pressing
    need to engage in deliberate management of potential environmental impacts to
    encourage inclusivity, health and sustainability (UN Climate Change Conference
    UK 2021). Adverse impacts on the natural world resulting from existing and emerging
    technologies and IS can be described as negative externalities (Dasgupta and Ehrlich,
    2013, Perrow, 1991). The field of environmental economics, among other things,
    involves the study of externalities that generate tangible and intangible costs
    to the physical environment and its inhabitants (Cropper & Oates, 1992). It is
    often difficult to quantify these costs given the reach of an incident, and the
    extent of its irreversible impact. For example, significant oil spills cause major
    externalities that cannot readily be measured, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil
    spill, which was estimated to have spilled 4,900,000 barrels of crude oil into
    the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Beyer, Trannum, Bakke, Hodson, & Collier, 2016). There
    are two main types of negative externalities; the first refers to negative production
    externalities that can cause, for example, air or water pollution through manufacturing
    plants powered by technology and other forms of engineering; and the second denotes
    negative consumption externalities that can cause for instance, traffic congestion
    and noise pollution that are generated by systems (Biglan, 2009). Externalities
    caused by technologies and IS may be unanticipated, unintended, and even paradoxical
    (Pringle, Michael, & Michael, 2016). Unanticipated externalities refer to those
    incidents and system failures that were not factored into scenario planning and
    risk management processes during systems design and development, such as the Fukushima
    Daiichi nuclear disaster whereby a substantial wave surged over defences and flooded
    reactors causing major radiation leakage (von Hippel, 2011). Unintended consequences
    of technologies and IS are those that were discounted as potential outcomes of
    a respective system, but nonetheless transpired (Ash, Berg, & Coiera, 2004). An
    example is the use of irrigation systems for crops, which subsequently contributes
    to soil erosion and increased soil salinity (Khan, Tariq, Yuanlai, & Blackwell,
    2006). Conversely, paradoxical externalities emerge from attempts to use technologies
    and IS for advantage and benefit, but where the result is a negative outcome on
    another aspect of the environment. An example is the introduction of Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices to monitor energy systems to lower consumption that requires
    the devices to be powered and over time to be replaced, causing often toxic and
    non-biodegradable e-waste that is disposed of in landfills (Mukhopadhyay & Suryadevara,
    2014). A common element underpinning these types of negative externalities is
    the impact on public resources that are shared by communities (Pigou, 1920). These
    include the ocean and its fisheries and clean drinking water, amongst others,
    leaving individuals and communities vulnerable, potentially compromising their
    health and wellbeing. Furthermore, these undesirable impacts extend to the natural
    system and environment. These impacts can be linked to technologies and IS that
    do not suitably consider socio-ecological and socio-technical considerations,
    and that fail to recognize the value of design, testing and validation, with sustainability
    and people in mind (Chen et al., 2008, Trist, 1981). The mitigation of the undesirable
    consequences of existing and emerging technologies and IS necessitates intervention
    in the form of sustainability transitions (Loorbach et al., 2017, Smith et al.,
    2005), moving beyond the existing multi-level perspective (Geels, 2004, Geels,
    2011) toward transdisciplinarity. At the heart of these transitions is the establishment
    and socio-technical (re)design of higher education frameworks resulting in new
    forms of knowledge production, allowing for the design and redesign of human-centered
    socio-technical systems for sustainability, and consequently for human benefit
    (Geels, 2010, Verbong and Geels, 2010). The proposed socio-technical intervention
    would require commitment to a series of stages or flows, as depicted in Fig. 1,
    which we define as the Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle. These include:
    (i) establishing a detailed understanding and conceptualization of the tightly
    coupled natural and human systems in context and in view of interactions and feedback
    loops; (ii) implementing the appropriate sustainability transition through a process
    of socio-technical (re)design; (iii) measuring the effect of the design over time
    in view of the degree to which negative externalities are reduced or mitigated;
    (iv) assessing the impact on human health and wellbeing, in addition to environmental
    sustainability; and (v) iterating to ensure continual evaluation of the tightly
    coupled system given its evolving nature. It should be noted that despite this
    proposed cycle, there will be cases in which paradoxical externalities occur,
    which is an inherent and unavoidable characteristic of tightly coupled systems.
    This occurs for two reasons: (i) events in nature are not always predictable no
    matter how “controlled” the socio-technical transitions are through, for example,
    regulation and policy mandates (Smith et al., 2005), and (ii) interventions themselves
    are a form of “technology” that are subject to independent and autonomous forces
    that are “uncontrollable” (Winner, 1978). Download : Download high-res image (251KB)

    cycle. 3.2.7.2. Sustainability transitions through transdisciplinarity The proposed
    model suggests that our global challenges and significant problems require a transdisciplinary
    lens, beyond a multi-level perspective, in which design interventions are required
    in the form of sustainability transitions. Within this model, the information
    systems discipline has a significant and mediating role given its socio-technical
    orientation and appreciation of the open systems paradigm (Scott and Davis, 2015,
    von Bertalanffy, 1950, Watson et al., 2010). For instance, step (ii) in Fig. 1
    would markedly involve a redefinition of technological and information system
    design and development processes (Schoormann, Stadtländer, & Knackstedt, 2021),
    characterized by the emergence of a supportive human-centered, transdisciplinary
    educational framework (Crow & Dabars, 2015) oriented toward a public interest
    technology (PIT) research agenda (Abbas et al., 2021a, McGuinness and Schank,
    2021, Michael and Abbas, 2020). Transdisciplinarity, in the context of the proposed
    sustainability transitions, typifies trans-institutional, trans-sectoral and trans-national
    frameworks bringing together at a minimum industry, government and academia toward
    the production of knowledge (Crow & Dabars, 2017, p. 474; Hadorn, 2008). This
    involves recognition that while all problems are local and community focused,
    their impacts are increasingly global, given the age of entanglement we now live
    in (Hillis, 2016 as cited in Crow & Dabars, 2020, p. 381), and the tight coupling
    of natural and human systems, as described above. In considering sustainability
    transitions more specifically, the proposed Socio-Technical Sustainability Design
    Cycle would promote Public Interest Technology (PIT) research, empowering citizens
    and communities (Pitt, Michael, & Abbas, 2021). It would additionally emphasize
    the importance of directing attention to highly integrative basic and responsive
    (HIBAR) research (Crow & Dabars, 2020, p. 376), which is still lacking internationally,
    despite the creation of globally oriented goals such as the United Nations Millennium
    Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (World Health
    Organization, 2015). In transitioning to HIBAR research and practice that requires
    PIT processes and innovations, we are seeking to recognize negative externalities
    and to continually strive to reduce them by introducing alternative socio-technical
    design options in each selection environment (Nelson & Winter, 1977, pp. 61–70).
    3.2.7.3. A public interest technology research agenda for sustainability A preliminary
    phase in operationalising the proposed design cycle and implementing sustainability
    transitions is the strategic realignment of IS, and/or the higher education system
    to proceed toward the production of knowledge and socio-technical innovations
    that are purpose driven and in the public interest (Abbas & Michael, 2021), facilitating
    an integrated and responsive approach to addressing our global challenges and
    key problems (Melville, 2010). Capturing first principles from foundational theories
    and frameworks across disciplines, including IS, and merging them to form a transdisciplinary
    lens will allow for the creation of models and simulations that afford a high-level
    view or conceptualization of existing major forces and counterforces (Frodeman,
    2014, Scholz, 2020). Achieving such a capability commands stakeholder engagement
    in the provision of data to an emergent knowledge system, encapsulating multi-level
    perspectives (local-national-global) within socio-cultural, business, techno-economic
    and institutionally-relevant policy contexts (Köhler et al., 2019). We suggest
    that the role of emerging technologies and IS, as they relate to this knowledge
    system, be embedded within a PIT framework (see Abbas, Pitt, & Michael, 2021,
    Fig. 1), represented as a complex, open socio-technical ecosystem that is informed
    by the landscape of technological and IS developments. The framework also acknowledges
    the corresponding application areas and the link to financing models, stakeholder
    engagement (balancing lived experience and professional expertise), transdisciplinary
    theorizations/conceptualizations and operationalisation to achieve the goal of
    sustainability toward human health and wellbeing (Abbas et al., 2021). 3.2.7.4.
    The role of IS/IT education The subsequent and corresponding phase in operationalising
    the proposed Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle relates to the elimination
    of disciplinary silos in higher education institutions, that have existed since
    scientific endeavor was acknowledged as the foundation of the Age of Enlightenment.
    Through the deliberate reconfiguration or redesign of university structures, new
    transdisciplinary agendas can be positioned to respond to global challenges (Crow
    & Dabars, 2015, ch. 5; Gholami, Watson, Hasan, Molla, & Bjorn-Andersen, 2016).
    In order to ensure our long-term sustainability as a species and a planet, university
    design must undergo a rapid rethink, becoming more adaptive and agile but also
    closely aligning to public and planetary challenges (Crow & Dabars, 2020). The
    transition to transdisciplinarity, even interdisciplinarity, remains fraught with
    risk principally with respect to forming meaningful ties between Computing, Informatics,
    Business (including Information Systems) and Engineering schools in addition to
    other non-STEM domains of knowledge. A harmonization is required not only within
    the STEM disciplines, but going beyond traditional collaborative fields to incorporate
    action-oriented endeavors through the creation of Schools dedicated to Sustainability
    or Life Sciences (Tejedor, Segalàs, & Rosas-Casals, 2018). Here the traditional
    research university is challenged to apply itself to real-world problems. However,
    irrespective of the inevitable difficulties, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated
    the importance of solidarity toward collective action, harnessing the knowledge
    produced from both professional expertise/practice and the lived experience. The
    IS discipline is in a prime position to offer information and knowledge management
    expertise to support transdisciplinarity, and it is our obligation to actively
    implement sustainability transitions and responsible systems design (Monson, 2021),IS
    research (Pan & Zhang, 2020) and innovation (Stilgoe, Owen, & Macnaghten, 2013)
    in the interest of sustainable futures (Hadorn et al., 2006, Hess and Ostrom,
    2007). 3.3. Impact on people and communities 3.3.1. Contribution 13 – promoting
    IT innovation to improve the global environment: towards establishment of global
    co-creation & co-evolution models – Professor Mitsuru Kodama 3.3.1.1. IT innovation
    through convergence The leading core technologies in the cutting-edge technology
    fields of IT, energy, automobiles, electronics, semiconductors, biotechnology,
    pharmaceuticals and materials science, etc. have become dispersed among individuals,
    companies and organizations across the globe. The integration of these superior
    core technologies is a source of innovation of new products and services. (e.g.,
    Kodama, 2007). Across various fields in society, IT innovation is changing working
    practices, lifestyles, the way products are made and resources are used in production
    activities. IT technology is being incorporated into a variety of advanced devices
    and contributing directly and indirectly to the reduction of CO2 emissions. IT
    innovation is driving energy-efficient manufacturing by promoting energy-saving
    investments and measures. Such IT innovation will bring about “convergence” -
    the fusion and integration of different technologies and services and the building
    of business models across different industries. Meanwhile, with the adoption of
    the Paris Agreement, a new international framework for the reduction of greenhouse
    gas emissions and other measures from 2020, all participating countries, including
    those that are developed, emerging and developing, are strongly urged to take
    measures to combat global warming. Specifically, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
    and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been trending globally in recent years while
    collaboration and fusion of the IT industry with various other industrial fields
    is transforming various businesses, social activities and the lives of people.
    Backing the evolution of these innovative technologies is the convergence of IT
    and electronics technologies, including sensing and location information technologies,
    energy management systems (HEMS, BEMS, FEMS, etc.), energy-saving devices and
    data utilization. Furthermore, smart communities such as smart towns and smart
    cities, into which many countries are currently pouring efforts, are attracting
    attention as next-generation social systems that connect homes, buildings, and
    transportation systems with IT networks to make effective local use of energy.
    IT solutions including energy management systems such as HEMS, BEMS and FEMS to
    optimize operation smart meters, renewable energy and EVs, etc., and CEMS to integrate
    the management of those as well as transportation systems such as ITS are becoming
    indispensable in smart communities. The development of these innovative technologies
    will greatly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and enable a dramatic
    increase in energy reduction benefits. Furthermore, XR technology, which has a
    promising future, will contribute directly and indirectly to global environmental
    issues by minimizing the physical resources generated, utilized, and consumed
    in various processes in social, economic, and management activities. Therefore,
    IT industries in every country need to contribute to global society by further
    strengthening technological and business partnerships with various industries,
    supply chains and venture businesses to promote new technologies and businesses
    through convergence strategies that will open up the future while understanding
    environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures. To date, the
    advances of IT have shortened the time and space in business processes and supply
    chains across a whole range of industries, accelerated decision-making and raised
    business efficiency, and have given birth to new business models that transcend
    and converge dissimilar industries (Kodama, 2020, Kodama, 2021). IT innovation
    promotes industry-wide co-creation & co-evolution to improve the global environment
    and increases the possibility of forming dynamic “global ecosystems” as new value
    chains (see Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (897KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Global IT innovation through IT- leadership. Through such
    convergence, what actions should companies, public bodies, government organizations,
    and a country as a whole take in terms of strategy building and organizational
    reform to create new business models that integrate different technologies and
    create IT innovations across industries? What kind of national leadership and
    management is required to achieve this? These are just a few of the many practical
    issues facing many stakeholders around the world, including those in academic
    research. 3.3.1.2. Research agenda related to IM/IT/IS While individual industries,
    companies, and governmental organizations in each country have their own strategies,
    the key concept of organizational behavior to adapt to (or create) the convergence
    worldview is new “strategic knowledge integration” at the global level. Organizational
    platforms that support such global strategic knowledge integration are global
    IT community formations. Global IT communities are important organizational platforms
    for evolving the core knowledge in one’s own country while at the same time actively
    exploring and integrating the best knowledge from around the world with the core
    knowledge of one’s own country (see Fig. 2). To drive global strategic knowledge
    integration, the most crucial issue is not only to integrate the diverse knowledge
    of different organizations within a company, but also to form global IT communities
    with superior stakeholders including customers around the world and integrate
    the best knowledge in the external environment, an ecosystem consisting of globally
    dispersed knowledge, with the knowledge in the organizations within a company.
    The key word to accelerate such global knowledge integration inside and outside
    an organization is “IT collaboration”. In forming global IT communities across
    the world, “collaborative dynamic capabilities” (Kodama, 2018) to appropriately
    generate, evaluate, and use common knowledge (i.e., lexicon, meaning, and interests)
    (Carlile, 2004) regarding environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures
    among diverse stakeholders, are a trigger to realize IT collaboration. In addition,
    the “IT-leadership” of national leaders is crucial to accelerate new strategic
    knowledge integration through IT collaboration through the formation of global
    IT communities across a wide range of countries. For this purpose, “holistic leadership”
    (Kodama, 2017) through the holistic thinking and actions of world leaders will
    be a particularly important factor of management. However, existing studies in
    the IM/IT/IS fields have shed little light on the details of the theoretical concepts
    and practical processes of global IT community formation. Furthermore, there is
    very little accumulated research on IT collaboration. The holistic IT-leadership
    of leaders will play a role in forming and developing the organizational platforms
    of global IT communities. Hence, the cultivation of such leaders will become a
    pressing issue going forward. 3.3.2. Contribution 14 – smart city initiatives
    to maximize information value for sustainability – Professor Brenda Scholtz The
    growing population, particularly in urban areas, has put pressure on researchers
    and society to address challenges surrounding the global lack of scarce resources
    and the negative impact on the environment (Khatoun and Zeadally, 2016, Kumar
    et al., 2020). The technological footprint of companies and individuals has exacerbated
    this problem since technologies are mainly reliant on fossil fuel, thus the more
    technology used, the more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, creating
    global warming. Technology manufacturers and implementers therefore need to consider
    adopting practices of environmentally sustainable computing. This phenomenon can
    be viewed as sustainability in technology or Green IT, where the priority must
    be to reduce the negative impact of an organization’s technological footprint.
    On the other hand some argue that providing individuals and organizations with
    access to information and technology can assist people with living more conveniently
    and easily; for example reducing travel and our carbon footprint. This phenomenon
    can be referred to as sustainability by technology, whereby we need to reduce
    the negative impact of companies and their value chains by enabling sustainability
    use cases or initiatives. The interplay of sustainability in technology and by
    technology must therefore be addressed by all stakeholders in industry and academia.
    One solution to achieving this interplay is to utilize the capabilities of information
    management (IM) and the related field of information systems (IS), which are reliant
    on the acquisition of information, the custodianship and distribution of that
    information to those who need it, and its ultimate disposal through archiving
    or deletion thereof. However, valuable information can only be provided to users
    if access to data is available. The Economist has described data as “the oil of
    the digital era”. However, others, such as the Centre on Regulation in Europe,
    argue that this “often-used analogy between data and oil is misleading.” Their
    argument is that data, unlike oil, is not scarce and therefore it cannot be likened
    to oil (MacCarthy, 2018). One thing that everyone agrees on, is that the digital
    economy cannot live without data and that it remains an immeasurably valuable
    and unexplored asset. More than 90% of the world’s data has been created in the
    last two years – more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. We are experiencing
    an information explosion. Herbert Simon, the Nobel prize-winning psychologist
    and economist, stated way back in 1971 that “In an information-rich world, the
    wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever
    it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious:
    it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates
    a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among
    the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.” (Bélanger, Van
    Slyke, & Crossler, 2018). The potential value of data, information flow and technology
    to address the effective management of scarce resources has been the driver of
    the Smart City concept (Ismagilova et al., 2019). According to Albino, Berardi,
    and Dangelico (2015): “A Smart City is based on intelligent exchanges of information
    that flow between its many different subsystems. This flow of information is analyzed
    and translated into citizen and commercial services. The city will act on this
    information flow to make its wider ecosystem more resource-efficient and sustainable.
    The information exchange is based on a Smart Governance operating framework designed
    to make cities sustainable”. The promotion of a Smart Environment is one of the
    core dimensions of a Smart City (Van der Hoogen, Scholtz, & Calitz, 2020). The
    success factors that are linked to this dimension are the attractiveness of natural
    conditions, environmental protection policies, having a sustainability strategy
    for resource management, and making sure that a city is ‘future proof’. A sustainability
    strategy should enable an integrated view of socio-economic, political and environmental
    visions; thus focusing on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United
    Nations. Future-proof refers to the ability of something that allows it to continue
    to be of value into the distant future such that the item does not become obsolete.
    Another core dimension for a Smart City is that of Smart Policy, meaning that
    any Smart City initiative should align with the strategy of the city, the country
    (government laws), intergovernmental agreements and of course global policies
    (Garg et al., 2017, Yadav et al., 2017). Policies here include environmental policies
    and those related to information governance and therefore IM. The privacy of personal
    data and information is causing much concern and therefore acts and regulations
    are important in the context of a Smart City. In South Africa the Protection of
    Personal Information Act (POPIA) was implemented in 2013 to protect the information
    and privacy of people, but was only enforced on 1 July 2020 (POPIA, 2020). The
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European equivalent to the POPIA
    for South Africa (GDPR, 2018). In addition to these acts, companies are also pushed
    to have their own information governance and management policies and guidelines.
    Another dimension that is closely linked to climate change issues is that of Smart
    Mobility. This dimension focuses on factors that involve sustainable, innovative
    and safe transport systems that are accessible locally, nationally and internationally
    (Calderón et al., 2017, Yadav et al., 2017). IoT is an integral part of Smart
    Mobility and is regarded as an enabling technology of big data (Bibri, 2019).
    However, big data is only valuable once quality data is produced, which is required
    for intelligent decision making to contribute to sustainable smart cities. The
    Smart City definition illustrates the importance of information exchange within
    a Smart City and therefore the importance of the provision of open data and the
    creation of open data hubs. Smart Technology and ICT-infrastructure is considered
    a support dimension of a Smart City since it is integral to all the other dimensions.
    It refers to the different types of smart technologies that are used in a Smart
    City and since these technologies produce and utilize data, it also involves relating
    all the data in smarter ways. Some of the opportunities for smart cities are that
    the data is in a digital format through IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    machine learning technologies, making real-time collection, processing and sharing
    easier and therefore, decision making and solution development is becoming faster
    and more advanced (Allam & Dhunny, 2019). Providing access to quality data through
    the related strategy of information governance is becoming more and more critical.
    Information governance is the overall strategy for information and provides a
    balance between the risks of the information with the value that this information
    can provide. Data quality forms part of governance, since it is focused on the
    integrity and value of the information itself. When the factors of a Smart City
    concept are integrated, such as ICT, urban infrastructure, open data with data
    governance, and stakeholder participation, equitable and sustainable solutions
    can be developed to face city challenges (Yadav et al., 2017). Stakeholder participation
    is emphasized in the Smart People dimension of a Smart City and it is here that
    the importance of skills, qualifications and education is addressed. The lack
    of skills lies in the areas of IT/IS and Computer Science graduates in general,
    but in particular with regard to Data Science, AI and machine learning competencies.
    Higher education has started addressing the need for these competencies in the
    recent IS2020 curricula guidelines (IS2020, 2020). Competencies related to sustainability
    and environmental issues are also included in the IS2020 guidelines as social
    and ethical considerations. In Germany and South Africa modules related to Green
    IT, and environmental information systems have been introduced in recent years.
    So whilst some progress has been made, much more effort and investigations need
    to take place to introduce more competencies regarding sustainable technologies,
    data management, data analytics and data science into IS/IT and CS degree programs.
    Much research has been done on the topics of smart cities, Green IT and ICT for
    sustainability. However, reported empirical studies on IS for meeting the SDGs
    are still considerably low, particularly with regard to sustainable management
    of water and sanitation (SDG 6); access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and
    modern energy for all (SDG 7); and conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas
    and sustainable behavior (SDG 14). In Africa and other developing countries these
    three SDGs are far from being met, where access to clean water and energy are
    major problems for the vast majority of the population. There is also a lack of
    valuable information and empirical research regarding emerging smart cities, especially
    in developing countries (Backhouse, 2015, Estevez et al., 2016). This lack of
    information prevents stakeholders from making informed decisions, such as how
    to manage the city resources more efficiently or how to attract potential investors.
    3.3.3. Contribution 15 – wider issues in IS research on climate change – Professor
    Rahul De’ In The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, noted
    writer Amitav Ghosh (2018) points to the absence of writing on the destruction
    of nature and habitats through the devastation wrought by Imperialism and the
    rise of industrial capitalism. He calls this absence in the canon of English literature
    the ‘great derangement’ where thinkers and intellectuals are oblivious to the
    plainly visible damage done to the planet. This neglect of climate change continued
    in writings in history and politics. Ghosh calls for an awakening to recognize
    and give voice to the scale of the ‘unthinkable’ impact of this phenomenon. Ghosh’s
    call resonates in IS research, where this phenomenon is recognized as a ‘critical
    challenge’ for researchers and practitioners (Gholami et al., 2016; Eliot and
    Webster, 2017). The call is for more extensive research on climate change and
    its impact on the world, where ‘grand challenges’ require a wider understanding
    of the phenomena and a scoping that includes ideas and concepts outside of current
    disciplinary concerns (Winter & Butler, 2011). Following this reasoning, three
    possible issues are presented in this brief essay that can address the scale of
    climate change concerns, and, which also resonate with prior IS research. These
    ideas have to do with engaging with issues of the postcolonial condition; a focus
    on the impact of climate change on ordinary people; and its impact on women. 3.3.3.1.
    Focus on postcolonial condition Prior research in IS has examined the postcolonial
    condition prevailing in former colonies of large imperial nations of the West,
    which includes most of the developing and less-developed world (Lin et al., 2015,
    Ravishankar et al., 2013). This condition essentially refers to the power asymmetry
    between former rulers and the ruled, and defines the cultural and political practices
    of both, even though there is no present-day colonial presence. The postcolonial
    condition is perpetuated largely through multinational corporations and global
    agencies. Global actors, such as large multinational corporations and multilateral
    agencies (like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), have a massive
    and disproportionate effect on world affairs. Their beliefs, policies, and practices
    affect millions of people directly and indirectly, as they influence governments
    and the actions that governments take. These institutions have a strong influence
    on the uptake of information technology in many nations, through efforts such
    as electronic governance, ICT for development, and spread of technologies to reduce
    the digital divide (De, Pal, Sethi, Reddy, & Chitre, 2018). They also have a strong
    influence on industrialization, deforestation, energy consumption patterns, and
    the overall adoption of modern technologies. Prior research has shown that many
    “development” projects ultimately harm subaltern people, who are the poor and
    marginal groups, rather than benefit them (Ferguson, 1994), and scholars often
    doubt the very benefits of development in such situations and contexts (Escobar,
    2011). Green IS research that is concerned with recording and analyzing the impact
    of climate change (Melville, 2010) must also document the postcolonial conditions
    and the impact of multilateral agencies. When agencies fund, say, construction
    of roads or dams or massive irrigation projects, the impact on the environment
    must be documented and the particulars of local politics, struggles, and contestation
    must be recorded. Crowd-sourcing technologies may be used to both record the different
    perspectives of people, and also to arrive at a possible consensus (Malone & Klein,
    2007). 3.3.3.2. Focus on people Though there is considerable work on Green IT
    and Green IS from the perspective of organizations and how they can manage their
    consumption and production patterns (Dedrick, 2010, Khuntia et al., 2018, Melville,
    2010), the emphasis must also include the manner in which ordinary people in urban
    and rural areas, in remote mountainous regions, on isolated islands, and in forests
    are affected, and how they are using IT to both learn about and counter the effects
    of climate change (Watson et al., 2021). The focus can be on local and indigenous
    approaches to adapting to climate change, and how digital technologies can support
    those, with information and feedback. One problem that can be addressed through
    both design science and action research is that of measuring the changes that
    are slowly and inevitably happening, and how people are adapting to them. These
    changes are in local climate conditions, in soil composition, in levels of water
    tables and aquifers, and in the extent and survival of local flora and fauna.
    These changes may be viewed from multiple perspectives of resource depletion for
    businesses or from that of people’s livelihood, and the impact on local sustainability
    (Clarke & Davison, 2020). 3.3.3.3. Focus on gender Theorizing about climate change
    around issues of mitigation and impact cannot be “gender blind” (Pearse, 2017).
    In rural areas, the brunt of droughts, flooding, soil degradation, river erosion,
    salinization, and loss of food crops, is felt largely by women (Alston, 2015).
    With these drastic and adverse changes in agricultural conditions, there follows
    shortages in food, nutrition deficiency for both women and children, loss of livelihood,
    and increase in debt (Chandra, McNamara, Dargusch, Caspe, & Dalabajan, 2017).
    Though both men and women suffer the consequences of extreme climate events, it
    is women who are worse off as national policies do not fully account for them,
    and relief measures are not easily accessible to them. When climate change events
    force populations to migrate, women are worse off as they lose their local social
    networks, are subject to abuse, and are unable to secure livelihoods on foreign
    soil. The gender imbalances are exacerbated and become entrenched (Alston, 2015).
    Prior research in IS has established the imbalanced access that women have to
    both ICT devices and facilities in developing regions (Rashid, 2016). As they
    are most prone to adverse effects of climate change, research has to both reveal
    these deprivation issues, and find ways to address them. 3.3.3.4. Conclusion IS
    research has an opportunity to sidestep the great derangement in literary culture
    by both exposing the causes and consequences of climate change, and finding ways
    and means to address them. Some work has already started on understanding concerns
    of postcolonial dominance, identifying issues of ordinary people, and understanding
    the particular challenges faced by women. Future research will likely build on
    this. 3.4. Responsible digitalization 3.4.1. Contribution 16 – corporate digital
    responsibility: the powerful offspring of sustainability and digitization – Professor
    Michael Wade 3.4.1.1. Two dominant trends Two of the most significant global business
    trends over the past several years have been sustainability and digitization.
    Sustainability revolves around the natural world, most notably humanity’s impact
    on our planet. Digitization, by contrast, focuses on the virtual world. Without
    obvious common roots, these two megatrends have largely developed independently
    of one another (Naujok, Fleming, & Srivatsav, 2018). I recently had a conversation
    with the Chief Sustainability Officer of a consumer goods company and when I asked
    him about digital and sustainability, he looked back at me blankly. However, this
    is likely to change. If we expand the definition of sustainability to include
    responsible and ethical practices of all kinds, not just those that impact the
    planet, we see plenty of intersection points. Examples include cyber-security,
    data privacy protection of employees and customers, digital diversity and inclusion,
    ethical algorithms including AI, technology component recycling, right to repair,
    ethical gig economy practices, and there are many others. Unfortunately, our research
    suggests that most organizations today are unprepared to effectively respond to
    these challenges. If they do so at all, it is in a fragmented manner. This opens
    up new and interesting avenues for research. 3.4.1.2. A new field of corporate
    digital responsibility It is time to bring these disparate and fragmented elements
    together under a single umbrella so that they can be addressed in a consistent
    and complementary manner. We refer to this new consolidated focus as Corporate
    Digital Responsibility (CDR) (Lobschat et al., 2021). CDR can be regarded as a
    subset of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), an already established entity
    in many organizations. Corporate digital responsibility is defined as a set of
    practices and behaviors that help an organization use data and digital technologies
    in a way that is socially, economically, and environmentally responsible (Wade,
    2020). 3.4.1.3. Each CDR sub-categories contains a number of areas Social Corporate
    Digital Responsibility revolves around an organization’s relationship to people
    and society. The important topic of data privacy protection of customers, employees,
    and other stakeholders is included here. It also incorporates aspects of digital
    diversity and inclusion, such as bridging an increasing divide between digital
    haves and have nots across geographies, industries, social classes, and age. There
    are also societal impacts of inaccurate A.I. decision-making algorithms that can
    lead to unfair or discriminatory practices, as has been noted among many recommendation
    engines (Noriega, 2020). Other technologies can also have harmful effects on society.
    Facebook, among others, banned so-called deep fake videos that realistically apply
    false or misleading statements to real people. Economic Corporate Digital Responsibility
    relates to the responsible management of the economic impacts of digital technologies.
    Much has been said about the replacement of human jobs by robots and other digital
    technologies, and this is certainly a relevant part of economic CDR. Yet, it also
    relates to the creation of new jobs in a digital world that are enriching, purposeful,
    and interesting. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the so-called gig
    economy creates jobs that are often uninteresting, repetitive, and underpaid (Tan
    Z.M., 2021). There are also questions regarding the sharing of the economic benefits
    of digitization with society through taxation of digital work, and fair compensation
    of data monetization to the original owners. Finally, Environmental Corporate
    Digital Responsibility concerns the link between digital technologies and the
    physical environment. There are many issues here, including the responsible recycling
    or disposal of old computer equipment. The extension of obsolescence cycles by
    one year, for example, can have an enormous impact on the environment.5 There
    are also issues regarding the limiting of power consumption, including reducing
    the use of electricity to support bitcoin mining. 3.4.1.4. A call for a multi-disciplinary
    focus on CDR Many organizational processes, practices, and projects exist to address
    digital aspects of social, economic, and environmental responsibility. Yet, they
    are rarely coordinated or optimized. Some, like cybersecurity, tend to be the
    responsibility of IT departments, others, like workforce automation, may fall
    under the purview of operations, and yet other elements may sit with HR, legal,
    engineering, R&D, or particular lines of business. Without effective coordination,
    organizations leave themselves open to risks, and may miss out on rewards. Research
    too, is required to better understand the dynamics of CDR from both theoretical
    and empirical perspectives. This research will need to be multi-disciplinary since
    CDR covers aspects of many different fields, including IS (the coordination of
    technology and people), IT (the ethical design of technologies themselves), operations
    (the development of systems and practices to embed CDR in organizational processes),
    organizational design (how to set up structures to effectively govern CDR activities),
    strategy (how to align CDR with other organizational objectives), and OB (how
    to train people to act in responsible ways). In summary, as the sustainability
    and digitization trends continue to grow, Corporate Digital Responsibility will
    become increasingly relevant for organizational performance, both to mitigate
    risks as well as find new sources of advantage. As researchers, we need to get
    ahead of this trend not only to better understand it, but to influence its development
    through the creation and dissemination of tools, frameworks and best practices
    to practicing managers. 3.4.2. Contribution 17 – digitalization and the myth of
    sustainability: some critical reflections – Professor Suprateek Sarker Digitalization
    is all around us, and we are all well aware of the value digitalization brings
    to help improve many facets of human existence. Indeed, when we think about digitalization,
    most of us see the positive impacts digitalization has had, and can potentially
    have, on the environment. After all, in digitizing business processes, we drastically
    reduce, even eliminate the consumption of paper, which saves trees, and in turn
    contributes to better environmental outcomes. We also think of how, through metering,
    we are able to encourage consumers to consume less electricity, which again contributes
    to better environmental outcomes (e.g., Wunderlich, Veit, & Sarker, 2019). Perhaps
    a more high-profile example that we can all relate to pertains to the new generation
    of automobiles, that have been described as “computers on wheels” (Wade, 2016).
    Digitalization vehicles can help to optimize fuel and/or battery usage, and hence
    result in less pollution of the environment. Furthermore, metaphors like ‘cloud’
    imply something floating and delicate” and green, and add to our sense that digitalization
    is at the heart of our battle to save the environment (Crawford, 2021, p. 41)
    and can have a significant role in addressing climate change. Yet, many argue
    that the above represents a grossly biased picture, and is a consequence of the
    largely pro-digitalization, “digital utopia” narrative which includes the myth6
    of digitalization’s contribution to sustainability, that is promoted by tech companies,
    sections of the business press, and those fascinated by the wonders of digitalization.
    Crawford (2021), among others, provides a critical commentary on the “mineralogical
    layer” (p. 32) underlying digital technologies and AI that made me acutely aware
    of the environmental effects associated with digitalization. She notes that “seventeen
    rare earth elements,” that are part of virtually every digital device/technology
    surrounding us, have to be extracted from mines. Mining of such minerals is not
    only associated with slavery, conflicts, and human exploitation very often, but
    also results in dangerous waste. Specifically, she quotes David Abraham who writes
    “. 99.8% of earth removed in rare earth mining is discarded as waste… that are
    dumped back into the hills and streams” and this leads to “pollutants like ammonium…”
    (pp. 36–37). Particularly alarming is the estimate by the Chinese Society of Rare
    Earths that refining one ton of these elements “produces 75,000 liters of acidic
    water and one ton of radioactive residue” (p. 37). The amount of consumption of
    water and electricity by data centers and other components of the digital infrastructure
    is also shocking, but is largely hidden from view or consciousness of the average
    consumer or decision-maker, who is led to believe that digitalization is “clean”
    and a key part of the solution for the environmental crisis (pp. 42–45). Along
    similar lines, Wade (2016) suggests that in addition to batteries and their deleterious
    environmental impacts, “rare metals are sprinkled throughout vehicles, mostly
    in the magnets that are in everything from the headlights to the on-board electronics.
    But those rare metals come from somewhere—often, from environmentally destructive
    mines… and processed in less-than-green ways.” The point of highlighting the above
    issues is not that digitalization needs to stop. The point is to make people aware
    that there are environmental trade-offs that we are implicitly making when we
    use digital technologies. Indeed, by many accounts, the clean paperless image
    has been carefully cultivated, and it distorts the assessment of environmental
    impacts in one direction, in favor of further digitalization. As IS researchers
    who embrace the sociotechnical view (e.g., Sarker, Chatterjee, Xiao, & Elbanna,
    2019), we are aware that the need for efficiency, effectiveness, and economic
    value needs to be balanced with a consideration of humanistic outcomes. Given
    the critical role that the environment, especially in the form of climate change,
    is seen to play in shaping human wellbeing (even threaten survival), we need to
    consider environmental outcomes as an undeniable aspect of humanistic outcomes
    of digitalization. While outlining a research program is not feasible in a short
    editorial segment, there are a few points I would like to make, that may have
    implications for research and teaching: As researchers and teachers, we need to
    develop and communicate a balanced picture of digitalization, and not unreflectively
    perpetuate the “digital utopia” narrative. We must reflect on the culture that
    our societies have developed, of technology infusion in human processes as a natural
    course of development of organizations, economies, and societies. We need to develop
    frameworks and metrics that will help managers and technology consumers assess
    the economic value and convenience with respect to the true costs. Just as we
    have metrics to capture the economic value of digital technology implementation,
    we need to develop and incorporate the use of environment-related criteria and
    metrics as part of the proposal and justification process for any significant
    digitization initiative. At a very basic level, we need to ask why we need digital
    technology infusion in a certain aspect of life, and whether it is warranted when
    a holistic assessment is done. And, we need to develop conceptual and analytic
    tools to be able to carry out such assessments, even if such analysis is initially
    far from perfect. Obviously, the environmental damage resulting from the harnessing
    of digital technologies is a systemic issue involving many different stakeholders,
    and IS scholars cannot solve the problems themselves, but we need to actively
    consider how we may be part of the solution. We need to become aware of the issues,
    make the environmental costs transparent in our communication with stakeholders,
    conduct revelatory studies of the hidden environmental costs of certain technologies
    that are extolled, create models that incorporate benefits and costs including
    environmental costs, and, most importantly, make our students aware of the one-sidedness
    of the pro-digitalization narrative. We need to incorporate environmental impact
    analysis of digitalization initiatives as part of the IS curriculum, and foster
    an environmental consciousness among the students with respect to digitalization.
    Undoubtedly, a lot of research will be needed to enable decision makers to link
    environmental costs to a particular decision pertaining to digitalization. Many
    of us talk about responsible AI – here, my objective is to encourage responsible
    digitalization, and the responsibility is regarding environmental impacts of digitalization.
    As we set out on this path, I reiterate that our goal will not be to single-mindedly
    promote or oppose digitalization, but to “right-size” the extent of digital infusion
    in any initiative, after careful consideration of benefits and costs, where costs
    will not only consider the immediate tangible financial implications but also
    environmental costs over time that humanity will be left to bear. 3.4.3. Contribution
    18 – systems for sustainable growth – Professor Maung Sein and Dr Leona Chandra
    Kruse “Stark realities, critical choices […] Years, or even decades, of progress
    have been halted or reversed.” These alarming statements began this year’s Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) report, underlining the gloomy consequences of COVID
    19 related crises. The prospect, however, is not all doom and gloom. Digital transformation
    has been accelerated in various governmental and business sectors, and we need
    to continue harnessing the potentials of information systems to address key societal,
    economic, and ecological issues. Supported by well-designed information systems,
    researchers, economic actors, policymakers, and civil society can join forces
    to rebuild a more resilient and sustainable future. Perhaps no issue is more crucial
    now than the threat of climate change. This is not just an isolated threat: it
    directly challenges our conceptualization of sustainable growth and sustainability
    itself. We view sustainability as a synergy across people, planet, and profit,
    following the SDGs. We place a particular emphasis on a holistic view of information
    systems (IS) for sustainability which entails the study of designing, engineering,
    using, and disposing of information systems in order to minimize their environmental
    impact as well as to promote sustainability-related practices. This holistic view
    embraces different initiatives across various computing and informatics disciplines
    in the spirit of transdisciplinarity and multilateralism. In the following, we
    will delve into the role of IS in this crucial discourse on the threat of climate
    change. We will first set the scene by providing our perspective on IS and sustainability.
    We will then propose specific approaches that the IS research community can take
    to address the issues we raise. We will conclude our editorial segment by discussing
    issues related to evaluating the initiatives and frameworks aimed at meeting sustainability
    challenges. 3.4.3.1. Setting the scene The thirteenth SDG persuades us to “take
    urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,” and this year’s report
    continues to urge us on how “rising greenhouse gas emissions require shifting
    economies towards carbon neutrality” (United Nations (UN), 2021, p. 20). For us,
    this urging means exploring new and alternative approaches to minimize the environmental
    impact of information systems, in addition to our ongoing measures. We observe
    several ongoing transdisciplinary movements to this end. One of them, computing
    within limits, aims to reshape computing research by acknowledging a need for
    limits (LIMITS, 2021). This movement is guided by three core ideas: aiming for
    a steady-state economy and acknowledging the limit of growth, considering models
    of scarcity in order to promote resilience, and reducing energy and material consumption
    while avoiding the rebound effect (Nardi et al., 2018). Rethinking the status
    quo in our design and computing assumptions can help us shape the way forward.
    Minimizing the environmental impact of information systems, however, concerns
    not only the design and use period. We need to anticipate what happens in the
    post-use period, that is, minimizing and managing e-waste. This is echoed by the
    twelfth SDG: “ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” However,
    this year’s report shows that “electronic waste continues to proliferate and is
    not disposed of responsibly [.] Each person generates about 7.3 kg or e-waste,
    but only 1.7 kg was recycled” (United Nations (UN), 2021, p. 19). 3.4.3.2. Design
    science research for sustainability What can the IS community do to meet the enormous
    challenges posed by the threat of climate change in particular and to sustainability
    in general? The simple answer is that research needs to make this a key area to
    address. Understanding the phenomenon, explaining the mechanisms of climate change
    and predicting its consequences are agendas that continuously engage researchers
    from across the disciplines. We propose that the IS community can significantly
    contribute to these ongoing initiatives through designing artifacts (systems,
    prototypes, methods or frameworks). While designing systems in a way to best accomplish
    a particular purpose (combating climate change in our case here), lies at the
    very core of what we do in our discipline, our call here is to take a design science
    research (DSR) approach in our research. DSR aims at creating new prescriptive
    knowledge through building methods and artifacts to improve the world in some
    way, however incremental. The DSR paradigm is fundamentally a problem solving
    paradigm. It is not atheoretical tinkering – artifacts are developed based on
    theoretical and conceptual foundations, drawing upon the knowledge base for explanation
    research – and in the process creates theoretical and conceptual knowledge that
    are of prescriptive nature such as design principles that are transferable to
    other contexts. While care is taken to ensure rigor, the very fact that the artifacts
    developed through DSR are to solve problems faced by the society makes it relevant
    by definition. 3.4.3.3. Sustainability as value for design DSR is perfectly placed
    to meet the threats to sustainability. Among the papers and prototypes presented
    in the 2021 edition of the premier conference of the DSR community (Design Science
    Research in IS Technology – DESRIST), one is an excellent illustration of what
    the IS community can do. Hillebrand and Johannsen (2021) developed a chatbot called
    KlimaKarl “to Promote Employees’ Climate-Friendly Behavior in an Office Setting”.
    The App can be classified under “persuasive technology” that has been used successfully
    in the health sector to promote healthy living (e.g. weight management) through
    behavior change. Obviously such systems cannot force behavior change but can definitely
    informate users. A system of this genre can prove to be useful in the particular
    case of wind powered energy in Norway. While there is a broad support for developing
    green energy, many localities vehemently oppose constructing windmills in their
    areas. Systems can be effective in helping citizens see a balanced view and hopefully
    reduce opposition to windmills. DSR, like any research approach, is not value
    free (Iivari, 2010) and consequently, “the values of DSR should be made as explicit
    as possible” (p. 44). The burden of explicating the value of the designer and
    his/her goal in designing the artifact is essential to help the user understand
    the possible deleterious outcome or the unintended dark side of the technology.
    This is a particular sensitive issue with the use of persuasive technology in
    a debated issue such as sustainability. 3.4.3.4. Green practices within DSR Finally,
    environment-friendly practices such as green computing and green coding can be
    incorporated in the design of artifacts, whether as a DSR project or routine design.
    These practices help to minimize the environmental impact of the resulting information
    systems. The IS research community is also a user of IT. We need to be mindful
    of the potential e-waste of our research endeavor and ingrain e-waste management
    in our daily behavior. Some of the points in this editorial indeed represent critical
    choices which must be made in the face of the stark climate realities. 3.5. Role
    of data, technology and IS governance 3.5.1. Contribution 19 – climate change
    and role of information technologies – Professor Babita Gupta 3.5.1.1. Information
    technologies and climate change Information technologies require energy at every
    stage of its life-cycle and contribute to the carbon footprint. However, IT is
    also helping reduce net carbon emissions in various industry sectors. Technology-enhanced
    working using the video conferencing and cloud-based collaboration that has accelerated
    during the COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be a double-edged sword (Frontier technologies,
    2020). While these technologies helped the environment by significantly reducing
    the impacts of travel and commuting, they also increased carbon emissions since
    the backend infrastructure, such as massive data centers, is enormously energy-intensive.
    Current estimates of information and communication technology (ICT) impact range
    from 1.4% to 3.9% of global CO2 emissions, highlighting the need for accurate
    data on ICT’s impact on the environment (Cunliff, 2020, Murugesan, 2021, Robertson,
    2021). Several information technologies are poised to play a critical role in
    monitoring, managing, and mitigating climate change-related phenomena and increasing
    environmental resiliency. For example, artificial intelligence and robotics are
    being utilized for automated detection and monitoring of environmental hazards,
    remote sensing to track deforestation activities and marine life, monitoring biodiversity,
    traffic flow optimization, estimating real-time precipitations, and managing flood
    risks and emergency planning. Increasing occurrences of extreme weather events
    are affecting food production and distribution globally. Advancements in information
    technology utilizing multi-source spatial and temporal data, robotics, drones,
    Internet-of-Things (IoT), etc., are being explored in the agriculture and transport
    industry. For example, precision agriculture technology is an environmentally
    sustainable strategy for optimizing water input, weed control, disease eradication,
    pest reduction, and yield enhancement to avert water and food insecurity and optimize
    the food production chain. Data centers are the backbone for managing big data,
    cloud computing, AI, blockchain, and IoT. They also have massive power consumption
    needs contributing to climate change. Researchers and innovators are exploring
    novel technologies such as liquid cooling that improve heat-dissipation efficiency
    and reduce their impact on the environment to reduce the carbon footprint of data
    centers and other IT infrastructure. 3.5.1.2. Role of higher education in building
    environmental resiliency Higher education institutions can provide knowledge and
    resources to the learners and create awareness, inspiring the next generation
    to navigate the complexities of climate change. Education and training can encourage
    learners to think about technological and behavioral changes to reduce and mitigate
    environmental impact within their local sphere of influence and macro level. Institutions
    offering information systems and related programs are beginning to incorporate
    pedagogical practices in their curriculum that engage students to reflect on organizations’
    sustainable and responsible technology adoption and use practices. Educational
    institutions can create partnerships with community stakeholders to accelerate
    carbon-neutral business practices and build environmental resiliency. Several
    universities are forming coalitions committed to climate action, such as the University
    Climate Change Coalition, to leverage scientific knowledge and expertise for climate
    change solutions. In addition, universities are offering programs that emphasize
    environmental justice and equity, such as responsible business MBA and hospitality
    and sustainable management. 3.5.1.3. Research agenda and climate change The estimates
    for carbon dioxide levels in the year 2021 are at 417 parts per million. Bringing
    it down to the safer threshold of 350 parts per million would require the removal
    of about 2000 gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere over the next century (Fork
    and Koningstein, 2021, Frontier Technologies to Protect the Environment and Tackle
    Climate Change, 2020). This reversal of climate change would require everyone’s
    effort, including researchers in the IT, information systems, and related areas,
    to develop a robust and practical research agenda: Methodologies to assess the
    sustainability of ICT Infrastructure. • Develop an actionable set of metrics that
    can measure the reliable and precise impact of an information technology infrastructure,
    an IT project, or a portion of the cloud in terms of its carbon budget and footprint
    • Develop reporting mechanisms, models, and infrastructure that would make it
    easy for companies to evaluate their as well as their supply chain partners’ emissions
    and environmental impact. Sustainable, greener technologies. • Strategies grounded
    in organization behavior and culture that persuade companies to shift from fossil-fuel-based
    electricity to using cleaner, renewable energy solutions in their IT projects,
    technology infrastructure, and data centers • Creating mechanisms for designing
    sustainable technologies compliant to be carbon-neutral in the ICT industry by
    2050 • Models for integrating disparate data and prediction models and forecast
    systems for weather, traffic, demand, patterns of consumption, and real-time inventory
    that companies can use to optimize their supply chain and reduce waste and carbon
    footprint • Best practices to make the entire life cycle of IT greener, including
    energy-efficient hardware and software that has reusable code and is optimized
    for the green hardware. Resource recovery and reducing e-waste. • Research on
    e-waste management and strategies for e-waste prevention, smart recycling, and
    resource recovery, without shifting the e-waste burden to still-developing economies.
    Use of behavioral theories to engage stakeholders in climate change solutions.
    • Research on the role of social media and models grounded in behavioral theories
    that can prevent or at least reduce the impact of misinformation on public perception
    of climate change • Strategies to empower consumers so that the collective consumer
    sentiment about climate change imperative can incentivize companies to pursue
    carbon net-zero more actively as a goal • Research on digital and social media
    best practices to increase consumer awareness of the impact of their purchasing
    choices and decisions on environmental sustainability and design strategies that
    nudge consumers to adopt behavior that reduces their carbon footprint. Role of
    governance in climate change innovations. • Research on the role of governments
    in enabling effective guidelines, policies, legislation, incentives, R&D collaborations,
    and regulations about emission standards versus companies setting voluntary targets
    for achieving carbon neutrality within the critical time frame. • Research on
    the role of policy governance within the organizations when implementing IT projects
    and the evaluating impact on the environment. • Research on the role of social
    media and other digital tools to influence leaders in government and businesses
    to embrace sustainable consumption and production. 3.5.2. Contribution 20 – climate
    crisis response: climate crisis response: complex information governance for social
    sustainability – Professor Deborah Bunker "Climate change is destroying our path
    to sustainability. Ours is a world of looming challenges and increasingly limited
    resources. Sustainable development offers the best chance to adjust our course."
    – Ban Ki-moon (2012). We are amid an existential climate crisis which has been
    building since the onset of the industrial revolution (Jonsson, 2012). Information
    systems (IS) scholars continue to debate our contributions to tackle climate change
    and sustainability. In response to the global climate crisis, we are being called
    upon to “develop suitable theoretical frameworks to underpin the investigation
    of complex phenomena and complex problems” on a societal level (Hasan, Smith,
    & Finnegan, 2017, p. 298). In response to any crisis, however, we know that to
    develop and deploy resources effectively, an IS must produce an accurate, reliable,
    and trustworthy assessment of the situation at scale (Bunker, 2020). The key to
    achieving this ''situational awareness'' is the development and implementation
    of an accepted approach to complex information governance for response to societal
    problems and crises (Bunker, 2020, Smith and Stirling, 2008, Nüttgens et al.,
    2011). How the value, authenticity; accuracy; reliability; and legality of information
    is determined, controlled, and assured through acceptable governance mechanisms,
    is at the heart of how information is represented and used to develop situational
    awareness and support sustainability goals for climate action ". the ways in which
    these representations are articulated into knowledge that structure our overall
    understandings" (Smith & Stirling, 2008 - p. 2). Complex information governance
    has, however, been shown to be difficult to assure as seen in the financial market
    failures of 2001 and 2008 and more generally in the response to the current COVID-19
    pandemic. Information governance is defined as "a collection of competences or
    practices for the creation, capture, valuation, storage, usage, control, access,
    archival, and the deletion of information and related resources over its life
    cycle" (Mikalef, Bourab, Lekakos, & Krogstie, 2020). IS research on information
    governance, however, has mainly focussed on big data analytics and organizational
    innovation for formal IS. Far less is known about information governance in complex
    scenarios where formal IS and informal social IS might combine to jointly produce
    situational awareness on which to frame a response. Yet we know of many cases
    where trusted situational awareness, dynamic organizational collaboration and
    multi-stakeholder decision support have been produced by combining formal and
    informal IS. These include adoption and use of: – a cloud-based, freely available
    IS used by environmental non-government organizations (ENGO), for eco-collaboration
    activities in a structurally dynamic manner based on the NGO national context
    i.e., Thai, Lebanese, Australian (Aoun, Vatanasakdakul, & Bunker, 2011). – a combined
    open social media platform and proprietary job scheduling system to communicate
    with and organize a student volunteer army during the Christchurch Earthquakes
    (Bunker, Ehnis, Seltsikas, & Levine, 2013); and – an open social media platform
    for dynamic communication, coordination, and collaboration activities during Hurricane
    Harvey (2017) by emergency management agencies, media organizations, journalists,
    private individuals, celebrities, politicians, and influencers who took on the
    roles of information starters, information amplifiers and information transmitters
    (Mirbabaie, Bunker, Stieglitz, Marx, & Ehnis, 2020). These cases highlight an
    emerging need for development of effective complex information governance approaches
    for IS, using dynamic organizing principles. Lee, Zhu, and Jeffery (2019) researched
    information governance and data management for these types of platform ''ecosystems''.
    While they focussed on data governance and practices, they did not directly address
    the complexity of information governance where trusted situational awareness/consensus
    is developed at a societal level from a combination of formal and informal IS.
    In order to conceptualize and understand complex information governance for development
    of trusted situational awareness and response at scale, transitions may hold the
    key i.e. dynamic co-evolutionary processes that evolve from the "interplay of
    many unlike, particular processes" (Kemp, Parto, & Gibson, 2005, p. 23). Transitions
    present us with an opportunity to develop approaches for complex information governance
    as they are "aimed and guided in an iterative, forward-looking, adaptive manner,
    using markets, institutions and hierarchy (the three basic forms of coordination)"
    (Kemp et al., 2005, p. 23). These three forms of coordination are critical ''global
    levers'' for climate action so consensus regarding information governance at a
    transitional level is crucial for achievement of situational awareness, development
    of sustainability response/goals and resulting action. The key components or mechanisms
    of complex governance for social sustainability include: policy integration, common
    objectives, criteria, trade-off rules and indictors, information and incentives
    for practical implementation and programs for system innovation (Kemp et al.,
    2005). “The most significant challenge is to ensure that multi-player governance
    regimes embody capacity for sustainability-oriented co-ordination, direction and
    re-direction” (Kemp et al., 2005, p. 18). This can be achieved through the nature
    and dynamics of autopoiesis or self-producing/constructing physical systems (Bunker
    et al., 2013, Mingers, 2002, Mingers, 2004). These systems are: self-producing;
    contingently maintained (so that they don''t breakdown); structurally open but
    organizationally closed; structurally determined; able to be structurally coupled
    to other systems by mutual specification and/or co-evolution; and able to embrace
    embodied cognition and self-reference/recursion to enable self-construction/production
    (Mingers, 2002, p. 280). Transitional processes combined with the nature and dynamics
    of autopoietic systems, provide IS scholars with a theoretical basis for complex
    information governance development. The use of both formal organizational IS and
    informal personal/social IS in disaster management and crisis response, has been
    rapidly co-evolving at scale over the last decade (Ehnis & Bunker, 2020). While
    IS scholars have mainly focussed on information governance approaches for formal
    organizational IS, the self-producing/constructing attributes of hybrid IS which
    combine elements of the formal and informal have been largely ignored. The negative
    aspects of social systems and platforms and their combination/integration with
    formally managed and governed IS, have presented society with many problems (Elbanna,
    Dwivedi, Bunker, & Wastell, 2020). There is, however, potential for their management
    and use to effect positive outcomes for social sustainability and the response
    to the global climate crisis, if approaches to complex information governance
    are developed and implemented by IS scholars and practitioners. Currently there
    is a global focus on the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
    (STEM) education, but more recently there have been calls for a reframing of STEM
    from techno-science, towards a science of reconnection with nature (Smith & Watson,
    2020). IS courses and training can therefore, make a valuable contribution to
    the development of complex information governance for social sustainability at
    scale by developing and delivering units of study that focus on: 1) complex information
    governance and leadership for social sustainability - frameworks, concepts, descriptions,
    rules and communications approaches based on transitions and autopoietic systems;
    2) how to work in large and diverse teams - understanding, implementing and accommodating
    approaches to complex information governance; 3) and understanding the information
    governance of global supply networks and logistics for sustainable development
    goals. 3.5.3. Contribution 21 – climate change – IT – Data Science perspective
    – Ms Jeel Dharmeshkumar Shah The world’s climatic conditions seem to deteriorate
    every day, and the evidence from the research(Shaftel, 2021) held at NASA further
    bolsters this claim. The researchers at NASA further believe that the unprecedented
    warming trends today are the effect of human actions. Since most of these actions
    involve the development or use of technology, it certainly plays a significant
    role in climate change. The world today seems to be in a state of quandary. Whether
    to restrict the use of technology or invest in further research in the same field
    is a concern. However, in this case, I believe that the cause is the solution-
    just like the snake venom that is fatal for humans but is also proven to be medicinal
    and used to save lives. When the problem is so complicated, the solution must
    also be four-fold; we must take the System-of-Systems (SoS) approach. We must
    be able to analyze the dependencies of various systems - such as human, environmental,
    physical and information systems- which the SoS framework can enable. This could
    be a holistic approach to finding possible solutions to this complicated issue
    as it provides a good understanding from all viewpoints. Data Science is a required
    field for this discussion as it can analyze all forms of data and help automate
    crucial decisions. ‘Green Technology’ is expected to transform our society. The
    Climate Group, in their report, estimates that smart technologies such as smart
    homes/buildings, smart transport and logistics, intelligent agriculture management
    systems and smart electricity grids are a few of the various ways that can help
    reduce greenhouse emissions. It is Data Science that makes these technologies’
    Smart’ or ‘Intelligent’. While Big Data provides a platform for processing large
    chunks of heterogeneous data, Data Analytics and AI help analyze this data and
    identify trends (with the help of machine learning to identify main features and
    make predictions). This intelligence is then used in business to make informed
    and calculated decisions. Cloud computing can further be used to accelerate the
    process, and IoT could help apply these efficiently in a practical scenario. Analyzing
    the foot-fall data of various public transport systems, for example, could help
    identify efficient routes, and this ‘Smart Transport System’ would then optimize
    its fuel consumption and aid in reducing carbon footprints. Another such example
    would be a ‘smart air conditioning system’ that collects, compares and analyses
    weather and usage data to develop plans that optimize economic and environmental
    savings—solutions such as these help tackle issues regarding the sustainability
    of the climate. Various techniques followed by the Data Scientist aid this kind
    of analysis. Classification is one such technique that draws meaningful information
    and differentiates the data based on similarities found in its attributes. Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) can also be utilized in many practical scenarios for cause
    and effect analysis. One such example is the study carried out in the United States
    that used this technique to identify the factors affected due to differences in
    hydro-climatology of two different streams. This study successfully inferred how
    the differences affected the average runoff, flow stability(from baseline) and
    frequency of floods in the two areas (Poff, Tokar, & Johnson, 1996). Further improvements
    in the climate model were also made in 2003 (Knutti, Stocker, Joos, & Plattner,
    2003) to increase its efficiency with larger datasets. Calculations from this
    model revealed that almost half the members surpassed the surface heating range
    that the IPCC estimated earlier. In such challenging scenarios, neural networks
    can help extensively. It is all used to explore the general trend in climate change
    and its mechanisms to identify the hidden correlation/attributes in the data that
    is otherwise not decipherable. The use of Solar energy has become increasingly
    popular today as it is a renewable source of energy. One of the major drawbacks
    of this form of energy is that its availability widely depends on meteorological
    conditions. The efficiency and performance of a solar power plant would depend
    on these changing conditions. Jang, Bae, Park, and Sung (2016) has discussed how
    we can leverage images captured by the satellite to train a SVM (Support Vector
    Machine) model and predict the motion of clouds. This could be a brilliant way
    to determine when the plant would be most productive and when it would require
    backup. In this way, data analytics could help manage climate changes for uninterrupted
    and effective energy production. Climate change also significantly affects coral
    reefs that are important for the ecosystem as they provide food and shelter for
    their inhabitants. Thermal stress due to the warming of the ocean could cause
    infectious diseases, while frequent intense storms could lead to the destruction
    of the reefs. A rise in sea levels could lead to sedimentation, whose runoff can
    destroy the corals, while fluctuations in precipitation lead to an increase in
    runoff that could make the water murky and restrict the light. One such study
    (Franco, Hepburn, Smith, Nimrod, & Tucker, 2016) conducted in 2016 used the Bayesian
    Network approach to evaluate how climate change disturbances affected the coral
    reefs. The study revealed interesting results identifying the factor that contributed
    the most to the carbonate budgetary state of the reef and concluded that the change
    in the state of the reef was mainly due to the decrease in water quality (Franco
    et al., 2016). Data Science offers a plethora of such techniques that can be applied
    in the majority of challenging scenarios. It can help in the acquisition of environmental
    data as well as monitoring and analyzing it. This can help take immediate actions
    in case of an emergency or check if an industry is compliant with the pollution
    control requirements. Remote sensing and continuous data monitoring improve data
    availability that is the foundation for Data analysis. Risk analysis is another
    critical feature that can be used in combination with IoT enabled devices to send
    real-time alerts in case of high-risk prediction. These alerts and controls maintain
    safety by keeping a check on potential hazards. Results drawn from such analysis
    could also aid in finding sustainable alternatives. These advantages are very
    beneficial for governance, and the government has collaborated with the IT industry
    in developing and launching schemes that help alleviate the environmental conditions.
    The ‘National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)’ was established in 2020 by the central
    government that is predicted to reduce 20–30% of particulate matter concentration
    in 4 years by 2024 (NCAP, 2020). Another such flagship scheme introduced by the
    government is the ‘Namami Gange Programme’ that aims to reduce water pollution,
    conserve effectively and revive river Ganga (Namami Gange Programme, 2020). With
    the enormous number of benefits and applications, Data Science, in my opinion,
    has not yet reached its full potential. This is because ‘Data’ forms the foundation
    of Data Science, and without accurate and complete data, ambitious goals can be
    challenging to achieve. A recent paper published on the 10th of October 2021 (Callaghan
    et al., 2021) successfully collected enough evidence to conclude- based on mapping
    of 10000 attributes- that almost 80% of the land area globally is affected by
    climate changes caused by human actions. This is an excellent insight although
    the researchers also identified the ‘attribution gap’. Though the paper could
    draw important information about global climate models, it failed to understand
    the impact of climate on low-income countries. This was because they were unable
    to collect enough data from these regions. Shruti Nath, a researcher at Climate
    Analytics, said, “Developing countries are at the forefront of climate impacts,
    but we can see in our study there are real blind spots when it comes to climate
    impact data. Most of the areas where we are not able to connect the dots attribution-wise
    are in Africa. This has real implications for adaptation planning and access to
    funding in these places” (Mercator, 2021). Although curation of data and its quality
    remains a problem, my belief in the potential of this field stays unaltered. Though
    there are many hurdles on the way, Data Scientists are working hard in fighting
    these challenges and coming up with new and improved solutions every day. 3.5.4.
    Contribution 22 – the IS/IT in addressing the challenges of climate change – Dr
    Matti Mäntymäki 3.5.4.1. Need of increased attention to the sustainability implications
    of IS/IT Digital services, platforms, and infrastructures consume significant
    amounts of electricity globally. On the other hand, digital infrastructures consume
    electricity. From this vantage point, for example Bitcoin can hardly be considered
    an environmentally sustainable technology. Moreover, the upgrade from HD to 4–8 K
    quality in video has an effect on the energy consumption of the devices such as
    smartphones and tables used to watch the videos. Considering the global smartphone
    penetration, energy consumption of smartphones is a significant sustainability
    issue. All in all, this calls for increased attention to the sustainability implications
    of IS/IT development and operations. This in turn requires that sustainability
    impact of digital services, platforms, and infrastructures be measured and monitored
    in a reliable and transparent fashion. 3.5.4.2. Reducing digital waste through
    IS/IT design As the volumes of data being created, transmitted, and stored have
    skyrocketed also the volumes of ’digital waste’, i.e. unused digital content,
    have surged. To provide some perspective of this phenomenon, CO2 emissions of
    YouTube in 2019 was evaluated to equal a city size of Glasgow.7 A well-known example
    of how IS/IT design could reduce CO2 emissions is not to show video for users
    who are only listening to audio. This idea of digital waste reduction videos could
    be taken a step further by default by asking the user if he/she wants to see the
    video in addition to the audio content. In addition, energy efficiency can be
    considered in website design. Typically, today’s websites are dynamic. While this
    design approach offers benefits in terms of user experience, it basically requires
    that the server hosting the website creates the website for the user. A static
    website that is stored on the server and updated on a 12-hour or 24-hour interval
    is considerably more power efficient. 3.5.4.3. Research-based decision-making
    to accelerate adoption of ‘green initiatives’ Resulting from the increased innovation
    around Greentech, there will be various new technological solutions to address
    the challenges of climate change. The effectiveness and impact of technological
    tools is dependent on their successful implementation as well as adoption and
    use by the users. The academic IS community has worked on technology adoption
    for decades and the individual-level technology adoption has evolved to be one
    of the most mature areas of academic IS research (Venkatesh, Davis, & Morris,
    2007). Hence, the IS community is well-equipped to contribute to the deployment
    of various technological solutions targeted to fight climate change. 3.5.4.4.
    Sharing economy and circular economy as a means towards more resource-effective
    societies The sharing economy is one way for existing resources to be used more
    efficiently (Sutherland & Jarrahi, 2018). Sharing economy at scale is typically
    executed through digital platforms. Digital platforms such as Uber are famous
    for leveraging data, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence to predict
    and balance supply and demand. Another mechanism toward a more resource-efficient
    society is the circular economy. It is evident that executing a circular economy
    requires implementation of digital infrastructures where the physical and digital
    elements go hand-in-hand (see Lee, 2008; Rajkumar, Lee, Sha, & Stankovic, 2010).
    3.5.5. Contribution 23 – the value of information management in the built environment
    to tackle climate change – Mr Henry Fenby-Taylor The built environment is made
    up of sectors that have an outsize responsibility when it comes to the future
    of our planet. It provides us with our economic infrastructure – power lines,
    roads, railways, utilities, as well as our social infrastructure of homes, schools,
    hospitals and so on. Yet it also contributes around 40% of the UK’s total carbon
    footprint, according to the UK Green Building Council. There is a real sense of
    urgency that this needs to change. Industry leaders are increasingly in consensus
    that they need to prioritize how they mitigate and adapt to climate change, as
    well as reduce emissions. 3.5.5.1. Unlocking the value of data Critical to tackling
    climate change in the built environment will be the use of Information Management.
    It is currently a vast, largely untapped resource that will be pivotal in transforming
    the decision making process. At its core, Information Management is about making
    efficient use of resources – it’s about transforming information about the lifecycle
    of built assets into actionable intelligence. Effective information management
    gathers information across the lifecycle of assets from design to creation to
    operation. At each of these stages, data is collected that informs better decision
    making, enabling reductions in waste, time and cost, more efficient use of resources,
    improved design and safety and increased infrastructure resilience – all essential
    for reducing carbon emissions from our built environment and serving those it
    was intended for. Although we have the technology to collect large amounts of
    data it needs to be structured, managed and shared in an effective way to make
    it valuable. The Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB), through the National
    Digital Twin programme (NDTp) is creating the Information Management Framework
    which is a collection of open, technical and non-technical standards, guidance
    and common resources to enable secure and resilient sharing of data across sector
    and organizational boundaries. There are already some excellent examples of successful
    green Information Management in practice. The Energy and Carbon Reporting Framework
    developed by the CDBB, WMEBoom and the Construction Innovation Hub defines when
    operational energy and emissions need to be analyzed and reported during the lifecycle
    of built assets. This tool is providing organizations like NHS Scotland and their
    supply chain the ability to effectively identify and therefore control the energy
    and carbon impact of their built assets. It also supports the Construction Leadership
    Council''s CO2nstructZero programme which sets out how the construction sector
    can meet the Net Zero challenge. 3.5.5.2. Sharing data to improve climate resilience
    The sharing of data is an important part of the process. At the NDTp, the Climate
    Resilience Demonstrator (CReDo) provides a practical example of how connected
    data and greater access to the right information across organizational and sectoral
    boundaries can improve climate adaptation and resilience. Collaborating on CReDo
    are Anglian Water, BT and UK Power Networks who will use their asset and operations
    data as well as weather data on a secure, shared basis to inform an increased
    level of infrastructure resilience. CReDo will integrate data between energy,
    water and telecoms networks to improve climate resilience decision-making across
    infrastructure systems. 3.5.5.3. Fit for the future Although it is clear we should
    be pushing towards a green information economy, there remain hurdles - we need
    a workforce with the appropriate skills who can make it happen. Our work at the
    CDBB has a socio-technical focus and part of this is balancing the technology
    with the people aspect. That is why we commissioned a Skills and Competency Framework
    report, a joint collaboration between Mott MacDonald, Lane4 team and the Construction
    Innovation Hub, that sets out the key roles and skills needed. It is a very practical
    framework that allows organizations and individuals to assess their own needs
    and consider how to address them. 3.5.5.4. A shift in culture Data is no longer
    a commodity to be hoarded, but a resource to be shared. If industry and government
    are serious about tackling climate change there needs to be collaboration and
    there needs to be interoperability between information management systems, so
    that we use all the data we have in a relevant, impactful way. 3.5.6. Contribution
    24 – What can information technology and systems researchers and educators do
    to mitigate climate change? – Dr Wu He To respond to climate change, a significant
    threat to the United States and the world, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences,
    Engineering and Medicine has convened a committee of experts and published a report
    in 2021 to highlight the need for transforming the world''s energy system to one
    with net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2050 (NASEM, 2021). The report
    emphasizes the need to invest in new technology, expand innovation toolkits, and
    reduce the cost of existing technology in a socially just way. My Views on the
    above four questions: 3.5.6.1. Energy Use and Technology The information management,
    information technology, and information systems sectors highly depend on computers,
    sensors, and a wide variety of physical and electronic devices. However, the production
    and use of computers, sensors, storage devices, and other electronic devices require
    a tremendous amount of energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and causing
    harm to the environment. For example, data centers consist of a large number of
    servers and computing resources interconnected by high-speed networks, which need
    to work nonstop 24 × 7. Data centers have to rely on cooling systems to ensure
    all those machines do not overheat. Such cooling systems consume a lot of energy.
    The United States Data Center Energy Usage Report (Shehabi et al., 2016) indicates
    that data centers in the U.S. alone likely consumed approximately 73 billion kWh
    in 2020. Energy efficiency strategies and technologies, including AI and data
    analytics, could help monitor data centers’ energy usage and significantly improve
    energy conservation to reduce cost and carbon emissions. Google has reported using
    AI to reduce energy consumption in its data centers by as much as 40% (Evans &
    Gao, 2016). 3.5.6.2. Potential of information technology on mitigation of climate
    change Information technology has great potential to increase the energy efficiency
    of buildings, transportation systems, manufacturing, supply chains, power grids,
    infrastructure, and agriculture, enabling sustainable solutions for energy consumption
    and usage. Low-cost internet of things (IoT) sensors and devices (e.g., smart
    thermostats, smart humidifiers, smart air purifier, smart air conditioner, smart
    fans, smart blinds, and so on) have been used to reduce energy consumption and
    achieve long term cost savings by tailoring climate-control according to real-time
    needs and lifestyle of people and their schedule (either in the building or away).
    Teleconferencing, telemedicine, e-commerce, and e-learning technologies are playing
    a role in reducing unnecessary travel and thus reducing total emissions into the
    environment. These sensor-based technologies can continuously collect massive
    amounts of environmental data to measure emissions and other relevant parameters
    and adjust based on optimal standards or human preferences and needs. Big data
    analysis and visualization can be leveraged to unlock insights that will help
    individuals, organizations and communities track electricity consumption patterns,
    identify energy leaks, improve energy use efficiency, and find creative ways to
    conserve energy and adapt to climate change faster and better. 3.5.6.3. Suggested
    research agenda on climate change Several potential research ideas on climate
    change for information management, information systems, and technology researchers
    are listed below: • Conducting empirical research to collect first-hand evidence
    and develop evidence-based guidelines and suggestions to help practitioners design
    and implement Green IT(green information technology) and Green IS (green information
    systems) initiatives within their organization. Green IS (green information systems)
    refers to the use of information systems to achieve environmental objectives.
    In contrast, Green IT (green information technology) refers to the practice of
    environmentally sustainable computing and emphasizes reducing the environmental
    impacts of IT production and use (Dedrick, 2010). Green IT/IS can help reduce
    the negative consequences of technology production on the environment and contribute
    to sustainable solutions, including environmentally sustainable business processes,
    practices, and end products in organizations and communities (Boudreau, Chen,
    & Huber, 2008). • Studying the adoption of energy-saving IT in locations like
    home, businesses and communities, and assessing the impacts of information technology
    innovations on human behavior, mitigation of climate change, and relevant policymaking.
    • Conducting design-based research on designing and developing AI-based techniques,
    modeling and simulation, decision support tools, games, visualization, and other
    technologies or approaches that help the general public visualize and understand
    possible impacts of climate change. • Studying the use of games, mobile apps,
    augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality and other technology innovations
    in promoting environmentally sustainable behavior that contributes to climate
    change mitigation. Such studies could help understand the role of human behavior
    in achieving climate change mitigation strategies, reveal insights why people
    choose to engage in specific environmentally sustainable behavior or not, develop
    innovative approaches, policies, best practices, and solutions to climate change
    (Douglas & Brauer, 2021). 3.5.6.4. IT/IS education on climate change This generation
    and future generations need to understand the impacts of climate change on our
    daily lives and society. IT/IS education could play a critical role in helping
    individuals and communities in the understanding of the science behind climate
    change and what steps are needed to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming caused by climate change and human activity. IS/IT educators could use
    project-based or problem-based learning approaches to engage students to explore
    specific climate change issues and community-related climate datasets (e.g., heat,
    cold, rain, drought, snow, wind, river, lake, ocean, water quality, air quality,
    and coastal flooding) and to assess the impact of potential solutions by leverage
    existing software, tools and techniques such as data analysis and visualization,
    modeling and simulation, augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality, and
    AI techniques. When students are asked to use technology tools to explore specific
    climate change issues and datasets of interest or relevance to their local communities,
    they are more likely to become interested and engage in active learning for systems
    thinking, complex problem-solving, creativity, and evidence-informed decision-making.
    In the meantime, they will become familiar with these software, tools, and techniques
    through learning by using them to analyze data and solve problems in a meaningful
    way. Students will have a chance to develop interdisciplinary skills to interpret
    complex data analysis and visualization results into informed decisions and sound
    policies. The ability and skills to interpret data and communicate results to
    support the decision-making process are important for IT/IS students to become
    effective decision makers or problem-solvers in their careers. IS/IT educators
    are recommended to come up with concrete learning activities, to develop technology-related
    case studies, tutorials, projects, and exercises on the topic of climate change,
    and to encourage their students to work on collaborative or hands-on projects
    using open-source resources, including various datasets and open-source software
    and tools available on the Internet, such as CODAP, R, Python, and more. There
    exists significant levels of climate change, open-source projects on GitHub, which
    is an excellent way for IT/IS students to learn, practice, and contribute. 3.6.
    Technology and IS research agenda 3.6.1. Contribution 25 – holistically missing:
    climate change and information systems research – Professor Samuli Pekkola 3.6.1.1.
    Introduction and related activities In Finland, the Ministry of Transport and
    Communications recently published a climate and environmental strategy for the
    information and communication technology sector (Ojala & Oksanen, 2021). The strategy
    defines ICT related objectives and measures for carbon-neutral Finland, paying
    attention to ICT infrastructures and their energy efficiency, making recommendations
    on energy aspects in software and service procurement, considering material flows
    and recycling of the devices, suggesting energy consumption statistics on data
    centers, and increasing awareness of energy specific issues of software and hardware.
    These areas and objectives, and their measures are evidently impactful on climate
    change. They increase awareness and provide general goals. Unfortunately, the
    strategy pays no attention to how the use of ICT impacts on climate and environment.
    The use aspect is touched, for example, in the European Commission’s ICT for Sustainable
    Growth (2021) program, where, similarly to Estonia (2018), UK (Howes, 2020), and
    Norway (2016), the point of foci is on sustainable economics, not on sustainable
    ecology, environment, green ICT, or climate change – whatever term is adopted.
    This means that, in practice, environmental issues and ICT are approached either
    sporadically with a narrow view and disconnected contexts, or indirectly in the
    context of economic growth and prosperity. Similarly, IT/IS literature sees environmental
    issues as something that the ICT managers should consider in their work. For example,
    Esfahani, Rahman, and Zakaria (2015) and Singh and Sahu (2020) summarized the
    green IS studies focusing on the benefits, adoption, design and implementation,
    or initiation of green IS projects. Loeser (2013) takes a more concrete approach
    and lists a variety of different contexts for green IS initiatives. Wang X. (2015),
    Wang Y. (2015)’s meritorious literature review parallels these and poses a set
    of research questions, all aiming to understand the green IS initiatives. In general,
    it seems that IS literature focuses the adoption of ideas of climate change into
    the IS activities and context. Comprehensive understanding about how to apply
    and use IT/IS to improve the situation regarding climate change seem to be scarce.
    3.6.1.2. Towards a holistic understanding of IS and climate change The absence
    of comprehensive approaches is surprising especially after the lessons from COVID-19.
    For example, the amount of traveling decreased up to 90% in California due to
    stay-at-home orders (Schilling 2020). At the same time, air quality improved significantly
    (Eregowda, Chatterjee, & Pawar, 2021). People have learned new ways of working,
    learning, and living, without a need to travel to work, school, or anywhere. Although
    these settings of distant working, online learning, and online shopping, traveling,
    and leisure have been studied (c.f. Dwivedi et al., 2020; Pan & Zhang, 2020),
    the approach is again contextual: how to use IS in online meetings or education,
    how to provide or acquire goods, food, or services online, and how to manage and
    govern the IT (Herath & Herath, 2020). Contextual approach becomes problematic
    with the interconnectivity of systems and the systems of systems. For example
    during the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning tools have turned out to be quite
    efficient in conveying learning contexts to distant learners, although some learning-related
    difficulties have been identified (Chen and Roldan, 2021, Xie et al., 2020). Yet
    the difficulties may go beyond the learning contexts. Online activities have been
    reported to increase loneliness, disconnectivity with fellow students and teachers,
    distraction, mental problems, and increased workload (Maqableh and Alia, 2021,
    Pan and Zhang, 2020). These negative issues may have unpredictably long-lasting
    effects on learners: for instance, do they know the topics, have they made friends,
    and have they learned to interact in face-to-face situations? The quality of an
    online learning environment may have an impact on the rest of the learner’ life.
    Similarly, targeting green IS/IT activities locally may, or may not, be beneficial
    from the viewpoint of climate change. They may have unintended consequences similarly
    to online learning: activities seemingly beneficial in the short term may possibly
    be harmful in the long run. This notion leads to following research topics: •
    What are the long-term effects of green ICT investments? To climate and environment?
    To people: employees, learners, travelers, and their ways of doing, working, and
    living? To institutions? To firms and other organizations? To other parts of the
    system? • When do the benefits of green ICT investments exceed its investment
    costs? The example of an electric car illustrates this: building an electric car
    is more environmentally harmful than building a petrol car, but the tide turns
    when the car is used enough. What is this turning point for a green IT/IS investment?
    And most importantly: • How can ICT be used to improve the situation regarding
    climate change? Interestingly, we are studying how the ideas and isms of climate
    change and green ICT are adopted, but not how ICT should be used to reduce climate
    change. This has been touched by sustainable economic endeavors, but aren’t there
    any other values in addition to economic issues? 3.6.2. Contribution 26 – information
    technology and climate change – Professor Rameshwar Dubey Irresponsible human
    activities are well reflected in the form of rising sea levels, forest fires,
    extinction of some rare species, the meteoric rise in floods in many parts of
    the world, and fast-shrinking levels of safe drinking water. These are clear indications
    that human influence on climate systems is clear and growing (Wright & Nyberg,
    2017). Whyte (2020) argues that it is now too late to avoid dangerous climate
    change. The negative effects of climate change have attracted significant attention
    from the world''s top leaders, industry, media, and policymakers (Banerjee, 2001,
    Kolk and Pinkse, 2008, Mees et al., 2019). Some scholars argue that “climate change
    threatens irreversible and dangerous impacts,” that may have serious negative
    effects on people and ecosystems (Whyte, 2020), and to address the pressing global
    threat, there exists a unanimous call for an immediate reduction in carbon emission
    levels (Park, Byun, Deo, & Lee, 2015). Although the COVID-19 crisis has caused
    severe discomfort and impacted human lives in significant ways, studies have identified
    signs of some positive and visible regional effects on the planet (Khan, Shah,
    & Shah, 2021). This could be easily explained by a change in behaviors during
    lockdown that has reduced human activities such as transportation, irresponsible
    consumption, production, and industrial activities. In the last two years, there
    is some evidence of an improvement in the quality of air, water and the environment
    looks greener and cleaner than it used to be (Everard et al., 2021). This change
    has been possible due to the role of emerging technologies, (Dwivedi et al., 2020,
    Pan and Zhang, 2020). Many scholars have found positive effects from emerging
    technologies on environmental sustainability: big data and predictive analytics
    capability (Dubey et al., 2019), blockchain technology (Saberi, Kouhizadeh, Sarkis,
    & Shen, 2019), AI (Nishant et al., 2020), and cloud computing enabled supply chain
    design (Shee, Miah, Fairfield, & Pujawan, 2018). However, the COVID-19 crisis
    has further accelerated the debate on “how information technology capabilities
    or information management scholars” can help tackle climate change (He, Zhang,
    & Li, 2021). Despite the general optimism in the role of environmentally friendly
    technologies or emerging technologies in tackling climate challenges, some developed
    and developing economies, industry and global corporations still remain skeptical
    about the role of information technology in tackling the climate change crisis
    (Teräväinen et al., 2014). Wright and Nyberg (2017) argue that the organizations
    in pursuit of their economic gains have in the past lobbied against carbon emissions
    initiatives and further delayed constructive action. Despite the rich body of
    literature on the corporation''s initiative towards mitigating the carbon emissions
    problem (Banerjee, 2001, Wright and Nyberg, 2017), organizational/ management/
    information technology scholars have an important role to play particularly in
    addressing the climate change crisis. There is a need for theory-driven research
    that provides an in-depth understanding of both the causes and possible solutions
    to tackle climate change. We note some clear research gaps in the academic literature
    and posit the following research questions that may help bridge the gaps in our
    understanding and the expected role of the information technology /emerging technologies
    in tackling the climate change crisis: a. How AI-enabled predictive analytics
    techniques may help identify some of the economic activities in some parts of
    the world which are contributing to carbon emissions? b. How the use of distributed
    ledger technology (DLT) and AI can help identify the role of some corporations
    involved in unethical practices that led to contamination of water bodies and
    deforestation? c. How the use of AI enables predictive analytics to detect issues
    during logistics and transportation within developing economies thereby contributing
    to a reduction in carbon emissions? d. How AI-enabled technologies can help build
    swift trust and collaboration among the stakeholders engaged in tackling the climate
    change crises? 3.6.3. Contribution 27 – blockchain and climate change – Dr Daniela
    Andreini Of all technologies in place in the market, the one I know best is the
    blockchain. This technology has environmental, social and economic impacts, and
    in these few words, I would like to focus on the ecological aspects. 3.6.3.1.
    How IM/IT/IS sector has any negative impact on the environment and how it can
    be reduced Like any other technology, blockchain creates a digital ecosystem composed
    of multiple hardware devices, program files, and different actors'' data files.
    Another critical component of the ecosystem is interacting and exchanging cryptocurrencies,
    files, information, etc. The sustainability of the blockchain is controversial;
    for instance, O''Dwyer and Malone (2014) stated that the energy consumption of
    the Bitcoin mining network is comparable with the Ireland electricity consumption.
    In the same way, we can think about the energy and infrastructural consumption
    of all the IM/IT/IS systems that cause enormous energy and infrastructural consumption
    and thus a tremendous environmental impact. 3.6.3.2. How IM/IT/IS can be utilized
    to improve situation regarding climate change At the same time, other authors
    demonstrated that the artificial intelligence and IT ecosystem could find more
    efficient ways to create and exchange information and virtual services. For instance,
    for what concerns bitcoins, Dimitriou and Karame (2013) demonstrated that in mining
    bitcoins, if a miner can create a block more efficiently and speedily than another
    one, the system will substitute the less efficient miner with the most productive
    and profitable one. This mechanism drives the entire system towards a more effective
    way to use and consume energy and infrastructures. Thus, the IM/IT/IS systems
    can be the sources and the solution of energy consumption and dispersion. 3.6.3.3.
    A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change The
    cost and climate impact of blockchain are strictly related to its diffusion. For
    instance, in this historical moment, the substitution of traditional currencies
    with bitcoins in our monetary system would be too expensive in energy consumption,
    and thus it could not be sustainable. Therefore, in finance, for instance, more
    research is needed to understand how the two monetary systems can coexist efficiently.
    The same thing can be extended to other IM/IT/IS systems: virtualized and physical
    transactions should coexist to balance environmental, social, and economic systems.
    3.6.3.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this Experimentation in education
    is relevant, and more educational systems should turn into laboratories, where
    institutions should offer problem-solving driven teaching methods. 3.6.4. Contribution
    28 – towards a relevant agenda for environmental issues within KM/IM/IS/IT – Professor
    Johan Olaisen The climate crisis is the largest threat to civilization we have
    ever faced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018
    made the science very clear. There are significant climate impacts all around
    the world even if we limit warming to the recommended 1.5 C. The report also showed
    there are significant increases in impacts and damages between 1.5 and 2.0 C.
    These results were fully supported by the IPCC science report (2021). We are building
    our living standards upon coal, gas, and oil, and few of us want to change our
    lives, and new global generations are coming that want our living standards. Every
    corporation wants to be green and practice sustainability even if the reality
    of the image is most often an illusion or just a fashion (Jevnaker and Olaisen,
    2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021bbd). What is the research situation within knowledge management
    (KM), information management (IM), information technology (IT) and information
    system (IS) research? We investigated all academic papers 2016–2020 (N = 481)
    delivered at the European Conference for Knowledge Management (ECKM). We found
    that less than 5% of the papers investigated climate issues and concluded that
    the KM/IM/IT/IS potentially harms environmental-climate issues owing to neglect
    (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen,
    2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd). All research consists of problem, knowledge,
    and methodology sentences. We get traditional pragmatic business-as-usual research
    when there is an over-focus upon methodology and knowledge sentences and a low
    focus upon problems. We must start to ask the research questions about environmental
    and sustainability issues. Through verification and falsification (Popper, 1974),
    research is expected to come up with theories, paradigms, perspectives (Kuhn,
    1962) that explains and explores practices that we may evaluate, giving us either
    empirical research or critical research (what is acceptable/not acceptable) or
    constructed research (what is adequate and what is not adequate). Most research
    is empirical, and to get more focus upon environmental issues, we must get more
    constructed and critical research setting up the green and sustainable agenda.
    We must ask the essential questions about if the academic papers involve acceptable
    or not acceptable climate solutions or if the papers are adequate or not adequate
    for relevant climate issues. Fig. 3 presents the model of the climate crisis issues

    crisis in information research. Research deals with four paradigms: the empirical,
    the materialistic (political), clarified subjectivity, and action papers. Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb found that nearly all papers
    might be classified as empirical and as a form of clarified subjectivity papers
    in harmony with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. We must invite
    papers in conflict with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. These papers
    will be representing the materialistic political and action paradigms. We must
    ask how research papers, often in conflict, contribute to climate issues. To get
    green and sustainable papers, we must get more problem-focused research on climate
    issues, more critical and constructed papers, more exploring papers built upon
    sensitizing concepts and less upon definitive concepts, and more political and
    action-based papers. Most of all, we need editors and conference chairs dedicated
    to climate issues asking for adequate and critical papers on this topic that might
    be political, action-based, and problems often based in conflict with existing
    issues, knowledge, and methodology. A political economy paradigm for the climate
    crisis in information research is a complement to presently prevailing concepts.
    KM/IM/IS/IT research and papers might be utilized to be a knowledge café, outlet,
    and center for environmental issues and perspectives. We might develop an environmental
    paradigm for relevant KM/IM/IS/IT research. We might define another future for
    societies and organizations. We might be giving the picture of a pluralistic sustainable
    future and even a utopia (More, 1973). We already have the experience through
    AI and robotics forming the fourth industrial revolution and solving the environmental
    issues is the fifth industrial revolution based upon the perspectives from KM/IM/IS/IT
    research. The paradigms within information research focusing upon the climate

    use in the climate crisis. The objective and agenda of IS/I/IT/KM research strategy
    for sustainability are to help to promote knowledge, information, systems, and
    technology that will: • Resolve national and global challenges relating to sustainability
    in corporations and societies • Facilitate industrial development that enhances
    sustainability and increases green competitiveness • Promote the innovativeness
    and creativity for sustainable solutions • Such objectives will include areas
    like: • Reduced climate change and effective adaptation measures • Preservation
    of ecosystems services and lower environmental impacts • Sustainable cities, corporations,
    regions, and transport systems • The circular knowledge economy The IPCC, 2018,
    IPCC, 2021 have mentioned five areas: Food and ecology, Sustainable cities, Energy
    and material, Health and wellbeing, Transportation. IT/IS/IM/KM are mentioned
    as essential for all these areas, and there is a need for developing the areas
    into issues for journals and conferences. The identified focus for research within
    information research is in Scandinavia sustainable private and public cases where
    the green and sustainable practices are documented. These cases should be developed
    into model cases for KM/IM/IS/IT. The cases should be used as action research
    cases promoting a sustainable practise (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd).
    The Scandinavian impact model might look like Fig. 5: Download : Download high-res
    image (118KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The Scandinavian impact
    model of information research. An important issue is how KM/IM/S/IT in higher
    education should reflect the environmental issues. Education that ensures future
    competencies upon sustainability, reuse, and environmental issues is essential.
    Environmental, green, and sustainable practices are an essential part of green
    education. Green KM/IT/IM/IS practice in action will be significant to get the
    students to participate in the transformational changes. The students must understand
    how different practices influence the environment. I have developed an executive
    program at BI (Oslo) “Sustainable leadership-in-action," where sustainable practices
    are discussed and reflected upon through collaboration with Norwegian businesses
    and the participants'' experiences and where the students project paper is an
    empirical paper reflecting and learning from green practices with a synopsis as
    a reflection upon how they have implemented sustainable practices in their organizations.
    Ideally, should environmental issues be a part of all programs. KM/IM/IS/IT are
    innovative and creative tools for the solutions to environmental issues. Let COP26
    also be the starting line for new objectives, areas, and education within KM/IM/IS/IT.
    We have every tool we need within information research to help to reduce and tackle
    the climate crisis. Let us all contribute!. 4. A brief overview of full opinion
    articles related to this theme This section outlines an appraisal of the selected
    full opinion articles related to this theme included within volume 63 of IJIM.
    Each study covers one or more themes related to the overall climate change and
    emissions reduction agenda, together with the views of the authors on the key
    specific technology and IS related topics. The following table (Table 4) lists
    the full selection of the full opinion articles. Table 4. List of full submitted
    articles on climate change, IS and technology. Authors Title Ågerfalk, Axelsson,

    for Future Research Trkman and Černe (2022) Humanizing digital life – Reducing
    emissions while enhancing value- adding human processes. The opinion article by
    Ågerfalk et al. (2022), explores the Scandinavian perspectives on three current
    research projects where digital transformation is posited as offering a positive
    force in the fight against climate change and its impact on the world. The research
    viewed the climate change challenges from a stakeholder-centric perspective, emphasizing
    the criticality of closely involving people to engender the necessary change required
    in the design of digital technologies and the requirement for green IS researchers
    to engage in a collaborative context. It is vital that emerging technology focussed
    solutions, designed to combat climate change, take account of the necessary ethical
    dimensions and values from the onset to negate the potential scenario of technological
    innovations exacerbating the climate change problem. These aspects are analyzed
    by Brooks et al. (2022) where the opinion article highlights the importance of
    technologies delivering the required socio-economic impact through climate engineering
    solutions. Via a review of the relevant literature, the research reveals the disjointed
    nature of ethical dimensions in many cases, lagging behind emerging technological
    innovations. The study advocates a rebalancing of emphasis where ethical dimensions
    are an integral element of the climate engineering process. The opinion article
    by Laukkanen et al. (2022) argues for the usefulness of virtual technologies for
    changing human consumption behavior toward more sustainable consumption behaviors.
    The article argues that such technologies could provide greater opportunities
    to influence consumer decisions than the present digital environment. The article
    details a discussion on technology-assisted sensory marketing, cognitive and emotive
    aspects of virtual reality, and outlines applications of virtual reality technologies
    to encourage sustainable consumption. The opinion article led by Papadopoulos
    and Balta (2022), highlights the low levels of existing studies that focus on
    the role of Big Data Analytics (BDA) and impact of climate change, positing the
    potential opportunities for more sustainable operations and supply chains. The
    study assesses the challenges faced by operations and supply chains, asserting
    the contribution from BDA in providing a valuable role in the development of solutions
    to the myriad of climate related problems. Environmental sustainability from a
    technology acceptance perspective, is discussed in Papagiannidis and Marikyan
    (2022), where the opinion article highlights the dichotomy of technology negatively
    impacting the environment, whilst helping to manage and save precious natural
    resources. The research offers insights to the technology acceptance process from
    the sustainability perspective, arguing for a change in approach from researchers
    to be more cognisant of the impact of systems on the environment, thereby engendering
    environmentally compliant behaviors. Researchers have highlighted the valuable
    role of smart and climate intelligent cities in the transition from current high
    emission urban infrastructure. The opinion article by Pee and Pan (2022) calls
    for resilient urbanization to weather the impending climate shocks that are likely
    to materialize as a direct result of global warming. The research posits the role
    of IS research and its potential contribution to energy and resource optimization
    and the role of IS in the contribution to mitigating many of the current climate
    change related challenges. The opinion article by Pan et al. (2022) offers an
    Australia focussed perspective to approaching the climate change crisis highlighting
    the role of innovative technologies with huge transformative potential such as
    AI, analytics and IoT to tackle global warming whilst adhering to sustainable
    development goals. The researchers posit a research agenda that focuses on: climate
    resilience, climate-conscious citizen science, and substantive ESG strategies
    that can positively impact global warming. The key challenges related to redesigning
    the necessary human processes to eliminate environmentally harmful activities,
    while maintaining humans’ fundamental value proposition are discussed in the opinion
    article by Trkman and Černe (2022). The opinion article discusses a future world
    where humans transition from digitalization to a human digitalization, recognizing
    the critical role of government and research institutions for this change. The
    researchers highlight the role that technology can have in identifying, planning,
    enabling and executing the required changes in human behavior, as well as measuring
    and communicating their impact. 5. Discussion and recommendations This section
    elaborates on the expert contributions presented in Section 3, to reveal the key
    emphasis and emerging themes relating to digital technology, IS and climate change.
    We highlight the implications for government and society, and develop a number
    of key recommendations for policy, practice and education. 5.1. Expert Contribution
    Analysis A systematic analysis of the contributed articles was undertaken to offer
    a deeper insight to the key topics and underlying analytics. The analysis reviewed:
    a) the frequency of specific keywords mentioned in the articles, b) specific text
    features such as keywords, phrases and c) scores of polarity and sentiment analysis.
    Fig. 6 presents a word cloud view of the frequently occurring text from the submitted
    individual contributions. The analysis results highlight that the words: impact,
    sustainability, green, environment and smart are some of the significant and influential
    keywords emerging from the analysis of the contributed expert inputs. Download

    contributed expert inputs exhibit neutral polarity on the use of digital technologies
    and information management for climate change. If the neutral polarity is ignored,
    and the positive and negative polarity is compared, the majority of authors present
    a generally positive outlook for the use of digital technology and IS for combating
    climate change. This highlights the general consensus from the invited contributors,
    on the important role that technology can play in the global effort to reduce
    emissions to net zero by 2050. Download : Download high-res image (807KB) Download

    inputs. 5.2. Emerging Issues and recommended actions Whilst the views on the extent
    of the role of digital technology and IS in combating climate change vary amongst
    the contributors, there is general consensus that technology is an integral component
    of the overall solution, whilst at the same time - a fundamental aspect of the
    problem (Muregesan, 2008; Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). There exists a realization
    amongst many of the contributors that a more sustainable implementation of technology
    in all its forms, needs to be at the forefront of solutions to get to net zero,
    the mistakes of old cannot be repeated once more. A number of the submitted articles
    reference the negative impact of human behavior and people''s attitudes in their
    day to day use of technology, positing the necessity for a transformative change
    in the way technology is developed, used and recycled. The expert input by Professor
    Davison illustrates these points specifically, highlighting the study by Clarke
    and Davison (2020), where the study asserts that very few studies within the IS
    research discourse, viewed the major challenges from the environmental perspective
    or included the environment as a key stakeholder. Professors Constantiou and Vendelø
    develop a narrative that highlights the potential use of technological solutions
    to facilitate the necessary change in human behaviors, citing how technology could
    be used to: identifying climate impact of transportation options, reduction in
    food waste via collaborative consumption and education on sustainable cooking.
    Behavioral influences from the community perspective in the context of faith and
    youth activism, are discussed in the expert inputs by Dr Abumoghli and Professor
    Panteli respectively, highlighting the important role of technology in building
    active communities that challenge the status quo. The expert input from Professor
    Metri cites the study by Junior et al. (2018) to highlight the woeful record of
    environmental sustainability from the technology industry, where the article posits
    the necessity of embedding the UN SDGs within technology design considerations
    and the potential of penalties for organizations that fail to change behaviors.
    The educational awareness and requirements for changed working practices, are
    discussed within a number of submitted articles, where these aspects are viewed
    from the technological perspective and impact on progress to net zero. The expert
    inputs from Professor Barlette and Drs Nishant and Teo identify the need for the
    IS community to educate more effectively to instil a greater awareness of the
    impact from technology adoption and the delicate balance between benefits toward
    net zero and contributing to the problem. The impact of climate change can be
    effectively monitored via the use of technology leading to a greater awareness
    amongst people to change their behaviors. These points are discussed in the expert
    input from Professor Tiwari where the article asserts the benefits of education
    at a community level, to empower people to gain access to knowledge and relevant
    data and assist vulnerable populations in the fight against climate change. The
    manufacture of technology based products relies on the use of precious and finite
    natural resources, at significant cost to the environment (Okafor, 2020). The
    expert inputs by Professors Rowe, Raman and Rana illustrate some of the negative
    impacts on the environment from the use of technology and the necessity for organizations
    to change their working practices to be more cognisant of the impact from the
    choices we make, the effect on the planet and support for the transition to environmentally
    friendly products. Professor Rana further emphasizes the need for education not
    just on climate change but also on how to use technology in a responsible way
    to help reduce carbon emissions and become ambassadors for sustainable living.
    The expert inputs by Professor Michael and Dr Abbas discuss the importance of
    a transition from current IS design practices to a more sustainability focussed
    approach and framework (Crow & Dabars, 2015), presenting a socio-technical sustainable
    design cycle for responsible systems design. A number of the expert contributions
    discussed perspectives relating to the impact of people and communities, where
    key aspects of technology can be used to ensure humans live and work with a “lighter
    touch” to conserve precious resources and attain net zero via the innovative use
    of IS infrastructure (Elbanna at a., 2020). The expert input by Professor Kodama
    references the increasing focus on smart communities in the form of smart cities
    where next generation social systems connect homes, buildings and transport, within
    an environmentally supportive infrastructure, highlighting the criticality of
    an emphasis based on IT collaboration to deliver meaningful change. The smart
    city contribution to reduced emissions is discussed by Professor Scholtz, where
    the contribution highlights the smart environment dimensions of smart cities (Van
    der Hoogen et al., 2020), and the necessity for addressing the necessary skills
    and educational requirements to ensure people can interact with smart infrastructure,
    thereby attaining the intended benefits and sustainable outcomes. The expert input
    from Professor De’ discussed the issues surrounding Green IS initiatives (Dedrick,
    2010; Khuntia et al., 2018; Melville, 2010), and how digital technologies can
    counter the effects of climate change. The article highlights the need for a greater
    emphasis on gender rebalancing to counter the poor access to technology from women
    in developing nations and the disproportionate effect that environmental change
    has on women. Studies have posited the need for a greater focus on responsible
    digitization and corporate digital responsibility (Crawford, 2021; Lobschat et
    al., 2021). These aspects are discussed in the expert inputs from Professor Wade
    and also Professor Sarker where both articulate the need for organizations and
    consumers to take a more holistic view on the use of technology across the full
    lifecycle, highlighting the need for a more balanced, realistic and wider debate
    on environmental tradeoffs. The article by Professor Sein and Dr Chandra Kruse
    advocates a Design Science Research (DSR) approach from the IS community when
    developing sustainability and global warming solutions. This approach aims to
    create new knowledge through building methods and artifacts that are aligned with
    improving societal problems via the greater adoption of green practices. The literature
    has posited the role of technology in the monitoring and governance of climate
    change progression, via the extensive use of IS systems and remote sensing devices
    to provide the necessary data to scientists and decision makers at a global level
    (Bunker, 2020, Nüttgens et al., 2011). The expert input by Dr Mäntymäki highlights
    the need for a greater awareness of the sustainability impact of digital services,
    platforms, and infrastructure and that these systems be measured and monitored
    in a reliable and transparent fashion to mitigate the surge in unused digital
    content - so called digital waste. The expert inputs from Professor Gupta, Professor
    Bunker and from Mr Fenby-Taylor elaborate on these crucial aspects where they
    posit the benefits of improved data innovation practice, transitional approaches
    to complex information governance and effective information management to engender
    a culture shift in the use of data in all its forms, more collaboratively, thereby
    delivering impactful change. The expert input by Ms Shah highlights the critical
    role of data science processes to inform decision makers, monitoring of potential
    environmental hazards and accurate modeling of global warming scenarios. In the
    contribution from Dr He, he discussed the role of data analysis and climate change,
    where the role of sensor-based technologies was highlighted in the collection
    of huge amounts of environmental data to measure emissions and develop insights
    to conserve and improve energy use. A number of the submitted expert inputs discussed
    topics associated with IS and digital technology research, commenting on the current
    position and potential agendas for the future. The expert input from Professor
    Pekkola criticised the narrow approach taken by organizations and public bodies
    where environmental issues and ICT are approached from disparate perspectives
    in the context of economic growth and prosperity. The article from Professor Dubey
    posits the need for theory-driven research utilizing AI based approaches to provide
    a better understanding of the causes of climate change and potential solutions.
    The impact of blockchain technology and the environment was discussed in the submission
    from Dr Andreini, where the article asserts the need for a research agenda better
    aligned to understanding how the traditional and cryptocurrencies can coexist
    more effectively. The article from Professor Olaisen critiqued the current IS
    literature, finding that a very small percentage of studies actually investigated
    climate issues, asserting the need for researchers to start to ask the necessary
    research questions, on key aspects of the environmental and sustainability issues.
    5.3. Recommendations for research The expert contributions detail a number of
    research recommendations on many aspects of technology and digital products. One
    of the key emerging themes from the contributions is the call to explicitly include
    the environment as a key stakeholder. This is referenced in the expert inputs
    by Professors Davison and Sarker and implicitly supported in many other contributions,
    where a more honest and informed perspective is required, advocating a research
    agenda that focuses on impacts as well as benefits from a responsible IS perspective.
    Many of the contributions highlight the need for further research on the role
    of IS in improving systems and processes in the transportation, agriculture and
    manufacturing industries to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and deliver
    accurate data to make better, more informed decisions. A number of contributions
    detail the critical role of IS and digital technologies in the provision of key
    data that can inform decision makers on the progress of global warming initiatives.
    Some of the topics discussed within the expert input by Professor Raman articulate
    many of the perspectives on this topic, highlighting the need for more research
    to improve the collection and dissemination of data on climate risk and use of
    sensor based IoT technologies within developing countries to alert authorities
    on emission levels. The expert input from Professor Rana supports a greater level
    of research focus on the socio-psychological behavioral factors surrounding the
    adoption of digital technologies, that can help inform researchers on how people
    adapt to new interactions and systems that reduce emissions. The theme of multidisciplinary
    perspectives on IS and sustainability for research agenda, is discussed by a number
    of experts including the need for greater focus on global IT collaboration. Viewing
    these perspectives from a transdisciplinary lens is advocated in the contribution
    from Professor Michael and Dr Abbas, where they posit the benefits of creating
    models and simulations within an overall sustainability framework that can encapsulate
    multi-level perspectives on the provision of data and technology interaction.
    A number of articles have referenced the role of smart technologies, smart cities
    and smart mobility, within the overall transition to a more sustainable digital
    infrastructure where people can interact with IS more effectively throughout their
    daily lives. However, as highlighted by Professor Scholtz, the focus on aligning
    smart initiatives to the UN SDGs seems to be an underdeveloped research area that
    could inform further research on key topics of sustainable water management, sanitation
    and access to sustainable energy sources. This sentiment is further explored in
    a number of articles, but particularly the call for greater multidisciplinary
    perspectives on CDR as highlighted by Professor Wade, asserting the need for a
    better understanding of the dynamics of CDR from theoretical and empirical perspectives.
    The problem of e-waste is discussed within a number of articles and further research
    in this area is explicitly called for. The article from Professor Gupta discusses
    a number of these key points that are detailed within many expert inputs, calling
    for greater research on improved strategies for dealing with this problem that
    negates the need for shifting the problem to emerging economies. The pivotal role
    of data and data science has been referenced in many submissions but particularly
    in the from Ms Shah where the article discusses the criticality of accurate data
    and empirical studies to inform key decision makers. Further research and insight
    is needed, through evidence-based initiatives to ensure the effects of global
    warming are effectively communicated to governments and organizations to ensure
    timely decisions are made and relevant resources are made available in the critical
    areas. 5.4. Recommendations for education The need for a greater educational awareness
    amongst IS researchers and users, seems to be a common thread within the submitted
    articles. A number of articles advocate a more holistic emphasis and informed
    debate on the environmental impact of technology, as well as its benefits in helping
    to mitigate further global warming and attainment of net zero by 2050. Many of
    the experts advocate a more balanced perspective within the IS and technology
    curriculum, to ensure students better understand the impact of behaviors. A number
    of articles also posit the need for better education on technologies that directly
    mitigate climate change, highlighting that this core topic seems to lack focus
    within many institutions. Technology has a critical role to play in the changing
    of human attitudes and behaviors toward sustainability. IS can educate and inform
    people about the carbon footprint to explore new innovative ways to perform everyday
    activities but in a more sustainable way. The article by Professors Constantiou
    and Vendelø illustrates how digital platforms can engender collaborative consumption
    and social entrepreneurship, educating people to redistribute unwanted products
    and reduce waste as well as influence consumers via sustainable cooking and plant
    based food. A number of experts have detailed the role of IS in the context of
    educating people through online communities. The contribution from Professor Panteli
    emphasizes this aspect, positing the role of young people and their digital activism
    in influencing a change in behaviors, whilst Dr Nishant and Professor Teo discuss
    the need for IS educators to increase awareness on green IS and the sustainability
    aspects of technology. It is clear from the submitted articles that education
    is a key component of the transition to net zero and ensuring that all stakeholders
    (industry and individuals) have the necessary knowledge to engender changes in
    behavior, is a key component of the transition. 5.5. Recommendations for practice
    and policy The UN COP26 conference gained commitment for a number of key initiatives
    that could have a significant impact on global warming. The key commitments included:
    at least 100 countries (including Brazil) agreeing to end deforestation by 2030;
    Led by the US and EU - 80 countries pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by
    2030; Although commitment could not be gained from China, the US, India and Australia
    - 23 nations made new commitments to phase out coal power, including five of the
    top 20 users: Indonesia, South Korea, Poland, Vietnam, Chile and Ukraine; India
    committed to attaining net zero by 2070 (COP26, 2021). Governments have a critical
    role in combating global warming from the legislative and policy perspective,
    but to ensure the targets set for 2050 have a realistic chance of being achieved,
    we need change at a societal level. The IS and technology industry has a critical
    role to play in the monitoring of progress toward net zero, but also a pivotal
    role in the development of innovative solutions to better manage emissions and
    offer people alternatives to current carbon based practices. Many of the contributions
    have highlighted the crucial role of organizations adopting a green philosophy
    and demonstrating a firm commitment to CSR and CDR policies and working practices.
    A number of the experts have discussed the realities of technology contributing
    to the global warming problem due to the high levels of waste and inability for
    manufacturers to adopt a greater sustainability focus on manufacturing materials,
    processes and poor emphasis toward product repair, not replace - so called e-waste.
    The expert input by Professor Metri cites the 2019 UN and WEF reports that 50
    million tonnes of e-waste was produced in that year, with only 20% being dealt
    with sustainably and the rest ending up as landfill. Many articles discuss these
    aspects, highlighting that the IS industry has much to do in this area. Organizations
    have their part to play to align with the goals and commitments from COP26, but
    successful outcomes rely on support from government and institutions to create
    the necessary environment and policy infrastructure, thereby enabling the technology
    industry to make the right long term decisions for the environment and society.
    6. Conclusions The UN climate change conference – COP26 held in Glasgow UK, is
    seen as one of the last chances for governments and key decision makers to make
    the firm commitments needed to ensure global temperatures do not exceed 1.5 °C
    above pre-industrial levels by 2050. The use of technology and IS is an integral
    component of many of the proposed mitigation measures, as governments and societies
    around the world take the necessary steps in transitioning to net zero. This multi-contribution
    editorial study offers a technology focussed and IS perspective on the climate
    crisis where many of the multi-faceted complexities facing governments, organizations
    and decision makers are discussed. In alignment with the approach set out in previous
    studies (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015), each of the invited experts offers their
    own unique viewpoints to explore many of the key topics related to climate change,
    IS and digital technologies. The major technology and IS focussed themes that
    have emerged from the invited experts include: the impact of technology on behaviors
    and attitudes; Education, awareness and changed working practices; Impact on people
    and communities; Responsible digitalization; Role of data, technology and IS governance;
    Technology and IS research agenda. We present this opinion paper as a timely perspective
    on this critical topic where we have discussed the multifaceted role of digital
    technology and IS in combating climate change. The expert contributions highlight
    the urgent need for education initiatives that offer a more holistic and balanced
    perspective on the opportunities for technology based solutions but also communicate
    the realities of the negative impact from e-waste and the shifting of the problem
    to poorer emerging nations. The developed countries throughout the world have
    a responsibility to develop solutions for problems of their own making and a greater
    focus on responsible digitalization has to be the right direction to engender
    sustained change. We advocate a greater awareness from individual consumers as
    well as manufacturers, on the “lived in” realities of environmental tradeoffs
    and key value choices (Rowe, 2018), as we continue to utilize technology as an
    integral component of our daily lives. Decision makers need to be cognisant of
    these key choices, as greater use is made of technology in all its forms to deliver
    net zero by 2050. References Abbas et al., 2021a R. Abbas, S. Hamdoun, J. Abu-Ghazaleh,

    \ in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nIn recent years,\
    \ intelligent sensor techniques have achieved signiﬁcant attention in agriculture.\
    \ It is applied in agriculture to plan the\nseveral activities and missions properly\
    \ by utilising limited resources with minor human interference. Currently, plant\
    \ cultivation\nusing new agriculture methods is very popular among the growers.\
    \ However, the aeroponics is one of the methods of modern\nagriculture, which\
    \ is commonly practiced around the world. In the system, plant cultivates under\
    \ complete control conditions in\nthe growth chamber by providing a small mist\
    \ of the nutrient solution in replacement of the soil. The nutrient mist is ejected\n\
    through atomization nozzles on a periodical basis. During the plant cultivation,\
    \ several steps including temperature, humidity,\nlight intensity, water nutrient\
    \ solution level, pH and EC value, CO2 concentration, atomization time, and atomization\
    \ interval\ntime require proper attention for ﬂourishing plant growth. Therefore,\
    \ the object of this review study was to provide signiﬁcant\nknowledge about early\
    \ fault detection and diagnosis in aeroponics using intelligent techniques (wireless\
    \ sensors). So, the farmer\ncould monitor several paraments without using laboratory\
    \ instruments, and the farmer could control the entire system\nremotely. Moreover,\
    \ the technique also provides a wide range of information which could be essential\
    \ for plant researchers and\nprovides a greater understanding of how the key parameters\
    \ of aeroponics correlate with plant growth in the system. It oﬀers\nfull control\
    \ of the system, not by constant manual attention from the operator but to a large\
    \ extent by wireless sensors.\nFurthermore, the adoption of the intelligent techniques\
    \ in the aeroponic system could reduce the concept of the usefulness of\nthe system\
    \ due to complicated manually monitoring and controlling process.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Agriculture has an ancient history nearly dates back to\nthousands of years. Moreover,\
    \ its advancement has been\npushed by implementing the several new systems, practices,\n\
    technologies, and approaches with the time. It employs over\none-third of the\
    \ global workforce [1]. The agriculture is the\nbackbone of an economy for many\
    \ countries and executes a\nsigniﬁcant contribution to the development of the\
    \ economy\nfor underdeveloped countries. Besides, it steers the process\nof economic\
    \ prosperity in developed countries. Several\nresearch studies concluded that\
    \ overall world agriculture uses\napproximately seventy percent per year available\
    \ fresh water\nto irrigate only seventeen percent of the land. Another side,\n\
    the total available irrigated land is gradually decreasing due\nto the rapidly\
    \ increasing of food requirements and eﬀects of\nglobal warming [2, 3]. In other\
    \ words, agriculture is dealing\nwith new main signiﬁcant challenges. Foote [4]\
    \ said FAO\nreported that world food production must be increased by\nseventy\
    \ percent to provide suﬃcient food production for\nthe fast-growing population\
    \ and urbanisation. The expected\nworld population growth for the half of the\
    \ present century\nis daunting. However, depending on the estimate, it could\n\
    be expected to rise above the nine billion people by midcen-\ntury. As many studies\
    \ reported that the population is increas-\ning very fast, the global population\
    \ was one billion in 1800,\nHindawi\nJournal of Sensors\nVolume 2018, Article\

    \ to seven billion people in 2012. However,\nstudies report feared that at the\
    \ end of the current century,\nit could be expected to reach eleven billion people\
    \ and there\ncould be many, many more mouths to feed soon. Thus, the\nrapid increase\
    \ of the population, alongside the decrease in\nagriculture land, intensiﬁcation\
    \ of global climate changes,\nand exacerbation of water resources, declines labour\
    \ force\nand energy crunches are posing tremendous challenges and\nhurdles to\
    \ the agriculture sector [5, 6]. Furthermore, the\ndeveloping and developed countries\
    \ will deal with substantial\nwater crises and issues due to rapid urbanisation\
    \ and indus-\ntrialisation. The available fresh water for irrigated agriculture\n\
    land is supposed to decrease in future [7, 8]. Besides, the\nunpredictable climate\
    \ changes include extreme weather con-\nditions, intense storms, heat waves, and\
    \ ﬂoods will have a\nsubstantial adverse impact on world agriculture sector. We\n\
    need more production from agricultural systems to meet\nthe growing food demands.\
    \ Otherwise, we will suﬀer from\nfood insecurity problems which will be the biggest\
    \ threat.\nMoreover, Qiu and coworkers [9] revealed that the progress\nof the\
    \ agriculture production is not only signiﬁcant for to\nproducing food to feed\
    \ the population, but it is also essential\nfor the industrial sector. Similarly,\
    \ the agriculture is the main\nsource to produce the raw material for many industrial\
    \ sec-\ntors. Therefore, it must be understood that industrial and\nagricultural\
    \ developments are not alternatives. However,\nboth sectors are complementary\
    \ to each other on the path\nto achieving the food security issues.\nAs the evolution\
    \ of humankind from hunters and gath-\nerers to agrarian societies, the eﬀorts\
    \ have mainly focused\non improving the plant yield and productivity by either\n\
    genetic changes, cultural or husbandry, management prac-\ntices, or by developing\
    \ and introducing plant protection\nmeasures. Accordingly, in the last and present\
    \ century,\npeoples have started exploring the possibilities by adopting\ndiﬀerent\
    \ modern techniques in agriculture. The adoption\nof the precision farming methods\
    \ in agriculture is one of\nthe excellent examples. The purpose is to try and\
    \ mechan-\nise them in agriculture to prevent the crop losses due to\nsudden climatic\
    \ changes, soil-borne diseases, pest attaches,\nand so on. However, many research\
    \ studies have been\nsuggested and reported that problems and challenges of\n\
    agriculture could overcome by adopting the precision farm-\ning methods. At present,\
    \ several countries are increasing\ntheir farming productivities by implementing\
    \ the precision\nfarming methods.\nBaudoin et al. [10] reported that the artiﬁcial\
    \ plant grow-\ning method (e.g., greenhouse and factory farms) is one of the\n\
    fundamental types of precision agriculture. Nowadays, the\nmethod is receiving\
    \ importance and gaining the intention\nof the growers. The method can provide\
    \ suﬃcient food\nsupply throughout the year. In the system, the plant grows\n\
    around the year by artiﬁcially adjusting and controlling\nthe surrounding environmental\
    \ conditions such as tempera-\nture, CO2 (carbon dioxide), humidity, light intensity,\
    \ airﬂow,\nand nutrients supply within the conﬁned facilities [11, 12].\nBesides,\
    \ the system minimises environmental impact and\nmaximises the crop yield with\
    \ signiﬁcant results as compared\nwith traditional (open-ﬁeld) cultivation system\
    \ [13]. Savvas\nand team [14] informed that at present soilless plant cultiva-\n\
    tion is one of the most disruptive inventions ever presented\nin the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial\
    \ plant growing system. The soilless sys-\ntem refers to plant cultivation techniques\
    \ without the use of\nsoil by providing artiﬁcial solid material or water nutrient\n\
    solution as a growing medium instead of soil. However, the\nwater culture is related\
    \ to the process of hydroponic and\naeroponic plant cultivation (Figure 1). In\
    \ both methods, the\nroots of the plant are continuously or intervalley nurtured\n\
    with or within water nutrient solution by providing a spe-\nciﬁc control environment\
    \ in artiﬁcial supporting structure\n[16, 17]. Both methods provide many beneﬁts\
    \ to the grower\nsuch as full control of nutrient concentration and supply and\n\
    prevention of many soil-borne diseases and infections to\nplant, thus resulting\
    \ in increased plant yield with signiﬁcant\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\

    \ of available\nnatural resources [18, 19].\nSeveral studies reported aeroponic\
    \ and hydroponic\nsystems as a modern and innovative plant cultivation tech-\n\
    niques under the soilless system. By adopting these tech-\nniques, the growing\
    \ food crises could be resolved [20, 21].\nMoreover, the hydroponic system to\
    \ grow initially leafy\ngreen vegetables was the ﬁrst to emerge, which started\
    \ taking\ncommercial exploitation routes in industrialised countries in\nwest\
    \ and east but eventually was found to have particular\ndefects and problems that\
    \ forced people to discover and\nexperiment with newer variations and techniques\
    \ like the\naeroponic system. According to the NASA report, the aero-\nponic system\
    \ could reduce water, nutrient, and pesticide\nusage by 98, 60, and 100 percent,\
    \ respectively, and increase\nthe plant yield by 45 to 75 percent [22].\nThe primary\
    \ motivation of this review article is to pro-\nvide an idea about the use of\
    \ intelligent sensor techniques\nin the aeroponic system. It could provide an\
    \ opportunity\nfor full automation, scalability, anytime-anyplace access\nmonitoring,\
    \ and fault diagnostics in the aeroponic system.\nMoreover, it would be helpful\
    \ for the local farmer and grower\nto provide timely information about rising\
    \ problems and\ninﬂuencing factors for successful plant growth in the aeropo-\n\
    nic system. The farmers could start to understand their crops\nat a micro scale\
    \ and able to communicate with plant through\naccessible technology. To the best\
    \ of our knowledge, this is\nthe ﬁrst work to provide a brief review of the use\
    \ of intelligent\nsensor techniques in the aeroponic system. However, the rest\n\
    of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the\ncurrent work in\
    \ the aeroponic system with intelligent sensor\ntechniques. In Sections 3, 4,\
    \ and 5, we present the brief\ndescription about the aeroponic system, application,\
    \ and\nworking protocol of wireless sensor network in the aeroponic\nsystem. Sections\
    \ 6, 7, 8, and 9 describe the advantages, future\napplication, application of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence in agricul-\nture, and conclusion.\n2. Related Work\n\
    Aeroponics is the new plant growing technique of modern\nagriculture. Until now,\
    \ it is not entirely implicated among\nthe farmers. Mostly, it is practiced by\
    \ the researchers for\nperforming the experimental studies. Their study reports\n\
    concluded that it could be well accepted in agriculture as\na modern-day plant\
    \ cultivation activity where the modern\nfarmer does not need soil to grow the\
    \ plant. However, the\naeroponic system has some substantial vulnerability like\
    \ a\nfailure of water supply pumps, nutrient distribution line\nand preparation,\
    \ and atomization nozzle clogging, which\nrequire special knowledge and attention\
    \ to avoid damage,\nrapid plant death, and failure of the system [23]. Further-\n\
    more, the integration of the intelligent agriculture techniques\ncould be the\
    \ best solution to avoid or deal with the above-\nmentioned issues without any\
    \ technical expertise. Xiong\nand Qiao [24] reported that the integration of the\
    \ intelligent\nagriculture systems could be an eﬀective approach for solving\n\
    complex problems of agriculture domains. Zhai et al. [25]\nreported that presently,\
    \ several research studies had been\nconducted on the use of intelligent techniques\
    \ in agriculture\nespecially in the last two decades. Besides, several new tech-\n\
    niques and application have been introduced and patented\nto improve the traditional\
    \ agriculture practices. However,\nexperts mainly focused and monitor the climatic\
    \ condition,\nsoil properties, water quality, plant development, livestock\nmanagement,\
    \ and fertilizer application, pesticide applica-\ntion, and illumination control\
    \ through various intelligent\ntechniques [26–32]. Meanwhile, it could be concluded\
    \ that\ntraditional agricultural logistics is improved and upgraded by\nintroducing\
    \ and implementing the several modern technolo-\ngies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ domains [33]. Basnet and\nBang [34] reported that the collecting information\
    \ through\nsensors and communication technology played a vital role\nin improving\
    \ agricultural production. It has shifted agri-\nculture from input-intensive\
    \ to knowledge-intensive, and\nagriculture becomes more networked and decision-making.\n\
    Both small- and large-scale farmer can beneﬁt from intro-\nducing this technique\
    \ into the agriculture value chain, having\ntheir productivity increased, quality\
    \ improved, services\nextended, and costs reduced. It provides insights into various\n\
    issues in the agriculture like weather prediction, crop and\nlivestock disease,\
    \ irrigation management, and supply and\ndemand of agriculture inputs and outputs\
    \ and helps in solv-\ning those problems. Rehman and Shaikh [35] concluded that\n\
    at present, several information technologies including satel-\nlite navigation,\
    \ grid and ubiquitous computing, and sensor\nnetwork are exercised in agriculture.\
    \ However, the applica-\ntion of the sensor network is supporting agriculture\
    \ practices\nand activities in a very positive direction [36, 37]. Zhang and\n\
    coworkers [38] used a sensor network to monitor air tem-\nperature, humidity,\
    \ ambient light, and soil moisture and\ntemperature. Also, the aeroponic system\
    \ is the new applica-\ntion of the soilless agriculture. Besides, several studies\
    \ had\nbeen successfully designed the aeroponic system by using\nvarious information\
    \ technologies approaches such as Tik\nand coworkers [39] designed and implemented\
    \ a wireless\nsensor network to monitor the aeroponic system. They used\ntemperature,\
    \ light intensity, pH, and EC monitoring sen-\nsors. Moreover, the study reported\
    \ that the wireless sensor\nnetwork oﬀers a wide range of information which could\n\
    be required for the horticulturist to provide a greater\nunderstanding of how\
    \ these environmental and nutrient\nparameters are correlated with plant growth.\
    \ The real-time\ninformation obtained from sensor nodes can be utilised to\noptimise\
    \ strategies to control the temperatures and the other\nproperties of the nutrient\
    \ solution. A study by Pala et al. [40]\nproposed an approach to monitor automation\
    \ and early fault\ndetection tools in the aeroponic system through intelligent\n\
    techniques. In the protocol, they designed a highly scalable\naeroponic system\
    \ and coded as aero-pot prototype. They\ndeveloped software based on a genetic\
    \ algorithm to optimise\npower consumption of the aeroponic system. Their study\n\
    concluded that using this software user can deﬁne various\nproperties and virtually\
    \ conﬁgure the aeroponic system.\nThe developed software can allow the user to\
    \ add and remove\nthe lights and pumps and deﬁne consumption of added\ndevices\
    \ with minimum grower eﬀort. Laksono et al. [41]\ndesigned a wireless sensor and\
    \ actuator network for the\n3\nJournal of Sensors\ncontrolling, monitoring, and\
    \ conditioning of an aeroponic\ngrowth chamber. The designed wireless protocol\
    \ was based\non ZigBee technique. They also designed a data transmission\nsystem\
    \ to transfer the data from the database server to\nadministrator through text\
    \ message. The proposed system\nwas based on the sensors, actuators, communication\
    \ system,\nand database server. The experiment results showed that the\nproposed\
    \ wireless protocol based on ZigBee techniques was a\nuseful tool of the wireless\
    \ sensor network to monitor the\naeroponic system. Jonas et al. [42] developed\
    \ an automatic\nmonitoring system to control the environmental and nutri-\nent\
    \ supply of the aeroponic system. The designed wireless\nprotocol was based on\
    \ Arduino development board. Their\nstudy concluded that the proposed system can\
    \ control the\nnutrient atomization frequency based on the root chamber\nmoisture\
    \ content. However, the system can automatically\ntransfer all the gathered information\
    \ to a web server and also\nshare on Twitter. Sani et al. [43] recommended a web-based\n\
    control and monitoring system for the aeroponic system.\nTheir system was composed\
    \ of microcontrollers (using\nArduino IDE program), actuators (two relays include\
    \ atomi-\nzation spray and fan on/oﬀ on speciﬁc time), the sensor (tem-\nperature\
    \ and pH sensor), LDR (light intensity sensor), and\ncommunication modules (GSM/GPRS/3G\
    \ modem). The\npresent study concluded that our proposed design was able\nto monitor\
    \ and measure the temperature, pH, light intensity,\natomization time and interval\
    \ time, and fan activation time\nand interval time in the aeroponic system. The\
    \ proposed\nmethod was able to directly send the real-time information\nfrom the\
    \ sensor to the server via the Internet using GSM.\nAnitha and Periasamy [44]\
    \ designed wireless sensor tech-\nnique to monitor the aeroponic system. The technique\
    \ was\nbased on the ZigBee prototype. The proposed network archi-\ntecture was\
    \ based on temperature, pressure, humidity, water\nlevel, and pH monitoring sensors.\
    \ The sensors transmitted\nthe gathered data to the GSM (Global System for Mobile)\n\
    node or coordinator node, whereas the gateway device was\nused to transfer the\
    \ data to the personal computer. However,\na server was connected to the database\
    \ where the maximum\nand minimum threshold values of pH, water level, and tem-\n\
    perature were ﬁxed. Furthermore, if the monitored value\nreaches above or below\
    \ the threshold values stored in the\ndatabase, thus, the system was able to start\
    \ the alarm sound\nto aware the farmer. Another study in 2016 by Kernahan\nand\
    \ Cupertino [45] invented a system to monitor and control\nthe aeroponic system\
    \ using wireless techniques. They con-\ncluded that a reliable aeroponic system\
    \ provides a wireless\nconnection between its subsystem for the exchange of data\n\
    and commands. The various subsystems manage one or\nmore plants growing atriums\
    \ include nutrient atomization\non hanged roots, maintenance, control of nutrient\
    \ solution\nlevel, the addition of various nutrients, and control of the\nlight\
    \ quantity and cycle. A study by Montoya et al. [46]\ndesigned a wireless sensor\
    \ system to monitor the aeroponic\nsystem. The system protocol was based on the\
    \ Arduino\ndevelopment board. They used analog and digital sensors\nfor monitoring\
    \ temperature, nutrient atomization, EC, and\npH ﬂuctuations and level of nutrient\
    \ solution in the nutrient\nreservoir. In order to acquire data and automation\
    \ system,\nthe two Arduinos were managed in a master-slave conﬁgu-\nration and\
    \ connected to each other through wireless by\nWi-Fi. All the recorded data was\
    \ autosaved in microSD\nmemory and sent to a web page. Their study concluded that\n\
    the proposed protocol could be used for automation and\ncould monitor the aeroponic\
    \ system. Kerns and Lee [47]\nﬁrstly designed and introduced an aeroponic system\
    \ using\nIoT (Internet of things) to automate the system. The pro-\nposed system\
    \ is comprised of a mobile application, service\nplatform, and IoT device with\
    \ sensors (pH balance, tempera-\nture, and humidity). They used Raspberry Pi Zero\
    \ device and\ndesigned a system to monitor and measure the selected\nparameters.\
    \ The gathered data was autosaved into the data-\nbase server by sending an SQL\
    \ query. Their study concluded\nthat the proposed system could help farmers to\
    \ control and\nmonitor the aeroponic system remotely. Furthermore, Karu\n[48]\
    \ also designed and implemented a high-precision system\nfor small-scale aeroponic\
    \ plant cultivation. The system is\nallowed to precisely control the nutrient\
    \ solutions, pH, and\nEC levels and gives data about humidity, temperature, pH,\n\
    and EC concentration and amount of the nutrient solution\nin the reservoir. A\
    \ recent study by Martin and Rafael [49]\nalso proposed and suggested systems,\
    \ methods, and devices\nfor the aeroponic system. Mithunesh et al. [50] proposed\
    \ an\nintelligentcontrolsystem foranaeroponicsystem. Thesystem\nprotocol was based\
    \ on an open-source development board\ncalled Raspberry Pi. Their study concluded\
    \ that the developed\nsystem provides the simple management and high availability\n\
    established by using both the local and global systems. Idris\nand Sani [51] designed\
    \ monitoring and control system for\nthe aeroponic system. They concluded that\
    \ the developed sys-\ntem is able to monitor the aeroponic system working parame-\n\
    ter such as temperature and humidity by sending the data in\nreal time from sensor\
    \ to the display system. Janarthanan\netal.[52]concluded thattheproblemsoftheaeroponicsystem\n\
    could be solved by the use of wireless sensor and actuator\nsystem. It allows\
    \ the user to monitor and interact with the\nsystem through mobile app and a web\
    \ interface. However,\nLiu and Zhang [53, 54] designed an aeroponic system for\n\
    automatic control of water-fertilizer and temperature. They\nconcluded that system\
    \ supplies an experimental platform\nwith features of simple structure and convenient\
    \ control.\n3. The Aeroponic System\nThe aeroponic system is one of the techniques\
    \ of the soilless\nculture, where the plant grows in the air with the assistance\
    \ of\nartiﬁcial support instead of soil or substrate culture. It is an\nair-water\
    \ plant growing technique where lower portions such\nas the roots of the plant\
    \ are hanged inside the growth cham-\nber under complete darkness in controlled\
    \ conditions. How-\never, the upper portions of the plant such as leaves, fruits,\
    \ and\ncrown portion are extending outside the growth chamber.\nUsually, the artiﬁcial\
    \ supporting structure (plastic or thermo-\nfoam) is provided to support and divide\
    \ the plant into two\nparts (roots and leaves). In the system, plant roots are\
    \ openly\nexposed in the air and directly irrigated with a small droplet\nsize\
    \ of the water nutrient at interval basis. The nutrient solu-\ntion is supplied\
    \ through diﬀerent atomization nozzles with or\n4\nJournal of Sensors\nwithout\
    \ high air pressure. Moreover, several studies consid-\nered aeroponics as a modern-day\
    \ agricultural activity which\nis practiced in an enclosed growth chamber under\
    \ entire con-\ntrolled conditions, as it could eliminate the external environ-\n\
    mental factors as compared with traditional agriculture\nactivity. Hence, it is\
    \ no longer dependent on large-scale land\nuse, and it could be set up in any\
    \ place, a building that has\nlifted global climate without considering the current\
    \ climate\nsuch as rainy season and winter [23, 55–59]. Buer et al. [60]\nreported\
    \ that atomization nozzle uses the tiny amount of\nthe water nutrient solution\
    \ and provides an excellent growth\nenvironment for the plant. Zobel and Lychalk\
    \ [61] said it is a\nmodern-day agricultural research tool which provides several\n\
    agricultural research opportunities for a researcher with sig-\nniﬁcant results\
    \ by providing artiﬁcial growth conditions.\nHowever, Table 1 shows the essential\
    \ monitoring and control\nparameters in the aeroponic system. Hessel et al. [62]\
    \ and\nClawson et al. [63] studies discovered that aeroponics con-\ntributes to\
    \ the advances and developments in many areas of\nplant root studies. It provides\
    \ an excellent chance for plant\nresearchers to deeply study the behavior of plant\
    \ root under\ndiﬀerent conditions and without any complications. Until\nnow, many\
    \ researchers had conducted plant root research\nand experimental studies root\
    \ response to drought [64],\neﬀects of diﬀerent oxygen concentrations on plant\
    \ root\ndevelopment [65, 66], root microorganism [67–69], arbuscu-\nlar mycorrhizal\
    \ fungi production [70], and legume-rhizobia\ninteraction [71]. Furthermore, studies\
    \ also practiced the\ntechnique by growing vegetables, fruits, herbs, and medicinal\n\
    root-based plant [72–74] such as tomato, potato, soybean,\nmaize, lettuce, Anthurium\
    \ andreanum, and Acacia mangium\n[15, 59, 75–79].\n3.1. Present Status of the\
    \ Aeroponic System. The aeroponic\nsystem is one of a holistic production management\
    \ method\nin agriculture which promotes and improves agroecosys-\ntem, health,\
    \ and biodiversity. The system has a paramount\nreputation in the horticulture\
    \ department, because of its\nimplications on the economic and technical aspects\
    \ in the\nagriculture. Among all agriculture systems, only the aeropo-\nnic system\
    \ is receiving the full attention of farmers, policy-\nmakers, entrepreneurs,\
    \ and agricultural researchers. The\ngrower could reduce the requirements of chemical\
    \ inputs\nincluding fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and other agro-\nchemicals.\
    \ The grower could obtain higher cultivated plant\nyield and quality as compared\
    \ with other growing methods.\nHowever, the aeroponic system is labour-intensive.\
    \ It oﬀers\nmany opportunities for the farmers to increase rural employ-\nment.\
    \ The farmer can grow a plant in their homes by provid-\ning artiﬁcial growth\
    \ environment. Anitha and Periasamy\n[44] reported that nowadays many families\
    \ are practicing\nthe aeroponic system on their terrace. Besides, several coun-\n\
    tries of the world are using aeroponics for making an expan-\nsion in nourishment\
    \ creation managing the monetary issues\nand making the nation naturally amicable\
    \ to have their par-\nticular food supply. While some years ago, the use of the\n\
    aeroponic system was limited almost around the world\n[84]. At present, the system\
    \ is acquiring more attention from\nthe farmers and several countries are being\
    \ eﬀectively\nadopting as an economical and environmentally friendly veg-\netable\
    \ and fruit growing system. However, it is practiced in\nfollowing countries:\
    \ Abu Dhabi, Australia, Bhutan, Bolivia,\nBrazil, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, China,\
    \ Canada, Colombia,\nEcuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece,\n\
    Indonesia, Italy, India, Iran, Japan, Israel, Kenya, Korea,\nMalaysia, Mongolia,\
    \ Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru,\nPhilippines, Poland, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi\
    \ Arabia, South\nAfrica, Spain, Singapore, South Korea, Slovakia, Sri Lanka,\n\
    Taiwan,\nThailand,\nUzbekistan,\nand\nVietnam.\nBesides,\nattempts are made to\
    \ represent the system in other countries\nof the world [23].\n3.2. Key Problems\
    \ and Diﬃculties of the Aeroponic System.\nAeroponic cultivation is performed\
    \ in an outdoor and indoor\ninstallation and or in a greenhouse under controlled\
    \ condi-\ntions. It may be carried out within a facility that includes\nthe provision\
    \ of light for plant growth, the centralised deliv-\nery of nutrient solution,\
    \ and electrical power. The growing\nplants are set in a growth chamber and periodically\
    \ soaked\nwith nutrient solution small mist ejecting through atomiza-\ntion nozzle\
    \ (Figure 2). In addition, the aeroponic system\ngives the chance to control the\
    \ entire growth chamber envi-\nronment precisely. The aeroponic system is the\
    \ modern\ntechnique of the agriculture which is still under develop-\nment. Until\
    \ now, limited studies have been performed, and\nconducted studies concluded that\
    \ the system has some prob-\nlems and issues. Studies suggested that aeroponics\
    \ is per-\nformed without soil or any solid media; thus, the main\nobserved problems\
    \ are water and nutrient buﬀer, any fail-\nure of the water pumps, nutrient solution\
    \ distribution and\npreparation, atomization nozzle clogging, and so on, which\n\
    lead to rapid death of the grown plant [40]. Kernahan and\nCupertino [45] reported\
    \ that the aeroponic system provides\nbetter control of the plant growth and nutritional\
    \ availability\nand prevents the plant from various diseases and root rot.\nHowever,\
    \ during plant growth from sowing to harvest time,\nthe methods adopted in the\
    \ aeroponic system require a little\nhand-operated contribution, interference\
    \ regarding physical\npresence, and expertise in domain knowledge of plants, envi-\n\
    ronment control, and operations to maintain and control the\ngrowth of the plant.\n\
    Moreover, there is a requirement to sustain and keep\nretain the nutrient solution\
    \ parameters which include nutri-\nent temperature, pH, and EC concentration in\
    \ a narrow\nrange of preferred values for optimal growth. If these param-\neters\
    \ drift outside the desired range, it will create several\nproblems for plant\
    \ growth. In addition, some supplemental\nparameters can adjust to optimise the\
    \ plant growth further.\nThe additional parameters are atomization time, atomization\n\
    interval time, air temperature, relative humidity, light inten-\nsity, and carbon\
    \ dioxide (CO2) concentration which make\nthe system complicated and time-consuming\
    \ with high\nhuman energy and with the higher level of expert training\nand skill\
    \ for operating the system. However, the grower has\nthe responsibility to control\
    \ and monitor the ﬂuctuations\nof the above parameters in the desired range to\
    \ achieve\nthe suitable growth conditions for the speciﬁc plants. A fail-\nure\
    \ to accurately control and monitor the parameters could\n5\nJournal of Sensors\n\
    signiﬁcantly aﬀect the growth of the plant and cause ﬁnan-\ncial loss. If any\
    \ component failure occurs while the operator\nis not present on site, it may\
    \ be detected too late to prevent\nharm, because systems generally include some\
    \ automated\nmeans for periodically providing nutrient mist to the plant\nroots,\
    \ reﬁlling a nutrient reservoir, and managing light cycles\nand intensity. Therefore,\
    \ the aeroponic cultivation consid-\nered hitherto to be somewhat unsuitable for\
    \ the local grower\nand due to the above reasons and it is not common to\nﬁnd\
    \ an installation. However, the main reason for the low\nacceptability of the\
    \ aeroponic system is not a cost, but the\nmain drawback is the amount of attention\
    \ required of the\ngrower with a high level of expertise and judgment. For the\n\
    above-discussed reasons, more sophisticated and advanced\nmonitoring techniques\
    \ have implemented in the aeroponic\nsystem for early fault detection, real-time\

    advantageous to use artiﬁcial intelligent tools (Figure 3) in\nthe aeroponic system\
    \ to detect fault and diagnosis problems\non time. Thus, it could help to avoid\
    \ rapid damages to grown\nplants and help to fully automate the aeroponic system.\n\
    4. The Aeroponic System and Sensor Network\nIn recent years, early fault detection\
    \ and diagnosis using an\nintelligent agricultural monitoring system is considered\
    \ as\nthe best tool to monitor plant without any complicated oper-\nations and\
    \ laboratory analysis which required domain exper-\ntise and extensive time. The\
    \ development of these convenient\nfeatures has attracted much attention in the\
    \ agriculture.\nThe system is based on a wireless sensor network which\ncomprises\
    \ of a data server, a wireless convergence node,\na plurality of wireless routers,\
    \ and a plurality of wireless sen-\nsor nodes. However, the wireless sensor nodes\
    \ are used as the\nTable 1: Basic monitoring and control parameters in the aeroponic\

    \ monitoring system\nand are used to collect each selected parameter of farming\n\
    operations to be monitored. Park et al. [85] stated that wire-\nless sensor network-based\
    \ systems could be a signiﬁcant\nmethod to fully automate the agriculture system,\
    \ because\nthe sensors provide real-time signiﬁcant information and\nbelieved\
    \ to eliminate the considerable costs of just wiring.\nAnother study by Kim [86]\
    \ said that in agriculture, sensor\nnetwork technique helps to improve existing\
    \ systems\ninstalled in the greenhouse eﬃciently and smoothly by for-\nwarding\
    \ real-time collected information to the operator\nthrough the radio signals.\
    \ The system optimises the trans-\nmission protocols more accurate and quick and\
    \ maximises\nthe application of energy to save the energy and reduce the\nconsumption.\
    \ Pala and team [40] suggested that the utilisa-\ntion of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ techniques in the aeroponic sys-\ntems could lead not only to ﬁnd early fault\
    \ detection but also\nto fully automate the system without any or small interven-\n\
    tions of human operators. The aeroponic system could gain\nmore popularity among\
    \ local farmers by deploying this tech-\nnique in a system for monitoring and\
    \ controlling purpose.\nHowever, it will conserve resources and minimise impacts\n\
    on the environment. The farmers could start to understand\ntheir crops at a micro\
    \ scale and able to communicate with\nplant through accessible technology. Therefore,\
    \ in this arti-\ncle, we explored how wireless sensing technologies wove into\n\
    the aeroponic system. Thus, the primary motivation of this\nreview article was\
    \ to provide an idea about diﬀerent intelli-\ngent agriculture monitoring tools\
    \ used for early fault detec-\ntion and diagnosis for plant cultivation in the\
    \ aeroponic\nsystem (Figure 4). Additionally, it would be helpful for the\nlocal\
    \ farmer and grower to provide timely information about\nrising problems and inﬂuencing\
    \ factors for successful plant\ngrowth in the aeroponic system. The adoption of\
    \ the intelli-\ngent agriculture monitoring tools could reduce the concept\nof\
    \ unsuitable for the amateur.\n4.1. Number of Sensor Nodes and Input Parameters.\
    \ At pres-\nent, the utilisation of diﬀerent sensor techniques is almost\npossible\
    \ in every ﬁeld of life due to the sharp progressions in\nthe currently available\
    \ technologies. Moreover, the sensor is\na device that has capabilities to measure\
    \ physical attributes\nand convert them into signals for the observer [87]. A\
    \ WSN\n(wireless sensor network) traditionally consists of a few to\ndozens and\
    \ in some cases thousands of the sensor nodes\nwhich are connected to one or more\
    \ sensors [88]. Generally,\nit includes a BS (base station), which acts as a gateway\
    \ between\nthe WSN and the end users. Each sensor node is consisting of\nﬁve main\
    \ components, which are a microcontroller unit, a\ntransceiver unit, a memory\
    \ unit, a power unit, and a sensor\nunit [89]. Each one of these components is\
    \ a determinant in\ndesigning a WSN for deployment. Furthermore, the micro-\n\
    controller unit is in charge of the diﬀerent tasks, data process-\ning, and the\
    \ control of the other components in the node [88].\nThrough the transceiver unit,\
    \ a sensor mode performs its\ncommunication with other nodes and other parts of\
    \ the\nWSN. It is the most dominant communication unit. The\nmemory unit is another\
    \ important part of the WSN system,\nwhich is used to store the observed data.\
    \ The memory unit\ncould be RAM, ROM, and their other memory types ﬂash or\neven\
    \ external storage devices such as USB. Lastly, the last\none unit is the power\
    \ unit. It is one of the critical components\nof the system which is for node\
    \ energy supply. However, the\npower unit could be any source; it can store in\
    \ batteries (most\ncommon) rechargeable or not on in capacitors. In addition,\n\
    for extra power supply and recharging the power unit, the\navailable natural resource\
    \ could be used. The natural sources\ninduce solar power energy in forms of photovoltaic\
    \ panels\nand cells, wind power energy with turbines, kinetic energy\nfrom water,\
    \ and so on. Last but not the least is the sensor unit,\nwhich includes several\
    \ sensors for parameter measurements\nsuch as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide,\
    \ methane,\nand carbon monoxide [90]. However, in the aeroponic sys-\ntem, the\
    \ total required number of sensors and actuators\ndepends on the size and requirement\
    \ of the operator.\n4.2. Sensor Types and Monitoring Parameters. In this review\n\
    study, we reviewed the previous work done on the aeroponic\nsystem using wireless\
    \ sensor network technique. We found\nthat the primary objective of a wireless\

    \ and Lee [47].\n7\nJournal of Sensors\nsystem for the aeroponic system is to\
    \ control the growth\nchamber climatic condition as per the crop data sheet. How-\n\
    ever, the basic principle of the aeroponic system is to grow\nthe plant by suspending\
    \ in the closed, semiclosed, or dark\nenvironment in the air with artiﬁcial provided\
    \ support. In\nthe system, the plant stems, leaves, and any fruit grow in a\n\
    vegetative zone above the suspension medium, and roots\ndangle below the suspension\
    \ medium in an area commonly\nreferred as a root zone [46]. Generally, closed\
    \ cell foam is\ncompressed around the lower stem and inserted into an\nopening\
    \ in the aeroponic growth chamber, which decreases\nlabour and expense. However,\
    \ the trellising is used to sus-\npend the weight of cultivated plant [44]. Ideally,\
    \ the environ-\nment is kept free from pests and diseases so that the plants\n\
    grow healthier and more quickly than other plants grown\non techniques. Furthermore,\
    \ the key to the success and high\nyields of the air gardening is a scientiﬁc\
    \ grade monitoring of\nthe conditions and accurate control of the growing environ-\n\
    ment. Each plant yields and needs a diﬀerent environmental\ncondition for growth.\
    \ However, the plant growth is mainly\ninﬂuenced by the surrounding environmental\
    \ and climatic\nvariables and the amount of water and the fertilizers supplied\n\
    by irrigation. There is a requirement to monitor and control\nliquid nutrient\
    \ parameters in a narrow range of preferred\nvalues for optimal growth. The parameters\
    \ include nutrient\ntemperature, pH, and EC concentration. If the parameters\n\
    drift outside the desired range, the plants can harm. Besides,\nthere are some\
    \ additional parameters which can be adjusted\nto further optimise growth, such\
    \ as air temperature, relative\nhumidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide\
    \ (CO2) concen-\ntration. Idris and Sani [51] reported that the one solution to\n\
    solve the problems of monitoring and controlling the grow-\ning conditions in\
    \ the space environment is by applying some\nsensors. The sensor can detect and\
    \ monitor a number of\nparameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity,\n\
    O2 and CO2 levels, direction, and wind speed. Aside from\nthe sensors, there is\
    \ also a requirement for the actuators to\ndistribute nutrients and waters to\
    \ plant roots or lower stems\n(Figure 5). The sensor collects the information\
    \ of the various\nenvironmental conditions and forwards the signals to the\nactuator\
    \ to take place and produce the outcome for the col-\nlected information to know\
    \ the status of that parameter.\nThe actuator can control the environment changes.\
    \ The sen-\nsors store information that analyzes the environment and\nidentiﬁes\
    \ the location, object, people, and their situations.\nThe sensor provides multiple\
    \ contributions in various\ndomains that depend on a variety of attribute and\
    \ variant\nin time [87, 91, 92].\n4.2.1. Temperature Sensor. In the aeroponic\
    \ system, the\ntemperature is one of the critical factors signiﬁcantly\ndetermining\
    \ plant growth and development. A reduction\nin temperature below the optimal\
    \ conditions often results\nin suboptimal plant growth. A diﬀerent cultivar requires\n\
    a diﬀerent temperature level for the photosynthesis process\nand growth, which\
    \ can advance the plant growth stage. It\nwill eventually bring us substantial\
    \ economic beneﬁts. In\nthe aeroponic system, the optimum growth chamber tem-\n\
    perature should not be less and more than 4 and 30°C,\nrespectively, for successful\
    \ plant growth. The temperature\nﬂuctuations of aeroponic growth chamber can signiﬁcantly\n\
    aﬀect the root growth, respiration, transpiration, ﬂowering,\nand dormant period\
    \ [93]. Therefore, the temperature sensors\ncan be used to monitor the temperature\
    \ ﬂuctuations of the\naeroponic system. At present, temperature sensors are used\n\
    in many applications like environmental controls, food pro-\ncessing units, medical\
    \ devices, and chemical handling. The\ntemperature sensor is a device mainly composed\
    \ of thermo-\ncouple or resistance temperature detector. The temperature\nsensor\
    \ measures the real-time temperature reading through\nMobile phone\nPC\nInternet\n\

    \ the data about tem-\nperature from a particular source and convert the data\
    \ into\nan understandable form for a device or an observer. The\ntemperature\n\
    sensor\naccurately\nmeasures\ntemperatures\nslower changing from critical applications\
    \ such as facilities\nor rooms and sends them to the user’s webpage.\n4.2.2. Humidity\
    \ Sensor. Aeroponics is the technique of culti-\nvating plant by providing the\
    \ water nutrient small spray in\nthe air. Thus, the humidity is another important\
    \ parameter\nof aeroponic growth chamber environments, and its control\nis recognised\
    \ to be very important for signiﬁcant plant\ngrowth. In the aeroponic system,\
    \ the plant gets all available\nmoisture in the growth chamber. Moreover, if the\
    \ growth\nchamber has too high or less moisture content, both condi-\ntions will\
    \ create many problems for the plant. Accordingly,\nan accurate and precise means\
    \ of testing moisture content\nin the growth chamber will help farmers to monitor\
    \ their\ncrops and provide a suitable growth environment for the\nplant. Wang\
    \ et al. [94] reported that a humidity sensor is a\ndevice that detects and measures\
    \ water vapour present in\nthe air within a room or enclosure. At present, humidity\
    \ sen-\nsors are widely used in medicine, agriculture, and environ-\nmental monitoring.\
    \ However, the most commonly used\nunits for humidity measurement are relative\
    \ humidity [95].\nThe development of humidity sensors has shown remarkable\nprogress\
    \ because of using various types of sensing materials in\nrecent years. The sensing\
    \ materials used in humidity sensors\ncan classify into ceramics, polymers, and\
    \ composites [96].\nThe humidity sensor could be placed in the growth chamber\n\
    to maintain the moisture level. If the moisture level becomes\nless than the plant\
    \ requirement, the sensors will forward the\nsignals to atomization nozzles to\
    \ perform their work.\n4.2.3. Light Intensity Sensor. As we know, all vegetable\
    \ plants\nand ﬂowers require large amounts of sunlight, and each plant\ngroup\
    \ reacts diﬀerently and has the diﬀerent physiology to\ndeal with light intensity.\
    \ Some plant performs well in low\nlight intensity and some in high light intensity.\
    \ However,\nthe aeroponic system implements in indoor conditions, so\nit is necessary\
    \ for the farmer to provide suﬃcient light quan-\ntity of at least 8 to 10 hours\
    \ for a day to grow the healthy\nplant. The artiﬁcial lighting is a better option\
    \ to present\nenough intensity to produce a healthy plant [97, 98]. In the\nconventional\
    \ aeroponic system, the control of the light quan-\ntity present in the growth\
    \ chamber is mostly done by farmer\nthrough observing the plant condition. However,\
    \ it is a time-\nconsuming and challenging task for the farmer to provide the\n\
    required light concentration accurately. It could be a better\noption to use intelligent\
    \ agriculture techniques to monitor\nthe light intensity in the aeroponic system.\
    \ The intelligent\nagriculture techniques mean using the sensor system to con-\n\
    trol the light intensity. The light sensor is an electronic device\nwhich is used\
    \ to detect the presence or nonpresence of light\nand darkness. There are several\
    \ types of light sensors includ-\ning photoresistors, photodiodes, and phototransistors.\
    \ These\nlight sensors distinguish the substance of light in a growth\nchamber\
    \ and increase or decrease the brightness of light to\na more comfortable level.\
    \ Light sensors can be used to auto-\nmatically control the lights such as on/oﬀ.\
    \ By adopting the\nsensor network in aeroponics, the farmer could be able to\n\
    monitor light intensity without any human interference.\nBecause the sensors will\
    \ perform all work such as if the light\nintensity in the growth chamber will\
    \ be less than the required\nlight quantity for plant growth, the sensor will\
    \ automatically\nforward the signal to the LED light to turn on until the light\n\
    quantity reaches to the desired level.\n4.2.4. CO2 Sensor. The appropriate oxygen\
    \ concentration in\nthe root environment is crucial to keep the root metabolism\n\
    in nutrition solution. The available oxygen concentration\nfor the root environment\
    \ is a hugely signiﬁcant factor since\nlow concentrations aﬀect the root respiration,\
    \ nutrient\nabsorption, and, consequently, the plant growth [66]. Thus,\nthe CO2\
    \ sensor could be used to monitor the carbon dioxide\nﬂuctuations in the aeroponic\
    \ growth chamber. A carbon\ndioxide sensor is an instrument which is used for\
    \ the mea-\nsurement of carbon dioxide gas concentration. Bihlmayr\npH sensor\n\

    \ sensors are used to measure indoor\nair quality in a building to perform demand-based\
    \ ventila-\ntion. However, the CO2 sensor data measuring range is in\nbetween\
    \ 500 and 5000 parts per million. There are two main\ntypes of the CO2 sensors\
    \ which include nondispersive infra-\nred carbon dioxide sensors (NICDS) and chemical\
    \ carbon\ndioxide sensors (CCDS), whereas the NICDS detected CO2\nin a gaseous\
    \ environment by its characteristic absorption\nand composed of an infrared detector,\
    \ an interference ﬁlter,\na light tube, and an infrared source. However, the CCDS\
    \ of\nsensitive layers are based on polymer or heteropolysiloxane\nwith low-energy\
    \ consumption [100].\n4.2.5. Water Level Sensor. The aeroponics is the method\
    \ of\nthe plant cultivation by providing a small mist of the nutrient\nsolution\
    \ in the growth chamber. Thus, there is no any use of\nsoil; just water is required\
    \ to cultivate the plant throughout\nthe germination to harvest time. Therefore,\
    \ the water nutri-\nent solution reservoir is one of the major components of\n\
    the aeroponic system which should be monitored throughout\nthe growth period.\
    \ In the conventional aeroponic system, the\nfarmer checks the water nutrient\
    \ level in the nutrient solution\nreservoir, and if he founds water level less\
    \ than the desired\nlevel, he maintained accordingly. However, by adopting the\n\
    precision agriculture techniques, the farmer will be able to\nmonitor and control\
    \ water nutrient level through the intelli-\ngent methods such as wireless sensors.\
    \ The water nutrient\nlevel sensors detect the liquid level in the reservoirs\
    \ and facil-\nitate operator in collecting water nutrient level data in real\n\
    time. The sensors will alert the operator about any potential\nproperty damage\
    \ that results from any leaks and also allow-\ning to know when a container is\
    \ nearing empty.\n4.2.6. EC and pH Sensor. In the aeroponic system, the plant\n\
    productivity is closely related to nutrient uptake and the EC\nand pH regulation\
    \ of the nutrient solution. The EC and pH\nconcentration of the nutrient solution\
    \ aﬀects the availability\nof the nutrients to plants [101]. The pH and EC concentra-\n\
    tions are controlled to prevent barrier growth. Their mea-\nsurement is essential\
    \ because the solubility of minerals in\nacidic, alkaline, and ion concentration\
    \ of all the species in\nsolutions is diﬀerent and the solution concentration\
    \ changes\nwith solubility [102, 103]. The unmonitored EC and pH\nconcentration\
    \ of the nutrient solution will quickly lead to\na situation where plants cannot\
    \ absorb the essential nutri-\nents, if not corrected this will eventually lead\
    \ to harmful\nplant growth and poor productivity. Thus, the EC and pH\nconcentration\
    \ of the nutrient solution is a critical parameter\nto be measured and controlled\
    \ throughout the plant growth.\nMoreover, in the conventional aeroponic system,\
    \ the EC and\npH value of the nutrient solution is mostly monitored manu-\nally\
    \ by performing laboratory analysis or using advanced\nequipment which is a time-consuming\
    \ process. For instance,\nwhen the EC of the nutrient solution decreased or increased,\n\
    the control of nutrient solution concentration is mostly\nachieved by adding more\
    \ high concentration nutrient solu-\ntion or the fresh water, respectively, to\
    \ the nutrient solution\nto maintain the EC level to the prescribed target range.\
    \ Sim-\nilarly, for pH, an acid solution and an alkali solution are used\nto control\
    \ the pH ﬂuctuation of the nutrient solution within a\nspeciﬁed target range [101].\
    \ However, these conventional\nmethods are time-consuming and challenging task\
    \ for the\nfarmer to maintain the EC and pH value at the desired range\naccurately.\
    \ In addition, the EC and pH sensor could be used\nto deal with the above challenges.\n\
    5. Sensor Working Protocol in the\nAeroponic System\nToday, the world demands\
    \ automatic tools to do most of the\nwork for them without bothering its user\
    \ for doing some task.\nSo, the concept is all about a very high level of automation\n\
    system which will be independent of its users to a very great\nextent, reduce\
    \ human eﬀorts, and save all kinds of resource\nutilisation, as monitoring and\
    \ controlling will be done by\ncomputers leaving very few easily manageable tasks\
    \ for\nhumans, and it will interest more people to join this ﬁeld\n[104–106].\
    \ Moreover, the monitoring and control system\nfor the aeroponic system mainly\
    \ consists of following sec-\ntions which include the aeroponic system, data acquisition,\n\
    controlling the equipment, data transmission module, cloud\ndata processing server,\
    \ social communication platform, and\nmobile application. A typical architecture\
    \ of sensor nodes\nfor controlling and monitoring the aeroponic system is\nshown\
    \ in Figure 6. Furthermore, in architecture, the data\nacquisition section refers\
    \ to some sensor nodes used in the\nAeroponic system\nData acquisition\nMobile\
    \ application\nControl and\nmonitoring center\nData transmission\nmodule\nSocial\
    \ platform\nCloud data\nprocessing server\nFigure 6: Schematic protocol of wireless\
    \ network in the aeroponic system.\n10\nJournal of Sensors\nsystem to establish\
    \ a data acquisition module. The data\nacquisition module is placed in the aeroponic\
    \ system or near\nthe growth chamber to collect the real-time information\nfrom\
    \ selected parameters (temperature, light intensity,\nhumidity, nutrient solution\
    \ level, atomization quantity, and\nphotos of the growing plants) and transmit\
    \ the gathered data\nto the control and management centre. However, the control\n\
    and management section refers to the central processing unit\n(CPU) of the system.\
    \ The CPU of the system consists of some\nprimary functions such as Arduino and\
    \ WRTnod protocols,\nwhose work is to store, manage gathered data from collection\n\
    nodes, process, and then accurately and automatically send\nto the web server\
    \ in real time [104–109]. Thus, the system\ncan help the farmer and grower to\
    \ monitor and control the\nsmart aeroponic system remotely using the mobile app.\
    \ In\nother words, the plant will be able to talk with the farmer\nthrough a mobile\
    \ app that whether the selected parameters\nare working well or not.\n6. Advantages\
    \ of Sensor Techniques in the\nAeroponic System\nThe continuously increasing food\
    \ demands require rapid\nimprovement and development in the food production\n\
    system. However, to enhance the quality and productivity\nof the cultivated crop,\
    \ peoples are moving towards the mod-\nern plant cultivation technologies in agriculture.\
    \ Thus, the\naeroponics is one of the rising plant growing technologies\nin agriculture\
    \ as a modern-day cultivation technique, where\nthe plant is cultivated in an\
    \ air environment, and no any soil\nsupport is provided. In the aeroponic system,\
    \ a number of the\nparameters are required to control for successful plant\ngrowth\
    \ because there is no any growing medium provided\nto the plant. For example,\
    \ if the plant has some sudden stress\nand the farmer is not present at the site\
    \ that means the plant\nwill die. Therefore, the proper management of the crop\
    \ is\nessential. In the conventional aeroponic system, grower uses\nhis knowledge,\
    \ skills, and judgment to adjust and maintain\nthe parameters such as EC and pH\
    \ meter, minimum and\nmaximum temperature, light intensity, and humidity level\n\
    through several instruments and checks the readings which\nare labour-intensive\
    \ and time-consuming task. To deal with\nthe above problems, the aeroponic system\
    \ can be developed\nwith a wireless sensor and actuator network for monitoring\n\
    the key parameters at lower labour cost, time, and without\nany technical knowledge.\
    \ The wireless sensor and actuator\nnetwork oﬀer several advantages including\
    \ faster response\nto confrontational climatic conditions and better quality con-\n\
    trol of the crop that produces at a lower labour cost. This\nadvancement in the\
    \ aeroponic system through wireless sen-\nsor network for monitoring growth chamber\
    \ environment\nis beneﬁcial. However, the monitoring system also oﬀers a\nrange\
    \ of information which could be required by plant scien-\ntists or grower to provide\
    \ a greater understanding of how\nthese environmental and nutrient parameters\
    \ correlate with\nplant growth. It is now recognised that plant grower can per-\n\
    fectly and easily acquire the skills needed to operate an aero-\nponic system.\
    \ It provides the full control of the system, not by\nconstant manual attention\
    \ from the operator but to a large\nextent by wireless sensors.\n7. Future Application\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence agriculture techniques are consid-\nered as a high potential,\
    \ improving technique for decision-\nmaking in agriculture. Nowadays, it is quickly\
    \ getting peo-\nples’ intention, more and more visible in our society and\ndynamically\
    \ turning our social awareness and lifestyle. The\ntechniques provide several\
    \ opportunities to monitor the\nplant growth and development from pre- to postharvest.\n\
    Aeroponics is the new plant cultivation technology of agri-\nculture which is\
    \ still under development. However, we\nreviewed the literature and found that\
    \ only limited study\nhad been conducted on the implementation of the intelligent\n\
    agricultural techniques in the aeroponic system. Moreover,\nuntil now, most of\
    \ the studies had been designed the aeropo-\nnic system using a wireless sensor\
    \ network using ZigBee and\nArduino system with Bluetooth, global system of mobile\
    \ and\nWi-Fi, and communication modules. During a literature\nsurvey, we noted\
    \ that no any single study had implemented\nthe idea of the cloud computing and\
    \ big data techniques in\naeroponics to collect real-time information via the\
    \ Internet.\nThe techniques provide many advantages to the user such\nas reduction\
    \ of the initial cost, allocation of the resources\non demand, and maintenance\
    \ and upgrade performed in\nthe back-end, easy, and rapid development. The techniques\n\
    present a chance to the operator to stay connected with the\nsystem using mobile\
    \ accessories like a smartphone, tablet,\nand PCs at any location via the Internet\
    \ which is not\nrestricted by conditions, locations, and time. Furthermore,\n\
    the system would be designed using additional artiﬁcial\nintelligence techniques\
    \ such as image processing, automatic\nseedling transplanters, and harvesting\
    \ and packing robots.\nThe purpose of image processing and analysis is to measure\n\
    and identify the physiology, growth, development, nutrient\ndeﬁciencies, diseases,\
    \ and other phenotypic properties of\nthe plants through automated and nondestructive\
    \ analysis.\n8. Application of Artificial Intelligence\nTechniques in Agriculture\n\
    Agriculture is the primitive and ancient application that\nhumans started ﬁrst\
    \ after born on earth. It has an extensive\nhistory between numerous industries\
    \ and very intimately\nlinked to the human development on earth. Moreover, in\n\
    the past, the agriculture sector was labour-intensive, but the\nnext-generation\
    \ farmers, researchers, and associated organi-\nsations proposed and applied new\
    \ farming methods, technol-\nogies, skills, and knowledge in agriculture as a\
    \ modern era to\nreduce labour-intensive task. Presently, the technology is\n\
    considered as a key tool to overcome many challenges and\neases the way how people\
    \ live. In the past, the many problems\nof agriculture, especially in irrigation\
    \ water management,\ncrop yield production, environment predication, and deci-\n\
    sion-making, were decided by many factors. In addition,\nthe fertilization often\
    \ decided by the mathematical equations,\nformulas, or the experiences of the\
    \ experts. The cultivation is\n11\nJournal of Sensors\nrepresented by descriptive\
    \ and causal knowledge, and diag-\nnosis of pests and diseases is represented\
    \ by uncertain knowl-\nedge. Thus, this knowledge and experience are illogically\n\
    incomplete and imprecise, and the traditional procedures\ncan not handle them.\
    \ However, artiﬁcial intelligence has its\nsuperiority. It could be an eﬀective\
    \ approach for solving com-\nplex problems to the levels of experts using imitate\
    \ experts\n[110]. The term artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) was developed in\n1956,\
    \ as “the science and engineering of making intelligent\nmachines” [111]. It is\
    \ a abroad discipline, which was devel-\noped for the interaction of several types\
    \ of ﬁelds such as com-\nputer science, information theory, cybernetics, linguistics,\n\
    neurophysiology, and psychology [112]. The main purpose\nof the creation of the\
    \ intelligence techniques is to ﬁnd the\nsolutions for complex problems and to\
    \ work, react, and\nrespond like humans. It performed work better than a well-\n\
    qualiﬁed person and brought positive economic and environ-\nmental results [112,\
    \ 113]. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) tools\nhave helped to predict the behavior\
    \ of nonlinear systems\nand to control variables to improve the operating conditions\n\
    of a system’s environment [114–117]. A recently published\nreport highlighted\
    \ that artiﬁcial intelligence is emerging as\npart of the solutions towards improved\
    \ agricultural produc-\ntivity. The global artiﬁcial intelligence in agriculture\
    \ is\nexpected to grow at a signiﬁcant level. It is employed to\nimprove the eﬃciency\
    \ of daily tasks in agriculture such as\nthe adoption of robots and drones, crop\
    \ health monitoring\nprotocols, automated irrigation system, and driverless trac-\n\
    tors [118]. At present, several research studies have been per-\nformed by implementing\
    \ the artiﬁcial intelligent techniques\nin agriculture. Popa [119] revealed that\
    \ some of the devel-\noped applications for agriculture are expert systems and\
    \ soft-\nware, sensors for collecting and transmitting data, and\nrobotic and\
    \ automation which are adapted from diﬀerent\nindustries into agriculture, whereas\
    \ the expert systems and\nsoftware is the planning process such as strategic or\
    \ opera-\ntional; it has beneﬁted substantially, due to the expansion of\npersonal\
    \ computer and Internet use. The systems are gener-\nated through the structured\
    \ knowledge base and reasoning\nmechanisms acquired from a human expert but with\
    \ an\nenhanced computational power and speed [120]. These sys-\ntems can demarcate\
    \ management zones taking in consider-\nation with relevant factors and able to\
    \ recommend suitable\ncrop rotations, optimal plant density, water requirements,\n\
    appropriate fertilizer use, diagnosing pests and diseases for\ncrops, and suggesting\
    \ preventive or curative measures\n[121]. Huang et al. [122] discussed soft computing\
    \ and appli-\ncations in agriculture. The study reported that soft comput-\ning\
    \ is the combination of the computing technologies, such\nas an artiﬁcial neural\
    \ networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic (FL),\nand genetic algorithms (GAs). These techniques\
    \ are opposed\nto the hard computing method which states to a huge set of\nstochastic\
    \ and statistical methods. The hard computing\nprovides inaccurate solutions and\
    \ results of very complex\nproblems through modelling and analysis with a tolerance\n\
    of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and an approxima-\ntion. However,\
    \ the soft computing techniques are used to\nachieve tractability and robustness.\
    \ It provides a low-cost\nsolution with a tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty,\
    \ partial\ntruth, and approximation [123–127]. Sui and Thomasson\n[128] developed\
    \ a BP-trained feedforward ANNs to predict\nnitrogen status in cotton plants based\
    \ on a data from a\nground-based sensing system. Tumbo and team [129] used\nan\
    \ on-the-go system for sensing chlorophyll status in corn\nusing BP-trained feedforward\
    \ ANNs and ﬁber optic spec-\ntrometry to acquire spectral response pattern data\
    \ in corn\nﬁelds. Tang et al. [130] developed a texture-based weed clas-\nsiﬁcation\
    \ method consisting of a low-level Gabor wavelet-\nbased feature extraction algorithm\
    \ and a high-level ANN-\nbased pattern recognition algorithm. El-Faki and group\n\
    [131] established and tested ANN-based weed detection\nalgorithms capable of detecting\
    \ the leading weed species\ncompeting with wheat and soybean crops. A study by\
    \ Krish-\nnaswamy and Krishnan [132] predicted the nozzle wear rates\nfor four\
    \ fan nozzles using regression and ANN methods.\nPearson and Wicklow [133] developed\
    \ a neural network to\nidentify fungal species that infect single kernels using\
    \ princi-\npal components of the reﬂectance spectra as input features.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [134] developed year-round air temperature pre-\ndiction models for prediction\
    \ horizons from 1 to 12 h using\nfeedforward-style ANNs. Zadeh [123] introduced\
    \ the con-\ncept of fuzzy sets as a mean for describing complex systems\nwithout\
    \ the requirements for precision. Fuzzy logic may also\nbe useful for descriptive\
    \ systems, those that fall somewhere\nbetween hard systems and soft systems, such\
    \ as biology\nand agriculture [135]. Studies reported that in agriculture,\nfuzzy\
    \ logic is used for multicriteria analysis of the image,\nimage classiﬁcation,\
    \ vegetation mapping, assessment of soil\nsuitability, and planning forest harvesting\
    \ [136–143]. Al-\nFaraj and coworkers [144] established a rule-based FL crop\n\
    water stress index (CWSI) using growth chamber data and\ntested this method on\
    \ tall fescue canopies grown in a green-\nhouse. Thomson et al. [145] and Thomson\
    \ and Ross [146]\ndeveloped a coupled sensor- and model-based irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ method. Yang et al. [147, 148] informed on the\ndevelopment of an image capture/processing\
    \ system to\ndetect weeds and a fuzzy logic decision-making system to\ndetermine\
    \ where and how much herbicide to apply in an\nagricultural ﬁeld. Gil and team\
    \ [149] applied multiple linear\nregression and FL inference models to evaluate\
    \ the eﬀects of\nmicrometeorological conditions on pesticide application for\n\
    two spray qualities (ﬁne and very ﬁne). Qiu et al. [150]\nestablished a fuzzy\
    \ irrigation decision-making system using\nvirtual instrumentation platform of\
    \ sensors, test instru-\nments, data logger, and LabVIEW. Generally, published\n\
    studies use on/oﬀ controllers where the inherent complexity\nof irrigation process\
    \ made it diﬃcult to achieve optimal\nresults [151]. Ali et al. [152] developed\
    \ temperature and\nhumidity controller inside the greenhouse using fuzzy logic.\n\
    However, several studies have been conducted to develop\nmany control strategies\
    \ to optimise the greenhouse environ-\nment using artiﬁcial intelligence techniques\
    \ such as neural\nnetwork, fuzzy logic controller, adaptive predictive control,\n\
    PID, and nonlinear adaptive PID control [153–159]. Zhu\net al. [160] used the\
    \ remote wireless system for water\nquality online monitoring in intensive aquaculture\
    \ using\nartiﬁcial neural networks. The results demonstrate that\nonline monitoring\
    \ for water quality information could be\n12\nJournal of Sensors\naccurately acquired\
    \ and predicted by using the remote\nwireless system. Mahajan et al. [161] reported\
    \ that agricul-\nture is noteworthy that computer vision applications have\ngrown\
    \ due to reduced equipment costs, increased computa-\ntional power, and increasing\
    \ interest in nondestructive food\nassessment methods. The use of these techniques\
    \ presents\nadvantages when compared with traditional methods based\non manual\
    \ work; however, there are still some challenges\nto be overcome. Moreover, the\
    \ principle of artiﬁcial intel-\nligence in agriculture is one where a machine\
    \ can perceive\nits environment, and through a certain capacity of ﬂexible\nrationality,\
    \ can act to address a speciﬁed goal related to\nthat environment.\n9. Conclusion\n\
    The objective of our study was to present the information\nabout the use of automated\
    \ monitoring and controlling tech-\nnique in the aeroponic system. The aeroponic\
    \ system is the\nnew plant cultivation method of the modern agriculture. Its\n\
    existence can allow producing food whole year without any\ninterval. The system\
    \ could create an excellent set which\nencourages the sustainable city life for\
    \ those peoples who\nwant to live in urban area. Moreover, during plant growth\n\
    from sowing to harvest time, the methods adopted in the\naeroponic system require\
    \ a little hand-operated contribution,\ninterference regarding physical presence,\
    \ and expertise in\ndomain knowledge of plants, environment control, and oper-\n\
    ations to maintain and control the growth of the plant.\nTherefore, the system\
    \ is considered hitherto to be somewhat\nunsuitable for the grower, and due to\
    \ the above reasons, it is\nnot common to ﬁnd an installation. We reviewed the\
    \ litera-\nture and found that implementation of advanced monitoring\ntechnology\
    \ tools in aeroponics could provide an opportunity\nfor the farmer to monitor\
    \ and control several paraments\nwithout using laboratory instruments, and the\
    \ farmer can\ncontrol the entire system remotely. Thus, it could reduce\nthe concept\
    \ of the usefulness of the system due to the com-\nplicated manual monitoring\
    \ and controlling process. The\ntechnology oﬀers incredible opportunities for\
    \ the aeroponic\nsystem to increase the capability, reliability, and availability\n\
    among the farmers and growers. We believe that our review\narticle will contribute\
    \ to the adoption of the advanced mon-\nitoring technology in the aeroponic system.\
    \ However, the\ntechnique provides a range of information which could be\nrequired\
    \ by plant scientists to provide a greater understand-\ning of how these environmental\
    \ and nutrient parameters\ncorrelate with plant growth.\nConflicts of Interest\n\

    \ more data-centric and requires precise, more advanced\ndata and technologies\
    \ than before, despite being familiar with agricultural processes. The agriculture\n\
    industry is being advanced by various information and advanced communication technologies,\
    \ such\nas the Internet of Things (IoT). The rapid emergence of these advanced\
    \ technologies has restructured\nalmost all other industries, as well as advanced\
    \ agriculture, which has shifted the industry from a\nstatistical approach to\
    \ a quantitative one. This radical change has shaken existing farming techniques\n\
    and produced the latest prospects in a series of challenges. This comprehensive\
    \ review article en-\nlightens the potential of the IoT in the advancement of\
    \ agriculture and the challenges faced when\ncombining these advanced technologies\
    \ with conventional agricultural systems. A brief analysis\nof these advanced\
    \ technologies with sensors is presented in advanced agricultural applications.\n\
    Numerous sensors that can be implemented for speciﬁc agricultural practices require\
    \ best manage-\nment practices (e.g., land preparation, irrigation systems, insect,\
    \ and disease management). This\nreview includes the integration of all suitable\
    \ techniques, from sowing to harvesting, packaging,\ntransportation, and advanced\
    \ technologies available for farmers throughout the cropping system.\nBesides,\
    \ this review article highlights the utilization of other tools such as unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) for crop monitoring and other beneﬁciary measures, such\
    \ as optimizing crop yields. In addi-\ntion, advanced programs based on the IoT\
    \ are also discussed. Finally, based on our comprehensive\nreview, we identiﬁed\
    \ advanced prospects regarding the IoT, which are essential tools for sustainable\n\
    agriculture.\nKeywords: IoT; agriculture advancement; UAVs; sustainable agriculture\n\
    1. Introduction\nIn order to increase agricultural production with limited resources,\
    \ major technological\nadvancements have been implemented throughout much of human\
    \ history. However, a\ngrowing population along with climate change always poses\
    \ a threat between food supply\nand demand. The world’s population is estimated\
    \ to reach 9 billion by 2050, which is\nabout a twenty-ﬁve percent increase over\
    \ the current population [1]. However, population\ngrowth will be larger, mostly\
    \ in emerging countries such as Mexico, India, China, and\nothers [2]. Additionally,\
    \ the urbanization trend is expected to accelerate in developing\ncountries by\
    \ 2050. Currently, 49% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, which\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 4883. https://doi.org/10.3390/su13094883\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n2 of 31\nis expected to increase to 70% by 2050\
    \ [3]. Besides, since the living standard is expected\nto increase in the future,\
    \ it will further increase food demand, particularly in emerging\nnations. Due\
    \ to the continuous increase in the global population, we should be more\ncautious\
    \ regarding nutritional values and food quality. To meet future food demands,\n\
    food production should be doubled by 2050 [4,5]. In particular, grain crops and\
    \ meat\nproduction should be increased from 2.1 billion tons to 3 billion tons,\
    \ and 200 million tons\nto 470 million tons, respectively, to meet the world food\
    \ demand by 2050 [6,7].\nIndeed, crops such as rubber, cotton, and chewing gum\
    \ play a crucial role in various\ncountries’ economies. In addition, crop-based\
    \ bioenergy markets have recently begun to\ngrow. Even ten years ago, 110 million\
    \ tons of coarse grains (about 10% of world production)\nwere used for ethanol\
    \ production alone [7,8]. Food security is also threatened by the\nincreased use\
    \ of food crops for biofuel production, bioenergy, and other industrial uses.\n\
    These biofuel/bioenergy demands have put further pressure on already scarce agricultural\n\
    resources. Unfortunately, due to different constraints (e.g., temperature, terrain,\
    \ and soil\nand water qualities), only a limited part of the Earth’s surface is\
    \ appropriate for agricultural\nuse. Moreover, the existing farming land is further\
    \ narrowed because of economic and\npolitical factors, including population growth,\
    \ climate, and land-use patterns, while the\nrapid urbanization process is continuously\
    \ putting pressure on the availability of arable\nland. Thus, since arable land\
    \ is decreasing, these factors would be major threats to crop\nproduction. Additionally,\
    \ crop production is already reduced due to a lack of arable land\nover the last\
    \ few decades [8]. For example, in 1991, arable land for the crop production\n\
    was 19.5 million square miles, which was 39.47% of the total agricultural land\
    \ area, but\nthat area was decreased to 18.6 million square miles in 2013, which\
    \ is about 37.73% of\nthe total agricultural land area of the world and is expected\
    \ to decrease in the future [9].\nConsequently, a larger gap between the demand\
    \ and supply of food is observed, which\nbecomes apparent and shocking over time.\n\
    Further, the quality and quantity of crops rely on climate, topography, and soil\
    \ charac-\nteristics. Major features such as available nutrients, soil types,\
    \ soil health, insect resistance,\nand quality and quantity of irrigation determine\
    \ its adaptability and the quality of certain\ncrops. In most cases, crop characteristics\
    \ and yields may vary within the same farm plot.\nTherefore, site-speciﬁc analysis\
    \ or the precision farming technique is required to obtain\noptimal yields. Besides\
    \ increasing crop production, growers and farmers need to practice\nmultiple cropping,\
    \ mixed cropping, year-round cropping, or intensive cropping. To meet\nthese needs,\
    \ growers and farmers require the latest/advanced technologies and services-\n\
    based techniques to produce more foods with limited land and resources. Farmers/growers\n\
    must monitor their croplands at a near to real-time scale to apply necessary measures\
    \ to\nenhance crop production. For this reason, there is a need for smart agriculture.\n\
    Currently, farmers and growers have to spend 70% of their time monitoring and\n\
    understanding the status of the crops rather than performing actual farm work\
    \ [10]. Hence,\nprecise and advanced technologies are required to advance the\
    \ agricultural sector. Addi-\ntionally, for sustainable agriculture, the effects\
    \ of climatic and environmental conditions\nshould be minimal. The Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) gives producers better results because\nof “on-site monitoring”\
    \ capabilities, allowing them to monitor farms remotely. Wireless\nsensors help\
    \ to continuously monitor crops with greater accuracy, and most importantly,\n\
    they can identify issues at the early growth stages of crops/plants. The latest\
    \ technologies\nand tools enhance agricultural operations during the crop growth\
    \ stages, such as crop har-\nvesting, the transportation of cropping materials,\
    \ and storage conditions [10]. During these\ndevelopmental stages of crops, advanced\
    \ technology, such as the IoT, plays a signiﬁcant\nrole, making the process efﬁcient\
    \ for the growers. Currently, several tools, including har-\nvesters, robot weeders,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other automatic machines,\nare beneﬁcial\
    \ to the growers for crop monitoring. For this purpose, several sensors are\n\
    installed in the ﬁeld. These sensors rapidly provide information regarding soil\
    \ health and\ncrop health, and associated factors. The IoT is a part of the latest\
    \ agricultural technology,\nwhich helps collect data from the ﬁeld.\nSustainability\

    \ modiﬁed from Talavera\net al. [26].\n3.1. Soil Monitoring\nSoil plays a critical\
    \ role in plant growth. It is necessary to monitor the soil at the ﬁeld\nscale.\
    \ By obtaining the soil’s health information, a grower can make fruitful decisions\
    \ at\ndifferent plant developmental stages. The main objective of soil analysis\
    \ is to measure\nthe content of nutrients present in the soil, which ultimately\
    \ leads to many treatments to\nfulﬁll the level of nutrients. Remarkably, the\
    \ soil test is suggested annually in the spring\nseason; however, it can be changed\
    \ according to the local environmental conditions and\nSustainability 2021, 13,\
    \ 4883\n6 of 31\nconducted in the winter or autumn season [27]. Several soil factors,\
    \ such as soil types\nand soil moisture, are recommended to analyze and quantify\
    \ fertilizers and irrigation\nrequirements. These primary factors also help provide\
    \ information regarding the other\nvital factors, including physical, chemical,\
    \ biological ones. The soil map helps to identify\nareas with good soil health\
    \ and texture for the suitability of seeds, sowing time, and even\nsowing depth\
    \ because some plants have deep roots and others have shallow root depths.\nMany\
    \ researchers have recently developed tools, technologies, and devices to monitor\n\
    soil health. These new tools are the major resources for farmers and growers,\
    \ which can\nbe used to monitor soil features such as water holding capacity,\
    \ moisture, chemical, and\nphysical properties. These tools also help monitor\
    \ soil health, such as salinity, pH, soil\norganic carbon (SOC), electrical conductivity\
    \ (EC), nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus,\nwhich help estimate required fertilizers.\
    \ One of the latest tools introduced by Agro Cares is\nthe Scanner and Lab-in-box,\
    \ which is known as a laboratory, having complete information\nby services through\
    \ which it gives soil status information [28]. This is the modiﬁed tool\nused\
    \ by many farmers without any laboratory for sample analysis. This tool can analyze\n\
    about 100 soil samples daily.\nOne of the major issues for estimating crop water\
    \ requirements is continuously moni-\ntoring soil moisture. To monitor soil moisture,\
    \ in situ soil moisture sensors, remote sensors,\nand tools can be efﬁcient strategies\
    \ for many farms to obtain information about the soil’s\nmoisture. There are many\
    \ satellites in operation to measure soil moisture data at a global\nscale. These\
    \ remote sensing products are: (i) the Advanced Microwave Scanning Ra-\ndiometer\
    \ Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) (2002–September 2011); (ii) the Soil Moisture\n\
    Ocean Salinity system (SMOS, 2010–present); (iii) AMSR2 (2012–present); and (iv)\
    \ the Soil\nMoisture Active Passive system (SMAP, 2015–present) [29]. For example,\
    \ Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS) was launched in 2009 and started to\
    \ monitor soil moisture from\nMay 2010 globally. In addition, in situ wireless\
    \ soil moisture sensors can also monitor soil\nmoisture at the farm scale.\nNew\
    \ tools, including the vision-based and wireless sensors, are used to determine\n\
    crop factors, such as soil depth, for efﬁcient seeding processes. Several robotic\
    \ tools are\ndeveloped for smart farming and improve crop production, such as\
    \ FarmBot and Agribots,\njust to name a couple. In agriculture practices, such\
    \ as sowing seeds, weeding, fertilizing,\nand irrigating, such tools would help\
    \ improve crop production if it is implemented at a\nlarge scale. Agribots is\
    \ a type of robot; the agriculture ﬁeld’s location is determined by\npairing digital\
    \ computers with the vehicle vision system. This type of robot works on any\n\
    agricultural land in which the global positioning system (GPS) helps develop location\
    \ maps.\nSensors that are mounted with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) help provide\
    \ information\nregarding the ﬂow rate of seed. Many remote sensors are used for\
    \ this purpose [30]. These\nLEDs are the source of receiving radiations that have\
    \ visible and infrared light waves. Seed\nmovement is monitored through many elements,\
    \ including light band, voltage output,\nand receiving element. Measurement of\
    \ the ﬂow rate of seed is conducted through signals\ncorrelated by transferring\
    \ seeds. Overall, advanced technologies and tools help analyze\nsoils, which further\
    \ help monitor crop growth and production.\n3.2. Irrigation\nOn the Earth, oceans\
    \ hold 97% of all water, but it is saline. The other three percent of\nwater is\
    \ fresh, among which 2% to 3% of the water is in the form of glaciers [31,32].\
    \ Out\nof three percent, half percent of freshwater is present as surface water,\
    \ and the remaining\nfreshwater is groundwater. People have to rely on the half\
    \ percent of freshwater to sustain\ntheir lives. This half percent of freshwater\
    \ includes water storage in lakes, rivers, and other\nreservoirs. Agriculture\
    \ uses almost 75% of freshwater [33,34]. In many countries, such as\nBrazil, the\
    \ demand for crops has increased to 75% [35]. Among several constraints, the lack\n\
    of proper monitoring tools to estimate crop water requirement is the actual cause\
    \ of the\nad hoc application of irrigation water. For example, the US uses about\
    \ 80% of freshwater\nfor irrigation purposes [5]. In the United Nations Convention\
    \ to Combat Desertiﬁcation\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n7 of 31\n(UNCCD) held\
    \ in 2013, it was found that about 168 countries of the world have a shortage\n\
    of water for irrigation. Research has showed that there would be a huge water\
    \ shortage for\nirrigation throughout the world by 2030 [36].\nDue to the increase\
    \ in irrigation water requirements, freshwater will only be available\nto those\
    \ countries that have adopted the best water resources management practice. For\n\
    this purpose, to reduce the water shortage, awareness programs should be promoted\
    \ to\nadopt effective irrigation practices. Many new irrigation techniques, including\
    \ sprinkler\nand drip irrigation methods, are used to reduce the losses and water\
    \ shortage. Traditional\napproaches, including furrow and ﬂood irrigation, cause\
    \ the waste of water. Moreover,\ntraditional irrigation approaches (e.g., ﬂooding)\
    \ reduce many soil nutrients through water\nlosses, which impact crop yield. Robust\
    \ technologies and tools are needed, which include\nsmart irrigation techniques.\
    \ The smart irrigation techniques help estimate crop water\nrequirements based\
    \ on soil types, antecedent soil moisture, and climatic conditions. In this\n\
    situation, many new tools such as the IoT play a signiﬁcant role in measuring\
    \ air and soil\nhumidity, which ultimately leads to the improvement of crops.\n\
    Crop improvement and its quality can be enhanced by the effective management of\n\
    soil and water. The use of the IoT, such as for irrigation management based on\
    \ the crop\nwater stress index (CWSI), is expected to improve crop efﬁciency signiﬁcantly\
    \ [30]. For this\nreason, the calculation of the CWSI requires one to obtain a\
    \ crop canopy at different times\nand temperatures. A CWSI is a wireless sensor-based\
    \ monitoring system that includes\nseveral crop parameter measurement systems\
    \ that help estimate moisture status, which is\nused to estimate irrigation water\
    \ requirements [11].\n3.3. Crop Disease and Its Management\nFamine in Ireland\
    \ occurred due to Phytophthora infestans, causing the late blight of\npotato,\
    \ which caused many crop losses. Due to this famine, about one million people\
    \ in\nIreland died [37]. In the USA, the southern corn leaf blight caused by Cochliobolus\
    \ heterostro-\nphus brought famine and crop losses of nearly one billion USD.\
    \ Later, this crop disease was\nspread to Canada [38]. The Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO) estimated 20% to\n40% annual crop loss per year due to crop\
    \ diseases [39]. Several agricultural management\nstrategies were applied to recover\
    \ these losses, such as the use of pesticides and fungi-\ncides. These approaches\
    \ are practiced in advanced agriculture since the last century. It\nis estimated\
    \ that approximately 500,000 tons of pesticides are used each year in the US\n\
    alone. In contrast, in other countries of the world, about two million tons of\
    \ pesticides are\napplied for disease management [40]. Although these pesticides\
    \ are used for plant disease\nmanagement to increase crop production, there are\
    \ many other harmful aspects to animals\nand humans’ health. It also disturbs\
    \ the world’s ecology and eventually causes severe\nenvironmental pollution to\
    \ the entire ecosystem [5,41].\nMany of the advanced technologies, such as the\
    \ IoT, play a signiﬁcant role in reducing\nthe usage of these chemicals, which\
    \ are hazardous to human health. Many crop disease\nmonitoring programs such as\
    \ crop modeling, the prediction of pests, and weather forecasts\nare monitored\
    \ by these advanced and emerging technologies in agriculture. These tech-\nnologies\
    \ are considered effective approaches for plant/crop disease management [42,43].\n\
    Although treatment, perception, and assessment are important in disease forecasting,\n\
    monitoring, and management, advanced technologies (e.g., the IoT, wireless sensors,\
    \ and\nUAVs) are beneﬁcial for disease identiﬁcation and pest management. For\
    \ example, remote\nsensing technology can be used to capture large areas of agricultural\
    \ cropland economically.\nThe remote sensors can be used to analyze crop processing,\
    \ including disease and pests,\nplant health, and the environment [43,44]. This\
    \ remote sensing tool is low cost and has\nmany advantages, such as a low cost\
    \ for automatic activation and supporting recovery.\nFor example, recently, the\
    \ yields of many crops have been severely threatened by the poor\npollination\
    \ process [45].\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n8 of 31\n3.4. Fertilizer\nPlant\
    \ growth, development, and reproduction mainly depend on the necessary nu-\ntrients\
    \ received from fertilizers or organic amendments. For the development of ﬂower,\n\
    fruit, and root, three signiﬁcant nutrients are needed: for leaf growth, nitrogen\
    \ is necessary;\nfor root development, phosphorus and the expansion of stem and\
    \ water passage in pant\npotassium is required [36]. Plant health can be affected\
    \ by the imbalance application of\nthese fertilizers to the plant. On the other\
    \ hand, the excessive application of these nutrients\nand fertilizers to the plant\
    \ not only affects plant health and causes economic losses but\nalso affects the\
    \ environment, including qualities of soil, water, and air. For example, only\n\
    half of the total nitrogen is utilized for crop development, and another half\
    \ of nitrogen\nis released into the environment. The imbalanced application of\
    \ undesired nutrients to\nthe crops causes a negative impact on the environment\
    \ and climate. It also increases the\nnutrient level in the soil [46]. New technology\
    \ such as the IoT is beneﬁcial for the exact\nestimation of the rate of fertilizers\
    \ in smart agriculture. These approaches also reduce the\nnegative effect on environmental\
    \ conditions.\nNew technology is used to estimate the spatial–temporal application\
    \ of nutrients\nfor the fulﬁllment of fertilization, which is relatively less\
    \ laborious and has maximum\nefﬁciency [47]. Generally, the normalized vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) is used to monitor\nvegetation health, which ultimately helps to\
    \ predict the application of nutrients in the\nsoil. The efﬁcacy of nutrient application\
    \ can be enhanced by such efﬁcient methods, which\nultimately reduces the other\
    \ effect on the environment. Many recent enabling technologies\nsuch as geographic\
    \ information systems (GIS) [48], variable rate technology [49], and global\n\
    positioning systems (GPS) [50,51] are used to estimate nutrients in the ﬁeld [52–54].\
    \ For\nthe betterment of crops, it was observed that fertilizers are the best\
    \ source for improving\ncrop productions, and they can be triggered by only the\
    \ use of new tools and technology\nknown as the IoT [55].\n3.5. Crop Harvesting\
    \ Monitoring and Forecasting\nMoisture level, the ﬂow of grain mass, crop yield,\
    \ and quantity or number of grains per\ncrop are monitored and diagnosed by the\
    \ yield monitoring system. To analyze the crop’s\noverall performance, it is necessary\
    \ to check the level of the moisture and crop yield. Crop\nmonitoring during the\
    \ growing period is one of the essential processes. The measurement\nof crop yield\
    \ is not only critical at the time of harvest, but it is also important to measure\
    \ crop\nyield before the harvesting and during the crop’s developmental processes.\
    \ Various aspects\nare required for monitoring crop yield, including a high level\
    \ of pollination, particularly\nwhen the environment is changing; there is a need\
    \ for the prediction of seeds [56–58].\nCrop forecasting is a technique that predicts\
    \ yields before harvest occurs. Such fore-\ncasts help farmers make near-term\
    \ plans and decisions. Moreover, the accurate harvesting\ntime can be estimated\
    \ by the analysis of crop maturity and its quality. The monitoring\nprocess can\
    \ also judge many of the fruit factors such as fruit color, size, quality, and\
    \ devel-\nopmental stages. Crop disease management strategies and other developmental\
    \ stages\nsuch as crop yield and its quality can be enhanced by crop prediction.\
    \ For this, awareness\nabout the appropriate harvesting schedule is necessary\
    \ for the betterment of crops. Figure 3\nindicates a typical snapshot of the farm\
    \ area network (FAN), which gives real-time portraits\nof the whole agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to the farmer.\nA new technology, such as a developed yield monitor, can\
    \ be correlated with any\nmachine which is used for harvesting. The yield monitor\
    \ tool can also be connected with\na smartphone application named FarmRTX, which\
    \ shows accurate harvesting data. It\nultimately processes data to the manufacturer’s\
    \ web-based program [59]. This smartphone\napplication can be used to generate\
    \ high-deﬁned mapping tools and transfer them with\nother experts and growers\
    \ to export to the other farming tools for monitoring crop yield.\nSustainability\

    \ \nHuman beings exist for a relatively short time in history, so the adaption\
    \ of novel \ntechniques of enhancing food quantity and quality is not advanced.\
    \ For increasing crop \ndevelopment and yield, farmers have applied many measures,\
    \ such as pesticides and fer-\ntilizers. Although there are other management strategies\
    \ such as greenhouses, hydropon-\nics, vertical farming, etc., for increasing\
    \ crop production, these measures are not enough \nto fill this gap. Growers should\
    \ apply new devices such as the IoT for agriculture advance-\nment. \n4.1. Greenhouse\
    \ Agriculture \nGrowing plants in controlled conditions is a relatively new technology\
    \ and a type of \nadvanced agriculture. This technique became popular in the 19th\
    \ century when a number \nof greenhouses were built in Italy, the Netherlands,\
    \ and France for growing plants, un-\nseasonal vegetables, and fruits. This type\
    \ of new agriculture technology was enhanced in \nthe 20th century, and countries\
    \ with climate/weather issues started to apply this technol-\nogy rapidly [60].\
    \ Crops that are grown in a controlled environment require minimum in-\nputs because\
    \ crops grow under controlled conditions. This controlled environment is de-\n\
    veloped in the greenhouse. Due to this controlled environment, seasonal and unseasonal\
    \ \ncrops are grown anywhere and at any time in the world. Several new toolkits\
    \ such as \nwireless communication, mobile devices, and other internet devices\
    \ are used to adopt this \ntechnology. Benke and Tomkins [61], who conducted a\
    \ comprehensive analysis, reported \nthat advanced toolkits could help to adopt\
    \ greenhouse technology. Various other toolkits, \nFigure 3. Internet of Things\

    \ controlled conditions. This controlled environment is developed\nin the greenhouse.\
    \ Due to this controlled environment, seasonal and unseasonal crops are\ngrown\
    \ anywhere and at any time in the world. Several new toolkits such as wireless\
    \ com-\nmunication, mobile devices, and other internet devices are used to adopt\
    \ this technology.\nBenke and Tomkins [61], who conducted a comprehensive analysis,\
    \ reported that advanced\ntoolkits could help to adopt greenhouse technology.\
    \ Various other toolkits, including\nprototype-based internet, are used to monitor\
    \ weather parameters, such as temperature,\npressure, and humidity.\n4.2. Hydroponics\n\
    The most advanced method for seasonal and unseasonal crops is to grow in water\n\
    under controlled conditions without a soil medium. In this approach, nutrients\
    \ and\nfertilizers are applied through the irrigation system. When VF and hydroponics\
    \ are used in\ncombination, every square meter farm can use almost 95% less water\
    \ and nutrients without\nusing any chemicals [62]. In a hydroponics system, the\
    \ accuracy of nutrient measurement\nis critical. Therefore, a highly reliable\
    \ wireless control system for tomato hydroponics was\nproposed [63,64]. In this\
    \ method, monitoring the water content and its accuracy is essential.\nIn a prototype\
    \ based on wireless sensors, it was proposed to provide the cultivation of crops\n\
    in hydroponics by the turnkey solution, which gives the measurements and estimations\n\
    regarding the plant growth in the absence of soil media. Furthermore, there was\
    \ a new tool,\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n10 of 31\na compact sensor that\
    \ uses the oscillator circuit. The primary purpose of this device is to\nmonitor\
    \ the occurrence and concentration of different fertilizers and irrigation levels\
    \ [65].\n4.3. Vertical Farming (VF)\nArable land is decreasing with the increase\
    \ in the human population, urbanization,\npollution, and soil erosion. The VF\
    \ is the progressive technique of advanced agriculture,\nwhich allows one to grow\
    \ the crops and plants in controlled conditions, and signiﬁcantly,\nthis efﬁciently\
    \ decreases the consumption of many resources. VF is the most suitable\nagricultural\
    \ approach in which a small patch of land is required to cultivate crops compared\n\
    to traditional farming. This conventional farming technique needs several resources,\
    \ not\nonly for crops [65,66]. Unfortunately, current farming practices, based\
    \ on industrialized\nagriculture, are destroying soil health much more than natural\
    \ reconstruction. Overall, it\nhas been reported that the soil erosion rate is\
    \ higher (10 to 40 times) than the formation\nrate of the soil. Recent measures\
    \ used for farming cause a loss of healthy soil from the\nagricultural land, which\
    \ is a major hazard to food production in the upcoming days.\nBesides, as we assume,\
    \ about 70% of the freshwater is only utilized for the farming system,\nwhich\
    \ will enhance the pressure on the existing water reservoirs or storage. VF is\
    \ the\nsolution for many limitations and challenges for land management and a\
    \ shortage of\nfreshwater.\nFor this purpose, according to Mirai, a Japanese-based\
    \ indoor farming tool provides\ndata of about 25,000 square meters of Japanese\
    \ agricultural farms. Notably, it utilizes\nthe minimum level of irrigation water\
    \ compared to the production of crops in outdoor\nconditions and 40% of the energy\
    \ [67]. The aviation farm is the leader of VF, where the yield\nof agricultural\
    \ products in New York increased by 390 times, while water consumption was\nreduced\
    \ by 95% [68]. Carbon dioxide is one of the crucial factors in farming as compared\n\
    to other aspects of agriculture. For the estimation of carbon dioxide, a new toolkit,\
    \ which is\na non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) carbon dioxide wireless sensor that\
    \ participates in the\ncomplete control of VF [69,70] connected to mobile devices\
    \ and wireless communication\ntechnologies. These devices can automatically check\
    \ the crops at each development phase.\n4.4. Phenotyping\nThe smart methods discussed\
    \ earlier seem more promising for advancing agriculture,\nas they have been utilized\
    \ to grow various crops in a conducive environment. Besides,\nsome advanced technologies\
    \ are evaluated to control their limitations through advanced\nsensing and communication\
    \ technologies, thereby further enhancing crop capabilities. The\nmost efﬁcient\
    \ method is the phenotyping approach, the advanced genetic engineering tech-\n\
    nique, and biotechnology, which correlates the genetic sequences of crops for\
    \ agronomical\nand physiological aspects, as described in Figure 4. In the last\
    \ few decades, several modiﬁ-\ncations have been made in the ﬁeld of genetic engineering\
    \ and biotechnology. However,\nmany factors such as grain weight and disease resistance\
    \ have not been dealt with yet due\nto a lack of efﬁcient techniques.\nRecent\
    \ advancements have described that phenotypes play an efﬁcient role in de-\ntermining\
    \ many quantitative factors such as plant growth, disease resistance, crop yield,\n\
    and crop quality in advanced genetic engineering and biotechnology [71]. One of\
    \ these\ntools is image-based phenotypes and sensors, which monitor how these\
    \ resolutions cannot\naccommodate numerous screen stimulants and help them understand\
    \ the mode of action,\nthereby participating in their success [72]. Moreover,\
    \ other tools such as the IoT and\nCropQuant-based phenotypes techniques are used\
    \ to analyze many crop-related factors\nsuch as crop traits by genetic engineering\
    \ and biotechnology for advanced agriculture [73].\nMoreover, an automated production\
    \ site-controlled program was established to continue\nthe generation of data\
    \ by this program. Machine learning modeling and feature analysis\nalgorithms\
    \ are given to exploit the association among phenotypes, growth environments,\n\
    and genotypes.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n11 of 31\n \nfor agronomical and\

    \ the association among phenotypes, growth environ-\nments, and genotypes. \n\
    5. Major Equipment and Technologies \nIn traditional agriculture, most farming\
    \ measures are applied by heavy machinery, \nincluding harvesters, massive robots,\
    \ and tractors. Several communications and remote \nsensing techniques are used\
    \ to operate these machines. In advanced farming, for many \ncrop-related practices\
    \ such as irrigation, sowing, fertilizer application, and harvesting of \ncrops,\
    \ these machines and equipment are supported by GIS and GPS technologies, which\
    \ \nare very accurate, efficient, and precise. Moreover, other agricultural measures\
    \ (the site-\nspecific management of crops) cannot replace these advanced techniques.\
    \ The develop-\nment of contemporary agriculture needs the efficiency of gathered\
    \ information and gen-\nerally has two parts [9]. First, remote sensing programs\
    \ with multifunctional devices, in-\ncluding UAVs, aircraft, and satellites, are\
    \ needed. Second, many other devices, such as \nground and remote sensors, are\
    \ required for particular functions at different locations. A \nGPS device can\
    \ be used to identify the data collection spot’s location, which can be used \n\
    for location-specific processing.  \nOver the past few decades, agriculture has\
    \ shifted from small and medium-sized ag-\nriculture to highly industrialized\
    \ and commercial agriculture. This shift plays an im-\nportant role in advancing\
    \ the agricultural industry like other developed industries be-\nFigure 4. The\

    \ the agricultural industry like other developed industries because,\nin agriculture,\
    \ data, control, and measurement are signiﬁcant factors in accomplishing\nequality\
    \ among production and cost to enhance outputs. For this purpose, the IoT is a\
    \ fun-\ndamental approach for advancement and beneﬁts in agriculture, which are\
    \ well planned,\nmanaged, and automated. According to this information, between\
    \ 2017 and 2022, the\nworld’s advanced agricultural industry is expected to grow\
    \ by 19.3% in one year and reach\nUSD 23.14 billion in 2022 [33].\n5.1. Smartphone\n\
    Although strong cellular communications coverage is lacking, cellular communica-\n\
    tions are the main communication methods in remote regions. Whenever a contractor\n\
    is needed to update most agricultural communities, smartphones are a powerful\
    \ com-\nmunication technology and the primary method of communication. Recent\
    \ advances in\nthe smartphone industry have led to a sharp drop in prices, which\
    \ has made the sector\nmore attractive, especially for small farmers in rural\
    \ regions. According to the global\nsystem assessment for mobile communications,\
    \ this proportion is almost eight percent [74].\nMoreover, features and ﬂexibility,\
    \ including GPS, microphone cameras, accelerometers,\nproximity, and gyroscopes,\
    \ have attracted IT technicians who are creating more attractive\nsmartphone functions\
    \ to satisfy many demands of farmers [75–78].\nDue to advancements in the research,\
    \ experts have developed various new tools and\napproaches strategically to implement\
    \ smartphone technology in agriculture. Several\ndeveloping countries, such as\
    \ Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, Mali, and Zimbabwe, are\nadopting advanced tools\
    \ and techniques in agriculture [79–82]. Moreover, smartphone\ntechnology is used\
    \ in many countries, such as China, Turkey, India, and several African\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 4883\n12 of 31\ncountries, which are listed above. These countries\
    \ are implementing this advanced tech-\nnology to increase agriculture production\
    \ and boost their economies [83–86]. The use\nof smartphones in the agricultural\
    \ sector signiﬁcantly depends upon numerous aspects.\nFor this purpose, studies\
    \ were conducted to determine smartphones’ usage for several\nagriculture measures\
    \ [87].\nTable 1 presents the classiﬁcation of smartphone-related sensors that\
    \ have attracted\nexperts to use them for different agricultural purposes. Table\

    \ and reporting of information are considered to be the\ncentral part of advanced\
    \ agriculture. The strong connection and participation of many\nfactors are needed\
    \ to retrieve efﬁcient and signiﬁcant purposes. Telecom operators play\nan essential\
    \ role in disseminating communication reliability in agriculture development.\n\
    Moreover, expanding the advancement of the IoT and widespread knowledge to improve\n\
    the advanced agricultural industry needs a highly efﬁcient management system.\
    \ Many\nfactors, including coverage, energy consumption, reliability, and cost,\
    \ are signiﬁcant and\nnecessary before selecting a communication method.\n5.2.1.\
    \ Cellular Communication\nDepending on the purpose and bandwidth requirements,\
    \ a cellular communication\nmode increase from 2G to 5G might be appropriate.\
    \ Besides, the reliability and even\naccessibility of cellular networks is a key\
    \ factor in rural areas. To solve this major problem,\ninformation transmission\
    \ through satellite is another important option. Still, in this case,\nthe price\
    \ of this communication mode can be very high, which makes it inappropriate for\n\
    small and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication model also relies on\
    \ the\nrequirements of the application. For example, some farms require sensors\
    \ to operate at a\nlow data rate, but they need to work for a long time and require\
    \ a longer battery life. In\nthis case, the new series of the low-power wide area\
    \ network (LPWAN) is considered to be\nan excellent answer for cellular networks.\
    \ The LPWAN has a longer battery life and has\na more massive connection range,\
    \ and an affordable price (2 to 15 USD) [103]. Currently,\ncrop and pasture management\
    \ are the two main applications where LPWAN networks\nare very suitable, and due\
    \ to their success, they can be used for many other agricultural\napplications\
    \ [104]. Generally, wireless sensors used in agricultural applications are divided\n\
    into three main categories according to the communication information rate and\
    \ power\nconsumption (Table 3).\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n14 of 31\nTable\

    \ wireless communication mode that links small-sized devices\nover short distances.\
    \ There are many IoT agriculture devices that are Bluetooth enabled,\nsuch as\
    \ Farm note Air gateway and Color sensor work with Bluetooth-enabled sensors.\n\
    Bluetooth has an ubiquitous nature, due to which it is studied as suitable equipment\
    \ for\nmulti-tier farming functions [105].\n5.2.3. Zigbee\nZigbee is mainly created\
    \ for a comprehensive range of applications, particularly\nto replace non-standard\
    \ equipment. According to application needs, devices based on\nthis etiquette\
    \ can be one of the three categories: router, coordinator, and end-devices.\n\
    Besides, Zigbee networks support three different topologies, namely Cluster Tree,\
    \ Start, and\nMesh [106]. Based on these traits and contemplating the needs of\
    \ agricultural applications,\nZigBee can perform a signiﬁcant role, particularly\
    \ for the environments of greenhouses\nthat often require short-range transmissions.\
    \ During different parameter observations,\nactual-time information from the sensor\
    \ nodes is transmitted to the terminal server via\nZigbee [107,108]. For applications\
    \ such as fertilizers and irrigation, the ZigBee module can\nbe used for transmission,\
    \ such as in drip irrigation, to check the soil moisture content.\n5.3. Sensor\
    \ Devices\nAmong all the devices used in advanced agriculture today, sensor devices\
    \ are highly\ncritical and perform a crucial role in collecting crop status and\
    \ other information. Sensor\ndevices can be utilized separately or in the group\
    \ as needed. Moreover, sensor devices\nare used for advanced farming because of\
    \ their robust technology. Next, the discussion is\nbased on the working process\
    \ and purpose of the main sensor types and their beneﬁts. The\nmajor sensor devices\
    \ used in advanced agriculture are listed in Table 4.\nTable 4. Types of sensor\

    several factors, such as forecasting, monitoring, yield assessment, crop evaluation,\
    \ land\ndegradation, and pest management (e.g., using LiDAR, satellite, UAVs).\

    Optical Sensor\nThese sensors use the phenomenon of light reﬂection to help measure\
    \ soil organic matter, soil\nmoisture, and color, the presence of minerals and\

    \ are used to record conductivity and transient electromagnetic\nresponses, identify\
    \ electrical responses and adjust variable-rate applications in practical\nsituations.\
    \ Sensors based on this technology use electrical circuits to measure the ability\
    \ of\nsoil particles to conduct or accumulate charge, which is mainly accomplished\
    \ by two\nmethods; contact or non-contact.\n[131]\nElectrochemical\nSensor\nThis\
    \ is used to assess soil characteristics to analyze the soil’s nutrient level,\

    \ in various ecosystems.\n[134,138]\nSWLB Sensor\nSoft water level-based (SWLB)\
    \ sensors are utilized in advanced agricultural watersheds to\nmonitor hydrological\
    \ behavior, including flow and water level, inflexible time-step acquisitions.\n\
    [9,136]\nNote: This list is an effort to compile most of sensors used in the advanced\
    \ agriculture. It is not meant to be a comprehensive list as many\nmore sensor\
    \ devices are used in agriculture.\n5.4. Advanced Machines Used to Advance Agriculture\n\
    As technology advances, most manufacturers provide tractors with automatic drives.\n\
    This equipment is not advanced because self-driving tractors were already on the\
    \ market\neven before semi-autonomous vehicles. One of the major beneﬁts of self-driving\
    \ tractors is\nthe capacity to prevent re-entering in a similar area or a similar\
    \ row via decreasing overlaps\nwith less than an inch. Moreover, they can create\
    \ extremely accurate turns without a\ndriver. The device provides higher accuracy\
    \ and reduces errors, especially when spraying\npesticides or target weeds; these\
    \ are almost impossible when people control the machine.\nAlthough there are no\
    \ fully automated tractors/machines in the market today, many\nscientists, researchers,\
    \ and manufacturers are working to develop the new equipment.\nBased on the future\
    \ needs of high-tech new tractors, it is expected that about 700,000 new\ntractors\
    \ outﬁtted with features such as tractor guidance or automatic steering will be\
    \ sold\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n16 of 31\nby 2028 [5,139]. Further, it\
    \ is expected that about 40,000 unmanned driving, completely\nautonomous cars\
    \ (level 5), and tractors will be sold by 2038 [109].\nHowever, most farmers cannot\
    \ afford such advanced farming machines, and most\ntractor service providers and\
    \ manufacturers operate far below their potentials. Considering\nthese challenges,\
    \ for example, Hello Tractor has developed a solution to these problems.\nThe\
    \ company has developed a low-cost monitoring device that can be installed on\
    \ any\ntractor, providing powerful software and analysis tools [113,140]. The\
    \ beneﬁts of this\ndevice are twofold: it ensures that most growers can afford\
    \ the tractor’s total cost while\nmonitoring the condition of the tractor and\
    \ reports if any problems occur. The software\nconnects tractor owners to farmers\
    \ who need tractor services, just like Uber’s tractors.\nAnother major example\
    \ is Case IH’s Magnum series tractors, which use on-board cameras\nand light detection\
    \ and ranging (LiDAR) sensors to detect the object that helps avoid\ncollision\
    \ and control accidents caused by agricultural vehicles [141].\n5.5. Cloud Computing\n\
    Growers can use cloud facilities to access data from predictive analytics agencies\
    \ so\nthat they can ﬁnd the right products based on their exact needs. Cloud computing\
    \ offers\ngrowers a knowledge-based repository that contains valuable information\
    \ and experience\nrelated to farming methods and equipment options available on\
    \ the market. The scheme\ncan be further extended to include access to consumer\
    \ databases, supply chains, and billing\nsystems to make it more active.\nObviously,\
    \ cloud-based services offer ample opportunities but also bring new chal-\nlenges.\
    \ First, various sensors are being developed and utilized in smart farming, each\n\
    with its unique data format and semantics. Second, most decision support systems\
    \ are\napplication-speciﬁc. On the other hand, farmers may need access to various\
    \ systems for\nspeciﬁc applications, such as soil monitoring. Considering these\
    \ two situations, cloud-\nbased decision support systems not only need to handle\
    \ the diverse data and their formats,\nbut they should also be able to conﬁgure\
    \ these formats for various applications.\n5.6. Harvesting\nIn the agriculture\
    \ sector, harvesting is a crucial phase in the crop production process\nbecause\
    \ this ﬁnal stage determines crop yield and, eventually, the crop’s performance.\n\
    Regarding manpower, it is expected that the US faces USD 3.1 billion worth of\
    \ crop losses\neach year due to manpower shortages [142]. Additionally, according\
    \ to the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), 14% of total agricultural\
    \ costs are spent on wages\nand labor, and as high as 39% on some labor-intensive\
    \ farms [143]. Considering the\nexpense and manpower shortage issues at this stage,\
    \ farm experts hope that the use of\nagricultural robotics technology will not\
    \ only reduce manpower shortage but also provide\nﬂexible harvesting capabilities\
    \ when required. Automatic fruit harvesting requires in-depth\nresearch on sophisticated\
    \ sensors that can collect precise and unambiguous information\nabout speciﬁc\
    \ crops and fruits.\nFor example, strawberries are highly consumed fruits and\
    \ can be purchased all year\nround. However, manpower, particularly during the\
    \ packaging and harvesting stages, is a\nmajor factor for the high-level price\
    \ of this fruit [144]. Because this fruit is mostly cultivated\nin the greenhouses\
    \ system, the harvesting robot can reduce the production cost. A robot\ndeveloped\
    \ by Agrobot is capable of collecting strawberries along the ﬁeld’s strawberry\n\
    plant rows and enhancing packaging through the operator [145]. For example, Agrobot’s\n\
    SW 6010 is a semi-automatic robot for semi-automatic strawberry picking. Tektu\
    \ T-100 is a\nrechargeable electric strawberry harvester that operates multiple\
    \ channels with a net-zero\nemission [144].\n6. Uses of UAVs in Agriculture Advancement\n\
    Currently, the IoT plays an important role in several ﬁelds, such as the agriculture\n\
    industry (e.g., ﬁsh and poultry). There is a limited communication network in\
    \ the agricul-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n17 of 31\ntural sector, including\
    \ Wi-Fi and base stations, which decreases the coverage of internet\ntechnology.\
    \ Advanced communication technologies are the worst in developing countries,\n\
    which are the major hurdles and challenges for the implementation of the IoT in\
    \ agriculture.\nWithout a reliable communication infrastructure, the information\
    \ collected using sensor\ndevices is not transferred quickly for analysis in developing\
    \ countries [146]. Under these\ncircumstances, UAVs can provide an alternate option\
    \ to gather information for data analysis\nand processing. Moreover, UAVs equipped\
    \ with advanced thermal, multispectral, hyper-\nspectral cameras, and wireless\
    \ sensors can collect data from several hectares of agricultural\nlands in a short\
    \ duration. Currently, the agriculture sector can obtain tremendous beneﬁts\n\
    by deploying UAVs to address several major and long-term issues. We highlight\
    \ some\nimportant areas where UAVs have played a crucial role in assisting growers\
    \ throughout\nthe crop cycle globally [147].\n6.1. Soil and Water Analysis\nNew\
    \ technology such as UAVs can provide accurate data to examine soil and soil\n\
    water before planting crops, which can help determine which crops are best suited\
    \ for a\nparticular land. In addition, it can provide information about the type\
    \ of seed and how it\ncan be grown under particular soils and environments [148].\n\
    6.2. Planting\nToday, millions of acres are not cultivated worldwide due to the\
    \ lack of appropriate\nmanpower or human inaccessibility. The safety issue of\
    \ the rough terrain is the major\nproblem for not utilizing these areas for agricultural\
    \ or forestry purposes. To this end,\ndrone-based sowing methods are being established\
    \ that can reduce sowing expenses by up\nto 85% [149]. Not only is it cost-effective,\
    \ but it even expedites the planting because many\nnewly formed drones can plant\
    \ about 100,000 trees within one day [150]. These systems\nshoot pods comprise\
    \ seed, which are essential nutrients required for plant growth. This\ntechnique\
    \ is very effective for rough terrain; signiﬁcantly, the success rate is more\
    \ than\n75% [151]. Because of the ﬂexibility and success, the recommended drones\
    \ can be excellent\nplantation systems worldwide [152,153].\n6.3. Irrigation\n\
    The beneﬁt of using UAVs are twofold in irrigation applications. First, equipping\n\
    drones with various cameras and sensors can support the identiﬁcation of areas\
    \ under\nwater stress to quantify irrigation water requirements. Second, they\
    \ can also be utilized to\nspray herbicides and pesticides accurately and water\
    \ on crops, particularly in emergencies,\nwhich can save time [154–156]. Besides,\
    \ UAVs can also be utilized to assess crop water\nstress [157]. Because of advanced\
    \ UAVs, these can be applied as water-saving tools. UAVs\nuse not only facilitate\
    \ improving watering efﬁciency but also identify leaks in irrigation\nor possible\
    \ water sinks, such as “JT20L-606” [158] and “AGRASMG-1” [159], which are\nspecially\
    \ developed UAVs that are currently being utilized to serve this purpose.\n6.4.\
    \ Health Assessment of the Crops\nScanning agriculture crops using infrared and\
    \ visible (IR) light sensor technology\nmounted on the UAVs can recognize which\
    \ farming plants may be infested via fungicide\nor bacteria. Detecting any such\
    \ issues in advance helps prevent the disease from spreading\nto other crops or\
    \ plant parts [160].\n6.5. Spraying Pesticides/Herbicides\nUAVs can be utilized\
    \ to spray insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides on crops. Spray-\ning applications\
    \ will beneﬁt current practices of spraying pesticides or herbicides across\n\
    the entire farm that is usually not needed in most cases. If UAVs are used to\
    \ spray the\npesticides or herbicides, they can be directly sprayed on weeds or\
    \ only concentrate on the\ndisturbed area. It can be poured directly on weeds.\
    \ Besides, since UAV spraying is highly\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n18 of\
    \ 31\ntargeted to the objects/plants or weeds, it can be conﬁgured and sprayed\
    \ as required,\nreducing overall expenses. For UAVs, handling sudden environmental\
    \ changes, such as\nwind direction, is problematic, mainly when spraying applications\
    \ [160].\n6.6. Plant Species Detection/Identiﬁcation\nRecently, UAVs have begun\
    \ to identify plant species, particularly those that are\nvery few on the planet.\
    \ UAVs are the best tools for this task, as they can ﬂy in very\nremote places\
    \ with limited physical access. According to the National Tropical Botanical\n\
    Garden (NTBG), Hawaiian calyx Hibiscadelphus woodii was found on a vertical cliff\
    \ face\nusing a drone, which was believed to have become extinct in 2009 [161,162].\
    \ Precision\nfarming desperately requires spatial information on crop density\
    \ when making decisions\nduring several applications. Quantities and plant numbers\
    \ not only reﬂect crop yields,\nbut they can accurately assess outcomes and determine\
    \ the fate of a crop. Gnädinger and\nSchmidhalter [163] counted corn plants digitally\
    \ using drones. Additionally, Jin et al. [164]\nproposed a technique to use UAVs\
    \ to evaluate wheat plants’ density at the seedling phase\nand captured images\
    \ using a Sony ILCEα5100LRGB camera. Crop monitoring is a daunting\ntask and is\
    \ inefﬁcient due to the large coverage area. Compared with satellite images used\n\
    in the past, UAVs provide all farm results by providing real-time monitoring data,\
    \ so\nthey are further accurate and cost-effective. Microdrones’ + m accessory\
    \ kit offers aerial\nimaging capabilities to monitor moisture content, crop nutrients\
    \ status, and other essential\nfactors [165,166].\n7. Food Safety and Transportation\n\
    The World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Comprehensive Report on Future Food De-\n\
    mand, released in 2018, highlights the food industry’s need to feed ten billion\
    \ people before\n2050. The statement aims for a ﬁve-course menu of solutions to\

    \ \nThe World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Comprehensive Report on Future Food\
    \ De-\nmand, released in 2018, highlights the food industry’s need to feed ten\
    \ billion people be-\nfore 2050. The statement aims for a five-course menu of\

    \ losses of food occurring along the food supply chain (from food \nproduction\
    \ to consumption) at different geographical regions worldwide are depicted in\
    \ \nFigure 5. The highest percentage of calories lost and wastage (61%) in food\

    \ \nIn addition to the WRI, the information released by the FAO of the UN is also\
    \ shock-\ning. It is projected that one-third of all food produced for humans\
    \ globally wasted each \nFigure 5. Losses of food occur along the food supply\
    \ chain [5,167].\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n19 of 31\nIn addition to the\
    \ WRI, the information released by the FAO of the UN is also shocking.\nIt is\
    \ projected that one-third of all food produced for humans globally wasted each\
    \ year is\nworth USD 1 trillion [168,169]. Food waste in the US alone accounts\
    \ for 1.3% of its gross\ndomestic product [170]. Based on these numbers, it can\
    \ be assumed that food wastage is\ncritical in food industries, and such loss\
    \ does not exist in non-food industries [171]. Even\nthough food wastage worth\
    \ USD 1 trillion has its economic value, more signiﬁcantly, the\nimpact of these\
    \ losses on the environment is critical. For example, the water wasted on\nproducing\
    \ food that has never been consumed is the same as the water that can meet\nthe\
    \ water demand of all of Africa [167,172,173]. Today, all over the world, only\
    \ 10% of\nperishable foods are properly well-preserved [174]. There is a massive\
    \ opportunity to\nreduce food losses and better distribute food simply via realizing\
    \ temperature-regulated\ntransportation systems. Based on these facts, it can\
    \ be concluded that enhancing food\nproduction is not enough to attain food safety.\
    \ However, many useful actions are needed to\nobtain a better-skilled way of distributing\
    \ existing food effectively. As shown in Figure 5,\nthe IoT can monitor and maintain\
    \ food quality at all stages of the entire supply chain from\nyield to consumption.\n\
    7.1. Compliance\nThe IoT can support the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control\
    \ Point (HACCP) com-\npliance, provide food security, and is an excellent monitoring\
    \ program that continuously\naccumulates the temperature data in kitchen equipment\
    \ and coolers. Its integration with\nthe touch module is utilized to monitor the\
    \ temperature in the cooler and the preparation\nchamber continuously [175].\n\
    7.2. Laird Sentrius\nThe battery-powered remote integrated sensor system takes\
    \ full advantage of Blue-\ntooth Low Energy (BLE) and Low Power Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRaWAN) connectivity. It\nis based on Nordic nRF51 silicon, Semtech SX1272,\
    \ and offers an 868/915 MHz LoRaWAN\noption and provides high nRF51 performance\
    \ at precise humidity temperature. The two\nmost important families consist of\
    \ RG1xx and RS1xx (multi-wireless gateways) to operate\ncollectively to deliver\
    \ cloud-based services. It is highly signiﬁcant and needs cheap end-\npoint radios\
    \ and other complex base stations to handle the network system compared with\n\
    low-power wide-area network technology. If Sigfox network transmission is directed\
    \ from\nthe endpoint to the base station, communication will be better. Although\
    \ it helps to have\nbidirectional capabilities, the power from the station to\
    \ the endpoint is limited because it\ndelivers lower downlink width than the uplink\
    \ width.\n7.3. Tempreporter\nThe HACCP is utilized to monitor temperature 24/7.\
    \ Besides, it automatically records\nmeasurements. It also automatically ﬁlls\
    \ the values in the report. The Health Product Reg-\nulatory Authority (HPRA)\

    \ strategies that help attain sustainable agricultural develop-\nment by 2030.\
    \ However, the latest statistical data issued by the WHO do not look favorable\n\
    for sustainability. This plan shows that more than 800 million people globally\
    \ face food\nshortages, which is one out of every nine people in the world [185].\
    \ To address these issues,\nthe overall grain production needs to be increased.\
    \ Additionally, cash crops need to be\nincreased to meet industrial requirements\
    \ such as rubber and cotton. Most signiﬁcantly,\nthe demand for bioenergy, such\
    \ as ethanol, will also increase by 2030.\nThis review outlines the main issues\
    \ that agriculture would face by 2050. This review\nessentially addresses two\
    \ main questions. How do the advanced technologies help to: (1)\nfeed about 10\
    \ billion people? and (2) increase agricultural production without occupying\n\
    more agricultural land? Moreover, these issues bring several challenges, such\
    \ as the\nreduction in agricultural manpower, the decreasing arable land area,\
    \ the shortage of water\nresources, the impact of climate change, etc. As the\
    \ world shifts towards urbanization,\nnot only is the population of rural areas\
    \ declining, but it is also rapidly aging. As a\nresult, young farmers are required\
    \ to step up to take liability. Population imbalances\nand generational transfers\
    \ will have a serious impact not only on the rural agricultural\nmanpower but\
    \ also on-farm management. Besides, while arable land is diminishing, many\nlands\
    \ are only appropriate for select crops due to certain geographical and environmental\n\
    constraints. Besides, climate change has begun to affect almost all crops. These\
    \ variations\nare anticipated to intensify many existing long-term ecological\
    \ difﬁculties, such as turf,\nﬂoods, soil degradation, groundwater depletion,\
    \ and more.\nCompared with developed nations, more than 50% of the populations\
    \ of developing\nnations are directly or indirectly involved in agriculture. Still,\
    \ they are far behind developed\ncountries in terms of quantity and quality. The\
    \ population of developed countries, which\nis less than 2%, is performing much\
    \ better. This difference is evident because Australia, the\nUS, and most European\
    \ countries have adopted improved tools and methods. Over the\npast ﬁfty years,\
    \ they have adopted improved instruments and techniques to increase crop\nproduction.\
    \ These differences demonstrate that advanced technology and sophisticated\napproaches\
    \ make the farm more productive and ecologically sound.\nIt is expected that the\
    \ future of agriculture will develop into a progressive sector\nwhen integrated\
    \ systems appreciate artiﬁcial intelligence and big data capabilities. These\n\
    integrated systems will combine several agricultural types of equipment, tools,\
    \ and tech-\nniques applicable for various agricultural management from sowing\
    \ to yield forecasting.\nAdvanced machines, such as robots of agriculture, cloud\
    \ computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nand big data, can usher in a different era\
    \ of super-convergence in the farming sector. Here\nare crucial tools and techniques\
    \ that need to be applied for sustainable agriculture in the\nfuture.\n8.1. Smartphone\
    \ and the IoT\nInformation communication technologies such as smartphones and\
    \ the IoT can change\nagriculture in developing countries by facilitating access\
    \ to markets and providing problem-\nsolving information. These technologies can\
    \ also bridge the rural–urban gap, including the\nnext generation of growers.\
    \ Most agricultural-related smartphone services in developing\ncountries have\
    \ provided simple functions due to the limitations of available delivery\ntechnologies\
    \ [79–81]. Fast-moving smartphones and the IoT may soon change by giving\nmany\
    \ opportunities for developing complex services. Today, users can use a wide variety\n\
    of devices to spread more complex information. Simultaneously, smartphones and\
    \ the\nIoT have become increasingly popular and interconnected through expanded\
    \ smartphone\nnetworks, allowing for the collection and processing of large amounts\
    \ of data to help\nagricultural farming and the establishment of social networks\
    \ for information exchange\nand learning.\nThis article discusses relevant knowledge\
    \ and implications, but further study is\nrequired to assess how the latest tools\
    \ and technologies can be practically used to support\nSustainability 2021, 13,\
    \ 4883\n22 of 31\nagriculture in developing nations. For example, what challenges\
    \ exist and what is needed\nto eliminate them? The smartphone and IoT technology\
    \ developers also need to ensure\nthat their services continue to meet a wide\
    \ range of user needs, rather than concentrating\ntoo much on new machinery that\
    \ may not be available to limited resource underserved\ngrowers.\n8.2. The IoT\
    \ and Wireless Sensors (IoTWS)\nInstalling IoTWS appropriately across farmland\
    \ can provide growers with the latest\nknowledge and information and enable them\
    \ to change accordingly, which helps enhance\ncrop yields. For sustainable agriculture,\
    \ the IoT can be core and forefront for farming\noperations. This comprises the\
    \ efﬁcient use of electricity, water, transportation of crops,\nalerts for the\
    \ maintenance and operation of agriculture machinery, and updated market\nprices.\
    \ It can simplify and streamline these tasks by identifying crop requirements\
    \ at each\nstep. It has proven to be advanced and will provide farmers with unprecedented\
    \ control\nover land and assets, thereby further changing our perceptions of various\
    \ agricultural\nactivities to maximize their efﬁciency and effectiveness. Besides,\
    \ the upcoming Internet\ntechnology can be formed by signiﬁcant improvements in\
    \ wireless sensor networks and 5th\ngeneration (5G) of smartphone communication\
    \ technology, providing growers important\nupdates in real-time and anywhere.\
    \ Based on recent successes, by 2021, it is assessed\nthat there will be more\
    \ than 75 million internet technology-based devices working in the\nagriculture\
    \ sector. Furthermore, the average farm is expected to produce 4.1 million data\n\
    points regularly by 2050 [186].\n8.3. Communication\nThe actual achievement of\
    \ the IoT in farming depends mostly on increased connectivity.\nFrom a telecommunications\
    \ perspective, connectivity and more value-added essential\nservices have a vast\
    \ perspective and can signiﬁcantly affect the whole chain [187]. Almost\nall telecommunication\
    \ operators worldwide provide connectivity facilities, but such public\nservices\
    \ represent only a small portion of the total advanced agriculture market. Given\
    \ its\nworth, especially in remote regions, smartphone operators must offer a\
    \ range of the latest\nservices to fulﬁll growers’ needs. Accepting the truth\
    \ that most people in the community\nare not highly educated, and, therefore,\
    \ they do not fully understand new technologies,\noperators must give end-to-end\
    \ resolutions, not only connectivity. Therefore, it will enhance\nthe market share\
    \ of smartphones and telecommunication operators. Peters [119,188]\nconsidered\
    \ 23 experiments mainly in developing countries and concluded that cellular\n\
    services and smartphone technology had brought a bright future to small farmers\
    \ capable\nof increasing yields. It is very important to give crucial connectivity\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector.\n8.4. Drones and Other Robots\nFarmers and growers\
    \ use UAVs to evaluate crop growth and monitor biodiversity\nand ecological landscape\
    \ features [189]. Additionally, considering the rugged farmland,\nparticularly\
    \ when the farmers have to grow crops on the rugged landscape, UAVs can\neffectively\
    \ be used for water spraying and other pesticides. Compared with traditional\n\
    machinery, with the same propose, robots and drones have conﬁrmed they are worth\n\
    spraying with haste and accuracy. With the latest improvements in swarm technology\
    \ and\ntask-based control, multiple sets of robots and drones armed with diverse\
    \ devices such as\n3D cameras can work together to give growers inclusive land\
    \ management capabilities.\nIn addition to drones, robotics in the agricultural\
    \ sector have increased productivity and\nbrought higher crop production. Robots,\
    \ for weeding and spraying, are decreasing the use\nof pesticides.\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 4883\n23 of 31\n8.5. Machine Learning and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) are utilized to mine data\
    \ for\ntrend analysis. For example, in agriculture, ML/AI is applied to explore\
    \ which genes\nare very appropriate to produce high-yield crops. This gives farmers\
    \ worldwide better\nvarieties of seeds that are suitable for the location and\
    \ climate. On the other hand, ML/AI\nalgorithms have demonstrated which goods\
    \ are in great demand and which goods are not\naccessible in the market. Thus,\
    \ for growers, this gives valuable information for upcoming\nfarming. The latest\
    \ advances in ML/AI will make it possible for growers to correctly\nclassify their\
    \ crop products and eliminate fewer advantageous products before they start\n\
    planting.\n8.6. Energy Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrid, and Smart Grid\n\
    Despite technological advances in agriculture, advanced farming still faces many\n\
    issues that hinder the extended use of the IoT. One of the notable issues regarding\
    \ en-\nergy/power consumption is that advanced agriculture needs extensive energy.\
    \ The major\nproblems for a large amount of energy consumption include the long-term\
    \ deployment\nof sensors, repeated transmission of sensing information by general\
    \ packet radio service,\nand GPS use. Traditionally, growers in rural areas have\
    \ randomly bought and used renew-\nable energy at high prices, which has largely\
    \ restricted their use for advanced agriculture.\nHowever, to resolve the energy\
    \ problem, in the long run, an in-depth analysis of the power\nsource (such as\
    \ remote information communication) can address the problem to some\nextent. In\
    \ addition, smart grids and microgrids enable the perfect integration of distributed\n\
    energy sources (DER), so they have attracted farmers’ adoption. The advent of\
    \ smart\nmeters has made farmers more conﬁdent in investing in DER, particularly\
    \ because farmers\ncan select full excess electricity to the grid. If a continuous\
    \ energy source is not available for\nusers in remote areas, alternative rechargeable\
    \ devices or thermal/electrical/mechanical\nenergy storage systems should be available\
    \ for them to use. Current advances in energy\nstorage apparatus, heating system,\
    \ and electricity will further make DER smarter to grow-\ners. They will be able\
    \ to store energy and use the heat created via heating and cooling when\nrequired\
    \ [190,191]. Moreover, requirements of healthy investment and public awareness\n\
    are two other obstacles to the success of these resolutions.\n8.7. Vertical Farming\
    \ and Hydroponics\nIn addition to adopting advanced technologies, new agricultural\
    \ practices are also crit-\nical to overcoming geographical and resource constraints.\
    \ While arable land is decreasing,\nit is assumed that 3 million people worldwide\
    \ have shifted to urban areas, putting more\nstress on existing limited city resources\
    \ [192]. Contemplating this quick migration, it is\nprojected that before 2030,\
    \ 60% of the world population will rely on urban areas, and these\nﬁgures are\
    \ expected to increase to 68% before 2050 [3,193]. Considering these two issues,\n\
    food production may be disastrous as soon as current agricultural practices are\
    \ concerned.\nVF solves these problems because it can meet the challenges of shortage\
    \ of water and land\nmanagement, and at the same time, it seems very appropriate\
    \ for adoption near urban\nareas or cities. At least in some parts of the world,\
    \ VF is depicted as the solution to food\nshortages and shrinking arable land.\
    \ Besides, hydroponics can play a very important role,\nas it greatly reduces\
    \ the need for space and water. The rapid growth of technologies has\npromoted\
    \ water and nutrient efﬁcient farming, such as VF, making it more attractive to\n\
    farmers. Alongside hydroponics and VF, the latest and improved solutions are needed\
    \ to\nboost the arable land without disturbing forests and natural animal habitats.\
    \ To accomplish\nthis, it is necessary to focus on the desert, because it covers\
    \ a third of the Earth’s land\nsurface. With Norwegian and Chinese companies/experts\
    \ working in the deserts of Dubai,\nQatar, Jordan, and China, solutions have begun\
    \ to be developed [194–196]. The existence\nof advanced technologies, such as\
    \ the IoT, is critical to achieving this target.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n\
    24 of 31\n9. Conclusions\nDue to the continuous increase in the world population,\
    \ the demand for food in-\ncreases. Consequently, forests and arable lands are\
    \ changing into urban landscapes. In the\ncontext of shrinking arable land area,\
    \ highly efﬁcient and advanced technologies need to\nmeet a growing world population’s\
    \ food demands. At present, people can easily see the\ndevelopment of advanced\
    \ approaches to enhance crop yield and improve other agriculture\nmeasures. Some\
    \ people with a lack of innovative spirit and technology take agriculture\nas\
    \ a profession. Although they have partnerships and collaboration among suppliers,\n\
    farmers, retailers, and buyers, there is a gap between them for proper communication.\n\
    To ﬁll this gap, there is an urgent need for innovative and advanced technologies.\
    \ This\nreview covers multiple aspects of technology used in agriculture and enlightens\
    \ the key\nrole of advanced technologies, particularly the IoT, to advance agriculture\
    \ to meet future\nexpectations. Moreover, other advanced technologies, such as\
    \ UAVs, remote and ground\nsensors, communication technologies, and cloud computing,\
    \ are needed for sustainable\nagriculture. This review provides deeper insights\
    \ into the latest research ﬁndings. Based\non all of the above important information,\
    \ it is concluded that there is a dire need for crop\nproduction and improvement.\
    \ However, implementing these advanced and innovative\ntechnologies, such as the\
    \ IoT, are genuinely indeed not optional. By adopting these ad-\nvanced technologies,\
    \ farmers will improve their agricultural resources and practices. The\nadvancement\
    \ in such advanced technologies will pave the path for sustainable agriculture.\n\

    Groundwater resources can be expected to be increasingly relied upon in the near
    future, as a consequence of rapid population growth and global environmental change.
    Cost-effective and efficient techniques for groundwater exploration are gaining
    recognition as tools to underpin hydrogeological surveys in mid- and low-income
    regions. This paper provides a state of the art on groundwater potential mapping,
    an explorative technique based on remote sensing and geographical databases that
    has experienced major developments in recent years. A systematic review of over
    200 directly relevant papers is presented. Twenty variables were found to be frequently
    involved in groundwater potential investigations, of which eight are almost always
    present: geology, lineaments, landforms, soil, land use/land cover, rainfall,
    drainage density, and slope. The more innovative approaches draw from satellite
    images to develop indicators related to vegetation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture
    and thermal anomalies, among others. Data integration is carried out either through
    expert judgement or through machine-learning techniques, the latter being less
    common. Three main conclusions were reached: (1) for optimal results, groundwater
    mapping must be used as a tool to complement field work, rather than a low-cost
    substitute; (2) the potential of remote-sensing techniques in groundwater exploration
    is enormous, particularly when the power of machine learning is harnessed by involving
    human judgement; (3) quality assurance remains the main challenge ahead, as exemplified
    by the fact that a majority of the existing studies in the literature lack adequate
    validation. Résumé Il est attendu, comme conséquence de l’augmentation rapide
    de la population et des changements environnementaux globaux, que les ressources
    en eaux souterraines soient de plus en plus nécessaires dans le futur. Des techniques
    efficaces et à bas coût pour l’exploration des aquifères sont de plus en plus
    reconnues en tant qu’outils en support aux investigations hydrogéologiques dans
    les régions à moyen et bas revenus. Cet article dresse un état de l’art concernant
    la cartographie du potentiel en eaux souterraines, une technique exploratoire
    basée sur la télédétection et les bases de données géographiques qui ont montré
    d’importants développements ces dernières années. Un examen systématique de plus
    de 200 articles traitant directement ce sujet est présenté. Vingt variables sont
    fréquemment prises en compte dans les études du potentiel en eaux souterraines,
    dont huit sont presque systématiquement utilisées: géologie, linéaments, reliefs,
    sol, utilisation/occupation des sols, pluies, densité de drainage, et pentes.
    Les approches les plus innovantes se basent sur les images satellitaires pour
    développer des indicateurs liés, entre autre, à la végétation, l’évapotranspiration,
    l’humidité des sols et les anomalies thermiques. L’intégration des données est
    réalisée soit par avis d’experts soit, moins fréquemment, par des techniques d’apprentissage
    machine. Trois conclusions principales peuvent être établies: (1) pour un résultat
    optimal, la cartographie du potentiel doit être utilisée comme un outil complémentaire
    au travail de terrain plutôt qu’un substitut à bas coût; (2) le potentiel d’utilisation
    des techniques de télédétection est très important, surtout lorsque la puissance
    de l’apprentissage machine est consolidée par l’avis d’expert; (3) le contrôle
    de la qualité reste le défi principal pour le futur, la majorité des études relevées
    dans la littérature manquant cruellement d’une validation adéquate. Resumen Las
    aguas subterráneas constituyen un recurso estratégico cuya importancia tenderá
    a incrementarse en el actual contexto de crecimiento poblacional y cambio climático.
    Las técnicas de exploración y prospección basadas en metodologías de bajo coste
    son de especial importancia en regiones de renta media y baja. Este artículo presenta
    un estado del arte sobre la cartografía de potencial hidrogeológico, una técnica
    exploratoria basada en la utilización conjunta de teledetección, cartografía tradicional
    y sistemas de información geográfica que ha experimentado importantes avances
    en tiempos recientes. Para su elaboración se ha llevado a cabo la revisión de
    más de 200 artículos de la bibliografía especializada. Hasta veinte variables
    distintas se encuentran habitualmente en trabajos de estas características, de
    las cuales ocho aparecen casi siempre: litología, lineamientos, geomorfología,
    suelo, uso del territorio, precipitación, densidad de drenaje y pendiente. Los
    estudios de carácter más avanzado utilizan además imágenes de satélite para el
    desarrollo de indicadores relativos a la vegetación, evapotranspiración, humedad
    y anomalías térmicas, entre otros. La integración de todas las capas de información
    se lleva a cabo habitualmente mediante criterio experto, siendo las técnicas de
    aprendizaje artificial menos comunes. De lo anterior se derivan tres conclusiones
    principales: (1) la cartografía de potencial hidrogeológico debe interpretarse
    como una herramienta para complementar el trabajo de campo, más que como un sustituto
    de bajo coste para el mismo; (2) el potencial de este tipo de técnicas es enorme,
    especialmente si se combina el criterio experto con las posibilidades que hoy
    brinda la inteligencia artificial; y (3) el control de calidad constituye el principal
    reto de futuro, como demuestra el hecho de que la mayoría de los estudios consultados
    carece de un procedimiento de validación. 摘要 由于人口迅速增长和全球环境变化,预计在不久的将来地下水资源的依赖性将逐渐增加。经济有效的地下水勘探技术正被认为是支撑中低收入地区水文地质调查的工具。本文提供了基于近年来经历重大发展的遥感和地理数据库探索技术的地下水势制图的最新技术。对200多篇直接相关论文进行了系统评述。发现与地下水势相关的20个常用变量,其中8个经常被用到:地质,地表特征,地貌,土壤,土地利用/土地覆盖,降雨,排水密度和坡度。更具创新的方法是利用卫星图像来确定与植被,蒸散发,土壤湿度和热异常等有关的指标。数据集成通过专家判断或机器学习技术进行,后者不常见。得出了三个主要结论:(1)为获得最佳结果,必须将地下水势制图作为补充野外工作的工具,而不是低成本的替代品。(2)遥感技术在地下水勘探中的潜力是巨大的,特别是当包括人类判断的机器学习的能力。(3)质量保证仍然是未来的主要挑战,例如文献中的大多数现有研究缺乏充分的验证。
    Resumo Espera-se que os recursos hídricos subterrâneos sejam crescentemente demandados
    até um futuro próximo, como consequência do rápido crescimento populacional e
    mudanças ambientais globais. Técnicas custo-efetivas e eficientes para exploração
    de águas subterrâneas estão ganhando reconhecimento como ferramenta para sustentar
    pesquisas hidrogeológicas em regiões de baixa e média renda. Este trabalho fornece
    o estado da arte para o mapeamento do potencial hídrico subterrâneo, uma técnica
    exploratória baseada em sensoriamento remoto e bancos de dados geográficos que
    tem experienciado desenvolvimentos expressivos nos últimos anos. Uma revisão sistemática
    de mais de 200 artigos relevantes são apresentados. Descobriu-se que vinte variáveis
    são frequentemente envolvidas em investigações sobre o potencial das águas subterrâneas,
    oito das quais são quase sempre presentes: geologia, lineamentos, relevo, solo,
    uso e cobertura da terra, precipitação, densidade de drenagem e declividade. As
    abordagens mais inovadoras partem de imagens de satélite para desenvolver indicadores
    relacionados à vegetação, evapotranspiração, umidade do solo, anomalias termais,
    entre outros. A integração de dados é realizada seja através de julgamento especialista
    ou através de técnicas de aprendizado de máquinas, sendo a última menos comum.
    Três principais conclusões foram alcançadas: (1) para resultados ótimos, o mapeamento
    da água subterrânea deve ser utilizado como uma ferramenta para complementar o
    trabalho de campo, em vez de um substituto de baixo custo; (2) o potencial de
    técnicas de sensoriamento remoto na exploração de águas subterrâneas é enorme,
    particularmente quando o poder de aprendizado da máquina é aproveitado ao envolver
    o julgamento humano; (3) a garantia de qualidade permanece sendo o principal desafio,
    como exemplificado pelo fato de que a maioria dos estudos existentes na literatura
    não possui validação adequada. Similar content being viewed by others Remote sensing,

    groundwater potential zones: a review Article 12 September 2023 Introduction Groundwater
    is the largest available freshwater resource in the world. Aquifers provide drinking
    water to at least 50% of the global population, and account for 43% of all water
    used for irrigation. Furthermore, 2.5 billion people worldwide depend solely on
    groundwater resources to satisfy their daily needs (UNESCO 2015). Groundwater
    is particularly important in arid and semiarid climates, where droughts are frequent
    and where surface-water resources are often unreliable (Llamas and Martínez-Santos
    2005). While crucial for human beings and ecosystems, groundwater resources suffer
    from the “hidden treasure” syndrome. Because groundwater is out of sight, aquifers
    are seldom well known, even in industrialized countries. This often leads to widespread
    contamination and dropping water tables, and hampers attempts to manage the resource
    in a sustainable manner. Groundwater mapping has been defined as a tool for systematic
    development and planning of water resources (Elbeih 2015). Hydrogeological maps
    provide spatially distributed information about aquifers, including their geological,
    hydrogeological and hydrochemical characteristics. Groundwater maps may be used
    to develop strategies for sustainable management, allowing water planners to identify
    zones suitable for siting productive wells. Moreover, mapping contributes to understanding
    the vulnerability of aquifers and their associated ecosystems to contamination
    and overexploitation, to identify areas for artificial recharge, and to convey
    information to groundwater users. Furthermore, groundwater maps may reveal links
    between groundwater resources and human settlements (Ahmed and Sajjad 2018). Inevitably,
    a conventional groundwater map is the synthesis of numerous variables. Field data
    can be problematic to obtain because surveys are typically time- and resource-intensive,
    particularly in the case of remote regions. In a world where a large share of
    the rural population relies on groundwater, and where millions still lack access
    to safe drinking supplies (Martínez-Santos 2017), this calls for alternative approaches
    to make groundwater exploration as efficient as possible. Consider remote sensing
    (RS) technologies. While satellite- and air-borne sensors are of limited use in
    groundwater surveys, they do provide valuable insights regarding certain hydrogeological
    processes and variables, particularly when combined with various other information
    sources. Remotely obtained data are especially important in developing regions,
    where hydrogeological monitoring is seldom systematic and where the potential
    of groundwater resources remains largely unknown. This is one of the reasons why
    many hydrogeologists worldwide have become accustomed to making use of remote
    sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Jha et al. (2007) identified
    six major applications of RS/GIS in the field of groundwater, including the exploration
    and assessment of groundwater resources (Abdalla 2012; Fashae et al. 2014; Martín-Loeches
    et al. 2018), the selection of artificial recharge sites (Samadder et al. 2011),
    subsurface flow and/or pollution modelling (Leblanc et al. 2007), aquifer vulnerability
    and protection (Vias et al. 2005; Hernández-Espriú et al. 2014; Hadzic et al.
    2015), estimations of natural recharge (Yeh et al. 2016; Mokadem et al. 2018)
    and hydrogeological data analysis and process monitoring (Crossman et al. 2012;
    Dailey et al. 2015; Sahoo et al. 2018). The number of applications of satellite
    information in groundwater science continues to grow. Take for instance the Gravity
    Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), whose data have been used in recent times
    to monitor large-scale variations in groundwater storage (Feng et al. 2013; Lakshmi
    2016). This paper deals specifically with the first of these applications, i.e.
    groundwater potential mapping. As demonstrated in the following pages, interest
    in this topic has increased dramatically in recent years. Thus, the main aim of
    this paper is to provide a critical overview of the existing methods. To the authors’
    knowledge, there are only two precedents of this intent in the literature. The
    first one is the aforementioned review of RS/GIS applications to groundwater science
    provided by Jha et al. (2007), who touched upon the issue of groundwater potential
    mapping in the context of a broader study. The second one is the review carried
    out by Jasmin and Mallikarjuna (2011), which deals specifically with groundwater
    potential placing the emphasis on the Indian context. With this in mind, this
    contribution is two-fold. First, it provides an updated overview of groundwater
    potential methods based on a thorough review of the booming body of literature
    published in the last decade. This is perceived as a valuable addition in a field
    associated with rapidly evolving methods and technologies such as increasingly
    accurate satellite imaging and machine-learning techniques. Moreover, this work
    broadens the geographical focus, thus providing a global perspective on the state
    of the art. Literature review The following sections compile the findings of a
    literature review of over 200 papers, leading to two main conclusions. The first
    one is that the topic of groundwater potential mapping has drawn considerable
    attention among hydrogeologists in recent times. While a good number of earlier
    publications were found (Sander et al. 1996, Shahid et al. 2000, Jaiswal et al.
    2003, Rao and Jugran 2004, Ravi Shankar and Mohan 2006, Solomon and Quiel 2006,
    Prasad et al. 2007, among many others), the truth is there has been a significant
    increase in the amount of groundwater potential research after 2010, more than
    50% of the literature stemming from the years 2012–2018. The vast majority of
    these documents pertain to regional-scale case histories in the Middle East, Africa
    and South Asia (Fig. 1). A detailed classification revealed 22% to refer to sedimentary
    basins, 42% to crystalline terrains and 36% to mixed geological media. Climate-wise,
    over 95% of the literature deals with arid, semiarid or tropical domains. Fig.

    with the sheer extent of the available information. It would be fair to say that
    the proliferation of academic sources and online repositories rendered it impossible
    to perform a strictly exhaustive review. For practical purposes, however, this
    is only perceived as a minor drawback, as the investigation consistently failed
    to reveal new methodological information after the first 30 or 40 documents were
    analysed. This, coupled with the fact that the number of sources is considerable,
    suggests that the review was sufficiently comprehensive for practical purposes.
    Defining groundwater potential Interestingly, the search revealed neither a universal
    definition of groundwater potential, nor a standardized method or set of units
    to measure the outcomes. A closer look at the literature shows that groundwater
    potential mapping means different things to different authors. While most assume
    that a groundwater potential map provides an indication of variations in groundwater
    storage across a given region, others simply interpret it as a measure of how
    likely groundwater is to be found or as to where the highest yields may take place.
    A minority places the emphasis on delineating optimal locations to site boreholes
    at the local scale. Thus, even though there is a methodological consensus—groundwater
    potential maps are always developed based on a series of indirect indicators—it
    is also true that very few authors actually attempt to define “groundwater potential”.
    Broadly speaking, groundwater potential studies aim at identifying optimal zones
    for groundwater development. Since groundwater development presents a utilitarian
    component—groundwater is used “for something”—it makes sense to bring purpose
    into the definition. In this context, what works for rural water supplies in low-income
    countries does not necessarily work for large irrigation developments in industrialized
    regions, neither in terms of yield, nor in terms of water quality. Certain authors
    thus refer their studies to a particular use or set of uses. For instance, Siddha
    and Sahu (2018) took into account multiple water quality and pumping test parameters
    to develop a groundwater potential map to underpin domestic water supplies in
    Gandhinagar, India. Similarly, Martín-Loeches et al. (2018) developed a groundwater
    potential map for the specific purpose of siting drinking water boreholes for
    rural communities in Caimbambo, Angola. From a language point of view, the term
    “potential” refers to a latent quality or ability that may or may not be actualized.
    In other words, the idea of potential has to do with the probability of something
    happening. With this in mind, a groundwater potential map was defined as a spatially
    distributed estimate of the physical capacity of the terrain to yield enough groundwater
    for a given use based on a series of indirect indicators. This conceptualization
    recognizes (1) the spatial component intrinsic to groundwater resources, and (2)
    that no single source of information is failsafe, which means thatas many as possible
    are needed to be integrated to minimize the uncertainties inherent to groundwater
    exploration. Furthermore, by speaking of potential, the hypothetical nature of
    the intent (and of its results), i.e. that a groundwater potential map is essentially
    a hydrogeologist’s “best estimate” is acknowledged. This holds true even in the
    case of maps checked against ground truth, as these are typically validated on
    limited datasets. Relevant sources and variables in groundwater potential studies
    Each document in the database was examined for the purpose of identifying the
    key elements involved in groundwater potential mapping. Over 20 parameter groups
    were identified, approximately 40% of which were found consistently across most
    studies (Fig. 1). These include lithology (geology), geomorphology, soil, land
    use/land cover, topography, lineaments, drainage- and slope-related variables,
    rainfall and groundwater recharge. The main factor determining the kind of information
    involved in each study seems to be whether the map was carried out a priori, that
    is, in the absence of groundwater data, or a posteriori, that is, with access
    to it. The former were found to rely almost exclusively on parameters that can
    be obtained without direct presence on the field (digital elevation models, preexisting
    cartography, satellite images), whereas the latter invariably banked on additional
    information sources such as groundwater levels, borehole yields and drilling success
    rates. Another key factor is the scale of work. The relevance of local variables
    such as certain landforms or lineaments, is lost when developing maps that span
    several thousands of square kilometres. Conversely, the spatial variation of rainfall
    and recharge may be close to meaningless when dealing with a scale of a few square
    kilometres (largely because of the absence of actual spatially distributed information
    at that scale). All these factors explain why maps very rarely, if ever, consider
    all variables in Fig. 1. All variables were classified in five categories as per
    their source of information—cartography, satellite images, digital elevation models,
    borehole data, other. Note that some papers were found to use a given parameter
    that was not listed explicitly. For instance, using a preexisting geological map
    implicitly means relying on the borehole/geophysical data that were used to produce
    it, even if this was not mentioned in the study. Moreover, in some cases it was
    found that the authors described a given variable, although it is unclear whether
    they actually used it; thus, the outcomes presented in Fig. 1 should be interpreted
    with some leniency. Cartographic sources Geology is the single most important
    factor determining groundwater occurrence. Since the geology of groundwater has
    been discussed extensively in the literature (Freeze and Cherry 1979, Fetter 1993,
    Younger 2007, among many others) only a schematic description will be provided
    here. Groundwater can only be stored and circulate within the rock’s fractures
    and voids, which implies that it is the porosity and permeability of the materials
    that ultimately constrain groundwater potential. In practice the challenge typically
    consists in identifying those formations which are more likely to hold water.
    These include, but are not limited to, nonunconsolidated deposits, weathering
    products and fissured and soluble sedimentary rocks. Groundwater is near ubiquitous
    in the case of unconsolidated sediments. These present intergranular porosity
    and a wide range of textures and permeabilities, which means that they usually
    make up either aquifers or aquitards. Under certain circumstances, the accumulations
    of unconsolidated materials can be hundreds or thousands of meters thick, making
    them highly interesting from the hydrogeological standpoint, even in those cases
    where the average permeability may be low. Similar considerations apply to alluvial
    fans, except that these typically make up shallow aquifers of limited potential.
    Consolidated sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone also favour groundwater
    occurrence, particularly when heavily fractured and, in the case of limestone,
    when karstified. In such cases, groundwater flow takes place predominantly along
    fractures and conduits. These rocks can however be close to impervious if fracturing
    and/or karstification is either limited or altogether absent. With the exception
    of some volcanic rocks, igneous and metamorphic materials do not constitute good
    aquifers. It is however possible to find moderate amounts of groundwater in coarse-grained
    weathering products overlying crystalline rocks, as well as in fractures. Because
    structural features play an important role in the infiltration and movement of
    groundwater (Chilton and Foster 1995; Meijerink 1996; Assatse et al. 2016), the
    definition of hydrogeological units is typically complemented by lineament mapping
    (Nag 2005; Bruning et al. 2011; Adeyeye et al. 2015; Varade et al. 2018). Lineaments
    are best described as elongated geological discontinuities associated with networks
    of fractures. These may extend over thousands of kilometres, and may be several
    kilometres wide and deep. Traditionally, lineament maps were developed from aerial
    photographs. Nowadays they can also be discerned from digitally processed colour
    composites, radar data or digital elevation models (Dar et al. 2010; Wendt et
    al. 2016; Das et al. 2018). These may lead, for instance, to the identification
    of geological features associated with the presence of soil moisture or vegetation
    (Sahoo et al. 2018). Lineament mapping has proven valuable in numerous groundwater
    exploration surveys in the past (Teeuw 1995; Sander 2007). For instance, the classic
    paper by Sander et al. (1996) demonstrates how careful lineament mapping was instrumental
    in improving the borehole success rate in the Voltaian sedimentary basin, central
    Ghana. Nevertheless, lineament mapping has often been criticized for its reliance
    on intuition, which inevitably leads to nonrepeatable results. Reproducibility
    can be increased either by comparing and integrating the outcomes obtained by
    several operators in the same area or by using automated methods. Both alternatives
    present practical drawbacks (Sander et al. 1997; Meijerink 2007; Sander 2007),
    a combination of the two being the most recommendable approach to smooth out inconsistencies.
    Sander et al. (1996) point out that a large proportion of the developing world
    is underlain by rocks where groundwater occurs chiefly in fracture zones. As many
    of these regions are subject to prolonged dry seasons and waterborne disease,
    groundwater is their only potable resource. This attests to the importance of
    appropriate lineament delineation in groundwater potential studies. Geomorphology
    is the study of landforms and structural features of the landscape. Geomorphological
    maps are usually developed through field surveys, aerial photos and satellite
    images, and serve the purpose of identifying those features that may be favourable
    to infiltration, groundwater storage, or both. Alluvial fans, sand dunes, weathering
    mantles, floodplains and other accumulations of unconsolidated material typically
    rank among the most interesting geomorphological features from the point of view
    of groundwater (Venkateswaran and Ayyandurai 2015). Conversely, landforms such
    as inselbergs, scarps and ridges can be safely assumed to be of little practical
    use. Soil data are routinely used in groundwater recharge and vulnerability studies
    (Vias et al. 2005, Samadder et al. 2011, Mokadem et al. 2018). This is mostly
    because soil permeability is directly related to effective porosity, grain shape
    and size, and void ratio, which means that soil type plays an important role in
    infiltration. For this reason, studies considering soil-related variables frequently
    do so together with rainfall and/or recharge (Nanda et al. 2017, Thapa et al.
    2017b, Al Shaheeb et al. 2018). Typically, the higher infiltration potential is
    associated with sandy and gravelly soils, while clayey and silty soils rank among
    the least favourable. Fine sands and loamy soils can be expected to present moderate
    permeability. Land use and cover play a similar role to soil type, for both are
    related to aquifer recharge. The integration of land use and land cover in groundwater
    potential studies attests to the fact that human activities can alter hydrological
    dynamics—for instance, cropland and forests are often considered favourable to
    groundwater occurrence because ploughing, root development and biological activity
    all favour infiltration. Areas in close proximity to permanent water bodies also
    tend to correlate with a higher groundwater potential (Naghibi et al. 2017; Singh
    et al. 2018). Conversely, hills, human settlements and wastelands are generally
    disregarded (Magesh et al. 2012; Martín-Loeches et al. 2018; Patra et al. 2018).
    Despite its influence on some of the aforementioned aspects, attempts are usually
    made to consider aquifer replenishment as a stand-alone factor. This can be problematic
    because groundwater potential mapping is typically applied in data-scarce regions,
    where aquifer recharge is poorly characterized. Furthermore, the idea of groundwater
    potential mapping via RS/GIS is to develop predictive maps based on whatever is
    readily available, rather than to improve the existing knowledge about specific
    variables. Thus, even if the recharge mapping literature is rich (Selvam et al.
    2015; Yeh et al. 2016; Mokadem et al. 2018), there are comparatively fewer examples
    of groundwater mapping studies using quantitative recharge estimates (An et al.
    2012; Konkul et al. 2014; Oikonomidis et al. 2015). These tend to rely either
    on third-party information or on uncomplicated techniques (rainfall minus evapotranspiration,
    quantification of canal losses, etc.). In contrast, the use of rainfall is far
    more common (Nampak et al. 2014; Madani and Niyazi 2015; Bashe 2017; Panahi et
    al. 2017; Nanda et al. 2017; Jenifer and Jha 2017; Thapa et al. 2017; Hussein
    et al. 2017). Spatially distributed rainfall estimates are generally developed
    by geostatistical extrapolation of point-source information. Digital elevation
    models Satellites are equipped with remote sensors, that is, devices that can
    capture information about objects from far away. Remote sensors are either active
    or passive. The former send a signal in the direction of the object to be investigated,
    while the latter measure the radiation that naturally emanates from it (usually
    reflected sunlight). The majority of active sensors operate in the microwave portion
    of the electromagnetic spectrum, which makes them able to penetrate the atmosphere
    under most conditions. Conversely, most passive systems used in remote sensing
    applications operate in the visible, infrared, thermal infrared, and microwave
    portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of active sensors are radars,
    laser altimeters, laser radars, ranging instruments, scatterometers and sounders.
    Passive sensors include accelerometers, hyperspectral and imaging radiometers,
    spectrometers and spectroradiometers (NASA 2018a). Satellite information is increasingly
    recognized as a cost-effective tool in many scientific domains. This is largely
    because its accessibility has become widespread in recent years, thus allowing
    scientific communities to develop applications within their respective fields.
    Digital elevation models (DEM) provide an excellent example of cross-discipline
    application. DEMs usually adopt the shape of raster files, and may be developed
    from many data sources, including field surveys. Currently, however, DEMs are
    mostly obtained from active sensor (radar, LIDAR) or passive optical sensor data.
    The radar-based Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the optical Advanced
    Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) rank among those
    whose use is most widespread. Both are available for free and currently provide
    consistent information at the global scale for a spatial resolution of 1 arc-second
    (30 m) (Wendt et al. 2016). In general, the application of DEMs to groundwater
    exploration relies on the assumption that shallow groundwater flow is partially
    driven by surface features, and parameterized by properties that can be inferred
    from surface data (Elbeih 2015); thus, topography may be used to identify lowlands,
    basins, closed depressions and other theoretically favourable settings. Furthermore,
    digital elevation information can be treated to gain additional insight (Liu et
    al. 2015)—for instance, slope provides important clues as to the nature of various
    geological and geodynamic processes, including groundwater recharge (Fashae et
    al. 2014; Kumar et al. 2016). Gentle slopes imply slow runoff, and thus, more
    time for infiltration, while, conversely, steeper gradients suggest greater erosion
    and short residence time. In groundwater potential mapping, this is frequently
    associated with a lesser probability of accumulation of unconsolidated sediments
    and recharge (Ibrahim-Bathis and Ahmed 2016). DEMs may also be used to develop
    drainage density maps. Drainage density is computed as the total length of the
    streams per catchment unit area; thus, it represents how close together the stream
    channels are. A very high drainage density means that runoff can be evacuated
    quickly, and thus, that infiltration is less likely (Magesh et al. 2012; Fashae
    et al. 2014). There are, however, some exceptions, as groundwater can be expected
    to accumulate in alluvial sediments in the flatter areas of the catchment (Das
    et al. 2018). In addition, a high drainage density can be assimilated to a larger
    erosion potential. Parallelisms between drainage density and terrain permeability
    may be found in certain geological environments (Meijerink 2007). Topography not
    only controls groundwater flow to some extent, but also plays an important role
    in the spatial distribution of hydrological variables such as infiltration potential
    or soil moisture. This can be reflected by parameters like the topographic wetness
    index (Beven and Kirkby 1979; Sorensen et al. 2006), which interprets the relation
    between the water that accumulates at any point of a given area and the gravitational
    force that drives water down slope. The topographic wetness index is calculated
    as a logarithmic ratio between the catchment area draining into a point of the
    drainage network and the average gradient. A higher index represents a lower slope
    and a larger area. Thus, groundwater occurrence and the topographic wetness index
    are positively correlated (Nampak et al. 2014; Rahmati and Melesse 2016; Misi
    et al. 2018). Other potentially useful parameters that can be inferred directly
    from topographic data include slope curvature, erosion indexes and runoff coefficients
    (Oh et al. 2011; Naghibi et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018; Singh et al. 2018). Satellite
    images Rationale and image treatment procedures Information from certain satellite
    images is classified and stored based on spectral response. Since each object
    presents a unique set of spectral responses, remote sensing may be used to identify
    different bodies (rocks, vegetation, roads, water) based on their specific signatures
    (Gupta 2018). Because each satellite presents a different spectrum of wavelengths,
    image size, spatial and temporal resolution, and historical records, the value
    of the data ranges from the local to the global scale, and may (or may not) be
    usable in studies spanning certain areas and/or periods of time. In this context,
    the selection of one information source over another may have critical implications
    on the results. There are currently numerous satellite platforms which provide
    potentially useful information. These include Landsat 7 and 8, WorldView 4, Pleiades,
    QuickBird, KompSAT, IKONOS, ALOS or Sentinel 2, among others. Landsat is, however,
    the most widely used in groundwater studies., which is explained by several factors,
    including accessibility, long time series, a sufficiently broad wavelength spectrum
    and accurate spatial and temporal resolution. The most recent satellite in the
    Landsat program is Landsat 8, launched in 2013. Landsat 8’s Operational Land Imager
    (OLI) captures spectral responses across nine discrete wavelengths along the electromagnetic
    spectrum, while its thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) includes two additional bands
    within the thermal infrared (Table 1; Barsi et al. 2014). Table 1 Landsat 8 bands
    (after Barsi et al. 2014, NASA 2018a, b). OLI operational land imager, TIRS thermal
    infrared sensor Full size table Satellite images may be treated to highlight the
    differences between spectral responses (Gupta 2018). Because images are made up
    of different wavelengths, their analysis typically seeks to find additional information
    by decomposing the image in separate bands (Bishop 2018). Common procedures include
    band composites, band ratios and principal component analyses (Wendt et al. 2016).
    These methods typically involve some subjectivity and trial-and-error, which means
    that the skill and experience of the technician may have a strong bearing on the
    results. Table 2 presents some commonly used composite combinations and band ratios
    for Landsat 8 images. Table 2 Commonly used Landsat 8 band combinations and ratios
    (own elaboration from Wendt et al. 2016 and various other sources). Applications
    may differ from humid to dry climates Full size table Spectral signatures are
    recorded at the scale of the image resolution (i.e. pixel scale). Since images
    may cover hundreds or thousands of square kilometres with a very high resolution,
    the volume of information stored in each one is enormous (Meijerink 2007). For
    practical purposes, this information typically needs to be clustered, which may
    be achieved through unsupervised or supervised methods (Elhag 2017; Huang et al.
    2018). In an unsupervised classification, in-built algorithms are used to classify
    the information based on similarities in pixel scores, with no human intervention
    beyond determining which algorithm to use. In contrast, a supervised classification
    involves the operator more directly. A number of sample pixels that can be considered
    representative of the variable at hand (rock, vegetation, etc) are selected based
    on ground-truth and expert knowledge (Aydav and Mizn 2015; Burton-Johnson et al.
    2016). Then these are used as “training sites” for the computer to identify those
    pixels in the image that present similar properties, usually with some degree
    of tolerance. As a rule of thumb, supervised classification based on field data
    is preferable to unsupervised classification; however, unsupervised classification
    may prove invaluable for initial screening in complex and large areas (Elhag 2017).
    Applications While satellite surveillance does not penetrate deep into the ground,
    it does provide useful information as to those features of the landscape that
    may be associated with shallow groundwater. Vegetation is a classic example. Multispectral
    imagery at high spatial resolution has been used, for instance, to monitor crop
    biophysical parameters and water use (Calera et al. 2017). In the context of groundwater
    potential studies, the presence of vigorous vegetation at the end of the dry season
    can be interpreted as a proxy for a permanent spring or a shallow water table.
    Many vegetation-related indices have been proposed over the years, including the
    ratio vegetation index (RVI), the vegetation index number (VIN), the differenced
    vegetation index (DVI), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI;
    Bannari et al. 1995; Xie et al. 2008). The latter is perhaps the most widely used,
    largely due to its ease of calculation and to its sensitivity to temporal changes
    in vegetation patterns (Xue and Su 2017). NDVI banks on the principle that chlorophyll
    content generates a highly absorptive response in the visible red, but is reflective
    in the infrared wavelength. Since live green plants typically appear dark in terms
    of their photosynthetically active radiation and bright in the infrared, the contrast
    can be used as an indicator of vegetation status (Xie et al. 2008). NDVI is typically
    used for the purpose of assessing vegetation vigour. NDVI values range from −1
    to +1. Pixel-scale ratings are ultimately dependent on the image, which means
    that they may fluctuate from one setting to another. However, there is a more
    or less general consensus that rock and bare soil typically present low positive
    values, whereas water and snow are in the negative. In contrast, dense vegetation
    exceeds +0.5, and shrub lands and grasslands result in intermediate positive values.
    NDVI may be sensitive to variables such as soil brightness, colour, atmosphere
    and cloud shadows (Xue and Su 2017). Because not all vegetation types present
    the same spectral signature, vegetation-related indexes may be used to distinguish
    among plant communities. This can be useful in the context of groundwater studies,
    where the presence of different species may have practical implications—for instance,
    the existence of a shallow water table may be inferred from the proliferation
    of phreatophytes. Halophytic species also point at shallow groundwater, but suggest
    a high degree of salinity, while xerophytes imply that groundwater is either “deep”
    or altogether absent (Jha et al. 2007; Jasmin and Mallikarjuna 2011). Other indicators
    such as evapotranspiration or soil moisture can provide similar information to
    vegetation (Ndou et al. 2017; Gokool et al. 2018). Due to the thermal inertias
    of water stored underground, temperature anomalies in land surface may also be
    used as an indicator of the presence of groundwater. This is particularly true
    of arid and semiarid environments subject to long dry spells. Cool thermal anomalies
    have been defined as locations where land surface temperatures are lower than
    those of surrounding locations under normal conditions. These can be associated
    with discharge of groundwater through fracture systems, infiltration or groundwater
    accumulation (Abrams et al. 2018). Whenever dealing with temperature-related variables,
    care must be taken to discriminate the effects of cloud cover and recent rainfall
    and runoff, as well as that of shadows and vegetation canopies. Satellite information
    has also proven useful in delineating rock types in numerous occasions (Simon
    et al. 2016; Ducart et al. 2016). Wendt et al. (2016) and Gupta (2018) provide
    an excellent discussion of the most prominent features of major rock types in
    satellite images, a selection of which is provided in Table 3. While rock type
    may be inferred from spectral response to some extent, there are mineral components
    with specific spectral signatures can be common to very different rocks (Meijerink
    2007). Moreover, the spectral response of given rock can vary significantly depending
    on whether it is fresh or weathered; thus, spectral assessment needs to be complemented
    with other information (DEM, landforms, drainage) for optimal results. Some degree
    of field work is inevitable to ensure an adequate calibration of the results,
    but the RS approach can help keep it to a minimum. Classification-wise, a combination
    of supervised and unsupervised methods is typically appropriate. Image processing
    techniques such as edge detection methods are sometimes applied on satellite images
    to detect lineament density (Al Saud 2010; Panahi et al. 2017). Table 3 Characteristics
    of selected types of rocks as featured in satellite images (after Wendt et al.
    2016 and Gupta 2018) Full size table Relevant hydrogeological features might be
    buried. Radar waves are able to penetrate the ground down to a few meters, although
    this is strongly dependent on soil moisture. In desert regions, for instance,
    the space-borne low-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has proven an invaluable
    aid in revealing paleo-hydrological and tectonic structures hidden under aeolian
    sands (Molina et al. 2017). This allows for the delineation of alluvial fans,
    paleo-channels, paleo-lakes and paleo-shorelines, which may constitute preferential
    flow paths or reservoirs of groundwater (Sternberg and Paillou 2015). Radar techniques
    may also contribute to penetrate dense vegetation canopies, thus providing information
    as to which types or rocks are beneath (Gupta 2018). Borehole and geophysical
    data The aforementioned sources provide surface-level information, but fail to
    capture the vertical component of groundwater systems (i.e. depth). Because groundwater
    is by definition stored underground, borehole and geophysical logs must be sought
    whenever possible. Borehole logs provide undisputable evidence of the presence
    (or absence) of groundwater. Borehole databases typically have information on
    yield, depth and static groundwater level (DNH 2010; DGEP 2016), and may also
    include pumping test and water quality data, as well as the location and flow
    rate of springs (Nsiah et al. 2018; Saha et al. 2018). In monotonous settings,
    consistently high success rates and similar groundwater levels throughout suggest
    the existence of a regional water table. In contrast, the value of borehole records
    is limited in highly anisotropic media, where the conditions underground may change
    significantly over just a few meters. Furthermore, water level/depth data are
    useful to develop water-table maps in order to determine the main recharge and
    discharge areas of an aquifer, while lithostratigraphic logs may be used to derive
    valuable information on aquifer thickness. Joint interpretation of all these variables
    can render a highly accurate picture of the hydrogeological conditions in the
    field, thus contributing to the reliability of the end product (Jasrotia et al.
    2016; Diaz-Alcaide et al. 2017; Nsiah et al. 2018). Unfortunately, the literature
    shows that the use of exhaustive borehole databases in groundwater potential studies
    is relatively uncommon. The next most informative thing to a borehole log is a
    geophysical log. Geophysical techniques do not directly detect the presence of
    groundwater, but do provide valuable information about the types of rocks that
    can be found underground and their properties. Electrical and magnetic surveys
    are frequently used in the process of siting boreholes, but the outcomes are seldom
    compiled in comprehensive databases. While there may be exceptions, the use of
    this kind of information is generally restricted to small-scale applications with
    an ad-hoc geophysical component (Omosuyi et al. 2013; Akinlalu et al. 2017; Helaly
    2017; Bayewu et al. 2018). Data integration and validation Any attempt to map
    groundwater potential must take into consideration two crucial points: (1) perceptual
    bias on the part of the operator (i.e. making the map look like “what it should
    look like” based on personal belief) may have an overly strong bearing on the
    results; and (2) the outcomes of a groundwater potential map are virtually worthless
    without ground truth. In this context, both the way data are integrated and the
    validation procedure are essential to ensure representative outcomes. Data integration
    procedures Groundwater potential zoning is a classic example of a multi-criteria
    decision problem (Ahmed et al. 2014), where the likelihood of attaining a target
    (finding groundwater) is contingent on a variety of factors—soil, lineaments,
    slope, geology, landforms, lithology, drainage. These sometimes contribute to
    this intent and sometimes offset each other, which makes the task more complex.
    The information needs to be integrated meaningfully so that, ultimately, every
    pixel in the map ends up with a reliable groundwater potential index. In broad
    terms, there are two major approaches to data integration: expert decision systems
    and machine-learning methods. Expert decision systems are directly based on human
    judgement, and include techniques such as simple addition, multi-influence factor
    techniques or analytical hierarchy processes (Agarwal et al. 2013; Abrams et al.
    2018). On the other hand, machine-learning methods comprise a large variety of
    approaches, including artificial neural network fitting, logistic regression,
    regression trees, random forest techniques and statistical tree algorithms (Duan
    et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2018). Generally speaking, machine-learning is less prone
    to procedural mistakes and perceptual bias, whereas expert methods provide the
    advantages of relying on a seasoned pair of eyes to discern features that may
    escape automatic detection. In practice, neither approach can be expected to render
    better results than the other. Expert decision systems Each information source
    provides a completely different set of variables. These may be either quantitative
    or qualitative, and not necessarily measurable in the same units. Hence, a crucial
    point in groundwater potential studies is data integration. For practical purposes,
    each pixel within each thematic map needs to be assigned a numerical score, or
    “weight”, so that map algebra can be performed (Ibrahim-Bathis and Ahmed 2016;
    Govindaraj et al. 2017). This process necessarily relies on expert judgement to
    some extent, which means that a certain degree of subjectivity is always involved
    (Martín-Loeches et al. 2018). The influence of each variable on groundwater potential
    presents two major components, namely, its comparative and intrinsic weights (Fashae
    et al. 2014; Das et al. 2017). The comparative weight of a variable represents
    how important it is in relation to the others, while its intrinsic weighting has
    to do with how the rating of a given variable is distributed “internally” (Ghodratabadi
    and Feizi 2015; Dinesan et al. 2015). For instance, under certain circumstances
    landforms may be deemed more important for groundwater potential than drainage
    density (Jasrotia et al. 2016), which means landforms will be assigned a greater
    comparative weight when putting both maps together with the rest. Then, landforms
    need to be classified into various types (inselbergs, pediments, floodplains),
    each one of which will receive a different score (intrinsic weighting). The most
    rudimentary integration technique is simple additive weight, consisting of assigning
    an equal weight to each variable, assuming the intrinsic weights to be consistent
    in terms of its importance for groundwater potential. While conceptually straightforward,
    this approach may render good-quality results if the setting is appropriate.,
    which is demonstrated by the work of Abrams et al. (2018) in Oman and the United
    Arab Emirates. In this case, expert methods (simple addition, analytical hierarchical
    processes) were observed to yield better results than machine-learning approaches
    (probabilistic frequency ratio). The authors attributed this to the limitations
    of the well dataset to predict groundwater potential in rugged terrain, as well
    as to the inability of the frequency ratio method to extrapolate groundwater potential
    beyond the spatial extent of known wells. Multi-influence factor techniques (MIF)
    rank among the most popular methods to determine the weights of each variable
    (Magesh et al. 2012; Das et al. 2017; Thapa et al. 2017a, b; Nasir et al. 2018).
    The underlying principle behind MIF methods is that some of the variables involved
    may be interdependent, and that those which influence the others the most are
    those that also influence groundwater potential more strongly. Thus, each variable
    is compared individually against all others in order to establish a hierarchy—for
    instance, in crystalline terrains lineaments can be expected to exert a strong
    influence on the drainage network, but the opposite will not be true. The variable
    under consideration is assigned a value of 1 if it influences the other one significantly,
    of 0.5 if it does so in a minor way, and 0 if it does not or if both are unrelated.
    The comparative scores of the variable under consideration are added together.
    Then, its comparative weight is calculated as the percentage over the total score
    of all variables (Manikandan et al. 2014; Thapa et al. 2018). Finally, each variable
    is reclassed internally for the purpose of computing its intrinsic weights. The
    maximum intrinsic weight must coincide with the comparative weight of the variable,
    while the minimum may be zero or even negative. Analytical hierarchy processes
    (AHP) are closely related to MIF methods (Saaty 2008). Expert-based pairwise combination
    remains similar, but the scores are normalized to smooth out the subjectivity
    component and tested for consistency. The final weightings for the thematic layers
    are the normalized values of the eigenvectors that are associated with the maximum
    eigenvalues of the ratio matrix (Mohammadi-Behzad et al. 2018). While the calculations
    are more complex than those involved in MIF, AHP is available in certain software
    packages, and is also frequently used in the groundwater potential literature
    (Agarwal et al. 2013; Shekhar and Pandey 2014; Aladejana et al. 2016; Mohammadi-Behzad
    et al. 2018). AHP is also versatile enough to be integrated with other approaches
    such as entropy analysis (Al Abadi et al. 2017). Machine-learning methods Machine
    learning is best described as a set of statistical approaches that focus on revealing
    hidden patterns in large datasets (Mitchell 1997). In the context of groundwater
    potential studies, machine-learning helps determine which variables are more closely
    associated with groundwater based on field evidence. Thus, the rationale behind
    machine-learning techniques is the opposite to that of manual methods. Based on
    ground truth (successful drilling spots, borehole yield, groundwater level), the
    computer examines the spatial relationships between all explanatory variables
    (geology, landforms, soil, etc.) to determine which ones are most significant
    (Odzemir 2011a, b; Naghibi et al. 2015). The results can then be used to develop
    a groundwater potential map. Machine learning methods may be supervised or unsupervised
    (Hastie et al. 2009). Supervised methods consist in developing an algorithm that
    relates a series of potentially explanatory variables to a known output. On the
    other hand, unsupervised machine learning takes place when there are a set of
    explanatory variables but no known output (i.e. no ground-truth). In the first
    case, the goal is to predict an outcome, whereas in the second, the aim is to
    learn more about the internal dependencies among the explanatory variables (Kelleher
    et al. 2015). Typical examples of supervised approaches include support vector
    machines, statistical learners and classification trees, whereas unsupervised
    learning includes clustering and dimensionality reduction (Shalev-Shwartz and
    Ben-David 2014). Supervised learning is particularly useful in the context of
    groundwater potential studies. Output-wise, supervised methods are split in two
    broad categories, namely regression and classification, the main difference being
    the type of results that can be expected (Hastie et al. 2009). Regression provides
    outcomes in terms of a continuous quantitative variable (borehole yield, spring
    flow, groundwater depth), whereas classification approaches are used to determine
    a series of bivariate or multivariate classes (presence vs absence of groundwater,
    presence vs absence of spring, low/medium/high groundwater potential). The use
    of machine-learning methods in the field of groundwater potential mapping is still
    relatively new. Tested approaches include weights of evidence (Lee et al. 2012;
    Al Abadi 2015; Madani and Niyazi 2015), probabilistic frequency ratio (Dadgar
    et al. 2017; Balamurugan et al. 2017; Jothibasu and Anbazhagan 2017; Abrams et
    al. 2018), logistic regression (Odzemir 2011a, b; Chen et al. 2018), functional
    tree models (Chen et al. 2018), evidential belief function models (Nampak et al.
    2014; Rahmati and Melesse 2016; Mogaji and Lim 2018), or regression trees (Naghibi
    et al. 2017), among others. Machine learning techniques are inherently complex,
    which means that predicting whether a method will perform better than another
    is too complicated a task for the human mind. Thus it is common practice to compare
    different methods and to either pick the best one or perform an ensemble of the
    results. The performance of machine-learning methods has been compared in the
    context of various studies—for instance, Naghibi et al. (2015) evaluated the performance
    of boosted regression tree, classification and regression tree, and random forest
    techniques to evaluate spring potential in the Koohrang watershed, Iran. All three
    models were validated satisfactorily by means of receiver operating characteristics
    curve methods. The boosted regression model rendered the best results, followed
    by classification and regression tree and random forest. Odzemir (2011a) carried
    out a similar exercise in the Sultan Montains, Turkey, where frequency ratio,
    weight of evidence and logistic regression models were tested. In this case, frequency
    ratio provided a better fit with observed data then the other two. Finally, Chen
    et al. (2018) compared ensemble weights of evidence with logistic regression and
    functional tree models to map spring potential in the Ningtiaota region, China,
    obtaining the better results with the latter. Map validation Al Saud (2010) provides
    a brief overview of about 20 groundwater potential studies carried out between
    the 1960s and 2008, including the authors’ self-assessments. Unsatisfactory results
    were found in the earlier period, outcomes becoming increasingly more reliable
    from the 1980s. This can be partially explained by the increasing resolution of
    remote sensing information, as well as to a growing number of variables being
    taken into consideration. Indeed, earlier works were typically based on one or
    two potentially meaningful parameters (lineaments, landforms), whereas the modern
    literature on average relies on no less than six or seven (Fig. 1). In practice,
    the only way to ensure that a groundwater potential map is actually representative
    is to validate it against field data. There are two approaches to validating a
    groundwater potential map, both of which are contingent on the quality and spatial
    distribution of borehole and/or spring data. The first one consists in checking
    the results against a sufficiently broad field dataset. Experience shows that
    the type of validation data will typically depend on what is available, rather
    than on the preferences of the operator. Thus, borehole success, pumping test
    or spring discharge data rank among the most sought-after validation sources (Agarwal
    et al. 2013; Gumma and Pavelic 2013; Agarwal and Garg 2016; Tahmassebipoor et
    al. 2016; Ahmed and Sajjad 2018). This is because these not only provide useful
    information as to the presence of groundwater, but also as of its suitability
    for different uses. In this context, validation procedures include comparison
    of the number of positive boreholes per potential zoning, well yield vs groundwater
    potential index, and receiver operating characteristic curves (Al Abadi 2015;
    Naghibi et al. 2015). In studies dealing with groundwater occurrence or storage
    potential, however, validating on groundwater depth/level may also be satisfactory
    (Kumar et al. 2014; Madani and Niyazi 2015; Nasir et al. 2018). The second procedure
    is self-validation. Self-validation is achieved by using exhaustive borehole data
    in the process of developing the map (Diaz-Alcaide et al. 2017; Nsiah et al. 2018).
    Self-validated maps may include variables such as well yield, transmissivity,
    groundwater level or spring discharge, alongside remote sensing information and
    hydrogeomorphological cartography. By its own nature, self-validation can only
    be carried out in regions with a sufficiently well-developed knowledge base. Mixed
    validation approaches based on splitting the field database into “training”, “validation”
    and “test” datasets are often implemented in the context of machine-learning applications
    (Odzemir 2011a, b; Oh et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2018). Discussion A groundwater
    potential map serves the purpose of delineating those areas that may be more favourable
    for groundwater development within a given geographical setting. While developing
    a reliable groundwater potential map requires advanced notions of geology, hydrogeology
    and satellite science, the final outcomes are typically presented in visually
    appealing fashion, so that they can be interpreted by anybody (Bagyaraj et al.
    2012). This has some inherent dangers, for the complexities and uncertainties
    of groundwater exploration are ultimately lost in a dimensionless colour scale
    ranging from “very low” to “very high”. As a result, groundwater potential maps
    have a natural tendency to replace reality in the eyes of stakeholders and decision-makers,
    which implies that care must be taken to ensure that end-users understand the
    pitfalls. Attractive maps can be developed with relatively little data. Looking
    at the end product, however, there is no telling as to how comprehensive the mapping
    process or the datasets were. In this context, quality assurance is a major issue.
    Remarkably, however, a major drawback in groundwater potential studies is the
    absence of validation. Out of the 200-odd cases studies analysed in this research,
    over 70% did not present a robust validation mechanism. Of course, this cannot
    always be attributed to methodological flaw. The absence of validation is acceptable
    in preliminary studies. Take for instance those carried out in isolated regions,
    where there may be little or no hydrogeological knowledge prior to the development
    of the map. In such cases, groundwater potential maps are best interpreted as
    estimates pending on confirmation (Al Shaheeb et al. 2018; Mogaji and Lim 2018).
    An important factor determining the reliability of a groundwater potential map
    is the quality and scale of the underlying datasets. Figure 1 provides an overview
    as to how various authors approached the issue of groundwater potential mapping
    in a wide variety of regions. As shown, the number of parameters involved in each
    study ranges from just four or five to over 10 or 12. Because of the inherent
    uncertainties of groundwater prospect, the availability of as much information
    as possible is generally desirable. The literature also shows that the resolution
    of the input data used in groundwater potential studies tends to be highly variable.
    More specifically, combining fine and coarse resolution information is common
    practice, as is the reclassification of explanatory variables (Manap et al. 2013,
    Bashe 2017, Dasho et al. 2017, Chaudhary and Kumar 2017, Jahan et al. 2018). This
    kind of simplification is often inevitable, even necessary in certain cases. However,
    it is only adequate if the map is to be used at the regional extent, as local
    inaccuracies can be expected to arise from mixing different scales. In such cases,
    groundwater potential maps should be interpreted as a tool to optimize the amount
    of field work involved, rather than as a low-cost substitute for local-scale surveys
    (Abdalla 2012; Mohammadi et al. 2014; Mandal et al. 2016). This is particularly
    relevant, for instance when siting boreholes for rural water supplies or humanitarian
    emergencies. Furthermore, field datasets sometimes provide spatially biased information,
    with significant amounts of data in some regions and virtually none in others
    (Diaz-Alcaide et al. 2017). As voids are typically left for automated interpolation
    to fill, this may lead to spurious results. In other words, this suggests that
    a study with a large number of low-quality variables or very disperse information
    may render a less accurate picture of a given region than another one using fewer
    parameters with very high resolution. Groundwater is context sensitive. A low-permeability
    formation may be considered an aquifer in a certain region because there is nothing
    else available, but may be disregarded in a neighbouring context where more permeable
    rocks occur. Moreover, flat areas with poorly developed drainage networks may
    be more prone to groundwater occurrence than hilly regions (Haghizadeh et al.
    2017; Martín-Loeches et al. 2018). In other words, the explanatory variables and
    the likelihood of groundwater occurrence must be determined based on the specific
    features of each setting. This explains why there is no universal scale of groundwater
    potentiality. Attempts have been made to standardize scores at the national scale;
    take for instance the cases of Burkina Faso, Uganda and New Zealand (DEP 1993;
    MWE 2012; Tschritter et al. 2017). Such efforts make sense in national contexts
    because they allow managers to compare groundwater potential across more or less
    similar regions, but may become impractical at the continental or global scales
    due to the variability of geographical, geological and climatic contexts. On a
    final note, there may be some margin to extend the number of variables involved
    in RS-based groundwater exploration. Since the vast majority of the literature
    deals with dry and tropical climates, the existing approaches are heavily geared
    towards these geographical domains. This is reasonable in view of the distribution
    of the world’s population. However, from a methodological standpoint, it also
    means that the role of certain variables that could be relevant in colder settings
    such as snow-related factors, has seldom been discussed (Han and Nelson 2015).
    Conclusions This paper has provided an updated overview of groundwater potential
    methods based on a thorough review of the more recent literature. The large number
    of academic papers published in the last decade attests both to the practical
    value of the technique and to the need to improve our knowledge of groundwater
    resources in a rapidly changing world. Groundwater potential mapping is time-
    and cost-effective, and provides a practical way to integrate multiple data sources
    to delineate those areas which are more favourable for groundwater development.
    This represents a particularly important advantage in remote regions, where obtaining
    exhaustive field work may be impossible. However, groundwater potential maps cannot
    be interpreted as a low-cost substitute for field surveys, as there are many aspects
    of groundwater occurrence that are not easily captured on cartographic support.
    Due to the widespread availability of RS/GIS technologies, as well as to the relatively
    small number of parameters involved, developing a groundwater potential map today
    is well within the reach of most hydrogeologists. Unfortunately, however, only
    a minority of the groundwater potential maps found in the literature have been
    adequately checked against ground truth. In this context, the main challenge ahead
    lies in developing high-quality maps that may be used to inform water policy.
    Because this should be preferably done in the context of validated outcomes, it
    is contended that academic groundwater potential studies should always be labelled
    either as “preliminary” or “validated”, in order to prevent misinterpretations.
    Furthermore, it may often make sense to refer groundwater potential maps to the
    use for which they have been developed. This is because different uses (i.e. drinking,
    irrigation) present different water quantity and quality requirements. From the
    methodological standpoint, the advent of machine-learning techniques represents
    an exciting development for the near future. In particular, the potential advantages
    of combining human experience with such approaches are enormous. In the authors’
    view, this can only result in more accurate mapping as these become increasingly
    widespread. References Abdalla F (2012) Mapping of groundwater prospective zones

    Metrics Abstract: A rise in the population has immensely increased the pressure
    on the agriculture sector. With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing
    a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of
    Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of the agriculture
    sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring of the farms
    paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions, academicians,
    and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice and execution
    of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for serving mankind.
    The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions. Inclusion of IoT,
    along with cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can
    provide sufficient scope to predict, process, and analyze the situations and improve
    the activities in the real-time scenario. The concept of heterogeneity and interoperability
    of the devices by providing flexible, scalable, and durable methods, models are
    also opening new domains in this field. Therefore, this paper contributes towards
    the recent IoT technologies in the agriculture sector, along with the development
    of hardware and software systems. The public and private sector projects and startup''s
    started all over the globe to provide smart and sustainable solutions in precision
    agriculture are also discussed. The current scenario, applications, research potential,
    limitations, and future aspects are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of
    IoT a precision farming framework is also proposed in this article. A graphical

    term ‘Agriculture’ is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’
    means ‘Cultivation’. It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one
    of the benchmark areas. This field is the withstander of the economies of various
    nations. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), more than 60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival
    and around 12% of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted
    by FAO, the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year
    2025 and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of
    this data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of
    70% in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is
    also the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based
    fertilizers, biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations,
    the agriculture sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution
    in the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture

    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7
    Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6. Sensors and their types.
    Show All SECTION IV. Related Work The advancement and role of the Internet of
    Things in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is
    being conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections. Various studies are performed and put forward by various
    academicians and authors concerning the evolution of agriculture relating to the
    incubation of the concepts of the Internet of Things. Kim et al. [64], reviewed
    different articles related to the induction of unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture.
    The authors highlighted the recent trends, controls, perspectives, and platforms
    of UAV for agriculture. The study focused on what are the different platforms
    used for UAV and how those platforms can be designed. The hardware components
    related to the design of UAVs were also discussed. Sensor types compatible with

    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios

    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.

    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness
    were considered and studied for model design. For digital communication between
    field and farm GSM module was used. Truong et al. [155], real-time data monitoring
    capable system was designed with IoT and cloud storage for disease detection and
    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,
    firstly the agriculture sector along with its challenges and economic importance
    is presented. The domain of IoT along with the communication technologies and
    goals, protocols, architectures are studied and put forward. The various IoT OS,
    their specifications and features with respect to agriculture are discussed. An
    analytic study of various articles in the field of agriculture is presented, highlighting
    their most focused sections and gaps or areas not addressed. The sensors based
    on their field of application are also discussed. A systematic review of different
    articles focusing especially on crop monitoring, irrigation, disease detection,
    and farm management is offered. The articles considered for study range from the
    time frame of the year 2015 to 2020. From the studies, certain issues are put
    forward that demand research and experimentation in the future. Various existing
    public and private sector platforms or start-ups which work for precision farming
    are also presented and discussed with their specifications and applications. Making
    precision farming a base, a layout of an IoT based architecture is proposed. The
    communication technologies and the hardware platforms of IoT are also discussed.
    The applications of IoT in agriculture are also discussed. The issues, challenges,
    and future research directions are also highlighted. As a whole, the in-depth
    description of various aspects of IoT for agriculture has been discussed and how
    these studies should be catered in a way to create efficient and smart agricultural
    scenarios. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

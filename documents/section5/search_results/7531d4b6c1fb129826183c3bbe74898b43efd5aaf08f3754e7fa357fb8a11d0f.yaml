    Copy Abstract Development of agriculture in Russia and Belarus is based on the
    practical implementation of "smart" systems in agriculture based on the use of
    modern wireless, intelligent technologies and Internet of Things. This review
    presents research articles (mainly, in Russian) published in the period of 2013
    – 2022 on the use of cloud technologies and Internet of Things for the development
    of agriculture in Russia and Belarus. An analysis of the use of cloud technologies
    and Internet of Things in the modern world is given on the basis of research articles
    and reviews published in English in the period of 2017 – 2022. The main directions
    of digitalization of modern agriculture are listed. The uses of cloud technologies
    and Internet of Things in agriculture are described along with promising directions
    for further research and applications. Keywords modern agriculture; smart farming;
    cloud computing; internet of things; survey Subject Biology and Life Sciences,

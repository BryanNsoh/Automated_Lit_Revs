    \ to the ongoing domestic and international\nlockdown for COVID-19. Many have\
    \ already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the\nCorona era.\
    \ Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and\
    \ agriculture,\nthere are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The\
    \ roles of modern technology, the\nInternet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic\nprosperity in the post-COVID-19\
    \ economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by\n2050 to meet global\
    \ food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic\n\
    and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving\
    \ food production\nand distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and\
    \ addressing the double burden of\nmalnutrition. As the world’s population is\
    \ growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s\npopulation reaches 9.6\
    \ billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,\n\
    technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced.\
    \ The urban\nsmart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production,\
    \ which can be introduced at\nany adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in\
    \ vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the\
    \ concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity\nas well as\
    \ its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and\
    \ beneﬁts. This\nreview has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations\
    \ in the development of the\nsystem, vertical farming management, and modern technologies\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: automation; smart vertical farming; sensors; Internet of\
    \ Things; urban farming\n1. Introduction\nIn the 21st century, urbanization will\
    \ be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion\nby 2050. 67.2% or 6.5\
    \ billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this\ngrowing,\
    \ increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand\n\
    needs to rise by 70% [2,3]. Rapid changes in urban built-up areas and skylines\
    \ in providing\nbuildings and infrastructures to cater to the city center’s larger\
    \ population have altered the\nurban climate into unhealthy living conditions.\
    \ This situation threatens the demand for\nthe basic needs of urban dwellers for\
    \ a livable urban living environment. Furthermore, a\nlarger urban population\
    \ also demands a fresh and good quality food supply [4]. Urban\nsmart vertical\
    \ farming (USVF) is one of the potential solutions to help societies meet this\n\
    elevated demand without additional farmland [5–7]. Figure 1 shows the statistical\
    \ data\nabout the use of vertical farming (VF) market in the world 2019 and 2025\
    \ respectively. In\nrecent years, the global VF market has been increasing steadily\
    \ as population sizes grow\nand urban living becomes more common in urban cities.\
    \ The VF industry reached some\n$4.4 billion in 2019, but the market size is estimated\
    \ to rise to $15.7 billion by 2025. The\nopportunity to utilize vertical space\

    \ to provide an ideal environment\nfor the crop chosen.\nNowadays, automation\
    \ plays a vital role in every ﬁeld of life. Some examples are\nmanufacturing,\
    \ transportation, agriculture, utilities, defense, facility operation [16,17].\
    \ The\nbeneﬁts of automation can be applied in water and wastewater, oil and gas,\
    \ electric power\nand telecommunication systems. Automation is generally used\
    \ in many ﬁelds because it\nreduces human effort, is easy to handle, and is more\
    \ effective and efﬁcient. By the name of\nagriculture, farm automation can automate\
    \ most of the agriculture ﬁelds’ processes, such\nas controlling watering systems\
    \ or ﬂow control and moisture control [18,19]. Similarly, it\ncan build a robot/drone\
    \ for spraying pesticides and plowing [20]. Harvesting machinery\nis also used\
    \ for such purposes: a user-friendly farm automation system, easy user control\n\
    for a layman, control water, plant health condition, and crop production [21].\n\
    In terms of human health, the World Health Organization estimates that more than\n\
    half of the world’s farms still use untreated animal waste as fertilizer, which\
    \ attracts ﬂies\nand may contain weed seeds or diseases that can be transmitted\
    \ to plants. VF has the ability\nto produce crops throughout the year, with greater\
    \ control over food safety and biosecurity,\nwhile also lowering inputs such as\
    \ water, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers [7]. Food\nprotection is a major\
    \ concern of our day, as there have been several incidents of events\naround the\
    \ world resulting in food recalls due to bacterial infectious diseases, resulting\n\
    in billion-dollar losses. After the crop has been picked, the washing of ﬁeld-grown\
    \ items\nposes a further risk of infection from various bacteria and pathogens.\
    \ This stage, on the\nother hand, has the potential to contaminate the entire\
    \ manufacturing process [22]. While\nthe whole world is badly affected by COVID-19,\
    \ the terrible clutches of natural disasters\nstill plague many people worldwide.\
    \ All scientists’ projections show that the number and\nseverity of climate-related\
    \ disasters are increasing due to climate change, which is cutting\noff the COVID\

    \ the features of the 21st century will be deforestation,\nbiodiversity loss,\
    \ climate chaos, and global epidemics; COVID-19 might be the latest\nmanifestation\
    \ of this, which has pointed to the horrible meaning of ‘global economy crisis\n\
    emergency’. Since COVID-19 will have a long-term impact, now is the time to prepare\
    \ to\nintroduce USVF.\nUSVF should become an opportunity for urban dwellers to\
    \ producing their food,\ndespite the limited agricultural land in the city center.\
    \ Integration of any available potential\nspaces inside and outside the building\
    \ by adaptive reuse and retroﬁt as part of the urban\nfarming (UF) technology\
    \ should be taken seriously and fully utilized. The design should\nconsider less\
    \ human intervention in operation due to the hectic life of urbanites. An appli-\n\
    cation of the Internet of things (IoT) can be incorporated into monitoring and\
    \ controlling in\nthe USVF system [23,24]. Thus, the UF technology can have bigger\
    \ involvement and contri-\nbution of urban dwellers. Besides producing their foods,\
    \ it contributes to the improvement\nin a healthy living environment and on urban\
    \ microclimate. UF offers an once-in-a-lifetime\nchance to grow food on already\
    \ built soil, maximize domestic food production, and reduce\nfood travel distances.\n\
    This study will include an in-depth examination of the philosophy of USVF as a\
    \ means\nof enhancing efﬁciency, including its forms, topologies, technologies,\
    \ control structures,\nsocial acceptance, and beneﬁts. This review concentrated\
    \ on a variety of issues, challenges,\nand recommendations related to the system’s\
    \ growth, vertical farming management, and\nmodern technology approach. The importance\
    \ of USVF how it plays a vital role in the\neconomy serve as the starting point\
    \ for this review. As the world’s population is growing\nday by day, there is\
    \ a need to modify those orthodox agriculture methods to fulﬁll the\nincreasing\
    \ demand for food. This modiﬁcation can be done by automating the agriculture\n\
    farm. This idea of agriculture farm automation wants to control water consumption,\
    \ the\nmoisture level of soil and water ﬂow, topologies, technologies, control\
    \ systems, social\nacceptance and enables an agricultural business to be more\
    \ productive, efﬁcient and\nproﬁtable.\n2. Types, General Structure and Materials\
    \ of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through\
    \ which large quantities of food\ncrops and medicinal plants can be produced in\
    \ a very small space only with the help of\nadvanced technology [25].\n2.1. Types\
    \ of Vertical Farm\nVF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world\
    \ and each way is so\ntechnologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize\
    \ agriculture [26]. The following\nsection represents a few types of VF utilized\
    \ for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,\ndiversifying, and improving in the\
    \ future of agriculture [7].\n2.1.1. Hydroponics\nHydroponics is a system that\
    \ can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,\nthis system has gained\
    \ popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation\nbarring soil.\
    \ Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is\
    \ often\nirrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like\
    \ cocopeat and is\nfed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain\
    \ plant growth. Hydroponic\nstructures use 60–70% much less water than regular\
    \ conventional agriculture [28,29]. In\nthis method, the plant roots are immersed\
    \ in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant\ninstead of the soil, in\
    \ which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.\nFigure\
    \ 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF\n\
    provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive\
    \ use\nof water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried\
    \ out in urban\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n4 of 40\nareas. However, this paradigm\

    \ of soil which widely\nused in advanced greenhouses worldwide.\n2.3.2. Lighting\n\
    Lighting plays an important role in making food for a crop in VF [53]. In the\
    \ VF\nsystem, since the trees are one on top of the other, sunlight cannot reach\
    \ the trees in the\nmiddle of the day. However, to solve this problem, the trees\
    \ should be kept in a place\nwhere they get enough sunlight at the beginning of\
    \ the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The\nconventional light-emitting diode\
    \ (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,\nmaking an indoor agriculture\
    \ system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least\naround 50–60% [54,55].\
    \ The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure\nsodium, to overcome\
    \ such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors\nindicated\
    \ the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF\
    \ in\nterms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.\nPlants\
    \ require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a\nwavelength\
    \ of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural\n\
    light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would\
    \ assist plants\nin growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light\
    \ to produce a reddish purple\ncolor. The perfect color combination for plants\
    \ and vegetables has been determined to be\nblue and red. This composition is\
    \ ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination\nof 23% blue and 77%\
    \ red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].\n2.3.3. Solar PV\nSolar\
    \ PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such\
    \ as\nrooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar\
    \ which is available\nin the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts\
    \ up in the VF by photosynthetic\nactive radiation, and it is not enough Solar\
    \ power must be collected by a collection of\nmirrors from the city’s structures\
    \ to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].\nAs a result, VF is\
    \ looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.\n2.3.4.\
    \ Water\nIn agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The\
    \ use of agricultural\nwater makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The\
    \ study in [61] addressed a VF\ntechnology that requires 70% less water and the\
    \ amount of water required is also recyclable.\nHistorically, users of traditional\
    \ agricultural systems were expected to manually check the\nwater level in their\
    \ water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of\nwater, which\
    \ ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated\n\
    that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater\
    \ in\nthe smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the\
    \ authors indicated\nthrough the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70%\
    \ in VF, while the hydroponics\ntechnique still using 70% water. Water automation\
    \ systems can be used in VF technologies\nto reduce human effort and error. Additionally,\
    \ users can use an Android program to turn\non and off the water pump. This is\
    \ an effective and cost-effective method of minimizing\nwater waste and human\
    \ labor. Additionally, [62] addressed an integrated device built on\nan Android\
    \ application that controls and tests the water pump and water level in smart\n\
    farming (SF).\n3. Technologies in Smart Vertical Farming\nVF is a state-of-the-art\

    \ Arduino\nmicrocontroller, reducing fertilizers used in smart agriculture. The\
    \ authors also addressed\npH sensors to collect and monitor real data from different\
    \ soil of SF, which save to cloud\nserver. However, the unnecessary growth of\
    \ the plant in the agriculture farm does not\ngrow well for crops. Therefore,\
    \ to overcome such a problem, pH sensor plays a vital role\nin SF.\nSensor of\
    \ Electrical Conductivity\nThe electrical conductivity sensor is largely used\
    \ in SF to measure the soil solute\nconcentration [87,88]. However, there are\
    \ still some limitations to use it properly in the SF.\nIn [88], the authors addressed\
    \ the soil contains some water and salt that harmful to grow\nup crops, which\
    \ can measure using an electrical conductivity sensor based on Faraday’s\nlaw.\
    \ The study in [89] showed an electrical conductivity sensor used to overcome\
    \ soil\nlimitations, such as measuring soil pore water, reducing cost and saving\
    \ working time.\nTemperature Sensor\nUsually, temperature sensors are used to\
    \ measure soil temperature in the farm\nplant [90,91]. The work in [90] indicated\
    \ the importance of plant growth based on tem-\nperature control processes such\
    \ as photosynthesis, transpiration, absorption. In [92], the\nauthors proposed\
    \ an aeroponic system in agriculture, which indicated plant growth and\ndevelopment\
    \ through temperature. Therefore, the temperature sensor plays an important\n\
    role to measure soil temperature, which increases the efﬁciency of plant growth\
    \ and more\ncrops.\nElectromagnetic Sensor\nElectromagnetic sensors calculate\
    \ the potential of soil particles to conduct or produce\nelectrical charge using\
    \ electric circuits [73,93]. As these sensors are used, the soil is now an\nelectromagnetic\
    \ loop, and any changes in local conditions have an instant impact on the\noutput\
    \ captured by a data acquisition system. In [93], the authors indicated electromagnetic\n\
    sensors for soil measure have become smaller, more rugged, faster, more accurate,\
    \ more\nenergy-efﬁcient, wireless, and smarter.\n3.3. Smartphone Sensor Technologies\
    \ in Smart Farming\nTelecommunications advances are allowing the rapid and more\
    \ reliable delivery of\nsensed data on a global scale. A sensor is a device that\
    \ detects and reacts to an electri-\ncal signal. Traditional phone sensing systems\
    \ need additional infrastructure, which is\nunaffordable to the majority of consumers.\
    \ Smartphones have advanced at a breakneck\npace in recent years, and they have\
    \ evolved into an integral part of everyday life. The\nsensors embedded in them\
    \ allow a variety of mobile application, which are assisting and\ntransforming\
    \ our way of life. Mobile sensors technology can enhance UF by improving\nconnectivity,\
    \ increasing the ﬂow of information, ensuring traceability for large buyers, and\n\
    creating economic opportunities [94,95]. This section illustrates concepts of\
    \ mobile sensors\ntechnology in SF that are currently using in the smartphone\
    \ and comparison among several\nresearch outcomes.\nSensors are a tool that measures\
    \ a physical amount and converts to a signal which\ncan be read and utilized by\
    \ other devices. Most of the mobile sensors are equipped on\nsmartphones. Numerous\
    \ forms of sensors are available nowadays, and several common\nsmartphones include\
    \ accelerometers, GPS, illumination sensors, temperature sensors, gy-\nroscope,\
    \ and barometer. These sensors evolved into a high-quality database for tracking\n\
    many facets of a user’s everyday activities. Three types of sensors are installed\
    \ in smart-\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n13 of 40\nphones: motion sensors, ambient\
    \ sensors, and location sensors [94]. The following Table 1\nsummarizes and illustrates\
    \ a set of popular sensors found in today’s mainstream smart-\nphones. The ﬁrst\
    \ category, motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity\nsensors,\
    \ and rotational vector sensors, provides acceleration force and rotational force\
    \ mea-\nsurements. Environmental sensors, on the other hand, provide observations\
    \ of the ambient\nenvironment. This includes measuring the ambient air temperature\
    \ with a thermometer\nand the atmospheric pressure with a barometer, as well as\
    \ lighting with a photometer. Place\nsensors, on the other hand, provide information\
    \ about the physical location of the system.\nMagnetometers, GPS, and orientation\
    \ sensors are examples of location sensors [94].\nTable 1. Familiar smartphone\
    \ sensors. Reprinted from ref. [94].\nSensor/Detector\nExplaination\nUsage\nAccelerometer\n\

    \ device has been\nsubmerged in water.\nIdentiﬁes if a device has internal water\n\
    damage and can warn the user.\n3.3.1. Accelerometer Sensor\nAccelerometer sensors\
    \ are largely used in the SF to predict and assist with necessary\nmaintenance\
    \ [96,97]. The study reported in [96] presented accelerometer sensor plays an\n\
    important role in monitoring the conventional use of equipment in the SF. In [98],\
    \ the\nauthors indicated accelerometer sensors detect running components or motor’s\
    \ health\nconditions through motion, speed, vibration inconsistencies. Therefore,\
    \ users can easily\ntrack the component health condition using an android application\
    \ in SF.\n3.3.2. Gyroscope Sensor\nA gyroscope is a system that uses the theory\
    \ of conservation of angular momentum\nto determine or retain orientation. Nowadays,\
    \ gyroscope sensors are used in a variety of\nareas, including science ﬁction\
    \ and mobile devices [94,99]. In [94], the authors indicated a\ngyroscope sensors\
    \ application to detect conventional equipment rotation in SF using an\nandroid\
    \ phone. However, the drawback of this gyroscope sensors application in smart\
    \ VF\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n14 of 40\ndifﬁcult to implement in terms of\
    \ requiring a complex mathematical model to conducts a\nsignal.\n3.3.3. Light\
    \ Sensor\nThe term “smart agriculture techniques” refers to the practice of using\
    \ a sensor system\nto regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light\
    \ sensor is a semiconductor chip\nthat detects the presence or absence of light\
    \ and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,\nand phototransistors are all examples\
    \ of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial\nlighting as a suitable\
    \ option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy\nplant\
    \ in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF\
    \ fault\nﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the\
    \ fault and On/OFF\nartiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android\
    \ phone application which reduces\nthe human effort and optimize cost [102].\n\
    3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor\nBasically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to\
    \ measure the direction of the workers,\nsuch as walk forwards, walk backward,\
    \ run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the\nsensors by mobile phone which\
    \ help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have\na deeper, richer knowledge\
    \ about their farms [94].\n3.3.5. Proximity Sensor\nThe proximity sensors utilize\
    \ to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].\nIn [71], the authors\
    \ usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source\nmeasured\
    \ by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors\
    \ are\nutilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to\
    \ reduce human effort,\nmeasure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh\
    \ environmental conditions. How-\never, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect\
    \ only the metallic target, and the operation\nrange also limited.\n3.3.6. Humidity\
    \ Sensor\nNowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF\
    \ [104,105].\nThe work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role\
    \ in SF, such as tracking\nthe water level of plants, environmental monitoring,\
    \ which suitable time for proper crop\nselection. The authors also indicated the\
    \ humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at\nmeasure bio-interface. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges still occur for the awareness of capable\nand wide-scale manufacture\
    \ of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.\nIn [106], the\
    \ authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture\nfarming\
    \ by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic\n\
    structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback\
    \ of this\nmetal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a\
    \ narrow sensing range.\n3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor\nThe carbon-based sensor has\
    \ many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The\ncarbon-based structures\
    \ used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-\nmond (ND),\
    \ fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,\n\
    mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,\n\
    and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described\
    \ in [107],\nexhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized.\
    \ Carbon nanostructures\nhave grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due\
    \ to their promising structure,\nwhich enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation.\
    \ The high surface-to-volume ratio and\nhollow composition make this material\
    \ suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The\nidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),\ncarbon monoxide (CO),\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and\nmethane, is\
    \ one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n15 of 40\nThe special properties of nanomaterials,\
    \ such as their compact scale, large surface area, and\nreactivity, make them\
    \ ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily\nused in\
    \ agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor\n\
    diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation\n\
    of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption\
    \ and\ndegradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants\
    \ from\nsamples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary\
    \ to remove toxins\nfrom various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary\
    \ to control pollution\nlevels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create\
    \ novel, highly effective biochemi-\ncal sensors for the detection of chemical\
    \ compounds at extremely low concentrations in\na variety of environments. In\
    \ [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials\nwill account for\
    \ 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives\n\
    and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy,\
    \ and this\nsection will highlight some interesting methods.\n3.4. Sensors Technology\
    \ in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops\nThe proper growth of\
    \ plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart\nVF. The\
    \ economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,\n\
    there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants,\
    \ such as crop life,\nnutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113].\
    \ Therefore, monitoring the\nhealth condition of each plant of agriculture farming\
    \ is essential [114]. Therefore, different\ntypes of sensors utilize to overcome\
    \ such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of\nthe method used for crop\
    \ health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model\nsensors in\
    \ SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application\
    \ in\nSF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy,\
    \ monitoring\nand detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of\
    \ crop and tracking leaf\ndamage from the insect.\nTable 2. Review of methods\

    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n17 of 40\nIn [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot\
    \ SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30\nsensors in farming applications because of cheap,\
    \ easy to manage, and potential versatility\nto count faster crop damage accuracy.\
    \ The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL\nT2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors\
    \ in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop\ngrowth. However,\
    \ these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not\nperforming\
    \ well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable\n\
    lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum\n\
    cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in\
    \ SF\napplications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments\
    \ with\nstrong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable\
    \ for VF applications.\nThe study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution\
    \ and Raspberry Pi camera sensors\nin agriculture applications to diagnose the\
    \ nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from\ninsects. It is suitable in VF\
    \ terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous\nact without\
    \ damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance\n\
    sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant\
    \ growth. The\nsensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust\
    \ real data in a short time,\nand strong controlling capability. In [125,137],\
    \ the authors reported an inverted microscope\nand plant village sensors in SF\
    \ application to automatically monitor health conditions in\nplants, which is\
    \ easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors\nin [138–140]\
    \ reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam\nsensors in\
    \ agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment\n\
    and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy\n\
    required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore,\
    \ to\novercome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.\nThe study\
    \ in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture\napplication\
    \ for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically\n\
    in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency\
    \ still\nvery poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216,\
    \ and MV-\nVDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops\
    \ such as apple,\ncarrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high\
    \ efﬁciency, low cost, and high\nprecision for the overall system compared to\
    \ conventional methods. However, the main\nlimitations are its monitoring accuracy,\
    \ such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of\ncrops. In [129,131,132],\
    \ the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and\nSONY DSC-W530 sensors\
    \ in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,\npotatoes.\
    \ Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large\n\
    accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed\
    \ an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with geolocation, a UAV platform equipped,\
    \ quadrotor\nUAV-RGB, senseFly eBee with RGB and CIR sensors in agriculture application\
    \ to detect\nheight, biomass automatically of crop plants. Therefore, the main\
    \ advantage of such sensors\nin SF is that they are stable, perform well, have\
    \ small defects, are easy to adapt to new\ntechnology, and they have a simple\

    4. IoT Framework on Smart Farming\nWith the development of technology and knowledge-science,\
    \ human thought-\nconsciousness is developing. As a result, everything is changing.\
    \ The revolutionary\ndevelopment of life and human thought in the world over the\
    \ last few decades is far more\nexemplary than the changes in the previous few\
    \ centuries. The transformation of the\nagricultural sector, like all other sectors,\
    \ is much more pronounced. Information-driven\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n19\
    \ of 40\nadvances, when all is said in done, are rapidly progressing with the\
    \ improvement of the IoT\nand may turn into a signiﬁcant piece of things to come\
    \ of farming [146–148]. All modern\nmethods are now being followed to ensure more\
    \ production on less land to meet the needs\nof the age, for example, IoT technology\
    \ in USVF. In [149–151], the authors proposed an IoT\na very modern technology\
    \ in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as\nlacking water,\
    \ crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such\n\
    issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling\
    \ the\natmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study\
    \ also indicated\nIoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop\
    \ production.\nFigure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF\

    \ layer [154–156]. The physical layer\nof SF is consists of various types of components\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, controllers,\nswitches, network gateways, routers,\
    \ etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer\nwhich plays an important\
    \ role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well\nas other operations\
    \ of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is\ncapable\
    \ of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in\
    \ VF.\nThe network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which\
    \ is important for\nsending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application\
    \ layer. The network\nlayer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces\
    \ for associating the weeding\nmachine, food harvester, and for correspondence\
    \ of machines and sensors with cloud\nframeworks. However, the challenge of the\
    \ network layer in SF where IoT generated a\nhuge amount of data is not only the\
    \ reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction\nof network efﬁciency\
    \ [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to\nboost IoT\
    \ security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware\
    \ acts\nas device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability,\
    \ and surveillance\nrelevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization\
    \ layer and network\nlayer which are capable of handling information and gives\
    \ a combination for connection\nbetween these layers. However, the middleware\
    \ layer includes safe and sensitive data\nstorage, and data transfer over wireless\
    \ is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT\ncloud support service layer assumes\
    \ a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) to\
    \ farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,\ncrop\
    \ health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are\
    \ cleared to\nencourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation\
    \ [21,68,161]. The\nanalytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for\
    \ crop production investigation\nyield efﬁciency based on environment condition.\
    \ Another sensor-based IoT system for\nthe analytics layer was presented in [162],\
    \ which ensures crop implement fragmentation,\ncompression, and a reassembly mechanism.\
    \ However, the main drawback of the analytics\nlayer in SF since its direct use\
    \ on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The\nuser experience\
    \ layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such\nas\
    \ crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation.\
    \ IoT plays\na vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall\
    \ situation of VF yield\ncondition by different sensors. However, the main challenges\
    \ still most of the IoT sensors\npower by the battery. Therefore, to overcome\
    \ these issues, energy harvesting technology\ncan be utilized to replace batteries.\n\

    The DHT11 sensor farmers can monitor time-to-time insects in the plant leaf, measure\
    \ temperature, soil, humanity, and claimed from\ntheir home through this sensor\
    \ which is very helpful in remote areas.\nPiezoelectric buzzer\n[193]\nA piezoelectric\
    \ buzzer is one kind of sensor when sound is appalled, and it produces voltage.\
    \ They are utilized in many ﬁelds such as\nenergy harvesting, low power sensors,\
    \ and also SF. Its application in SF to run low-power sensors reduces the dependency\
    \ on the battery.\nElectronic speed control\n[21,194]\nConventional electronic\
    \ speed controllers in farming control room temperature, motor speed and regulate\
    \ the motor voltage. Using this\ndevice in modern farming plays an important role\
    \ in terms of its large energy efﬁciency, less pollution, stability.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n27 of 40\nAgriculture operates somewhat differently today than\
    \ it did a few decades before,\nprimarily due to technical advancements such as\
    \ sensors, processors, robots, and informa-\ntion technology. Agriculture now\
    \ routinely makes use of emerging technology, including\nrobotics, temperature\
    \ and moisture sensors, aerial photography, and GPS. These advanced\ntechnologies,\
    \ precision agriculture, and robotic systems allow businesses to operate more\n\
    proﬁtably, efﬁciently, safely, and sustainably. The primary objective of the Internet\
    \ of things\nis to create a vast network by integrating various sensor devices\
    \ such as GPS, remote\nsensing (RS), radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), laser\
    \ scanners, and networks in or-\nder to comprehend the knowledge exchange of global\
    \ things. IoT can refer to millions\nof networked embedded smart devices capable\
    \ of accumulating data about themselves,\ntheir world, and other connected smart\
    \ devices and linking this data to other devices and\nsystems through the ubiquitous\
    \ Internet [195].\nAmbient daylight, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and humidity\
    \ are all control-\nlable parameters of vertical farming. In addition to the vertical\
    \ columns, the ambient\nparameters must be controlled for each stack, necessitating\
    \ the use of a separate collection\nof sensors for each vertical stack. These\
    \ sensors produce a large amount of data, necessitat-\ning the use of an effective\
    \ data management system. Numerous automation techniques\nare used to maximize\
    \ resource use, including the integration of actuation by automated\nirrigation\
    \ systems, as well as wireless monitoring via IoT in the VF, which is capable\
    \ of\nmanaging sensor data effectively, identifying duplicate sensor readings,\
    \ and visualizing it\nthrough web-based applications.\n4.5. Secure Cloud on Smart\
    \ Vertical Farming System\nThe growth of a country’s population and massive industrial\
    \ development, mainly in\nurban areas, lead to a variety of urbanization problems,\
    \ including housing, food demands,\nschooling, health, and poverty. A new farming\
    \ technique that utilizes minimal land\narea while producing a large crop with\
    \ a secure aspect is highly desired. In [196], the\nauthors addressed a two-factor\
    \ authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security\nmeasures. Since\
    \ the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system\ncommunicates\
    \ over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this\nhydroponic\
    \ system would be installed inside the user’s house, this electronic gadget\n\
    will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer\
    \ to the\nInternet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility\
    \ of data leakage\nand sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system\
    \ through access codes\ngenerated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application\
    \ for access veriﬁcation.\nFigure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart\
    \ using a 2FA mechanism. It starts\nwith the device module’s controller demanding\
    \ permission to send and receive data over\nthe network via the ThingsSentral-based\
    \ web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based\nIoT device network founded\
    \ by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,\nprogram, and portal\
    \ access code to the TS web service, the controller initiates the ﬁrst\nauthentication\
    \ order. If the codes are valid, TS will send another authentication order.\n\
    The second authentication process generates a request for veriﬁcation and notiﬁcation\
    \ to\nthe customer with a phone app that they must authenticate a request before\
    \ the farming\nmodule can continue operating. The user will authenticate the order\
    \ if approved, at which\npoint TS will allow the remainder of the procedure before\
    \ the controller explicitly stops\nit. If the customer fails to authenticate,\
    \ the whole system is aborted, and the hydroponics\nmodule controller is informed\
    \ of the request’s denial.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n28 of 40\nElectronics\

    \ of Urban Farming\nThe study in [197] addressed as far as a social responsibility\
    \ of USVF contributes more\nin terms of reducing pollution, produce clean air\
    \ and fresh food without using artiﬁcial\nfertilizer. The authors in [198] indicated\
    \ USVF totally brings new technology to produce\nmore food using less water, without\
    \ soil which falls a very good impact on society. In [199],\nthe authors reviewed\
    \ 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity\nin an urban\
    \ area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over\n\
    80% of the occupants favored VF on the rooftop of the building in terms of sufﬁcient\
    \ light\nfacility, clean air, low pollution, environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts,\
    \ fresh food, easy to\nmonitor, simple maintenance, etc. Moreover, the greater\
    \ part of the respondents was eager\nto purchase agricultural items. The study\
    \ also reported in [199] presented a lack of food\ninsecurity produced from VF\
    \ of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban\nareas. The work\
    \ in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared\nwith\
    \ the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the\
    \ effect of\nrising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop\
    \ a seven-story building\nin Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt.\
    \ In [202], the authors measured the\npollution level, crop production costs,\
    \ and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.\nTherefore, a USVF is\
    \ required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,\nsufﬁcient\
    \ food production, various type of crop production all season.\nAdvantages of\
    \ Urban Smart Vertical Farming\nDue to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced\
    \ to achieve food security in\nan urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in\
    \ expanding crop production and adding\nto maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of\
    \ rising food inside the urban area can be helpful\necologically, socially, and\
    \ monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety\nworldwide\
    \ [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise\n\
    aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for\
    \ the future,\nconservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality\
    \ produce, and halting mass\nextinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed\
    \ that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing\npolluted carbon-di-oxide from the air\
    \ and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,\nenvironmentally friendly,\
    \ helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it\nhas a fair\
    \ weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses\
    \ in\nthe city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air\
    \ ﬁltration by absorbing\ndust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed\
    \ beneﬁts of these USVF include\nprotection from weather-related problems, utilize\
    \ technologies and devices, helps in air\nﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round\
    \ production, huge food production within a small\narea of land.\nIn [206], the\
    \ authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-\n\
    ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure\
    \ from\na weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods\
    \ year-round.\nThe study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables,\
    \ strawberries can\nproduce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms\
    \ of crops could be sold in\nthe same infrastructures, they will not need to be\
    \ transported between production and sale.\nTherefore, USVF provides less spoilage,\
    \ reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than\nconventional farming encounters.\
    \ The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate\nand make a new job opportunity\
    \ for urban people who have less education and low expe-\nrience. The study reported\
    \ in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop\nproduction, such\
    \ as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,\n\
    manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth.\
    \ The authors\nalso indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production,\
    \ which can save 50%\nlesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The\
    \ study in [44] also reported\ndelivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable\
    \ and farmers do not need much focus\non soil and plant during growing.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n30 of 40\nBringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely\
    \ improves the quality of the\nurban environment, which is the main goal of urban\
    \ VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also\nexpected to provide environmental beneﬁts\
    \ to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban\nthermal performance and air quality\
    \ reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling\nloads. Despite providing\
    \ food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a\nconducive\
    \ and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such\n\
    as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to\
    \ marketability\nwith high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact\
    \ on the application of UF\nin the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and\
    \ effective extension services based on\nthe needs of all classes of growers so\
    \ that they can make the best use of their resources and\ncontribute to sustainable\
    \ agricultural and socio-economic development.\n6. Issues and Challenges\nVF technology\
    \ plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of\nthe\
    \ world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges\n\
    due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy\
    \ reliance and\nutilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented\
    \ in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],\nthe authors reported VF technology would be gradually\
    \ becoming a non-proﬁt industry if\nnot focus on addressing the current issues\
    \ such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a\nresult, current farming is heading\
    \ for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack\nof signiﬁcant\
    \ response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs\n\
    and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment,\
    \ smart\ntechnology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem\
    \ to be viable enough\nto meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop\
    \ production is considered to be\nvery risky due to the prevalence of diseases\
    \ and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.\nOther than that, equipment location,\
    \ space, and environmental issues have to be taken\nseriously depending on VF’s\
    \ design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape\nconsiderations such\
    \ as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as\nthe spacing\
    \ between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for\n\
    example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers\
    \ or fruit\nplants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their\
    \ heat management\ncharacteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated\
    \ by VF in order to minimize\nany possible adverse effect on development, while\
    \ allowing for adequate air circulation and\nventilation. It is crucial to keep\
    \ in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques\nmay be safer to eat\
    \ than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the\ngrowing\
    \ phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the\n\
    nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities\
    \ such\nas sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks.\
    \ Thus, food safety\nmanagement methods such as hazard analysis critical control\
    \ point analysis, as well as food\nsafety assessment and testing, are critical\
    \ in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.\n7. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\
    USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be\
    \ open\nto the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and\
    \ in turn use growing\nconvenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review\
    \ considers the diverse ways of\nhow a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and\
    \ built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The\ncontinuous ﬂow of real data accrued\
    \ from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF\nis analyzed, and suitable\
    \ actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only\na few are being\
    \ utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of\n\
    smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.\n\
    The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of the\nstate-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used\
    \ hardware, plat-\nforms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their\
    \ applicability to the proposed\nsolution. AI and image processing techniques\
    \ have become more prevalent in recent work\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n31 of\
    \ 40\nto develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications\
    \ for SF,\nthe most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements\
    \ in technical\napplications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple\
    \ sensors in networks\nquickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the\
    \ rapid growth of IoT projects,\nespecially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n\
    Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along\
    \ with\nthe various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable\
    \ for the research. This\npaper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology,\
    \ and hardware components\nsuitable for monitoring and controlling water level,\
    \ crop health condition, moisture of soil,\nproduction of yield and environment.\
    \ The paper has also focused on a comprehensive\nexplanation of USVF technologies,\
    \ monitor and control operation, smart automation,\nstructure, materials, social\
    \ acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.\nFinally, the\
    \ study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that\nreduces\
    \ human intervention to a minimum.\nThe review has proposed some signiﬁcant and\
    \ selective suggestions for the further\ntechnological developments of USVF based\
    \ on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint\nfrom the reviewed literature. Some\
    \ possible improvements have been addressed in this\nreview below:\n•\nFocusing\
    \ on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-\n\
    ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the\
    \ year,\nwith greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on\
    \ imported\nvegetables.\n•\nEnhance the user control panel for non-technical users\
    \ who use SF. As a result, it is\npreferable to develop a user-friendly interface\
    \ for powerful applications in a control\npanel and based on user experience.\n\
    •\nAppropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned\
    \ land\ncultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world.\
    \ Adequate\nstrategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address\
    \ this problem.\n•\nBy combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing,\
    \ a decision support\nframework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic\
    \ yield estimation in\ncrop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention,\
    \ and irregular growth.\n•\nRemote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must\
    \ be built in such a way that au-\ntomated planting machines can plate farmers\
    \ more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud\nmonitoring and remote multi-device visualization\
    \ have advanced to the point where\noperators/owners can track real-time manipulation.\n\
    •\nHaving a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to\
    \ improve\nthe farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of\
    \ the majority of IoT\nsystems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing\
    \ over a wide range of\nsensor data sources.\n•\nUse big data analytics to address\
    \ disease management problems across many crops\nand to create a consolidated\
    \ farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale\nagriculture.\n•\n\
    Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent\n\
    on big data analytics.\n•\nProvide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic\
    \ service for farmers.\n•\nAnalyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big\
    \ data modeling and a supply\nchain management framework.\n•\nAnalytics can provide\
    \ farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of\nagricultural products,\
    \ thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.\n•\nDevelop a\
    \ smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,\n\
    and time.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n32 of 40\n•\nCreate a warning system, as\
    \ most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer\nof critical events.\n\
    •\nEstablish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.\n\
    Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of\
    \ water\nand electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make\
    \ use of real-time\nweather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption\
    \ and prevent excessive\nirrigation.\n•\nDevice security is a critical issue.\
    \ Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to\nbolster the protection of the\
    \ affordable indoor hydroponic system.\n•\nAdditional research should be conducted\
    \ on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or\npH. Knowing how resistant plants\
    \ are too extreme pH levels enables device designers\nto create solutions that\
    \ handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.\n•\nDrone based pesticide sprayer can\
    \ be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and\nfertilizers to get better\
    \ quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the\nfarmers to spray\
    \ pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.\n•\nFor a smart storage\
    \ house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can\nautomatically\
    \ turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches\nthe temperature\
    \ danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is\nbetween 41\
    \ and 135 degrees for height.\n•\nFor water and food control for cattle, we can\
    \ use conveyor belts to automatically\nsupply food to cattle.\n•\nIncrease in\
    \ monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming\nsystem\
    \ to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.\n•\nWe can install a biogas\
    \ plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements\nand to fully use\
    \ the waste materials of cattle.\n•\nWe can also install a circuit to automatically\
    \ get the power meter reading and electricity\nbills on our cell phone and hence\
    \ get up to date about the power consumption of\nUSVF.\n•\nAtmospheric pollutants\
    \ due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect\non the plants,\
    \ therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution\nremoval\
    \ and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.\n\
    •\nfsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air\
    \ pol-\nlution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and\
    \ quantifying\npolluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO) based\nin [107,108].\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original draft preparation,\

    \ date\nAbstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a thriving technol-\nogy in almost\
    \ all ﬁelds of human life to make their lives easy.\nSmart Agriculture is one\
    \ of the IoT applications on which\nfarmers are widely switching to improve productivity\
    \ and re-\nduce labor costs. As IoT involves the Internet, data transmis-\nsion\
    \ technology creates the possibility of privacy/security\nbreaches concerning\
    \ users’ data. The cybercrime rate may\nalso increase in IoT-based agriculture\
    \ (IoTA). Thus there\nmust be ready concerning digital forensics in IoTA. Various\n\
    review articles are available regarding the emerging cyber\nattack, cybercrime,\
    \ and forensics challenges in IoT appli-\ncations like smart home, smart city,\
    \ smart healthcare, smart\ngrid, smart retail, smart supply chain management,\
    \ and smart\nagriculture, while a few review articles on IoTA security and\nforensic\
    \ challenges. This review paper is focused on IoTA\nsolutions and their security\
    \ and forensics challenges. The\nsystematic literature review method has been\
    \ used for this\nstudy which includes articles published from 2011 - 2021.\nThis\
    \ article has brought the limelight on IoT architecture\nand its application in\
    \ agricluture (IoTA) to emphasize on\nits introduction, architecture, challenges\
    \ and issues related\nemerging cybercrimes and digital forensics. At the end,\
    \ this\nreview paper discusses various challenges in securing IoTA\nsystems and\
    \ presents future directions for research.\n1 Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) refers to interconnected things. Karl\nSteinbuch, a German computer science\
    \ pioneer, said, \"In a\nfew decades, computers will be interwoven into almost\
    \ ev-\nery industrial product .\" IoT is frequently used in the do-\nmains like\
    \ healthcare, food and restaurant industry, travel\nand tourism industry and library\
    \ services, smart home, smart\nae-mail: santoshi.phdcs21@nfsu.ac.in\nbe-mail:\
    \ parag.rughani@nfsu.ac.in\ngrid, smart retail and smart agriculture [1] [2].\
    \ The IoT mar-\nket value projected to reach from 157 billion USD in 2016\nto\
    \ 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco predicted that by 2030,\n500 billion objects\
    \ would be connected and linked up to the\nInternet [3].\nFood Requirement will\
    \ increase by 70% more to supply\nfor an estimated population of 10.1 billion\
    \ by 2050, says the\nUN Food & Agriculture Report [4]. The volatility of food\n\
    prices, climate change and timely harvest forecasts are cru-\ncial to counteract,\
    \ which has a major impact on the economy\nand is closely linked to issues such\
    \ as malnutrition, and un-\ndernourishment, [5] [6] [7]. By 2050 the global population\n\
    of 9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding [8].\nTo deal with these\
    \ challenges and meet the need of future\nfood requirements. Agriculture 5.0 implies\
    \ that farms are\nfollowing Precision Agriculture principles and using equip-\n\
    ment that involves crewless operations and autonomous de-\ncision support systems\
    \ using the IoTA, robotics and AI [9].\nMany developed and developing counties\
    \ are widely using\nIoT based Agriculture (IoTA). It is observed that the 26.7%\n\
    global population and approximately 58% of the Indian pop-\nulation rely on agriculture\
    \ and farming to meet their liveli-\nhood. The Economic Survey of India 2020-21\
    \ report stated\nthat in FY20, the total food grain production was recorded at\n\
    296.65 million tonnes by India [10]. This high dependency\nmakes agriculture a\
    \ signiﬁcant factor in improving higher-\nyielding and better quality agriculture\
    \ and farming produc-\ntion. These higher-yielding and better quality requirements\n\
    are being taken with the help of technology. Many of the\ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries are transforming into\nIoTA.\nIoTA is a smart technique where the\
    \ researchers have\nbeen working on inventing tools and techniques for improv-\n\
    ing the production and quality in agriculture and farming.\nIn general, technologies\
    \ like GPS (Global Positioning Sys-\ntem), sensor networks and remote sensing\
    \ are used in IoTA\n2\n[11][12]. IoTA is helpful for various farm activities like\
    \ crop\nmonitoring, automated irrigation system, insect/pest moni-\ntoring, warehousing\
    \ of food, supply chain and smart farming\nsuch as livestock management, livestock\
    \ disease monitoring,\ndairy management [13]. Many IT organizations like Google,\n\
    Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel, Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE,\nHello Tractors, Farm\
    \ 2050 and Qualcomm are continuously\ndeveloping IoTA solutions that would have\
    \ a huge economic\nimpact [14]. The authors also estimate 2.7−6.2 trillion each\n\
    year, which will bring evolution in agriculture [15]. At present,\nmore than 26\
    \ billion smart devices are in circulation, while\na forecast says that this number\
    \ will triple within the coming\n5-6 years [16].\nThis paper presents a review\
    \ of different papers on IoT\ndevices supporting agricultural use, focusing on\
    \ the applica-\ntions, the emerging cyber attack and cyber crime (CACC)\nand Digital\
    \ Forensics (DF) challenges. With many farms\n(plant and livestock, small and\
    \ large) using automation and\nremote, networked sensors to monitor and manage\
    \ the op-\nerations, from watering and feeding, to growth and health\nmonitoring,\
    \ this is a sector that has not traditionally been as-\nsociated with high risks\
    \ of computer and network security\nproblems impacting their operation. And when\
    \ security is,\nat best, an afterthought, the enterprise can be at risk. Since\n\
    the number of IoTA solutions will rise, the number of crimes\non smart agriculture\
    \ may also increase soon. Sensitive data\nprocessed through IoTA could be a luring\
    \ means for hacking\ntargets by cyber criminals targeting the agricultural sector\n\
    for ﬁnancial gain, cyber warfare, activist/political purposes,\nor to obtain intellectual\
    \ property and technological advance-\nments. This study aims to review the work\
    \ done in the ﬁelds\nof IoTA based CACC and DF challenges as listed below.\n–\
    \ Introduction to IoTA\n– IoTA architecture\n– IoTA applications and IoTA solutions\n\
    – Existing vulnerabilities in IoTA\n– Existing and novel cyber crimes on IoTA\n\
    – DF challenges in IoTA.\nThe review article is organized in following way: Sec-\n\

    \ future research and\nchallenges in IoTA tools and techniques. This article is\
    \ con-\ncluded in Section 5.\n2 Review Selection Method\nIn this article, we have\
    \ followed the article selection method-\nology using the method Systematic Literature\
    \ Review (SLR)\nshows a representation in Fig 1. The ﬁrst step was to choose\n\
    reputed journals for selecting articles from there. The second\nphase of SLR was\
    \ the article published between 2011-2022.\nThe third step was to include articles\
    \ related to IoT/IOTA\nonly. The fourth phase was to check articles related to\
    \ IoTA\nor IoT architecture, security, CACC and DF challenges. All\nthe articles\
    \ fall in these categories that have been included\nin the systematic review.\
    \ The search focused on the scientiﬁc\nresearch publishers like Elsevier, IEEE\
    \ Xplore, Springer, Wi-\nley, MDPI, Inderscience, Taylor, Francis and UGC care-listed\n\
    journals. We considered the articles which were published\nbetween 2011 and 2021.\
    \ We have also considered a few\nwhitepapers, statistical survey papers and websites\
    \ to refer\nIoTA based tools. We have considered various IoTA relevant\nkeyword\
    \ search to ﬁnd relevant articles. The keywords were\n(\"Internet of Things\"\
    \ OR \"IoTA\" OR \"AIoT\" OR \"IoT based\nAgriculture Tools OR Appliance\" OR\
    \ \"Unmanned Ground\nVehicle (UGV)\" OR \"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\")\nAND\

    \ OR \"Smart Irrigation\" OR \"Automatic\nIrrigation\" OR \"Disease Monitoring-Detection\"\
    ) AND (\"Dig-\nital Forensic in IoT\" OR \"Challenges OR Issue in IoT\").\nIn\
    \ this SLR method, we could identiﬁed 111 articles\nfor the study. In these articles\
    \ 91 were journal papers, 12\nconference papers and 8 book chapters. We have referred\
    \ 3\nwhite papers and 10 websites additionally. The selected pa-\npers were analyzed,\
    \ considered and classiﬁed for IoTA and\nfarming applications of the method used\
    \ in this review for\narticle selection.\n3 IoT Based Agriculture (IoTA)\nIoTA\
    \ is an automated functioning system in which devices\ncommunicate over the Internet\
    \ and function according to the\nrequirements of the resources. The IoTA refers\
    \ to the usage\nof the Internet to connect sensors, Single Board Computer\n(SBC)\
    \ and servers. The Sensors sense the agriculture envi-\nronment status (plants,\
    \ crops, animals and their relative pa-\nrameters such as soil moisture, soil\
    \ nutrient ingredients, pest\nimages, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,\
    \ crop\nstatus, animal health and reproductive system). The sensed\ndata is to\
    \ be sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Ar-\nduino, Raspberry pi and others\
    \ decide according to set con-\nditioned values and update the agriculture status\
    \ using the\n3\nFig. 1: Review Article Selection Method\nInternet. IoTA is used\
    \ for increasing the quality and quan-\ntity of agriculture production so that\
    \ the agriculture can be\nmonitored or operated from remote places and the action\
    \ be\ntaken by IoTA as per the requirement of the plants and an-\nimals. It reduces\
    \ the monitoring and labor costs [17]. IoTA\nallows devices to operate automatically\
    \ so that the chores in\nagriculture can be monitored and controlled remotely.\
    \ IoTA\nis being adopted widely to reduce labor costs and improve\nproductivity.\
    \ IoTA applications can manage land, animals,\ncrops and farms without human intervention.\
    \ IoTA is also re-\nferred to as smart agriculture[18], precision agriculture\
    \ [19]\n[20], digital farming [21], smart farming[22] [23], digital\nagriculture\
    \ [24].\n4 IoTA Architecture\nIn general, there are ﬁve layers in IoTA architecture\
    \ i.e. ap-\nplication layer, middleware layer, network layer, edge layer,\nphysical\
    \ layer. The illustrated with the diagram as shown\nin Fig 2 IoTA architecture\
    \ with its basic components such\nas sensors, SBC, gateway, cloud and the Internet\
    \ [25] [26]\n[27].\nIn [28] by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\n\
    Telecommunication Standard Sector) had been supposed four\nlayered architecture\
    \ for holistic IoT. The ﬁrst is device layer\nwhich interacts with hardwares like\
    \ sensors, actuators, RFID\ntags and GPS in IoT. The second is network layer which\n\
    performs functions such as networking, communication and\ntransport. The third\
    \ layer is service and application support\nlayer and the topmost layer IoT application\
    \ layer, which\nmanages IoT applications.\nIn IoT World Forum 2014, [29] has presented\
    \ 7 layer\nbased IoT achitecture reference model by the combination\nof three\
    \ layered and ﬁve layered IoT architectures. The lay-\ners included are physical,\
    \ connectivity, edge computing, data\naccumulation, data absraction, application\
    \ and collaboration\nand processes. The physical layer manages things in IoT,\n\
    connectivity layer is resposible for communication and pro-\ncessing units. The\
    \ edge computing layer analyze data ele-\nment and transforms it. The data accumulation\
    \ layer works\nas a storage of data to be recived or sent. The abstraction\nlayer\
    \ performs aggregation and access of the data. The ap-\nplication layer controls,\
    \ performs analytics and presents re-\nport of the functionality of IoT regarding\
    \ present environ-\nment. The collaboration and process layer includes people\n\
    and business processes.\n[30] proposed a three layerd based IoTA architecture.\n\
    The authors adopted the concept of fog coputing and cloud\ncomputing in this architecture.\
    \ In which, the ﬁrst layer named\nas IoT layer includes IoTA devices such as sensors,\
    \ drones,\nSBC and actuators. The sensor measures the environmental\nvariables\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\nactivates the actuator to\
    \ perform respective function in the\nagriculture. Second is the fog layer where\
    \ IoTA devices are\nconnected with gateways by LoRaWAN or other network.\nThe\
    \ third layer is cloud layer which deals with API’s to man-\nage the data received\
    \ from the agricultral environment.\n[31] proposed four layer based IoTA architecture.\
    \ In this\nIoTA architecture, the perception layer is consists of phys-\nical\
    \ devices like sensor, actuators and microcontroller. The\nsensors fetch the data\
    \ of sensed agriculture environment and\nstored into the local server; Subsequently\
    \ after error anal-\nysis precised data is uploaded to the cloud. The network\n\
    layer performs abstraction of raw data recieved from the per-\nception layer and\
    \ trasnsmit on to the upper layers. The sen-\nsors are connected distinct communication\
    \ newtwork com-\nmunication technologies such as wireless networks like 4G,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee. The middleware layer provides\ninter-communication between\
    \ network layer and application\n4\nlayer. It also manages resourses and services\
    \ and performs\noperation the remote database. The application layer is re-\n\
    ceives data from middleware layer. It consists of interface\nmethods and communication\
    \ protocols such as MQTT, AMQL\nand CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts\
    \ it using soft-\nware internally and stores data on the local machine for fu-\n\
    ture use.\n[26], presented IoTA architecture where the 3 main layer\nare discussed.\
    \ Those layer are platform layer, edge layer and\ncommunication layer. The plateform\
    \ layer perform raw data\ncollection IoTA hardwares sensing by the agricultural\
    \ envi-\nronment. The edge layer performs decision making based on\ndata merging\
    \ and processing the sensors data. The commu-\nnication layer comunicates between\
    \ gateway and cloud.\n[32], discussed three layer based IoTA architecture. The\n\
    authors considered device layer, network layer and applica-\ntion layer. They\
    \ did not include middleware layer in their\narticle.\n[33] discussed two categories\
    \ of architecture based on\nholistic IoT applications. That IoT architectures\
    \ were three\nlayered and ﬁve layer according to different vendors of IoT.\nAuthor\
    \ raised the challenge of standarization issue of the\nIoTA architectures.\n[34]\
    \ discussed a common IoTA architecture. The archi-\ntecture consists of three\
    \ layers namely IoTA hardwares, com-\nmunication technologies and data processing\
    \ and storage.\nIoTA hardwares included sensors, actuators, embedded sys-\ntem\
    \ with processor, communication modules, memory, I/O\ninterfaces and battery power.\
    \ The authours have discussed\nvarious communication technoloies such as ZigBee,\
    \ Z-Wave,\n6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various parameters as li-\ncensed, transmission\
    \ distance, frequncy and data rate.\n[35] discussed drawbacks of tradional cloud\
    \ based archi-\ntecture and to overcome the drawbacks they proposed edge\nand\
    \ fog computing architecture for IoTA. The shortcom-\nings of existing system\
    \ were as high energy consumption\nduring agricultural data transfer from and\
    \ to the cloud and\nhigh network traﬁc. The proposed architecture reduces the\n\
    load over cloud layer which minimize the energy consump-\ntion, network traﬁc\
    \ and latency for IoTA applications and\nservices. The proposed architecture consists\
    \ of four layer\nsuch as IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer and cloud\nlayer.\
    \ The IoT sensor layer responsible for all IoTA har-\nwares deployment.The edge\
    \ layer performs computation of\nsensors/actuators data at the edge of the network.\
    \ The fog\nlayer is responsible for process and analyze complex data\nreceived\
    \ from IoTA sensors through edge layer. The cloud\nlayer provides higher scalibility\
    \ and on demand computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing.\n\
    [36] proposed user centrinc IoTA architecture which con-\nsists of three main\
    \ layers perception layer, communication\nlayer and control layer. The perception\
    \ layer is responsi-\nble for data aquisition via sensors. The communication layer\n\
    \ \nPhysical Layer\nSensor                      Actuator                     \

    \ the network. The control\nlayer works as a decision maker and performs analysis\
    \ of\nthe acquired data.\n[37] proposed IoTA architecture based on the holistic\n\
    IoTA architecture. This proposed architecture contains six\nlayers namely device\
    \ layer, network layer, session layer, ap-\nplication layer, cloud layer, business\
    \ layer. The business layer\nconsists of several business modules where the information\n\
    can be accessed as per the business nature.\nThe comparision in various IoTA architectures\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Table 1. This table includes total number of layers\nused\
    \ in IoTA, layers name and function of each layer.\nAfter the reviewing the previous\

    puter) and a gateway in the farm [38]. This layer senses and\ncollects agricultural\
    \ environment based speciﬁc data through\nsensor devices. Based on the speciﬁc\

    \ Layer [40].\nEdge Layer: The edge layer collects raw data from the\nphysical\
    \ layer and proceeds to the network layer based. It\nmerges sensor data and processes\
    \ it [26]. It enables the ac-\ntuators to what the conditioned value has been\
    \ set in the\nﬁrmware of IoTA. For instance, in a smart irrigation sys-\ntem,\
    \ the conditioned unit value for the soil moisture sensor\nis 1000; thus, if the\
    \ sensor provides less than 1000 soil mois-\nture values, the actuation will start.\
    \ Some of the commu-\nnication technologies namely 802.11*, Sigfox, LoRaWAN,\n\
    NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\nZ-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC used\
    \ in IoTA are categorised\nbased on distinct parameters like licenced spectrum,\
    \ trans-\nmission distance, type of network used, frequency, and data\nrate [41]\
    \ [38] [32] [42] [34]. The communication technol-\nogy allows the hardware (in\
    \ the physical layer such as sen-\nsors, actuators and the controller) to communicate\
    \ by wired\nor wireless medium [43]. According to[44], Low-Frequency\nCommunication\
    \ (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to a\nlack of infrastructure. However,\
    \ some prominent high com-\nmunication technology used in IoTA is IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Zensy\nWave, Long Term Evolution (LTE), LongRange (LoRa), Near\nField Communication\
    \ (NFC), Ultra-wideband (UWB) and\nothers. These communication technologies help\
    \ to commu-\nnicate hardwares like sensors, actuators in IoTA devices present\n\
    in the farm for are also commonly used in smart villages\nfor different applications\
    \ like postharvest management, cat-\ntle health monitoring and others.\nFog Layer:\
    \ Fog layer is a virtual cloud which recieves\ndata from edge layer and transmits\
    \ it to the upper layers. It\nprocess and analyze complex data received from IoTA\
    \ sen-\nsors through edge layer. It includes fog nodes like gateways,\nrouters,\
    \ entry points, distinct fog servers. The fog nodes sit-\nuates between end devices\
    \ and cloud data centers. This layer\nworks as a local cloud server.It provides\
    \ intra-networked\ncommunication for the IoTA system. By this means the IoTA\n\
    devices communcates through low frequencies and activates\nthe actuators. The\
    \ raw data collected from the sensors do not\nneed to travel frquently over the\
    \ Internet. Hence, the concept\nof fog layer overcomes the drawback like high\
    \ latency be-\ncause of real time control and mitigates security risk about\n\
    data transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone.\nThus, the compromisation\
    \ of the Internet will lead to com-\nplete obstruction IoTA system [30].\nApplication\
    \ Layer: Application layer consists of vari-\nous communication protocols such\
    \ as HTTP, MQTT, CoAP,\nAMQP and XMPP [45] [46]. This layer provides a graphical\n\
    user interface of the agricultural environment information\nprocessed by the Middleware\
    \ layer in encrypted form and in-\nternally decrypts this information using software,\
    \ thus stores\ndata for further use. The application layer monitors the agri-\n\
    cultural environment and suggests actions to be performed\nto get better throughput\
    \ using IoTA. The applications im-\nplemented by IoTA like smart crop monitoring,\
    \ smart irriga-\ntion, smart fertilizer/pesticides sprinkling, smart greenhouse\n\
    and livestock monitoring. The data is uploaded to the Cloud\nfor data warehousing\
    \ through these applications. Some of\nthe Cloud-based IoTA platforms are AgroCloud,\
    \ AT&T M2X\ncloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox,\nERMES, FIWARE,\
    \ freeboard, Google, GroveStream MACQU,\nMobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed,\
    \ SmartFarm-\nNET, ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx, Phytech\n[45][46].\n\
    Cloud Layer: The cloud layer works as a centerlised data\nstorage for the IoTA\
    \ system. It receives data through appli-\ncation layer from the fog layer and\
    \ stores it for long time us-\nage. It provides greater scalibility and on demand\
    \ computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing [35].\n5 IoTA\
    \ Applications\nThe IoTA applications have become very popular among\nfarmers\
    \ due to their efﬁciency and productivity. The IoTA\nsolutions are designed to\
    \ help farmers with time efﬁciency,\nimproved productivity and better monitoring\
    \ of daily agri-\ncultural tasks. Some of the sensors are soil moisture sen-\n\
    sor, temperature sensor, distance sensor, direction sensor,\nlivestock’s temperature\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, ultrasonic\nsensor, acoustic sensors, leaf sensors,\
    \ stem sensors and fruit\nsize sensor. These sensors have speciﬁc functionality\
    \ in IoT\napplications like identifying environment temperature, crop\nstatus,\
    \ soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and de-\ntection [14]. The IoTA\
    \ applications are classiﬁed into two\ncategories crop and livestock based applications.\
    \ Crop based\nIoTA applications are smart irrigation, frost protection, com-\n\
    post management, pest monitoring, pest controlling, weed\ndetection, chemical\
    \ control, seedbed preparation to reseed-\ning, yield analysis and mapping, arable\
    \ farming, spraying,\nvehicle and machinery control, crop assistant, weather con-\n\
    dition, soil quality, agricultural drones UAV, smart green-\nhouse. The applications\
    \ based on livestock management based\nare livestock monitoring, livestock identiﬁcation,\
    \ milking au-\ntomation technology, early disease detection, offspring man-\n\
    agement and care, smart poultry farming.\n[47] discussed the Niger research project\
    \ to highlight\nthe development of IoT-based smart city and smart village\nfor\
    \ the fulﬁllment of sustainable development goals (SDG-\n2030) 11 and 9 for revolution\
    \ through smart cities and smart\nvillages in Niger.\n[23] mainly focused on holistic\
    \ deﬁnitions of IoTA and\nits applications such as crop health, weeding and spraying,\n\
    planting sowing, seedbed preparation to reseeding, planting\nfrom the air, harvesting\
    \ from the ﬁeld, drones for a ﬁeld,\nyielding analysis and mapping.\n7\n[48] described\
    \ the types of agricultural UAV (Harvesting\nUAV, Spraying UAV, Mapping UAV, Sensing\
    \ UAV), includ-\ning their area of application in terms of seeding, planting\n\
    seed, monitoring, detecting weed, mapping, infestation and\nspraying pesticides/fertilizers,\
    \ forecasting and controlling.\n[49] have discussed IoTA applications that have\
    \ utilized\nmodern technologies like WSN, RFID, Cloud Computing\nand end-user\
    \ applications. These IoTA devices are found\nto be automotive, cost and time-efﬁcient\
    \ for the farmers.\nThe authors have also presented IoTA technologies and the\n\
    classiﬁcation of IoTA applications of monitoring activities.\nThe applications\
    \ are irrigation and water quality monitor-\ning, soil monitoring, weather monitoring,\
    \ farm monitoring),\ndisease and pest control, greenhouse production, automa-\n\
    tion and precision, agricultural machinery and crop manage-\nment with other applications\
    \ in smart farming as smart cat-\ntle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery,\
    \ smart aquaponics\nand smart beehive monitoring.\n[50] did a comprehensive study\
    \ about crop data man-\nagement in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular\n\
    analysis of various crop data management applications and\ntheir main features\
    \ based on parameters, namely software,\ncompany, headquarters and relevant features\
    \ .\n[13] discussed various solutions used in IoTA. Few of\nIoTA solutions are\
    \ water quality monitoring, farm land mon-\nitoring system, greenhouse envioronment\
    \ monitoring sys-\ntem, automated hydroponic system, smart mashrrom farm,\nsmart\
    \ vegitable storage, smart vineyard monitoring system\nand others. They compared\
    \ IoTA monitoring and control\nsystems based on parameters like a gateway, sensor\
    \ and ac-\ntuator, communication system, storage, user interface, ex-\nperiment\
    \ nature (outdoor/indoor), plant name/type, advan-\ntages of the existing system\
    \ and weaknesses in the current\nsystem.\n[46] did a thorough review of IoTA applications.\
    \ Based\non the usage, they classiﬁed IoTA applications into two types,\nIndoor\
    \ (i.e., crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic) and out-\ndoor (arable land, orchard).\
    \ Some other works include IoT\nbased smart greenhouse and precision farming applications\n\
    [51]. In Europe, there is ongoing work on IoTA based re-\nsearch projects [52].\
    \ The classiﬁcation of holistic IoTA ap-\nplications and various IoTA solutions\
    \ are tabulated Table 2\nrespectively.\nIn the few states of India like Orisa,\
    \ Madhya Pradesh\nfaced the problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this\n\
    situation, IoTA based alarming system has been designed.\nWhenever trespassing\
    \ of the elephants is observed, the smart\ncamera detects the suspected activity\
    \ and an alarming sys-\ntem is activated [53].\nIn the next section, we have specialized\
    \ in CACC and\nDF challenges and issues in the IoTA realms.\n6 Existing Emerging\
    \ Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crime\n(CACC) in IoTA\nCyber attack (CA) is a attack\
    \ based on pertaining to digi-\ntal devices and its nework to disturb distrupt\
    \ or destroy the\nservices of the system. The other aim be perform data theft\n\
    or malicious intension of the attackers. As the CA gets re-\nported into the police\
    \ is called as Cyber Crime (CC). CC is\nan unlawfull activity againsts making\
    \ subotage, disruption\nor harm pertaining to any digital device, network, data,\
    \ or\nany living being.\nA senior vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admit-\n\
    ted that cybercriminals have been looking for farming infor-\nmation.\nDue to\
    \ the interconnectivity of IoTA devices with the\ninternet, there are the possibility\
    \ of various CACC. The at-\ntackers could drive Sprout into a ditch or a hedge\
    \ or prevent\nit from working. In [2] [74], cyber-attack taxonomy included\nvectors,\
    \ viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, ad-\nware, zero-day vulnerability,\
    \ Stuxnet, exploit toolkit, Bot-\nnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing and\
    \ spooﬁng,\nside channel, DoS, DDoS, RFID based attacks. These cyber-\nattacks\
    \ have included case studies for IoT smart devices.\n[45] the authors covered\
    \ the simulation tools for the vulnera-\nbility assessment of holistic IoT devices,\
    \ i.e., Bevywise IoT\nSimulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon U-One, Simple IoT Simula-\n\
    tor, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. The authors suggested se-\ncurity measures and\
    \ precautions for the user only. They had\nemphasized cyber-attacks and security\
    \ measures as well.\nIoT has been emphasized greatly since the 90s, when it\n\
    was proposed as an idea of interconnecting different elec-\ntronic devices through\
    \ various technologies. However, dur-\ning the past decade, IoT has rapidly developed\
    \ without con-\nsidering the profound security goals and challenges involved.\n\
    Consequently, the IoTA will face various emerging CACC.\nAccording to Statista,\
    \ by 2025 there will be 75 billion IoT-\nconnected devices [75]. Due to the rapid\
    \ development, it im-\nplies that checking for the security and vulnerability\
    \ assess-\nment is impossible. The absence of a complete trust zone can\nbe detected\
    \ in the microcontrollers used for IoTA devices.\n[76], ForeScout IoT Enterprise\
    \ Risk Report clearly sug-\ngests that by 2018, two-thirds of enterprises will\
    \ experience\nIoT security breaches. It has captured a broader spectrum of\nthe\
    \ security vulnerabilities and attacks in IoT systems. Their\nclassiﬁcation is\
    \ unique compared to the other classiﬁcations\nas it divides the different attacks\
    \ into four distinct classes;\nPhysical, Network, Software, and Encryption attacks.\
    \ The\nsame statement is true for an IoTA system, where the IoTA\ndevices can\
    \ be attacked physically or at its network or to the\napplications. Similarly,\
    \ the attacks can be tried on encryp-\ntion schemes, as IoTA is implemented using\
    \ various existing\nnetwork technologies.\n8\nTable 2: IoTA Solutions and Techniques\n\

    \ emerging Cyber Attacks (CA) in\nIoTA based on each IoTA layer. The CA on the\
    \ physical\nlayer was autonomous system hijacking/disruption, irregular\nmeasurement,\
    \ node capturing and sleep deprivation. Edge\nlayer based attacks were forged\
    \ for control actuator, boot-\ning, ﬂooding and signature wrapping attack. The\
    \ network\nlayer attacks were DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing\nattacks,\
    \ signal disruption, Radiofrequency (RF) Jamming at-\ntacks, side-channel attacks,\
    \ malware injection, and Botnet\nattacks. An application layer based CA were phishing,\
    \ ma-\nlicious scripts, DoS, or DDoS. Cloud computing attacks and\ncyber terrorism\
    \ are other types of attacks have been dis-\ncussed.\n[78], covered network layer\
    \ based CA in IoTA. These\nattacks are replay attacks on Zigbee protocol that\
    \ can create\ndiﬁculties to implemnting other protocols. The smart farm,\nwhich\
    \ uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks like pass-\nword cracking and evil\
    \ twin access point, which allows at-\ntackers to get credentials by creating\
    \ a rogue access point.\nKey reinstallation attack, which exploits 4-way handshake\n\
    in WPA2, which was responsible for securing modern wiﬁ.\nARP spooﬁng attack where\
    \ an attacker fakes the MAC ad-\ndress of the gateway and convinces the victims\
    \ to send frames\nto the fake address except the destination address. DNS spoof-\n\
    ing attacks where the trafﬁc is directed to the fake website\ncause altered DNS\
    \ records.\n[79],discussed UAV oriented CA and its consequences.\nUAV is an automated\
    \ aerial vehicle IoTA system used for\ncrop monitoring, pesticides or chemical\
    \ sprinkling, etc. The\nCA is integrity exploitation of UAV or IoTA devices. The\n\
    consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole stand-\ning crop in the ﬁeld,\
    \ ﬂood the crop, and sprinkle the pesti-\ncides in excess quantity. If such attacks\
    \ are widely coordi-\nnated, they can take the place of agro-terrorism. The authors\n\
    discussed other UAV based CA, such as radio frequency\njamming, malicious code\
    \ injection, MITM, DoS/DDOS, ran-\nsomware attacks, etc. These attacks can tamper/modify\
    \ the\ncommunication devices.\n[80], [81], [82] [49] discussed emerging CA aspects\
    \ in\nIoTA system on the different levels such as physical secu-\nrity of devices\
    \ due to the harsh nature of climate and nat-\nural disaster in IoTA, emerging\
    \ cyber threats like endpoint\nattacks, phishing, third party attack, supply chain\
    \ attacks,\nransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart\ndevices.\
    \ They speciﬁed risks or dangers in terms of data\nbreaches, data integrity, privacy\
    \ breaches in business secrets,\nrisk of crypto-jacking, cyber-physical attacks,\
    \ state-sponsored\nattacks, highjacking, or threats to autonomous drones or trac-\n\
    tors.\n[83] described the several issues in IoTA caused by the\nInternet connectivity\
    \ for data processing and covered param-\neters based on CA in IoTA. In the IoTA\
    \ system, at the phys-\nical layer, the emerging CA such as unintentional physical\n\
    modiﬁcation in hardwired, temporary or permanent damage,\nautonomous system hijacking,\
    \ autonomous system disrup-\ntion, optical deformation, rough treatment, power\
    \ depletion\nof battery, sensor weakening as per the sensor aging, node\ncapturing,\
    \ adding a malicious node and sleep deprivation.\nIn sleep deprivation attack\
    \ there is draining the battery of\nthe smart devices. Network layer-based emerging\
    \ CA dis-\ncussed as DoS/DDoS, data transit attack, and routing attack.\nThe emerging\
    \ CA at the edge layer can be forged controls\nfor actuators, gateway-cloud request\
    \ forgery, forged mea-\nsure injection, booting, unauthorized access, MITM, signa-\n\
    ture wrapping, and ﬂooding. In the sequence, the concern-\ning CA in the application\
    \ layer is phishing, malicious script,\nDoS, and DDoS attacks. The author emphasized\
    \ the current\nstate of security in smart agriculture as the researcher and\n\
    developer leave default security features for the MQTT and\nCoAP since the researchers’\
    \ probability keeps it disabled.\nMoreover, IoT device manufacturers use IoTs\
    \ to keep them\ninvisible to the security feature, validation processes, col-\n\
    lecting, transferring, or storing phases or failure checks. This\npaper further\
    \ illustrates these invisible parameters for the in-\nvisible security features.\
    \ The authors also suggested a future\nenhancement in the perspective of better\
    \ security in smart\nagriculture and farming applications.\n[84] presented a literature\
    \ survey on CA pertaining to\ndistinct components of IoTA. They have discussed\
    \ attacks\nbased on hardwares like sensors, controllers, RFID tags. Few\nattacks\
    \ based on protocol such as RFID, NFC,bluetooth, wiﬁ,\nZigbee, 6loWPAN, and protocols\
    \ on application layer.\n[85], authors classiﬁed CA in IoTA based on the phys-\n\
    ical layer, network layer, middleware layer, and application\nlayer. The CA on\
    \ the physical layer is such a RF jamming,\nside-channel attack, which aims to\
    \ gather unauthorized in-\nformation regarding the implementation description\
    \ of the\nIoTA system using monitoring parameters of hardware like\nan electric\
    \ current or voltage [86]. Attacks on the network\nlayer are DoS, MITM, and cloud\
    \ computing attacks. At-\ntacks regarding data are data leakage, ransomware, cloud\n\
    data leakage, and misconﬁguration. Application layer based\nattacks are software\
    \ update based attacks such as malware\ninjection, buffer overﬂow and SQL injection.\
    \ Other attacks\nthey have covered are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which\n\
    refers to false data fabrication.\n[87], authors are concerned that exposure of\
    \ personnel’s\nprivate information, social engineering, cyber espionage, and\n\
    agroterrorism to any CA is a potentially severe threat that\nshould be seriously\
    \ and carefully considered.The possibil-\nity of cyber terrorism in the agriculture\
    \ sector is known as\nagroterrorism.\n[88], authors warn the cyber threat risk\
    \ in IoTA, for internet-\nbased automatic functional devices, like smart crop\
    \ sprayers,\ndrones, UAV in agriculture can be hacked.\n10\nCybercriminals are\
    \ looking to ruin the particular revenue\nbusiness, where agriculture plays a\
    \ very important role in\nrevenue generation for the individual and the country.\n\
    [89] homeland security of U.S. department mention the\nconcern potential cyber\
    \ threats and vulnerabilities in IoTA.\nTheir released report disscussed different\
    \ technologies in\nIoTA sucha as on farm device, location or remote sensing\n\
    technologies and machine learning. This report highlights\nhypothetical scenarios\
    \ pertaining to CACC. Likewise IoTA\nbased sensors could be the signaﬁcant cause\
    \ for CACC is-\nsues. A warning from the UK government and FBI states\nthat Cyber\
    \ criminals could exploit ﬂaws present in the IoTA\nhardware which were used to\
    \ plant and harvest crops, such\nas automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic\
    \ harvesters\nto disrupt the GDP growth, food production of the country\n[90].\
    \ According to an FBI report, CA in IoTA has slowed\ndown the agriculture processing\
    \ system and also interrupted\nthe email communication and website-based administration.\n\
    A cyber crime by disrupting process dairy facilities can quickly\nspoil the result.\
    \ FBI has released a list of cybercrime in agri-\nculture. Where the means of\
    \ cybercrime was a ransomware\nattack, where data was stolen and encrypted, and\
    \ criminals\ndemanded ransom, cyber actors may perceive cooperatives\nas lucrative\
    \ targets with a willingness to pay due to the time-\nsensitive role in agricultural\
    \ production. The goal could be\nto disrupt the seed and fertilizer supplies.\n\
    Various IoT based CACC has been already observed and\nsevere consequences had\
    \ faced by users. [91], the Mirai bot-\nnet in 2016 is an example of DDoS attack\
    \ which was launched\non IoT devices in smart home on a large scale. Similar CA\n\
    are possible in the context of IOTA. The consequences of\nsuch attack can disrupt\
    \ normal functionality of distinct mod-\nules of an individual IoTA farm and leverage\
    \ for interrupt-\ning legitimate cyber services in other areas. [92], the IoTA\n\
    system can be compromised and controlled by utilising cen-\ntral malicious system\
    \ know as Botnet of Things. [93], a CA\nnamed as Night Dragon could steal big\
    \ amount of informa-\ntion from various petrochemical companies. [94], an another\n\
    incidence of devastation using phishing attack attemped on\nGerman steel mill\
    \ for gaining access on network plant pro-\nduction system of the mill ofﬁce.\n\
    The increase in CACC in IoT based devices has become\nthe concern in smart agriculture\
    \ where these CACC can bring\ndevastation to IoTA, crop demage, animal production\
    \ loss\nand vast ecconomical loss.\nIn 2020, JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat\
    \ processing\ncompanies, paid $11 million as a ransome to resolve a CA;\nmalware\
    \ attack that shut down Australian and New Zealand\nwool sales [95]. The US agriculture\
    \ ﬁrm AGCO was af-\nfected production by a ransomware attack. President Greg\n\
    Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc observed losses be-\ntween $40,000 to $200,000\
    \ caused by cyber-criminals [96].\nIn the US, Jan 2021, faced the business lost\
    \ $9 million as cy-\nber criminals inﬁltrated a farm’s internal network via com-\n\
    promised administrative credentials. The total loss derives\nfrom the temporary\
    \ shutdown of operations.\nCo-founder of agricultural ﬁrm Muddy Machines, Chris\n\
    Chavasse, states that the IoTA based devices can be attacked\nand hacked. Their\
    \ study says that IoTA sector is at risk.\nIn industrial espionage, revenge-minded\
    \ employees can\ndamage farmers having a treaty in contract farming with that\n\
    particular company. In the case of IoTA, the farmer/contractor\nmay face severe\
    \ loss due to linked cyber security breaches or\nattacks on the contract provider\
    \ company. Subsequently, se-\nvere data loss/breaches or sabotage might be found\
    \ in IoTA.\nVarious emerging CACC, its consequences on IoTA and un-\nfavourable\
    \ affects on the farming are summarised in Table\n3.\nAgribusiness is suspected\
    \ of attacking and disturbing,\ndisrupting, or destroying its existing functional\
    \ system due\nto its fragility in nature, as IoTA is a hackable and crack-\nable\
    \ system. Consequently, various unsolved cases could be\nfound in the court of\
    \ law. Thus various challenges are being\nfaced in evidence collection and DF\
    \ investigation regarding\nIoTA. The various challenges are discussed in the next\
    \ sec-\ntion.\n7 Digital Forensics Challenges in IoTA\nDF is a superset of cyber\
    \ forensics, which includes forensics\nof all digital devices like computers,\
    \ mobile phones, PDAs,\npalmtops, storage devices, obscure devices like gaming\
    \ de-\nvices, recording devices, digital cameras, IoTs and many\nmore. DF consists\
    \ of the systematic propelled and scientif-\nically proven approach for preservation,\
    \ collection, valida-\ntion, identiﬁcation, analysis, interpretation, documentation\n\
    and presentation of digital evidence [100]. DF is a conven-\ntional technique\
    \ as the law enforcement acknowledges that\nmodern day life includes a distinct\
    \ of devices where IoT is at\nthe top of the list of digital devices. The IoT\
    \ can be exploited\nby criminal activity [101].\nThe IoTA is a subset of IoT.\
    \ It includes a sensor, gate-\nway, network, Internet and the cloud. Thus IoTA\
    \ also in-\nherits properties of DF challenges belong IoT. We have in-\ncluded\
    \ a few articles to discuss various DF challenges and\nissues in IoTA. According\
    \ to the principle of exchange given\nin 1934 by Dr. Edmond Locard (1877-1966),\
    \ \"Every action\nleaves a trace.\" Any action of a crime commiter cannot occur\n\
    without leaving a trace. The Locard’s principle was also de-\nﬁned in the perspective\
    \ of conventional crime that is proved\nin the digital world. The same rule is\
    \ equally applicable in\nthe IoTA.\n11\nTable 3: Emerging CACC and Its Consequences\

    \ into six categories: identiﬁcation, collection, preserva-\ntion, analysis, correlation,\
    \ attack attribution and presenta-\ntion. These challenges are further divided\
    \ into its subclasses.\nThe authors discussed DF challenges for various IoT appli-\n\
    cations except for IoTA.\nThe following section discusses the work done in the\n\
    area of IoT/IoTA forensics. In this article We have classi-\nﬁed related articles\
    \ into different categories, some of which\nare discussed below.\n7.1 Jurisdictions\n\
    [103] identiﬁed the challenge presented as the devices cross\nthe borderline of\
    \ jurisdictions. Likely, data in transit between\nIoTA devices and globally distributed\
    \ cloud computing plat-\nforms cross these borderlines more frequently. It is\
    \ unclear\nunder which law the case should be prosecuted i.e., the de-\nvice jurisdiction,\
    \ the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage\njurisdiction. For this reason,\
    \ it is necessary to create an in-\nternational commission that updates the current\
    \ legislation\nand can deﬁne uniform procedures in IoT DF [102] [104].\nThe same\
    \ jurisdiction challenge stands for IoTA too.\nAccording to [105], DF is an interdisciplinary\
    \ process of\ninvestigation where cooperation and coordination between\nnations\
    \ is indeed required for transnational law enforcement.\nThe Council of Europe’s\
    \ Convention on Cybercrime formed\na committee, \"Council of Europe, 2001,\" for\
    \ harmonizing\nprocedural and substantive laws related to digital crime and\n\
    evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states\nto create standard\
    \ systems of substantive and procedural laws\nprohibiting cyber-criminal conduct\
    \ and investigating crimi-\nnal conduct with computer devices with respective\
    \ to each\ncountry. This treaty includes the number of signatories coun-\ntries\
    \ was 63; the few of 63 counties are USA, Canada, Ger-\nmany, France, Great Britain,\
    \ Italy, Hungary, Israel, Japan.\nThe other high technology nations have not signed\
    \ the treaty\nat the convention. That countries are like the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation, Peoples Republic of China, India, the Islamic Repub-\nlic of Iran, Mexico,\
    \ Pakistan and South Africa) [103].\n7.2 Search and Seizure\nSearch and seizure\
    \ is an essential step in any DF examina-\ntion. However, detecting the presence\
    \ of IoT evidences is\nquite challenging as the IoT devices are designed to work\n\
    passively and autonomously. In most cases, when an IoT de-\nvice is identiﬁed,\
    \ there is no documented method or reliable\ntool to collect residual pieces of\
    \ evidence from the device in\na forensically sound manner [106].\n[107] concerned\
    \ that the standards by which the evi-\ndence is in DF investigations could have\
    \ been altered to ac-\ncommodate the changing nature of the cloud computing en-\n\
    vironment. We believe that the alalogical statement holds for\nIoTA DF investigations\
    \ too. Beyond technical challenges,\nprivacy is a signiﬁcant issue to consider\
    \ when analyzing and\ncorrelating collected data, primarily as most IoT sensors\
    \ col-\nlect innate personal information [106].\n[108] authors reviewed various\
    \ DF limitations and chal-\nlenges in IoT. Those limitations include impracticability\
    \ of\ncloning of all data by a service provider, requirement of ex-\ncess time\
    \ in data acquisition and other challenges.\n7.3 Identiﬁcation\nIn the term of\
    \ IoT based DF investigation, the question arises\nof whether to investigate devices\
    \ or data in the case of cloud\nor else the devices may be viewed as a metadata\
    \ aspect of\nthe data or if the reverse is true, the cloud computing ar-\nchitectures\
    \ (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and\ndistribution among different\
    \ countries and continents [109].\nAs IoTA is one of the applications, IoT may\
    \ face the same\nchallenge in the identiﬁcation phase of the investigation.\n\
    7.4 Preservation\nIn evidence, the acquisition is to maintain the integrity of\n\
    the evidence collected. The most frequently used technique\nfor computers and\
    \ phones is calculating a hash to assure\nintegrity. The question arises about\
    \ calculating hash at the\ntime of creating an image. The problem here is the\
    \ lack of\navailable tools that can prevent accidental changes in the IoT\nbased\
    \ evidence [103].\n7.5 Challenge in imaging\nThe challenge of the acquisition\
    \ is to decide whether to cre-\nate an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.\
    \ In the\ncase of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a\nworking\
    \ copy/image of the storage media and seal the actual\nmedia to avoid accidental\
    \ alteration in the actual evidence.\nSince the endpoints in IoT crime scenes,\
    \ excluding comput-\ners and smartphones, may store minimal or sometimes no\n\
    information, creating an image of those IoT nodes is com-\nplicated. If a component\
    \ stores some information, then it\nshould be technically possible to create an\
    \ image of that de-\nvice. The suggested way is to create images from available\n\
    sources [106].\n7.6 Analysis and correlation\nThe huge amount of data collected\
    \ in diverse type of IoT\ndevices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end\
    \ to end\n15\nanalysis of residual evidence. IoTA is a frequently evolv-\ning\
    \ technologies. Hence different Operating Systems (OS),\nvarious ﬁle formats and\
    \ distinct cryptographic methods. The\nExisting digital forensics tools or methodologies\
    \ do not sup-\nport for data extraction from emerging IoTA devices [102].\n7.7\
    \ Absence of Standard IoTA Architecture\nThe different standards for IoTA architecture\
    \ are followed\nby manufacturers, the lack of cooperation, and the many pe-\n\
    culiarities are the terrible thing about the IoT working within\nthe same area\
    \ of application. Due to the lack of standardiza-\ntion of IoTA architecture,\
    \ the smart irrigation system facil-\nitated by one manufacturer and the smart\
    \ crop monitoring\nsystem by another manufacturer can have problems in coor-\n\
    dination. The absence of a standard IoTA architecture chal-\nlenges the design\
    \ of the standard DF framework.\n7.8 Malware\nIn [97], the authors discussed various\
    \ research challenges in\nIoT forensics. The challenges are the complexity and\
    \ versa-\ntility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture, ev-\nidence\
    \ contamination due to overwriting data, and use of\nconventional tools forensics\
    \ tools.\n8 Discussion\nIoTA is the highest trending technology in human life\
    \ to\nmake life much easier, faster and more comfortable. Accord-\ning to Cisco\
    \ Internet Business Solution Group (IBSG), IoT\nwas born between 2008 - 2009,\
    \ with an average of 1.84 IoTs\nper person; the propositional logic can be derived\
    \ from this\nIBSG statistics that people will possess 10 IoTs per person\non an\
    \ average, in the coming age. Thus this ﬁeld requires\nthe most potential to research\
    \ in the IoTA domain to better\nits characteristics and work on its challenges.\n\
    This literature review is focused on IoTA. The rationale\nof this study is helpful\
    \ to understand IoTA architecture and\nits working environment from the physical\
    \ layer to the ap-\nplication layer from different authors’ perspectives. We have\n\
    included IoTA architecture, emerging CA, cyber crimes and\nDF investigation challenges\
    \ about IoT based Agriculture (IoTA).\nWe have done a comprehensive study about\
    \ the DF chal-\nlenges and issues that can have obstacles in this growing era\n\
    of IoTA and possible crime and related that scenario pre-\ncisely with IoTA. Many\
    \ challenges are discussed in previous\npapers. Those challenges include Jurisdiction\
    \ at IoT crime\nscenes, lack of available tools and documentation methods,\npreservation,\
    \ imaging, evidence analysis and correlation. There\ncan be future work on these\
    \ challenges, so the data must\nbe presentable in a court of law. In this review\
    \ work, we\nleft out elaborative discussion about all the IoTA based ap-\nplications,\
    \ deﬁnitions for IoT sensors, protocols, communi-\ncation technology, vulnerabilities,\
    \ cyber-attack, cybercrime,\ncybersecurity and DF, which can be added in the subsequent\n\
    study.\nThe concerning point of a literature review is that the\nauthors’ statement\
    \ was based on assumptions. The articles\nwere not found assured about CACC issues\
    \ in IoTA solu-\ntions. These weaknesses of the IoT system could be tested\nfor\
    \ being assured CACC. Consequently, the manufacturer\nand security experts would\
    \ have saved their time in ﬁnding\ncyber threats for each IoTA device with all\
    \ aspects through\nproactive measures.\nAs a part of the study, there has been\
    \ found a scarcity of\narticles on IoTA based cyber crime and DF discussion. Thus\n\
    the researchers can further explore emerging CACC and DF\ninvestigation based\
    \ on IoTA in this article to have survey\nbased insights. There must be readiness\
    \ for IoTA based CC\nand DF investigation process for running an agriculture busi-\n\
    ness (agribusiness) and to justice for the victim. The fail-\nure to prove the\
    \ suspect will cause the encourage CACC\nin IoTA. Those CACC will be responsible\
    \ for disturbing,\ndisrupting, or even destroying the IoTA system in agribusi-\n\
    ness. It will directly demotivate agribusiness persons to con-\ntribute to crop\
    \ and food production. Subsequently, individ-\nual agribusiness people, consumers,\
    \ laymen, countries and\nthe nation’s GDP could be affected. Thus there is an\
    \ urgent\nneed to have readiness towards CACC and DF in IoTA. It is\nalso observed\
    \ that most experiments were not conducted in\na practice environment and seemed\
    \ just an assumption. To\nsolve more real-time problems, researchers should also\
    \ ex-\nperiment with these techniques on real-world solutions for\nIoTA.\n9 Conclusion\n\
    It is a concerning point in SDG 2030; goal 2 is to promote\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ to achieve zero hunger. To smart agri-\nculture and farming the practice effectively,\
    \ IoTA is applied\nin almost all ﬁelds of agriculture, such as farm monitor-\n\
    ing, irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, smart\
    \ poultry farm and so on. Existing smart\nfarming techniques are classiﬁed and\
    \ reviewed; from this\nstudy, it is understood that researchers should concentrate\n\
    more on readiness for emerging CACC for IoTA applica-\ntions or tools. The readiness\
    \ will provide non-interruptable\nservices. There is a need to be readiness for\
    \ DF investiga-\ntion for IoTA speciﬁcally which will make a robust judicial\n\
    system and strengthen the judicial system by catching the\nnatural suspected person.\n\

    Abstract

    The integration of Internet Protocol and Embedded Systems can enhance the communication
    platform.

    This paper describes the emerging smart technologies based on Internet of Things
    (IOT) and internet

    protocols along with embedded systems for monitoring and controlling smart devices
    with the help of Wi-

    Fi technology and web applications. The internet protocol (IP) address has been
    assigned to the things to

    control and operate the devices via remote network that facilitates the interoperability
    and end-to-end

    communication among various devices c,onnected over a network. The HTTP POST and
    HTTP GET

    command that supports the RESTful service have been used to ensure the transmission
    and reception of

    packets between the IOT Gateway and Cloud Database. The emerging smart technologies
    based on the

    Internet of Things (IoT) facilitated features like automation, controllability,
    interconnectivity, reliability

    which in turn turn paved the way for a wide range of acceptance amongst the masses.
    The Internet of

    Things (IoT) has brought in many new emerging technologies into varoius ¦eld like
    our daily lives,

    industry, agricultural sector, and many more. The world is experiencing the explosive
    growth with the

    advent of Internet of Things (IoT) these years. The potential growth of IoT is
    enoromous which is

    evidenced by all the human beings in our day to day life.

    I. Introduction

    The notion of IoT has greater impact on the lives of the human beings. It has
    crept in both the domestic

    as well as business lives of the human kind. In recent years, with the evolution
    of IoT, the world has

    witnessed transformation of human life style in many possible ways. Various ¦elds
    like manufacturing

    units, inventories, agricultural sectors, etc., are experiencing the huge transformation
    with the advent of

    IoT in everyday lives. The concept IoT has been evolving for around two decades
    and attracts several

    researchers and academicians due to the estimation of having a greater impact
    in the emerging world to

    improve and enhance the lives of the society. The emergency of IoT technology
    tries to amalgamate

    everything which is available in this world. IoT is considered a growing technology
    of everyday life. The

    biggest challenge in the utilization of IoT is the concept of intercommunication
    between appliances. The

    di¨culty in the controllability of various devices, clustering different technology,
    automation of devices of

    different nature, etc., are some of the challenges which are prevailing in the
    usage or the integration of

    IoT into various devices.

    When the things are connected over an internet to make them work together by cooperating
    with one

    another to facilitate an ideal service as a whole and not the combination of devices
    that works

    independently. This idea is much useful in several real-world applications, for
    instance, smart residence,

    in which automatic opening and closing of windows based on the switching on and
    off of an air

    conditioner or based on the oxygen availability inside the room. Even the public
    sectors are bene¦tted

    using IoT technology in these years. Myriad bene¦ts are experienced everyday by
    various government

    and service sectors. IoT enabled applications bene¦ts public sectors in numerous
    ways like in handling

    public safety, maintaining and management of resource, city governance, tr¨c handling
    and much more.

    Page 3/14

    Many health care bene¦ts are also made possible with the help of IoT devices.
    Health care bene¦ts like

    monitoring the patients during their hazardous di¨cult situation, several hospital
    administration bene¦ts

    are made viable to all due to IoT in the ¦eld of medicine. IoT bene¦ts can be
    traced even in th ¦eld of

    agricultural sector as well. Automated irrigation system, crop monitoring technology
    bene¦ts the farmers

    of large scale. it simpli¦es their physical labour. Wireless IoT applications
    help the livestock management

    people in updating the status of the cattles. The intergration of automation and
    IoT in smart watches and

    ¦tness trackers also bene¦ts public in monitoring their health. It also further
    entertains the public through

    automated music system, smart home technology also enables to set timer and information
    in our ¦nger

    tips.

    Integration of smart technology at home also results in experiencing myriad bene¦ts.
    Automation and

    IoTin various gadjets like smart refrigerators, smart bulbs, smart plugs, smart
    thermostats, etc., are some

    of the examples which make things easier in our daily lives. These features help
    in giving alert messages

    regarding the stock availability, conservation of energy, etc. The application
    and usage of IoT technology

    is limitless. Capability and adjustability of integration of IoT with other device
    is wide. The relevant

    information can be obtained, the performance can be monitored, and even it can
    be controlled from a

    distance. It is evident that the bene¦ts of IoT is unlimited. The applications
    of IoT has brought newer

    promise to the world in bringing immense value to human lives. No longer it remains
    as a fanciful vision

    rather it can be experienced by everybody.

    The introduction of IoT leads to the transformation of the World into more advanced
    nature in the ¦eld of

    Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Through IoT various devices are
    embedded with

    internet connectivity which enables to share data with other devices used around
    human environment.

    The possibility of exchanging data with other system around us made numerous possible
    things over the

    web. The interconnection of web is made possible beyond phones and computers due
    to the initiation of

    IoT. As a result of initiation of IoT with other house hold and o¨cial devices,
    features like analytical and

    computing capabilities are made possible. Several devices are involved in implementation
    of smart

    technology with the help of IoT. The devices like sensors, actuators, IoT gateway,
    the cloud, interface, etc.,

    make the implementation of IoT in this era. All these components are tied together
    with the help of

    automation for the smooth §ow of work. The operational e¨ciency can be increased
    with the help of the

    feature of automation and IoT.

    The IoT facilitates the machine to machine and human to machine communication
    using a standard

    protocol. Furthermore it enhances workplace safety in all possible ways. The workplace
    devices which is

    equipped with sensors will help in detecting failures, maintainance of the working
    circumstances.

    Compliance, safety, e¨ciency, etc can be resolved by IoT and automation. Moreover,
    this technology

    helps in overcoming and navigating the longstanding problems with ease. It provides
    opportunities for

    new invention in the hands of technology. The global network transformed the ICT
    with smart device

    applications [1]. IoT is a self-motivated network that interconnects the physical
    and virtual objects

    together [2]. It has been developed from the convergence of wireless technology,
    embedded micro-chip

    and micro-electromechanical system and internet for standard con¦guration and
    to accomplish

    Page 4/14

    interoperable communication by with the help of embedded systems for the integration
    of network and

    things seamlessly [3].

    The development of embedded microchip device has been improved which when interconnected
    with

    internet gives rise to a concept called “Internet of Things”. The IOT makes use
    of a set of wireless

    connectivity like Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Bluetooth etc. and wireless protocols
    like HTTP, MQTT, 6LowPAN,

    CoAP etc. to facilitate better end to end communication among the smart devices
    and applications [4].

    The smart and intelligent devices need scalability for resource constrain, data
    security, secure packet

    transmission and power e¨ciency using RESTful architecture to integrate the cloud
    services. For a

    successful connection and interoperability, a developer should understand the
    complexities and

    standards of the evolving embedded system based on their IOT device. The embedded
    system is an

    electronic device which includes a microcontroller that helps in performing the
    operations like debugging,

    user modi¦cation or to encode a software which can control the devices.

    The monitoring and control of multiple devices using embedded wireless system
    is going on developing

    in recent years with the advancement in IOT, as it leads to a new revolution in
    the ¦eld of ICT [5]. The

    number of smart devices connected to IOT and the smartphones that can access those
    are exponentially

    increasing [6]. The Single on Chip (SoC) technology in homes and o¨ces improves
    the comfort of the

    lives of people, security and e¨cient power management. It also enhances the lifestyle
    of disabled and

    elderly people who needs additional support for their daily life. Hence, the growth
    of embedded based IOT

    is recently accomplishing more attention in the control and monitoring of smart
    devices and various

    wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and RFID are evolving in the automation
    of such devices. Thus,

    the wireless technology is going on improving in resource sharing and device to
    device communication

    via internet using the embedded systems and internet protocols. This technology
    gives rise to the

    automation in the development of smart devices, smart city, smart home, smart
    agriculture, smart

    healthcare, smart industry etc. Several researches have been carried out in the
    development of embedded

    system based IOT by several industrialists and academicians due to its demand
    in the connectivity of

    world with security, comfort, convenience and better quality of lives.

    The implementation of intelligent embedded system based IOT for remote data transfer,
    sensing,

    controlling and monitoring multiple devices with web applications by the integration
    of wireless

    technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Waves, ZigBee, RFID and
    Cellular network [7].

    Table I shows the comparison of wireless technologies and protocols on the basis
    of distance, data rate

    and frequency band. The data sharing and communication between human to things
    and things to

    things over a certain distance is based on the transmission and reception through
    radio waves had been

    facilitated by the wireless technology. The transmitting and receiving the packets
    from physical to

    application layer had been facilitated by the protocols like HTTP, MQTT and CoAP.
    When the protocols

    MQTT and CoAP was compared in such a way that the most of the functionalities
    like level of Quality of

    Service (QoS), multicast security, congestion control frequent message occurrences
    and message

    tenacity, the MQTT was found to have better performance, whereas when the reliability,
    bandwidth and

    Round-Trip Time (RTT) were compared, the CoAP was found to have better performance
    [8].

    In comparison with the protocols like CoAP and HTTP, tested with around ten thousand
    smart devices

    with a benchmark as Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) along with some technical parameters
    like energy

    consumption and data formed while transmitting through applications, CoAP had
    performed well when

    compared with HTTP in the sense that the energy consumption was 6x less than that
    of HTTP PUSH

    mode. Also, the CoAP protocols generated 62 GB data/month and the HTTP protocol
    generated 434 GB

    data/month [9]. These wireless technologies and protocols have been used in several
    embedded based

    IOT systems for monitoring and control of various smart devices and enhancing
    the communication

    between humans to things and things to things.

    Ii. Related Work

    A Home automation system based on Bluetooth technology has been implemented in
    [10]. In this system,

    an android based smart phone and a web-app is used for the monitoring and control
    of home appliances

    like light, fan, television, air conditioner, etc., but interlinking those devices
    with as Bluetooth sub-

    controller. The limitation of this system is that the Bluetooth has a low range
    of connectivity upto 10 m.

    The access control of Bluetooth makes use of a contention-less MAC with fast transmission
    and low

    latency. The Bluetooth architecture adopts Master/Slave concept and has adverting
    frame and data

    appliances with the web server database and webpage. The disadvantages of this
    system include the

    Page 6/14

    high cost and high consumption of energy due to the utilization of high-end personal
    computer. Another

    one drawback is that the developed home automation system controls the home appliances
    only through

    web application available in the home locality [11].

    An embedded system based smart home automation with a Global System for Mobile
    Communication

    (GSM) based on web app involves interfacing of devices with the GSM technology
    and a web server to

    monitor and control the home appliances and various other devices with the IOT
    module. The issues

    faced in this system were, in data transmission, authenticity and SMS/GSM and
    not video streaming [12].

    A ubiquitous home monitoring and control via a smartphone with an android based
    microweb application

    to facilitate an innovative communication protocol in the control and monitoring
    of a home switching

    system with the help of sensors connected with relays. The major demerit of this
    system is that, it does

    not support voice commands for controlling the home appliances [13].

    TinyOS is an application speci¦c Operating System (OS) for wireless sensor nodes.
    The TinyOS has been

    designed in such a way that it is well suited for sensor nodes with resource constrains
    like the Mica

    having §ash ROM, 128kb and RAM, 4kb. The TinyOS has a compact architecture that
    is less than 400

    bytes. Due to its compactness, this OS was preferred by several researchers to
    use it as a basic platform

    for sensor networks, middleware and several other applications. It includes database,
    networking, security

    which are the speci¦c needs for and IOT application on sensor nodes [14]. The
    same facilities have been

    found in a sensor networking OS called Contiki, which can be now used as an open-source
    OS for IOT. It

    consists of several libraries and middleware related to IOT that can be much helpful
    in the development

    of IoT applications. The major challenge in using Contiki is, it facilitates multi-thread
    support named as

    protothread, which has very less functionalities and lacks several essential features
    when compared with

    the real-time OS [15].

    The internet of things can be categorized into semantic-oriented, things-oriented
    and internet-oriented

    visions. The internet-oriented paradigm of IOT has been enhanced with the help
    of semantic-oriented

    approach, since these two approaches are useful for building a practical and complex
    IOT application

    that can be applicable for rich embedded systems. As of now, there were several
    researches has been

    carried out for building an IOT software framework that facilitate concrete implementation
    in the

    deployment of IOT applications. This system uses CoAP based REST packet transmission
    [16].

    The Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is a short-range wireless communication
    technology

    which can transfer data for approximately 20 cm. the NFC consists of a tag which
    holds only a small

    quantity of data and those data cannot be modi¦ed or deleted. It can be of read-only
    type data storage

    like RFID tags used in biometrics, or it can be re-written or modi¦ed later by
    the device [17].

    The Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology can be applicable for low-power
    applications

    and can be used for communication over very long range of around 10 km between
    the gateway and the

    end nodes. The data rate of LPWAN is very low of about less that 1 kbps. Major
    technologies in LPWAN

    Page 7/14

    are LoRaWAN, SigFox and Weightless that operates in sub-GHz bands. The major issue
    in the use of

    LPWAN is, the LPWAM in sub-GHz lacks the globally available band [18].

    The Z-Wave is a low power consumption MAC protocol specially used in home automation
    system. It is

    now also used in several other IoT applications other than home automation. The
    Z-Wave can cover upto

    100 meters, facilitates point to point communication and can be well suited for
    small message

    transmission. For media access, the Z-Wave use CSMA/CA along with the small acknowledgement

    message for reliable transmission. The Z-Wave architecture consists of a Master
    and Slaves. Here, the

    Master can control all the slaves connected to it by transmitting the commands
    and handle the

    scheduling of the complete network [19].

    ZigBee is the most common IoT standard speci¦cally used for medium-range communication
    like remote

    controls, smart homes and healthcare. The network topology of ZigBee includes
    the star topology, peer to

    peer topology and cluster tree. A coordinator is present in the center of star
    topology, which is used for

    controlling the network. The coordinator is available in the root of a tree in
    cluster tree topology. In peer-to-

    peer topology, the coordinator can be located at anywhere. There are two stack
    pro¦les available in

    ZigBee standards. They are the ZigBee and the ZigBee Pro. They can facilitate
    full mesh networking and

    can function with various applications that allows the implementation with low
    memory and low

    processing power. The ZigBee Pro provides several features that includes scalability
    by assigning

    stochastic address, security by exchange of symmetric keys and better performance
    by effective many to

    one routing factor [20].

    In this study, several existing approaches based on the integration of internet
    protocol and embedded

    system for device automation via IoT were analyzed for remote monitoring and control
    of various smart

    devices and its implementation and development. Hence, in this paper a model of
    smart automation

    system using Wi-Fi and android we application has been proposed. The proposed
    system would facilitate

    end to end communication, security, interoperability and scalability and various
    other functions of smart

    devices over a network.

    Iii. Proposed Methodlolgy

    The proposed embedded system based IOT communication rely on the con¦guration
    of IP address over

    Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 b/g/n) technology. The proposed system consists of various
    smart devices, Arduino

    microcontroller, IoT module (ESP8266), wireless router with ¦rewall and external
    power supply unit. This

    system also makes use of an android web application and cloud database. The architecture
    of the

    proposed system is given in Fig. 1.

    A. Smart Devices

    The smart devices are the devices that are integrated with the IoT technology
    to monitor and monitor

    them wirelessly through a remote network. The smart device— an electronic device—
    when it is connected

    to other devices can be operated interactively as well as autonomously. The word
    smart indicates

    Page 8/14

    intelligence. Smart devices and their usage in every day life is an emerging new
    trend in the ¦eld of

    technology especially in the era of IoT. The use of smart devices can facilitate
    ease of access for

    everyone including the elderly and disabled persons. These smart devices can be
    used in homes, o¨ces,

    industries, agriculture, etc. and can be accessed over a range of more than 10
    m. The qualities of

    controllability, interconnection, intelligence, and much more are integrated into
    various smart devices

    including households, o¨ces, industries, other sectors like agriculture, production
    networking, etc. With

    the emergence of technology, the levels of controllability can be adjusted according
    to the need of the

    person. This results in an increased number of users all around the globe, especially
    in recent days. Thus

    it can be said that through the Internet of Things (IoT) the entire world is experiencing
    the era of

    technology speci¦cally in the hands of the device when they are interconnected
    with a network of

    systems. The birth of IoT has paved way for the integration of many smart devices.

    B. Embedded System

    The smart embedded system refers to the intelligent microcontroller that is used
    in the development of a

    system with a ¦rmware coding stored in it. The Arduino (ATmega328) microcontroller
    consists of 8-bit

    analog and digital I/O pins, +5V AREF pin, Serial Peripheral Interface communication
    pins, USB port,

    interrupt pins for the con¦guration of changing an interrupt from the rising to
    falling edges and vice-versa

    and several other features. These result in integration of technology which aims
    for enhanced

    functionality. In this twenty ¦rst century IoT has become the most important technologies
    amongst all. It

    has made several things possible namely the embedded devices can be connected
    to various

    applications of everyday objects which results in smooth §ow of communication.
    Embedded systems are

    hih demanding because they are customized and programmed according to the needs
    and the

    requirements of the users. Smart embedded syatems by acquiring changes to the
    existing contemporary

    embedded syatems will result in suitability for real time existence of human life
    with additional features

    like cost e¨ciency and lower power consumption. Embedded device becomes the part
    and parcel of

    human life. it can be experienced in our daily life through devices like digitally
    controlled home alarm,

    digitially controlled toaster oven, phone which is connected to a web browser,
    etc, to name a few.

    C. Internet of Things Gateway

    The self-contained and SOC based ESP8266 module integrated with a TCP/IP protocol
    stack interlinks

    the microcontroller with the Wi-Fi network. This chip can be able to host a web
    application or can deposit

    all the Wi-Fi networking activities from any other application processor. This
    module has been designed

    in such a way that it has some preprogrammed commands that facilitates advanced
    technologies. These

    commands are more powerful to handle the on-board processing and storage of various
    application

    speci¦c interfaces and sensors connected over General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO).
    It also supports the

    minimum upfront development and run-time while loading the programs.

    The packets are transmitted via network layer. They are then broken into pieces.
    Each piece is assigned

    with a speci¦c name protocol data unit (PDU) and connected with a speci¦c layer.
    In the top-most layer, a

    discover packet has been constructed by HTTP client, which is then transmitted
    by HTTP POST. In layer-4,

    Page 9/14

    the datagram encapsulates the Protocol Data Unit into a segment called TCP/UDP.
    In layer-3, the IP

    address of the destination in same subnet sets the IP address of the next hop
    to destination. In layer-2,

    Wi-Fi broadcasts the IP address of the next hop, then the destination MAC address
    of the frame is set to

    broadcast. Now the PDU has been encapsulated by the device into Ethernet frame
    for concerned devices.

    In layer-1, at the same time, the cellular network port transmits the other frame.
    The devices buffers to

    transmit the frame in future.

    Amalgamation of hardware and software is made possible with the advent of IoT
    which aims for creating

    smarter world. IoT has become the basic common platform where integration of other
    devices are

    possible inorder to collect and exchange the necessary information. Furthermore,
    it also acts as a bridge

    in connecting devices for enabling the features like interaction, collaboration,
    etc. Several smart devices

    can be interconnected in real-world, which is stimulated by using the networking
    tools like packet tracer.

    The packet tracer supports the representation of several hardware that can be
    con¦gured by assigning

    the smart devices with IPv4. For performance analysis like throughput, latency,
    bandwidth, packet loss

    rate etc., the NS-3 network simulator is used, as it supports the simulation of
    IOT. The interoperable

    protocol used in this system is the RESTful web service with HTTP in the application
    layer to facilitate

    client and server communication among the gateway device and the remote user.
    Along with HTTP,

    TCP/IP protocol has been used for packet transmission in IOT to cloud database.

    D. Software System

    The development of system software for the monitor and control of smart devices
    involves two steps: (1)

    development of web application in JSON and (2) microcontroller-based ¦rmware microcode
    in Arduino

    IDE. In Arduino IDE, the web app and Wi-Fi library < wi¦.h > are implemented to
    allow data transmission

    and reception. It enables the client server functionality to facilitate better
    communication among the

    remote-user and the gateway device. The IOT module and the Gateway device were
    connected with the

    cloud database via TCP/IP protocol to provide connectivity for remote users. Whenever
    the gateway

    device is switched on, it is enabled for con¦guration via Wireless Local Area
    Network (WLAN) with the

    help of static IP address. The use of static IP address instead of dynamic IP
    address is to optimize the

    connection process. Until the gateway device receives any commands from the remote
    user through a

    web app, the device would be in the idle state. The Fig. 2 shows the establishment
    of connection among

    the embedded system and Wi-Fi module.

    The application software runs in the Arduino Uno microcontroller with the help
    of Wi-Fi chip. The Wi-Fi

    chip enables the client and server communication through a wireless router. The
    connection between the

    gateway device and the remote user with the smart devices has been con¦gured by
    the wireless router

    and the Wi-Fi module. The Wi-Fi library helps in receiving the packets from the
    microcontroller and also

    creates new packets by passing output message in Java native Language (JNL). The
    RESTful services

    for android web applications facilitates the communication between human to human
    and the human to

    things connected over a network in JSON format for HTTP POST and HTTP GET requests.

    E. Cloud Database

    Page 10/14

    The cloud database and the application layer facilitate the automation, controlling
    and monitoring of

    smart devices remotely and enables e¨cient use of data collected to graphically
    represent the status of

    the smart devices via the web application’s Graphical User Interface (GUI). Figure
    3 shows the overall

    architecture of the implementation of the proposed system.

    Iv. Conclusion

    This paper proposed the implementation of smart phone based remote monitoring
    and control of several

    smart devices with Wi-Fi technology. If the Wi-Fi connection gets failed, then
    the cellular networks enable

    the connectivity among the devices on the basis of RESTful architecture. The proposed
    system

    consumes very less power and can be used in various domains like homes, o¨ces,
    industries, healthcare,

    agriculture etc. with IOT protocols. The use of HTTP and TCP/IP protocols were
    encouraged in this paper

    due to the better performance in connectivity, communication, security and QoS
    with HHTP POST and

    HTTP GET commands for with RESTful services for packet transmission between IOT
    gateway and cloud

    services.

    \ backbone of the Indian \neconomy, accounting for roughly 15% of national GDP\
    \ \nand about half of India's population is entirely or partially \nreliant on\
    \ agriculture and related activities for their living. \nIndia is one of the top\
    \ 15 agricultural commodity exporters in \nthe world. India is also facing an\
    \ exponential population \ngrowth that demands a great need for food in the future.\
    \ \nTraditional agricultural practices, on the other hand, must be \nmodified\
    \ with the help of technology to meet the increasing \ndemand for good quality\
    \ food to meet the future need of the \npopulation. Agriculture development will\
    \ benefit not just \nfarmers, but also a huge portion of the people living in\
    \ rural \nareas that are actively involved in agriculture or indirectly tied \n\
    to agriculture as consumers. More efficient production \nmethods would produce\
    \ a more conjugative environment in \nthe country for the overall development\
    \ of the economy and \ngreater agricultural income. Small and marginal farmers\
    \ will \nbe empowered via education, reforms, and development, \nresulting in\
    \ better, more efficient, and stronger Indian \nagriculture. New production and\
    \ marketing models, as well as \nraising awareness and providing education to\
    \ farmers in \nvillages, will aid in the sector's development and, more \ncrucially,\
    \ improve the economic situation of impoverished \nfarmers [1]. \nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is the most promising approach to \nfarm management in today's era, as it uses\
    \ technology Internet \nof Things (IoT) to monitor the spatial and temporal parameters\
    \ \nof the field and ensures that input resources such as water, \nfertilizers,\
    \ pesticides, and other chemicals are applied to the \ncrops at the right time,\
    \ in the right place, and the right amount. \nTraditional agricultural surveillance\
    \ tactics were modified by \nIoT-based agriculture applications, which quickly\
    \ provided \nquantitative data with great temporal and spatial resolution. \n\
    Ecological data is collected in real-time from the surroundings \nof the agriculture\
    \ field using various sensors installed in the \nfields, which will be communicated\
    \ and analyzed to determine \nvarious problems. This collected data is analyzed\
    \ and \nprocessed to extract the proper information and is utilized to \ndecide\
    \ on various tasks performed in the field to automate the \nagriculture \nprocess\
    \ \nto \novercome \ncertain \ndifficulties. \nMultidisciplinary methods that combine\
    \ remote sensing, \nmodelling, and deep learning techniques can aid in the \n\
    improvement of agricultural operations and, as a result, crop \noutput [2]. \n\
    Collecting data manually from a big field is challenging, \nand it results in\
    \ fluctuation when compared to inaccurate field \nmeasurements. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks (WSN) help in \nintegrating various sensors in the field for the collection\
    \ of \ndifferent parameters from the field and environment. Various \nfarm monitoring\
    \ applications like crop selection according to \nthe soil in the farm, soil monitoring\
    \ to make zones with \nsimilarity to promote multi cropping and to assist farmers\
    \ with \nvarious decision making like when and in what amount of \nfertilizer\
    \ to be used, when to irrigate the crop, early disease \npredictions etc. are\
    \ possible due to several emerging \ntechnologies like WSN, Deep learning, Machine\
    \ learning, IoT \netc. \nAgriculture utilizes 85 percent of the world's available\
    \ \nfreshwater resources, and this fraction is progressively rising \nin parallel\
    \ with population expansion and rising food demand. \nAs a result, there is a\
    \ need to develop more efficient methods \nto ensure that water resources are\
    \ properly utilized in \nirrigation. New innovative plans in this direction are\
    \ needed in \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and\
    \ Applications, \nVol. 13, No. 5, 2022 \n268 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \nresearch to boost productivity and water management through \nnovel irrigation\
    \ techniques [3]. \nProper irrigation aids in the growth of crops, landscape \n\
    maintenance, and revegetation of disturbed soils. In addition \nto frost protection,\
    \ weed suppression in grain fields, and soil \nconsolidation prevention, irrigation\
    \ plays important role in \nhealthy crop cultivation. Irrigation management is\
    \ required \neven in places with abundant rainfall to boost farm \nproductivity.\
    \ Monsoon gaps are a feature of Indian rainfall. As \na result, sometimes it won't\
    \ rain for two or more weeks during \nthe rainy season, causing agricultural damage\
    \ in the absence \nof irrigation. \nIn the near future, proper integration of\
    \ advanced \nagricultural practices based on various technologies and \nadaptation\
    \ by rural communities should be secured. Climate \nchange will have extensive\
    \ consequences in the next decades. \nAs a result, laws, and practices must be\
    \ devised to protect \nfarming communities, particularly small landholders, from\
    \ the \nimmediate losses caused by extreme events [4]. \nThe most important reasons\
    \ for India's need for perfect \nirrigation are: \n Chaotic nature of climate.\
    \ \n Uneven Rainfall Distribution. \n Optimized use of water resources to meet\
    \ crop needs \nand soil requirements. \n To maximize crop production. \n To\
    \ manage supplement supply even in areas with \nabundant rainfall. \nIrrigation\
    \ scheduling is managed by rainfall forecast based \non weather conditions, which\
    \ determines the amount of water \nto be supplied by irrigation to maintain the\
    \ threshold value of \nwater (moisture) required by the crop at any given time.\
    \ \nAutomatic irrigation scheduling systems have replaced \nmanual irrigation\
    \ based on soil water monitoring. While \nimplementing, the plant evapotranspiration\
    \ was taken into \naccount, which was based on many climatic characteristics \n\
    such as humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and even crop \naspects such as\
    \ stage of growth, plant density, soil attributes, \nand pest. \nWeather forecasting\
    \ does an excellent job of providing \npeople with early warnings and alerts about\
    \ severe climate \nchange events, however, due to a lack of infrastructure, people\
    \ \nin remote regions such as villages do not receive information \non time due\
    \ to the absence of internet, and forecasting is not \nvery accurate for any given\
    \ location. As a result, this portable \ndevice may be taken anywhere and used\
    \ to anticipate the state \nof rainfall by sensing current atmospheric characteristics\
    \ and \npresent sky status to identify clouds related to rainfall. \nMost of the\
    \ farmers are living in rural areas and are not \nable to access the internet\
    \ and weather forecasting applications \nat remote locations like fields. This\
    \ article presents a portable \nweather station that uses a novel approach that\
    \ predicts the \nintensity of rainfall as No Rain to very Low Rain, Low to \n\
    Medium Rain or, Medium to high Rain based on the combined \napproach of identifying\
    \ types of clouds present in the sky and \nsome important weather parameters such\
    \ as temperature, \nhumidity, and atmospheric pressure using affordable sensors\
    \ \nthat are within the reach of farmers and will work \nindependently of WIFI\
    \ or internet. \nThis device consists of Raspberry pi with an integrated \ncamera\
    \ for taking digital images of the sky to know the type of \nclouds present in\
    \ the sky along with some atmospheric \nparameter sensors like DHT11 sensor, BMP\
    \ 180 etc. to sense \ntemperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure and will\
    \ give \nthe prediction on rainfall by both approach from cloud status \nand sensed\
    \ atmospheric parameters. Improvement in crop \nproduction and planning by using\
    \ local climate prediction \nwithout the internet can definitely help an individual\
    \ farmer to \nincrease his yield by managing the irrigation cycle by \navoiding\
    \ irrigating the crop with extra water or less water. \nA. Novelty \nThe proposed\
    \ work is distinguished from previous work by \nits multi-modal integration of\
    \ two separate techniques. The \nmajority of previous research has proposed solutions\
    \ in \nirrigation management by providing automatic irrigation based \non either\
    \ atmospheric parameters collected from nearby \nweather stations / using sensors\
    \ or only by capturing sky \nimages, but the proposed system takes advantage of\
    \ both \napproaches where real-time atmospheric parameters on the \nfields are\
    \ sensed using sensors and the sky image at that \nlocation is captured to provide\
    \ better rainfall predictions \nwithout using WIFI or internet so that it can\
    \ be used by \nfarmers or people at remote locations. Due to the global \nshortage\
    \ of clean water resources, it is critical that they be \nutilised to their full\
    \ capacity, which may be accomplished by \nutilising water resources wisely and\
    \ paying equal attention to \nirrigation water management. This device will help\
    \ farmers to \ntake decision before every irrigation scheduled cycle to what \n\
    extent the field should be irrigated by predicting the intensity \nof rainfall\
    \ as low, medium or high. \nThe rest of the article is arranged as follows: Section\
    \ 2 \ndescribes relevant work, Section 3 discusses the proposed \nsystem in detail,\
    \ Section 4 discusses methods and \nmethodology, Section 5 discusses findings,\
    \ and Section 6 \ndiscusses conclusion and future work. \nII. RELATED WORK \n\
    Weather conditions play an important role in both \nirrigation requirements and\
    \ crop performance. Researchers \nused various weather parameters and different\
    \ technologies \nand algorithms to predict the weather to know the status of \n\
    climate to control the use of water in Irrigation. \nThe evapotranspiration of\
    \ water in the soil is affected by \ntemperature and humidity. The thermic level\
    \ of the \natmosphere is described as air temperature, which is generally \nmeasured\
    \ in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin degrees. It is the \nmost closely observed\
    \ weather metric. The presence of water \nvapour in the air is known as humidity.\
    \ The proportion of \nwater vapour in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\
    \ The \nother major parameters considered by the researchers are \nluminosity\
    \ and is defined as the brightness or intensity of \nlight. Lux is the unit of\
    \ measurement. It causes more water \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    \ solar \nradiation. The most important parameter is the rainfall or \namount\
    \ of precipitation that influences whether or not \nirrigation is necessary as\
    \ well as the amount of water to be \nused if irrigation is required. The author\
    \ in [5] presents a \ndetailed survey on the IoT systems and recent sensors used\
    \ in \nan automatic smart irrigation system in Precision Agriculture \nand discussed\
    \ various weather monitoring parameters, sensors, \nsoil characteristics. The\
    \ author in [6] proposed an automated \nirrigation system which starts the motor\
    \ and water is supplied \nonly if the level of soil moisture goes below the threshold\
    \ and \nthe amount of water supply is managed by considering the \nweather parameters\
    \ temperature and humidity sensed by the \nsensor to predict the type of climate\
    \ as sunny (no rain), cloudy \n(rain chances <50%) or rainy (rain chances>50%).\
    \ In [7] to \nadd intelligence to the existing idea of automatic irrigation \n\
    systems, an autonomous irrigation system is proposed that \nemploys machine learning\
    \ and predictive algorithms to predict \nthe status of rainfall using historical\
    \ climate data for the \namount of water to be used by calculating the time of\
    \ motor to \nbe ON based on the soil moisture value for each zone \nseparately.\
    \ Work proposed in [8] is the development of an \nefficient IoT architecture that\
    \ monitors soil, microclimate, and \nwater parameters, as well as performing proper\
    \ irrigation \nmanagement based on challenges studied in irrigated farmland \n\
    of Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. For educated decision \nmaking and effective\
    \ operation of the irrigation management \nsystem, indigenous agricultural and\
    \ expert knowledge, local \nclimate information, particular features of crop and\
    \ soil are \nprovided to the system. Broadband connection and cloud \nservices\
    \ are either unavailable or too costly in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica. To overcome these\
    \ constraints, data processing, \nnetwork administration, irrigation choices,\
    \ and farmer \ncommunication are all done locally, with no back-end servers \n\
    involved. In the article [9] the technique was evaluated using \nfive crops at\
    \ four European sites with varying weather \ncircumstances to optimize irrigation\
    \ water consumption by \ntaking into consideration soil water availability, local\
    \ weather \npredictions, crop physiological condition, and water demands \nin\
    \ real-time. Main observations are the major effect of \ninaccurate predictions\
    \ of the forecast, unless the target yield \nwas excessively high, was that the\
    \ target yield was not \nattained, but the irrigation schedule stayed near to\
    \ optimum, \naccording to the data. In other words, while the actual yield \n\
    did not match the objective, just a little amount of irrigation \nwater was lost.\
    \ In [10] author proposed an idea to automate \nthe irrigation process to manage\
    \ the motor's pumping by \ntaking into account the soil moisture content and rainfall\
    \ \nforecast. Soil moisture data is continuously sensed using a soil \nmoisture\
    \ sensor and is sent to raspberry pi and depends upon \nthe value a rainfall prediction\
    \ is obtained from Openweather \nAPI to decide on irrigating the field or not\
    \ and the Android \nApplication is used to track the complete irrigation process\
    \ for \nthe agricultural field. The article [11] effectively shows a \nsimple,\
    \ low-cost, and somewhat accurate system for \nmonitoring current meteorological\
    \ conditions and forecasting \nrain. This system has a significant benefit over\
    \ comparable \nArduino-based weather monitoring systems in that it also \nprovides\
    \ rain probability at the current moment using weather \nparameters namely temperature,\
    \ humidity, light intensity, and \nwind conditions. The goal of this study [12]\
    \ was to provide a \nway for a reliable irrigation system based on a suitable\
    \ rainfall \nforecast algorithm. The new approach, which is Romyan's \nmethod\
    \ is introduced to calculate water requirement for crops, \nas well as the time\
    \ necessary for the motor to be turned on. \nThe author in [13] presents a technique\
    \ for high-accuracy \nrainfall forecasting that combines two types of data i.e.,\
    \ cloud \nimaging data and humidity as an atmospheric parameter in \nnumerical\
    \ form. Convolution Neural Network is used for \nimage recognition by extracting\
    \ important features using \nResNet. In this research, a novel network is built\
    \ that \ncombines the cloud picture with other meteorological \ninformation and\
    \ creates the result, to forecast rainfall with \ngreater accuracy than the existing\
    \ ResNet image recognition \nalone. \nA comparison of the existing and proposed\
    \ work based on \nthe parameters and technology along with methods and \nmethodologies\
    \ used are shown in Table I. The comparative \nanalysis of the previous research\
    \ work has revealed that most \nof the models used either atmospheric parameters\
    \ or cloud \nimages for the prediction of rainfall and only one paper \nproposed\
    \ a system using a combined approach but using only \none parameter as humidity.\
    \ However, after researching \nexisting systems it is clear that the combined\
    \ approach of two \nmodalities to predict rainfall gives more clarity and would\
    \ be \nvery useful. In this regard, the system proposed uses a \nmultisource data\
    \ approach that combines predictions from \ndigital cloud images and atmospheric\
    \ parameters to provide an \nimproved rainfall prediction system. \nTABLE I. \n\

    \ in \nterms of its portability and use of edge analytics where input is \nprocessed\
    \ and output is given at the device level only without \ncloud platforms, internet\
    \ or WiFi. \nIII. PROPOSED SYSTEM \nThe study of clouds and their characteristics\
    \ is crucial for a \nwide range of applications. It's been utilized to produce\
    \ \nprecise weather forecasts via nowcasting. There exist many \nclouds in the\
    \ sky but only a few clouds are responsible for \nrain. Identification of rainclouds\
    \ can be done using image \nclassification with the help of deep learning on a\
    \ ground-based \nimage cloud dataset. To make the predictions more accurate \n\
    the atmospheric parameters like temperature, humidity, \natmospheric pressure\
    \ is taken into account which can be easily \nsensed by the sensors and are affordable.\
    \ The results from \nboth approaches are combined and the final output is given\
    \ as \nthe prediction on the rainfall as No rain, Low to Medium rain, \nor heavy\
    \ rain as shown in Fig. 1 as a multi-modal proposed \nsystem on basis of which\
    \ many agriculture-related activities \ncan be carried out like managing irrigation\
    \ by taking in \naccount the status and intensity of rainfall. \nA. Components\
    \ used  \n1) BMP180: BMP180 is a barometric sensor with an I2C \n(―Wire‖) interface,\
    \ used to measure pressure surrounding it \nand altitude. It is also used to measure\
    \ temperature. It works \non push sensor BMP180 and can measure the pressure in\
    \ the \nrange of 300 to 1100 hPa with relative pressure error to 0.12 \nhPa (1m\
    \ height). The BMP180 outputs absolute pressure \nin pascals (Pa). By observing\
    \ variations in pressure short-term \nweather changes can be predicted. Dropping\
    \ pressure, for \nexample, frequently indicates the arrival of rain or a storm\
    \ (a \nlow-pressure system is moving in). When the pressure rises, it \nusually\
    \ signals that clear weather is on the way (a high-\npressure system is moving\
    \ through). \n2) DHT11 sensor is a basic and commonly used to record \ntemperature\
    \ and humidity from the atmosphere in the digital \nform. This sensor utilizes\
    \ a thermistor and a capacitive \nhumidity sensor to detect the surrounding air.\
    \ To monitor \nhumidity and temperature instantly, it may be simply \ninterfaced\
    \ with any microcontroller such as Arduino, \nRaspberry Pi, and so on. \n3) Raspberry\
    \ Pi 4: Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest model and \nis a tiny processor or a controller\
    \ with great processing power \nintegrated with Broadcom 2711, 64-bit quad-core\
    \ Cortex-A72 \nprocessor and is available with 1 GB, 2 GB, or 4 GB RAM. It \n\
    features a true gigabit Ethernet port, 2 x USB 3.0 \"Super-\nSpeed\" ports which\
    \ can be used to attach mouse and keyboard. \nIt comes as a size of the credit\
    \ card so is portable and easy to \ncarry. New version comes with a combination\
    \ of small \nfootprint, low-power drop, customization and amazing \ncommunity\
    \ support and the pi can be used in several. \n4) USB camera: Logitech HD webcam\
    \ c270 has a USB \ninterface that makes it easy to connect and has 3-megapixel\
    \ \nimage resolution along with superb color-rich imaging even in \nultra-low\
    \ light with HD support. \n5) OLED Display Screen: To display the output as the\
    \ \natmospheric parameters along with the status of rainfall and \nthe decision\
    \ based on the rainfall is displayed on an OLED \ndisplay screen. The OLED display\
    \ screen is very thin and \nlight-weighted with a size of 0.96 inches comes with\
    \ a \nresolution of 128X64. It has 4 pins named VCC: 3.3-5V GND: \nGround SCL:\
    \ Serial Clock SDA: Serial Data to carry out I2C \ncommunication. \n6) Basic Shield:\
    \ Basic Shield is a component provided \nwith 8 LED's, 2 push buttons and is very\
    \ popular for \ninterfacing electronics components like a push button, \npotentiometer,\
    \ LDR, buzzer, etc. and can be easily connected \nwith 5 V/3.3 V microcontrollers.\

    get displayed on the screen after regular intervals. To start the \nRain prediction\
    \ push-button b1 needs to press. Once b1 is \npressed camera will start and the\
    \ video will be captured, so the \ncamera should be faced towards the sky to get\
    \ the proper \ninput, which is fed as input to deep learning model at the same\
    \ \ntime machine learning code will also be executed by giving \nvalues T, H,\
    \ and P as input parameters. \nIV. METHODS AND TECHNOLOGY \nA. Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ \nIrrigation scheduling is critical for ensuring that crops \nreceive the right\
    \ quantity of water at the right time to \nminimize crop water stress and optimize\
    \ output [15]. Water \nstress can affect vegetable crops in two ways: when there\
    \ is a \nlack of water (drought stress) or when there is an abundance \nof water\
    \ (water stress) caused due to waterlogging or soil \nwater saturation. A water\
    \ deficit occurs when water is \nsupplied at the wrong time or insufficiently,\
    \ reducing the \namount of water available to plants in the soil. Long durations\
    \ \nof irrigation or high-water application rates can produce \nexcess soil moisture,\
    \ wasting water and causing nutrient loss. \nCrop water stress can also have an\
    \ impact on crop \nmanagement. Wilting occurs when soil moisture falls below a\
    \ \ncertain level, preventing plants from drawing water into their \nroots. Furthermore,\
    \ in low moisture circumstances, any \nmoisture-activated herbicides and nutrients\
    \ would not be \nefficiently used by plants. Presently, many different \napproaches\
    \ are adopted for irrigation scheduling as listed in \nTable II to optimize the\
    \ water application to crops. These \nmethods are ranked according to the level\
    \ of management \nrequired for water application [16]. Irrigation scheduling is\
    \ \ndifferent for a different crop at every growth stage and must \nbe followed\
    \ to optimize the crop yield and the use of water. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ METHODS \nRank \nMethod \nType of water management \n0 \nThe \"Irrigate whenever\"\
    \ method  \nWater is applied without scheduling \n1 \n\"Feel and appearance\"\
    \ method \nThe irrigation manager decides the amount of water to be applied and\
    \ when by observing the soil sample and \nassessment is done by comparing it with\
    \ the soil reference images. \n2 \nSystematic method \nRegardless of considering\
    \ weather or soil water conditions, the application of water is done based on\
    \ the amount \nor time. \n3 \nCrop water demand method \nThe amount of water applied\
    \ is determined by the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc). This strategy involves\
    \ \ncalendar-based scheduling based on prior seasons and should take into account\
    \ rainy days. \n4 \nSoil water status method \nWater is supplied to the crop root\
    \ system based on soil moisture levels, usually by giving a proportion of soil\
    \ \naccessible water. Rainfall occurrences should be taken into consideration\
    \ with this technique. \n5 \nWater budgeting method \nWater application is dependent\
    \ on crop evapotranspiration, soil moisture content at the root level, and water\
    \ \nbudgeting. \nThe first method is completely traditional and requires \nhuman\
    \ interventions and results in lots of water wastage in \nterms of irrigation\
    \ as management was not done properly and \nno parameters are considered. The\
    \ second and third methods \nconsidered soil parameters and timings as well as\
    \ an amount \nfor application of water which reduced the water wastage but \n\
    may result in water stress as no weather conditions are \nconsidered. The last\
    \ three methods are improved and make use \nof technology by considering various\
    \ parameters like soil \nmoisture content and rainfall events to plan the irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling thus optimizing the use of water resources. From \nthe above table,\
    \ we can see that Irrigation scheduling is very \nimportant to optimize the water\
    \ application thus by improving \nthe yields and rainfall is one such important\
    \ factor that must \nbe taken into account to protect the crop from the application\
    \ \nof excess water thus improving the Irrigation Management \nsystem. \nB. Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) \nEvery element of traditional farming processes may be \nsubstantially\
    \ altered by incorporating the newest sensor and \nIoT technology into agricultural\
    \ practices. Currently, Wireless \nsensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) are\
    \ being integrated \ninto smart agriculture and are capable of taking agriculture\
    \ \nsector to next level. Soil, humidity, wetness, light, air \ntemperature, CO2,\
    \ solar energy sensors, and a variety of other \nIoT sensors are all employed\
    \ in agriculture. Sensors, which \nare placed across the fields, on smart agriculture\
    \ vehicles, in \nIoT-based monitoring systems, and weather stations, collect \n\
    data in real-time and give farmers visibility and control over \ntheir activities.\
    \ Fig. 3 shows the basic architecture of IoT. \n \nFig. 3. A Basic Architecture\
    \ of IoT. \nIoT architecture consists of various hardware components \nlike sensors\
    \ as per the requirement to sense the data from \nsurroundings \nwhich \nrequires\
    \ \nsoftware \nand \nvarious \ncommunication technologies to exchange the data\
    \ among the \ndevices and finally, the data sensed by the interrelated devices\
    \ \ngets stored on the cloud for further analysis and various \napplication are\
    \ developed to convert this data into important \ninformation required for many\
    \ useful or decision-making \nactivities. \nThe information about IoT technology\

    \ \nmany more as shown in Fig. 4. \n \nFig. 4. IoT Components and Technologies.\
    \ \nToday we have clouds like Thingspeak, IBM Watson \nspecifically for IoT along\
    \ with general-purpose cloud \nplatforms (AWS Amazon, Google, Cisco). Once the\
    \ data is \nstored it is analyzed with analytical tools like keras, \nTensorflow,\
    \ OpenCV is libraries with very powerful functions \nand finally, the information\
    \ retrieved after analysis of data is \nused for various applications. \nC. Edge\
    \ Analytics \nSensors are used to collect data from the environment or \nsurroundings\
    \ and Actuators are the devices that will take \naction based on the output of\
    \ processed data. If the Analytics \nis performed at the device level that concept\
    \ is called Edge \nAnalytics. Only data for storage is sent to the cloud. If \n\
    analytics is done in the cloud, then it is called cloud analytics. \nThis experiment\
    \ used DHT11 and bmp180 sensors to sense \ntemperature, Relative humidity, and\
    \ atmospheric pressure, and \nthe data is fed to a machine learning algorithm\

    \ \nget the status of rainfall based on these real-time parameters. \nAlong with\
    \ it, raspberry pi is integrated with a digital camera \nto capture the image\
    \ of the sky at that location, and the image \nis given as the input to the deep\
    \ learning model (.h5 file) to get \nthe status of rainfall based on the types\
    \ of clouds present in the \nsky at that time. The processing is done in Raspberry\
    \ pi and \nthe predictions are displayed on the screen attached to it. This \n\
    proposed device uses Edge analytics to give output as the \nprocessing is done\
    \ at device level and does not depend on \nWIFI or internet. The cloud can be\
    \ used to just store the data \ncollected by the sensor only when Wi-Fi is available.\
    \ The cost \nof data storage and management is reduced using edge \nanalytics.\
    \ It also saves operational costs, bandwidth \nrequirements, and time spent on\
    \ data analysis. Despite the \nwidespread use of internet-connected gadgets, connection\
    \ \nproblems persist due to the unavailability of the internet or \nlimited network\
    \ access. Edge analytics guards against possible \nnetwork failures by ensuring\
    \ that applications aren't hampered \nby internet issues or limited network access\
    \ [17]. This is \nespecially beneficial in rural regions (remote locations) or\
    \ \nwhen trying to save communication expenses with costly \ntechnologies like\
    \ cellular. \nD. Deep Learning \nClouds are crucial in climate forecasting. Rainfall\
    \ \nforecasting is also heavily influenced by the state and kinds of \nclouds\

    \ on their features like texture, color, etc. \nto know the type of cloud and\
    \ rainfall can be predicted using \nthe precipitation associated with that cloud.\
    \ Ground-based \ncloud images are readily available compared to satellite cloud\
    \ \nimages and provides information about the local atmosphere \nby analyzing\
    \ bottom-level features of clouds like cloud height, \ncloud type, and cloud cover\
    \ [18]. Rain clouds are mainly \nclassified as Cirrus, Stratus, and Cumulus [19]\
    \ and the main \nclouds are shown in Fig. 5. \nThe proposed device is provided\
    \ with 8 megapixels digital \ncamera integrated into Raspberry-pi to capture live\
    \ sky images \nat any location by clicking a button on the device to activate\
    \ \nthe device. A cloud image is given as input to the convolution \nneural network\
    \ (CNN) and the SoftMax activation function is \nused to classify the cloud into\
    \ No Rain to very Low Rain, Low \nto Medium rain, or Medium to High Rain based\
    \ on the amount \nof precipitation associated with each cloud. According to the\
    \ \nPrecipitation and the amount of Rainfall as shown in Table III, \nall cloud\

    \ learning model as shown in \nFig. 6 where the weights of the pretrained model\
    \ are \ndownloaded first, followed by freezing of all the layers except \nthe\
    \ top layer, which is used for classification in the fresh \ndataset, and finally\
    \ the training of the model. All of the layers \nare unfrozen for fine-tuning,\
    \ and the model is trained on a new \ndataset with a very low learning rate. Once\
    \ trained, the model \nwas able to accurately predict the outcome. All three pre-\n\
    trained models, VGG16, Inception-V3, and Xception, follow \nthe identical flow\
    \ and concluded with The Xception model \ngives better accuracy to predict Rainfall\
    \ based on cloud \nimages taken from the ground, giving output whether Rain or\
    \ \nlittle Rain or medium Rain or high Rain as compared to VGG \n16 and Inception-V3.\
    \ Rain Prediction using deep learning on \nground-based cloud images using transfer\
    \ learning, is \npresented in [20]. \nE. Machine Learning  \nTo support the rain\
    \ prediction model based on cloud \nimages, atmospheric parameters are also considered\
    \ which \nalso plays vital role in determining the rainfall. Temperature, \nhumidity,\
    \ and pressure in the atmosphere fluctuate rapidly, \ncausing instability in the\
    \ atmosphere, which can result in rain, \nstorms, and even lightning and thunder.\
    \ The most significant \nelements in predicting precipitation are temperature\
    \ and \nhumidity [21]. Air pressure, dewpoint temperature (or relative \nhumidity),\
    \ wind speed, and cloud cover are four more \nmeteorological factors that are\
    \ substantially connected to \nrainfall [22]. But as the device is portable so\
    \ only the most \nimportant variables are chosen for the experiments which are\
    \ \ntemperature, relative humidity, and air pressure that can be \nsensed with\
    \ affordable sensors and are sufficient to predict the \nstatus of the rainfall.\

    \ Working of Deep Learning Model. \nRainfall intensity is classified according\
    \ to the rate of \nprecipitation, which depends on the considered time. The \n\
    following categories are used to classify rainfall intensity [23]: \n Low rain\
    \ — when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm \n(0.098 in) per hour \n Medium rain\
    \ — when the precipitation rate is between \n2.5 mm (0.098 in) and 7.6 mm (0.30\
    \ in) or 10 mm \n(0.39 in) per hour  \n High rain — when the precipitation rate\
    \ is > 7.6 mm \n(0.30 in) per hour, or between 10 mm (0.39 in) and \n50 mm (2.0\
    \ in) per hour \n Very High rain — when the precipitation rate is > \n50 mm (2.0\
    \ in) per hour \nHere also the data is classified in the same categories as in\
    \ \ncloud dataset as No Rain to Very Low Rain, Low to Medium \nRain, and Medium\
    \ to Heavy Rain based on the precipitation \nrate. \nThe data is collected for\
    \ the city of Hyderabad, Telangana, \nfrom Nasa Power Data viewer for Daily data,\
    \ which contains \nvarious climatic parameters, but only the most significant\
    \ ones \nare picked, and the data is collected over a 40-year period \nfrom 1981\
    \ to May 2021. Because there are an average of 64-\n65 rainy days each year, collecting\
    \ sufficient data over a long \nperiod of time is required. The dataset contains\
    \ many \nattributes (columns), but for this experiment, the independent \nvariables\
    \ are Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Pressure, \nand the dependent variable\
    \ is Condition, which is labelled in \nthree categories based on precipitation:\
    \ No rain to very low \nrain, Low to medium rain, and Medium to high rain. Various\
    \ \nsteps carried out to train the model from collecting dataset to \ncleaning\
    \ of the dataset, balancing the dataset, feature \nextraction, and then partitioning\
    \ of the dataset into train and \ntest sets as shown in Fig. 7. After that various\
    \ classification \nmodels are applied on the training set to train the model on\
    \ \nselected parameters then the performance is analyzed by \ncalculating the\
    \ accuracy based on the predictions from the test \ndataset. \nIt has been observed,\
    \ that among all individual machine \nlearning models RandomForest and KNN gave\
    \ a good \nprediction as compared to others. Logistic regression and \nSVM also\
    \ performed well while predicting the values but \nDecision Tree and Naïve Byes\
    \ performance was poor in \nestimating the predictions compared to other models\
    \ as shown \nin Fig. 8. For evaluating the machine learning models a very \neffective\
    \ technique called K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION is \nused where the model is tested\
    \ on part of the dataset which \nwas not used for training. In this experiment,\
    \ value of k is set \nto 5 in the K-fold cross-validation technique to check the\
    \ \naccuracy attained by various models used. Although \npredictions from stacking\
    \ Ensemble are better than voting, the \ncalculation time is three times that\
    \ of individual machine \nlearning models. As a result, the RandomForest classifier\
    \ was \nchosen to implement in hardware since it is faster and has \nsimilar accuracy\
    \ to Stacking Ensemble. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nF. Device Setup \nAll the components are connected to Raspberry Pi as \nshown\
    \ in Fig. 9. The screen displayed the currently sensed \nparameter values when\
    \ the power is given to the device. \nNo internet or WIFI module is used in this\
    \ device and the \npower can be given by the power bank to make the portable \n\
    device so that it can be carried to any location. Logitech USB \nCamera is used\
    \ to capture the video of the sky which will be \ndivided into continuous image\
    \ frames and given as input to the \nDeep learning model to get the rainfall prediction\
    \ based on the \nclouds present in the sky. Data sensed by the DHT11 sensor \n\
    and BMP180 i.e. temperature, humidity, and pressure is given \nas input to the\
    \ machine learning model. The predicted rainfall \nfrom both the models is displayed\
    \ on the OLED screen and \nthe final decision for the amount of irrigation is\
    \ also displayed \non the screen. Based on the output the motor can be switched\
    \ \nON to irrigate the land for the appropriate amount of water \nbased on the\
    \ decision given. The instrument is tested and \nfound to give very correct predictions\
    \ based on both \napproaches. This rainfall system would be very much useful in\
    \ \nmany agricultural events where the rainfall prediction needs to \nbe considered.\
    \ Prediction is given based on two different \nmodels where atmospheric parameters\
    \ and clouds both are \nconsidered. The most important is this device works without\
    \ \nthe internet only power is needed. The device can also be used \nonly \nto\
    \ \nmonitor \nindividual \natmospheric \nparameters \ntemperature, humidity, or\
    \ pressure which can be used to make \na decision on food storage, or crop harvesting.\

    \ Device Setup. \nG. Tools and Libraries used \nTo execute the Deep learning model\
    \ Debian GNU/Linux \n(64 bit) aarch 64(beta version) is installed which is a free\
    \ and \nopen-source operating. Debian GNU/Linux is a unique \nsoftware distribution\
    \ that combines Debian's philosophy and \nmethodology with GNU tools, the Linux\
    \ kernel, and other key \nfree software to make aarch 64. Because of its technical\
    \ \nbrilliance and profound dedication to the requirements and \naspirations of\
    \ the Linux community, Debian is especially \npopular among expert users. The\
    \ Deep Learning model and \nmachine learning models were trained on python 3 so\
    \ all the \nsupporting libraries with the required versions Keras – 2.4.3, \n\
    Tensor Flow-2.4.0-rc2, Scikitlearn-0.20.2, and OpenCV -4.5.3 \nare installed.\
    \ \nV. RESULT \nSome of the screenshots of output are shown in Fig. 10. \nHere\
    \ in the display screen T denotes Temperature, H denotes \nHumidity and P denotes\
    \ Pressure sensed by the sensor and are \ndisplayed as soon as Raspberry Pi starts.\
    \ The Value of T, H, \nand P keeps on displaying on the screen. When button b1\
    \ is \npressed its status changed from 1 to 0 and the rain prediction \nmodel\
    \ starts by starting the camera to capture the sky image \nand is given as input\
    \ to the deep learning and T, H, and P \nvalues are passed to the machine learning\
    \ model. P1 denotes \noutput from deep learning (i.e. from clouds) and P2 denotes\
    \ \noutput from machine learning (i.e. from Parameters). \nThe device is tested\
    \ in the open space in residential area by \npowering it with the USB power bank\
    \ as the Raspberry Pi \nrequires a 5volt input voltage, which is provided via\
    \ the USB \ntype-C connection. The input voltage should actually be a \nlittle\
    \ higher than 5 volts. Because power losses occur in the \nconnectors and wires\
    \ of the circuit's transmission, 5.1–5.2 \nVolts would be optimum. The results\
    \ obtained as the intensity \nof rainfall were compared with the open weather\
    \ API for the \nsame day and time and found that the device prediction gives \n\
    70-75% accurate results which will be really helpful in many \nareas that require\
    \ instant information on the rain at particular \nlocation and time. The device\
    \ must be operated in open space \nand camera should be kept facing towards the\
    \ sky to capture \nthe cloud images. Device can be used as many times by \nrotating\
    \ the facing of camera to capture sky in all directions. \n \nFig. 10. Final Output\

    \ \nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE \n In this era of technology people like farmers\
    \ must be able \nto use various technologies to increase their decision-making\
    \ \nin various agriculture processes like the timing of irrigation, \nspraying\
    \ of pesticides, use of fertilizers in the right amount, \nand at right time needed\
    \ by the crops. But there are some \nlimitations as unavailability of WIFI, No\
    \ Internet, lack of \nknowledge while using the technologies. This IoT based \n\
    portable device is a small effort for people like farmers, \ntransporters where\
    \ rain prediction is of utmost use for decision \nmaking and the main advantage\
    \ of this device is that it will be \noperated without the internet and will give\
    \ the prediction by \nsensing the atmospheric parameters and sky status at the\
    \ \ncurrent location. Compared to the previous devices this \nproposed \nsystem\
    \ \ngives \nrainfall \nprediction \nbased \non \natmospheric parameters along\
    \ with present cloud/sky status \nspecific to that location, hence is very useful\
    \ in agriculture for \nmonitoring the weather status without the use of any internet\
    \ \nand the device require very low power which can be given by \na power bank\
    \ using USB-C Type cable to a raspberry pi. \nFarmers cultivating crops under\
    \ irrigation can benefit from \nclimate prediction of precipitation and temperature\
    \ at various \nstages of the growing season. These forecasts enable farmers \n\
    to better manage the timing of water application and apply the \nappropriate amount\
    \ of water to maximize crop production. \nThis device can also be used to monitor\
    \ individual parameters \nas per the requirement like temperature, humidity, or\
    \ \natmospheric pressure. The device works in two modes for \nmonitoring individual\
    \ parameters and gives rain prediction \nonly after pressing the push button.\
    \ Rain prediction is given \nby combining output from machine learning by giving\
    \ \natmospheric parameters as input and deep learning by taking \nsky image as\
    \ input. For a deep learning model Xception model \ngives better accuracy of around\
    \ 80% as compared to VGG16 \nand Inception V3. Whereas for the Machine learning\
    \ approach \namong all individual machine learning models RandomForest \nand KNN\
    \ gave a good prediction as compared to others. \nLogistic regression and SVM\
    \ also performed well while \npredicting the values but Decision Tree and Naïve\
    \ Byes \nperformance was poor in estimating the predictions compared \nto other\
    \ models. The device is handy and requires human \nintervention for pressing the\
    \ button to get the rainfall \nprediction as per the requirement. Before reaching\
    \ the final \ndecision of irrigating the land the device can be used after \n\
    every 1 or 2 hours to monitor the changes in the atmosphere. \nThe sensed data\
    \ can be stored in excel in Raspberry-pi and \nwhenever a WIFI is available the\
    \ data can be stored on the \ncloud for future use. \nFor future work, the GSM\
    \ module can be integrated to \noperate the device automatically at regular intervals\
    \ and the \nprediction can be sent to the farmer's mobile and also the \nmotor\
    \ can be switched ON/OFF as per the suggestion based \non the rainfall prediction.\
    \ Water wastage may be greatly \nreduced by including a smart irrigation system,\
    \ which can \nreduce water consumption by 20%. The integration of smart \ntechnology,\
    \ such as machine learning, IoT, the web, and the \nmobile framework, has been\
    \ a major driver in achieving \nsustainable precision irrigation. Some of the\
    \ study's findings \nshow that sustainable precision irrigation management can\
    \ \nhelp farmers achieve food security and avoid water constraint. \nREFERENCES\

    in Côte D’Ivoire. Sensors 2023, 23, 7632. Copy Abstract Machine Learning can be
    used for social good. In this paper, we discuss how it can be used to combat climate
    change and facilitate land management and farming in developing countries and
    in particular in Côte d’Ivoire. This paper explores models that improve land and
    water management and agricultural farming cultivation to contrast climate change.
    Côte d’Ivoire is the largest producer of cocoa beans (43%) in the world, but deforestation,
    lack of rainfall, drought, and climate change threaten crops and the already fragile
    economy of Ivorian farmers. It is important to combat climate change with methods
    and techniques that are affordable to the local farmers and also induce positive
    effects in production. We discuss the use of low-cost sensors to collect data
    on the soil and open data and open source software to develop AI tools. We show
    that using deep neural networks (YOLOv5m) is effective for detecting healthy plants
    and pods of cocoa from damaged ones only using mobile phone images. Focusing on
    a single land is not enough to combat climate change, which has different causes
    and involves also knowledge at a higher scale. We propose a new method of forecasting
    for the analysis of remote sensors. Remote sensor data come from GRACE NASA Mission
    and ERA5 produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service at ECMWF. We implement
    a new deep neural network architecture named CIWA-net. It is based on a Fully
    Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) [ 1] and it is a U-net like architecture [2].
    The aim of CIWA-net is to forecast Total Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA). We show
    the quality of our model with a comparison to a vanilla Convolutional Neural Network.
    CIWA-net could be used also for the detection of lands that interfere with agricultural
    work and yields, such as deserted areas, water-soaking soil areas, zones at risk
    of desertification, and poor land use. The employment of AI at the service of
    agriculture can decrease crop losses and waste, lower the inputs onto the soil
    of fertilizers, responsible for the increase of Greenhouse Gases. It could be
    useful to help the small farmers (at a local scale) and also the policy-makers
    and farmers’ cooperatives (at the regional scale) to take valid and coordinated
    countermeasures to improve the correct use of the lands, helping to contrast and
    adapt to climate change. Keywords cocoa farmers; low-cost smart agriculture; remote

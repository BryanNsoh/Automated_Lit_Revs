    Abstract: Progress in agricultural productivity and sustainability hinges on strategic
    investments

    in technological research. Evolving technologies such as the Internet of Things,
    sensors, robotics,

    Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, and Cloud Computing are propelling
    the agricul-

    tural sector towards the transformative Agriculture 4.0 paradigm. The present
    systematic literature

    review employs the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
    (PRISMA)

    methodology to explore the usage of Machine Learning in agriculture. The study
    investigates the

    foremost applications of Machine Learning, including crop, water, soil, and animal
    management,

    revealing its important role in revolutionising traditional agricultural practices.
    Furthermore, it

    assesses the substantial impacts and outcomes of Machine Learning adoption and
    highlights some

    challenges associated with its integration in agricultural systems. This review
    not only provides

    valuable insights into the current landscape of Machine Learning applications
    in agriculture, but it

    also outlines promising directions for future research and innovation in this
    rapidly evolving ﬁeld.

    Keywords: Agriculture 4.0; machine learning; PRISMA; systematic reviews and meta

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture 4.0 [1–5], also known as “Digital Agricultural Revolution” [6], represents

    a paradigm shift in agriculture, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to optimise
    various

    aspects of farming operations. These technologies encompass the Internet of Things
    (IoT),

    Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, cloud computing, Decision Support System
    (DSS),

    advanced sensing technology, and autonomous robots [1,6,7]. Sensors and robotics
    play a

    crucial role in collecting essential ﬁeld data, which is then transmitted to a
    local or cloud

    server via IoT technology for storage, processing, and analysis. Big data and
    AI-based

    techniques can be used to convert these data into valuable insights. To facilitate
    user

    interaction and informed decision making, a DSS equips users with the necessary
    tools to

    optimise the agricultural system and undertake appropriate actions.

    Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, has shown great potential in enhancing
    various

    aspects of Agriculture 4.0. It can be deﬁned as a computer program or system that
    can

    learn speciﬁc tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so [8–10]. It is
    a process that

    involves the use of a computer to make decisions based on multiple data inputs
    [8]. In this

    case, data mean a set of examples. Labeled data is often used for supervised learning
    tasks

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2976. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13122976

    (where the model learns from labeled examples), and unlabeled data might be used
    for

    unsupervised learning tasks (where the model ﬁnds patterns and structures in the
    data) [9].

    ML indeed beneﬁt from large amounts of data to achieve meaningful accuracy in

    their tasks. In the context of agriculture, obtaining vast and diverse data can
    be sometimes

    challenging yet pivotal for the success of ML models. IoT sensors are instrumental
    in

    collecting a diverse range of agricultural data as they can be strategically deployed
    across

    ﬁelds to capture relevant information regarding, for instance, soil conditions,
    climate

    variables, crop health, and livestock metrics [1]. The widespread adoption of
    IoT technology

    facilitates continuous and real-time data acquisition, enabling the generation
    of extensive

    datasets over time. However, it is essential to consider that the data should
    be collected

    with sufﬁcient quality to ensure its representativeness in the speciﬁc case study
    at hand.

    For instance, in crop management, studying the different stages of the crop is
    important for

    developing models that are accurate and applicable to real-world scenarios. Obtaining
    such

    representative datasets may take time, but it is a necessary investment for the
    effectiveness

    and reliability of ML applications in agriculture. Furthermore, collaborative
    initiatives

    and partnerships with farmers, agricultural institutions, and research organisations
    can

    contribute to the pooling of data resources.

    A general ﬂow for the creation of ML models and their deployment in agriculture
    is

    illustrated in Figure 1. The initial phase involves the retrieval of agricultural
    data from

    diverse sources, forming the foundational input for subsequent ML processes. These
    data

    are then divided into ‘training’ and ‘testing’ datasets. The training dataset
    becomes the

    substrate for instructing the ML model, while the testing dataset serves as an
    evaluation

    mechanism, assessing the model’s performance and ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

    The outcome of these processes is a robust ML model capable of making classiﬁcations,
    pre-

    dictions, or decisions tailored to speciﬁc agricultural contexts. Subsequently,
    the validated

    model is ready for deployment across various agricultural domains, including crop
    (i.e.,

    optimising crop yields and health), water (i.e., ensuring efﬁcient utilisation
    of irrigation

    resources), soil (i.e., maintaining soil health and fertility), and animal management
    (i.e.,

    monitoring and improving livestock health and productivity).

    Figure 1. General flow for the creation of Machine Learning models and their application
    in agriculture.

    Several prevalent ML algorithms have emerged within the context of Agriculture
    4.0.

    These encompass well-known methods such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector
    Ma-

    chine (SVM), Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), and an array of Deep Learning (DL)

    variations [1]. These algorithms play a key role in reshaping the agricultural
    domain,

    taking innovation and efﬁciency to new heights. While there has been extensive
    literature

    discussing the potential of ML in agriculture, the existing body of work often
    lacks a sys-

    tematic and consolidated overview of the applications, impacts, outcomes, and
    challenges

    of ML integration in this dynamic ﬁeld. A review made by [9] concluded that 61%
    of

    the analysed articles used ML techniques for crop management (22% disease detection,

    20% yield prediction, 8% weed detection, 8% crop quality, and 3% species recognition),

    19% for livestock management (12% livestock production and 7% animal welfare),
    10%

    for soil management, and 10% for water management. Inspired by this study, the
    search

    for a current and comprehensive understanding of the landscape of ML applications
    in

    agriculture motivated the undertaking of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
    in 2023.

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2976

    3 of 27

    This effort seeks to elucidate the latest advances, trends, and challenges in
    this dynamic

    ﬁeld, with the aim of contributing valuable insights to the agricultural research
    community.

    The present SLR, conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology [11,12], addresses this

    research gap by providing a meticulous analysis of the state-of-the-art applications
    of ML in

    agriculture. By doing so, this review not only contributes to the existing body
    of knowledge,

    but it also offers valuable insights to researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders
    aiming to

    leverage ML technologies for sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural practices.
    PRISMA is

    internationally recognised for its systematic framework, which effectively mitigates
    bias

    and increases the reliability of systematic reviews by providing a structured
    protocol for

    the identiﬁcation, selection, and synthesis of studies. Adhering to the PRISMA
    guidelines

    was fundamental to maintaining the highest standards of methodological rigor,
    leading

    to an overall improvement in the validity and reliability of the results. To help
    guide this

    review, the following research questions were formulated:

    •

    RQ1: What are the most used ML algorithms in agriculture?

    •

    RQ2: What are the impacts and outcomes of integrating ML in agriculture?

    •

    RQ3: What are the challenges and future directions associated with integrating
    ML in

    agriculture and agricultural systems?

    The present document is organised as follows: Section 2 (Principles and Methods)

    details the PRISMA methodology, including the search strategy, inclusion, and
    exclusion

    criteria, data extraction process, and quality assessment of selected studies.
    Section 3

    (Results and Discussion) discusses the results of the SLR. Section 4 (Machine
    Learning

    Trends) presents the most used ML models and algorithms of the SLR. Section 5
    (Machine

    Learning in Agriculture) provides an overview of the ML techniques used, as well
    as

    speciﬁc applications, according to the domains outlined in Section 3. Section
    6 (Challenges

    and Research Opportunities) discusses the challenges associated with implementing
    ML

    in agricultural systems. Finally, Section 7 (Conclusions, Limitations, and Future
    Work)

    summarises the main ﬁndings of the present SLR and how they contribute to the
    current

    understanding of ML in agriculture.

    2. Principles and Methods

    This SLR adheres to the well-established PRISMA guidelines, which describes how

    to collect and analyse data from available studies. The PRISMA Statement is a
    systematic

    framework encompassing 27 items in the form of a checklist, along with a four-phase

    ﬂow diagram that serves as an invaluable tool for guiding researchers in the preparation

    of reviews and meta-analyses [11]. In the present section, each phase of the systematic

    review process is detailed, seamlessly aligned with the four fundamental phases
    outlined

    in the PRISMA methodology. These include the identiﬁcation (Section 2.1), screening

    (Section 2.2), eligibility (Section 2.3), and inclusion phase (Section 2.4). Lastly,
    an overview

    of the PRISMA framework itself (Section 2.5) is provided, offering a holistic
    understanding

    of the structured approach adopted in this study.

    2.1. Identiﬁcation Phase

    The identification phase represents the initial identification of records via
    various sources.

    To facilitate this step, a search string was formulated (Table 1). Final string:
    (“Agricultur*” OR

    “Farm*”) AND (“Machine Learning”) AND (“application” OR “implementation” OR “case

    study” OR “experimental” OR “practical”).

    The search encompassed records indexed in the speciﬁed repositories (Web of Science

    (WoS) and Scopus) up until the 1st of July, 2023, and the search string was adjusted
    to the

    syntax of each digital repository. The wildcard symbol (“*”) was incorporated
    at the end

    of certain words in the search string, enabling the retrieval of all possible
    variants of the

    respective term. The boolean “AND” was employed to connect keywords originating
    from

    different groups within the search string, while “OR” was used to link keywords
    within

    the same group.

    Additionally, some inclusion criteria were considered (Table 2) in order to meet
    what

    is intended in this study.

    In IC1, the digital repositories WoS and Scopus were selected as they are highly
    valued

    databases, due to their scientiﬁc and technical content, but also because they
    are closely

    related to the areas of knowledge associated with the objective of this article.
    The chosen

    search period, in IC2, was determined based on the signiﬁcant progress and contributions

    to the ﬁeld of integrating ML in the agricultural sector. Regarding IC3, the restriction
    to

    examining article titles, abstracts, and keywords was made with careful deliberation.
    This

    focused approach is predicated on the premise that these sections encapsulate
    succinct yet

    crucial information regarding the content and relevance of the articles, thereby
    facilitating

    the efﬁcient identiﬁcation of the pertinent literature. In IC4, the emphasis on
    scientiﬁc

    journal articles stems from a strategic assessment of the academic landscape in
    the speciﬁc

    domain of interest as they generally have a greater impact than other types of
    documents.

    Lastly, in IC5, the selection of English as the exclusive language criterion arises
    from its

    ubiquitous adoption as the lingua franca of global scientiﬁc discourse.

    2.2. Screening Phase

    In the screening phase, a systematic process is employed to evaluate the identiﬁed

    records against the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 3).
    The decision

    to focus exclusively on Q1 journal articles reﬂects a commitment to ensure the
    highest

    standard of research quality.

    2.5. PRISMA Overview

    Following the PRISMA guidelines, an initial screening process involved searching

    the repositories WoS and Scopus, resulting in a total of 4580 articles matching
    the search

    string from Table 1. Through a rigorous screening and eligibility phase (Tables
    3 and 4,

    respectively), a ﬁnal selection of 272 articles was identiﬁed for in-depth analysis.

    (SC4), prioritisation

    of content relevant to agriculture (EC1) and Machine Learning applications (EC2),
    and inclusion of

    full-text versions (EC3).

    3. Results and Discussion

    3.1. Statistical Analysis

    The number of publications by year and country are represented in Figures 3 and
    4,

    respectively. According to Figure 3, the number of publications in the WoS and
    Scopus

    databases has generally increased over the years, with a signiﬁcant jump from
    2019 to 2020

    and a consistent upward trend until 2022.

    In Figure 3, the pre-PRISMA analysis of WoS publications showed steady growth,

    from 274 in 2019 to a peak of 862 in 2022. This trend indicates a growing interest
    in research

    efforts of ML science in agriculture during this period. Scopus publications exhibited
    a

    parallel increase, starting at 408 in 2019 and culminating at 1127 in 2022. This
    upward trend

    can be attributed to signiﬁcant advancements in advanced technologies that have
    emerged

    within the agricultural sector, owing to the emergence and widespread acceptance
    of the

    Agriculture 4.0 paradigm [1]. However, it is important to note that in 2023, there
    was a

    decrease in the number of publications compared to the previous year. This decrease
    can

    be attributed to the fact that the search was conducted in the beginning of July
    2023 and

    the data do not capture the full extent of publications for the entire year.

    By examining these trends, we have uncovered a compelling narrative of how research

    efforts have evolved in tandem with the technological landscape. Technological
    advances

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2976

    6 of 27

    and their adoption in the agricultural sector have played a key role in driving
    this increase

    in interest and research activity. Notable advances in IoT, sensors, and robotics
    have

    catalysed the adoption of ML in various facets of agriculture. In addition, political
    changes,

    economic ﬂuctuations, and global events may have inﬂuenced the trajectory of research
    in

    this ﬁeld. Lastly, the application of the PRISMA methodology has resulted in a
    noticeable

    reduction in the overall count of publications for each year. While this might
    initially

    appear as a decrement, it signiﬁes an intentional effort to ensure a higher and
    more reliable

    quality of studies. This approach reinforces the credibility and validity of the
    selected

    research, ultimately enhancing the robustness of the systematic review.

    Figure 3. Distribution of the selected publications by year (before and after
    PRISMA).

    Furthermore, Figure 4 highlights the top seven countries that have made substantial

    contributions in terms of published articles. Before PRISMA, the number of publications

    in the WoS database varies for each country, with China having the highest count
    of 619,

    followed by the United States of America (USA) with 552 and India with 305. The
    number

    of publications in the Scopus database also varies for each country, with India
    having the

    highest count of 882, followed by China with 654 and the United States with 541.
    After

    PRISMA, China and the United States lead the pack in terms of publication output,
    with 96

    and 30 publications, respectively. On the other hand, countries such as India,
    Australia, the

    United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and Italy have relatively lower publication counts.
    These

    nuanced insights into the geographical distribution of research contributions
    enrich the

    understanding of the global landscape of ML applications in agriculture, underlining
    the

    need for international collaboration and knowledge exchange in this dynamic ﬁeld.

    Regarding the journals, the present SLR included 272 papers from 62 different
    journals.

    Figure 5 illustrates the top 10 journals, along with the corresponding counts
    of publications

    from each journal. From this analysis, “Remote Sensing” had the highest count
    of publica-

    tions with 73 publications, followed by “Computers and Electronics in Agriculture”
    with

    46 publications and “Agricultural Water Management” with 14 publications. It is
    further

    stated that the mean impact factor (Clarivate [13]) is 6.22, indicating the average
    inﬂuence

    of the journals. The range of impact factors spans from a minimum of 2.4 (Journal:
    “Mathe-

    matics”) to a maximum of 16.6 (Journal: “Nature Communications”). This range highlights

    the diversity of inﬂuence of the selected journals, which signiﬁes the breadth
    and depth

    of academic engagement in this ﬁeld. These insights not only enrich the understanding

    of the academic landscape, but it also serves as a testimony to the rigor and
    quality of the

    research efforts encompassed in this analysis.

    PRISMA).

    Figure 5. Distribution of the top 10 journals (after PRISMA).

    At last, Figure 6 shows the count of publications in various categories (according

    to Clarivate [13]). The category “Geosciences” has the highest count of publications,

    with 82 publications. “Agriculture” is the second-highest category, with 55 publications,

    followed by “Agronomy” with 23 publications. This categorical distribution of
    publications

    provides valuable information on the various domains that intersect with ML applications

    in agriculture. It highlights the multifaceted nature of research efforts in this
    ﬁeld and

    underlines the key role of interdisciplinary collaboration in the realisation
    of Agriculture 4.0

    and the advancement of agricultural technologies.

    3.2. Application Domains in Agriculture

    The distribution of application domains in agriculture, based on the SLR, is represented

    in Figure 7.

    Figure 7. Distribution of application domains in agriculture (after PRISMA): crop,
    water, soil, and

    animal management.

    As it is possible to see, the largest portion, accounting for 74.6%, is dedicated
    to

    Crop management. The Water management domain represents 21.7%, followed by the
    Soil

    management and Animal management domains, with 16.5% and 12.5%, respectively.
    The

    total percentage of each domain represents the proportion of articles that primarily
    focus

    on that speciﬁc domain. However, certain articles can be multidisciplinary in
    nature,

    addressing more than one domain within the agricultural context. Furthermore,
    ﬁve sub-

    domains were outlined, representing a distinct area of focus within the crop domain:
    Crop

    quality (33.8%), Crop mapping/recognition (27.9%), Crop yield (20.6%), Crop disease
    (8.8%), and

    Pest/weed detection (1.8%).

    Moreover, it was possible to identify the most used crops and animals in this
    analysis:

    •

    Crop type:

    –

    “Plants” with 46.36% of the total count. In this group, it is possible to ﬁnd
    the

    following: wheat (13.91%), maize (12.17%), rice (6.09%), vineyards (3.04%), grass

    (3.04%), rapeseed (2.61%), sugarcane (2.17%), tea (1.74%), cotton (0.87%), peach

    leaf (0.87%), alfalfa (0.87%), bok choy (0.43%), barley (0.43%), Arabidopsis (0.43%),

    jujube (0.43%), parsley (0.43%), green coffee plant (0.43%), mushrooms (0.43%),

    oil palm leaf (0.43%), almond orchard (0.43%), and banana leaf (0.43%);

    –

    The meticulous analysis of crop and animal types provides valuable insights into

    prevailing trends and focus areas for ML applications in agriculture. The prominence
    of

    “Plants” as the most studied crop category underlines the crucial role of ML in
    optimising

    various plant-based agricultural practices. Wheat, maize, and rice emerge as the
    main

    areas of focus, reﬂecting the importance of staple crops in agricultural research.
    In addition,

    the inclusion of specialty crops, such as vineyards and tea, exempliﬁes the diversity
    of

    agricultural contexts in which ML-based interventions are making substantial contributions.

    In the animal context, cows dominate the category, followed by poultry and sheep.
    The

    prevalence of interdisciplinary approaches in Agriculture 4.0 is evident in the
    analysis. In

    addition to traditional crops and livestock, the inclusion of categories such
    as bees and

    invasive insects demonstrates the innovative application of ML in various agricultural

    contexts, from agriculture to pest management.

    4. Machine Learning Trends

    The present section provides crucial insights towards answering to RQ1 (What are

    the most used ML algorithms in agriculture?). As it is known, various ML algorithms
    can be

    used for statistical modeling, data analysis, classiﬁcation, regression, and dimensionality

    reduction processes. In the context of this SLR, Figure 8 provides an overview
    of the most

    used ML algorithms employed in the agricultural scope.

    From the analysis of Figure 8, RF [14,15] emerges as the most widely used ML algo-

    rithm, representing 19.2% of the overall distribution. Its versatility and robustness
    make it

    a favored choice for handling complex problems. SVM [16,17] ranks second with
    15.9% as

    it is known for their effectiveness in both classiﬁcation and regression tasks.
    The Gradient

    Boosted Tree (GBT) [18,19] (8.3%), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [20,21]
    (7.3%)

    also demonstrate signiﬁcant usage and adoption in the agricultural sector. In
    descend-

    ing order of frequency, the ML approach categories present in the SLR, as well
    as their

    respective algorithms, are:

    1.

    Ensemble Learning: this category has the largest percentage in the SLR with 35.6%
    of

    the total distribution. Ensemble Learning [22–24] emerges as a key force for improving

    the performance and generalisation of ML models, making them more robust and

    reliable. This category includes RF (19.2%, frequency: 127), GBT (8.3%, frequency:

    55), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) (4.5%, frequency: 30), AdaBoost (0.9%,

    frequency: 6), Bagging (0.8%, frequency: 5), CatBoost (0.6%, frequency: 4), Stacking

    (0.3%, frequency: 2), and “not speciﬁed” ensemble methods (0.3%, frequency: 2).
    Of

    all the algorithms within this category, the RF presents the highest frequency.
    While

    the Decision Tree (DT) [25] offers a simple and interpretable model, RF leverages
    the

    power of multiple DT to provide robust predictions and classiﬁcations that are
    crucial

    for the optimisation of various agricultural processes. These processes can include

    crop yield estimation, disease detection, and land cover classiﬁcation based on
    remote

    sensing data.

    2.

    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks: the second category within the scope of this SLR consti-

    tutes 24.9% of the overall content and encompasses a range of inﬂuential algorithms

    that fall under the domain of ANN [26,27]. The algorithms covered in this category

    include CNN (7.3%, frequency: 48), ANN-not speciﬁed (6.4%, frequency: 42), Long

    Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (3.0%, frequency: 20), Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

    (1.8%, frequency: 12), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (1.7%, frequency: 11), You
    Only

    Look Once (YOLO) (1.2%, frequency: 8), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) (0.9%,

    quency: 6), DL-not speciﬁed (0.6%, frequency: 4), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (0.5%,

    frequency: 3), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) (0.3%, frequency: 2), Generative

    Adversarial Networks (GAN) (0.2%, frequency: 1), and Encoder and Autoencoder

    (0.2%, frequency: 1). These algorithms are powerful tools capable of learning
    complex

    patterns, thereby facilitating accurate predictions and advancing the capabilities
    of

    numerous applications. Among these algorithms, the one that stands out the most
    is

    CNN, known to be specialised for image data analysis [28], making them valuable
    for

    tasks like crop disease identiﬁcation, plant species recognition, and weed detection
    [1].

    3.

    Support Vector Machine: the third most prominent category, accounting for 15.9%

    (frequency: 105), is the SVM. This algorithm holds signiﬁcant popularity and

    widespread application for tasks encompassing both classiﬁcation and regression

    procedures [29]. SVM underscores its signiﬁcance in guiding informed decisions

    for bolstering agricultural productivity in the era of Agriculture 4.0 [1]. Through
    its

    adeptness in crop mapping, yield estimation, and disease detection, SVM contributes

    to the ongoing transformation of agriculture into a more precise, efﬁcient, and
    re-

    silient practice, aligning seamlessly with the evolving demands of a dynamic global

    food landscape.

    4.

    Dimensionality Reduction: this category represents 6.2% of the total distribution

    and includes three different algorithms that can aid in dimensionality reduction
    [30]

    and feature engineering [31] from agricultural datasets, namely Partial Least
    Squares

    (PLS) algorithm (3.9%, frequency: 26), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (1.2%,

    frequency: 8), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm (1.1%, frequency:
    7).

    5.

    Generalised Linear Models: comprising 6.0% of the total distribution, this category

    underscores the signiﬁcance of statistical models that transcend the constraints
    of

    simple linear regression. Of this category are Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    (2.3%,

    frequency: 15), Logistic Regression (1.4%, frequency: 9), Ridge Regression (1.2%,

    frequency: 8), Cubist Regression (0.8%, frequency: 5), and Multivariate Adaptive

    Regression Splines (MARS) (0.3%, frequency: 2).

    6.

    Nearest Neighbour: this category exclusively employs the k-Nearest Neighbors

    (KNN) algorithm (4.5%, frequency: 30). Among the various algorithms in the ﬁeld
    of

    ML, the KNN algorithm stands out as one of the simplest yet extensively employed

    methods for classiﬁcation purposes [32,33]. Its adaptive and comprehensible design

    contributes to its popularity in various classiﬁcation tasks.

    7.

    Bayesian Models: this category focuses on Gaussian distributions and probabilistic

    models. These methods leverage the principles of Gaussian processes [34] (2.0%,

    frequency: 13) and Naïve Bayes (NB) [35] (2.3%, frequency: 15). These techniques

    offer solutions that adapt to the complexities of diverse datasets and applications.

    8.

    Decision Trees: constituting 4.1% (frequency: 27) of the overall distribution,
    these tree-

    like structure algorithms are versatile tools that facilitate data-driven decisions
    [25].

    9.

    Multi-task Learning: represents 0.3% (frequency: 2) of the total distribution
    and

    its objective is to enhance the outcomes of several interconnected learning tasks
    by

    utilising valuable insights shared among them [36,37].

    5. Machine Learning in Agriculture

    The current section is dedicated to addressing RQ2 (What are the impacts and outcomes

    of integrating ML in agriculture?), with a detailed analysis of the distribution
    of application

    domains in agriculture (as mentioned in Section 3.2). For each domain (and sub-domain,

    in the case of crop management), the authors selected ﬁve to seven articles based
    on their

    relevance, impact, and ability to provide insights that contribute to the overall
    understand-

    ing of the subject. This sample size is considered reasonable as it allows for
    the inclusion

    of key ﬁndings and trends within each domain without overwhelming the review with

    an exhaustive list of articles. Section 5.5 summarises the main ﬁndings from each
    domain,

    providing a brief overview of the impact that ML technologies have had on modernising

    agricultural practices.

    5.1. Crop Management Domain

    Crop management is associated to several agricultural practices that profoundly

    inﬂuence the growth and yield of cultivated crops. These practices encompass a
    wide

    range of activities, starting with the meticulous sowing process, extending to
    the vigilant

    maintenance of crops throughout their growth and development phases, and concluding

    with the phases of harvest [1]. The optimisation of crop management strategies
    is essential

    to increase agricultural productivity, thereby addressing the escalating global
    requisites for

    sustenance, textile ﬁbers, energy sources, and fundamental raw materials [38].

    According to Figure 7, the crop management domain has the largest portion, account-

    ing for 74.6%, of the study. This ﬁnding indicates that the application of ML
    techniques in

    crop management has signiﬁcantly revolutionised conventional farming practices,
    offering

    capabilities such as crop mapping and recognition, yield prediction, optimal irrigation

    scheduling, pest and weed management, and disease detection [1]. From the 272
    articles

    included in the SLR, 203 articles are related to crop, where 92 are related to
    crop quality,

    76 to crop mapping/recognition, 56 to crop yield, 24 to crop disease, and ﬁve
    to pest and

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2976

    12 of 27

    weed detection. We delve into each sub-domain to highlight their speciﬁc contributions
    to

    crop management and their impact on enhancing agricultural practices.

    5.1.1. Crop Quality

    Within this study, crop quality refers to the characteristics of crops that determine
    their

    value and suitability. Improving crop quality via ML involves monitoring and managing

    crop’s growth, nutrient levels, organoleptic characteristics, and others parameters.

    By examining Table 5, it becomes evident that ML-based techniques have harnessed

    their computational prowess to effectively manage complex datasets encompassing
    a wide

    range of crop attributes (such as spanning size, appearance, and sensory characteristics).

    The synergy between cutting-edge ML algorithms and real-time data, including images
    and

    meteorological information, has propelled substantial advancements in the agricultural

    sector. This convergence has unlocked remarkable progress, allowing for more precise

    evaluations of crop quality based on current conditions and attributes. Furthermore,
    ML

    methods demonstrate their adaptability by excelling in the prediction and evaluation

    of crop quality using non-destructive approaches. This innovative strategy obviates
    the

    need for intrusive testing while simultaneously facilitating seamless real-time
    quality

    control throughout the supply chain. This paradigm shift enhances the efﬁciency
    of

    crop management and distribution, underscoring the transformative potential of
    ML in

    optimising agricultural processes.

    5.1.2. Crop Mapping and Recognition

    Crop mapping and recognition refers to the process of identifying and mapping

    different crop types within agricultural ﬁelds. It involves using various data
    sources

    (such as satellite imagery, aerial and/or proximal photography, and spectroscopy)
    to

    detect and classify different crops and their spatial distribution. With ML techniques,
    it is

    possible to create accurate and detailed crop maps and identify the unique characteristics

    of each crop, which can be valuable for agricultural planning, resource management,
    and

    yield estimation.

    Drawing insights from Table 6, it becomes evident that the application of ML-based

    techniques extends its computational capabilities into the domain of crop mapping
    and

    recognition, revolutionising how agricultural landscapes are understood and managed.

    The ability to process intricate data, coupled with real-time insights, enhances
    the precision

    and efﬁciency with which crop types and distributions are identiﬁed. Furthermore,
    by

    harnessing methodologies such as DL and established ML algorithms, these studies
    under-

    score the potential to effectively distinguish speciﬁc crop varieties with a commendable

    level of accuracy.

    over 90% overall accuracy for classifying corn and soybeans at the end of the
    season, as

    well as a satisfactory performance (85% overall accuracy) one to four weeks earlier
    than

    calendar-based approaches during the growing season.

    5.1.3. Crop Yield

    Crop yield refers to the quantity of agricultural produce obtained from a speciﬁc
    area

    of land during a growing season. Ensuring high crop yields is of utmost importance
    for

    addressing global food challenges and meeting the demands of a growing population
    [38].

    There has been a growing application of ML methods to estimate crop yield, aiming
    to

    facilitate farming planning, resource allocation (such as water, fertilisers,
    and pesticides),

    enhance storage management and marketing strategies, and tackle the pressing challenges

    of food security in the forthcoming years [1].

    Reﬂecting upon the compilation detailed in Table 7, it becomes apparent that the

    application of ML-based methodologies showcase the potential to predict crop yields
    with

    remarkable accuracy. By integrating diverse data sources like remote sensing imagery,

    meteorological data, and canopy geometric parameters, these models not only provide

    insight into crop yield, but it also highlights the interplay of various factors
    inﬂuencing the

    agricultural output.

    respectively). The results offer valuable insights into site-speciﬁc crop management

    and could aid in formulating water and nitrogen management strategies for global

    food security.

    5.1.4. Crop Disease

    Crop disease refers to the study and management of various diseases that affect

    agricultural crops, leading to reduced yields and economic losses for farmers
    and the

    agricultural industry as a whole.

    The use of ML-based techniques have proven to be key strategies in crop disease

    management, as highlighted in Table 8. Several techniques are applied to discern
    disease

    patterns, anticipate outbreaks, and implement targeted interventions, thereby
    offering

    a promising avenue for detection, diagnosis, and control of crop diseases [1].
    Through

    the fusion of ML models with diverse data sources, such as IoT-generated data
    and satel-

    lite and UAV imagery, these studies showcase the capacity to accurately categorise
    and

    even before visible symptoms appear.

    5.1.5. Pest and Weed Detection

    Instances of crop pest infestations, ranging from weeds, insects, pathogens, and

    rodents [65], have emerged as factors affecting global agricultural production.
    This sub-

    domain focuses on the utilisation of advanced technologies, such as sensors, imaging

    systems, and ML algorithms, to detect and mitigate the presence of unwanted organisms

    that can negatively impact crop growth and yield.

    From Table 9, it is possible to understand that ML techniques can help analyse
    complex

    data from various sources (such as satellites, UAV, or sensors) and identify patterns
    and

    anomalies associated with pest and weed presence that may not be easily recognisable

    to the human eye. ML-powered systems can detect pests and weeds at their early
    stages,

    enabling swift intervention before infestations become widespread [1].

    5.2. Water Management Domain

    As water resources become increasingly ﬁnite and their management more complex,

    the fusion of cutting-edge technology with robust data analytics holds great promise
    in

    promoting more sustainable water management practices. IoT technology, sensors
    and

    actuators networks, data analytics, and predictive models have enabled farmers
    to monitor

    water quality, soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and Crop Evapotranspiration
    (ETc)

    rates [71].

    As demonstrated in this current study, the water management domain represents

    21.7% of the study (Figure 7), highlighting its signiﬁcance in agricultural applications.

    Table 10 exempliﬁes the utilisation of an array of ML algorithms, coupled with
    remote and

    proximal sensing techniques as well as innovative IoT technologies, to address
    diverse

    water-related challenges encompassing irrigation management, water quality surveillance,

    making in intensive agricultural regions.

    5.3. Soil Management Domain

    Agricultural land is the extent of land considered suitable for agricultural production,

    covering both crop cultivation and livestock rearing [1]. By embracing the principles
    of

    Agriculture 4.0, the integration of IoT sensors for real-time parameter measurements,
    AI-

    driven data analysis techniques, and DSS for informed decision making equips farmers

    with the tools to effectively oversee their ﬁelds in a manner that is both efﬁcient
    and

    sustainable [1,79]. ML-based techniques can process vast amounts of soil-related
    data

    (such as soil composition, texture, and moisture measurements) and generate insights
    into

    optimal irrigation schedules, nutrient management strategies, and soil health
    assessments.

    In the present study, the soil management domain represents 16.5% of the entirety,

    as illustrated in Figure 7, and refers to the study and management of soil properties,

    composition, and conditions within agricultural systems. As is clear from Table
    11, ML

    techniques possess the ability to predict soil properties and behaviours, empowering

    farmers to make well-informed choices pertaining to soil fertility, structure,
    moisture levels,

    and nutrient concentrations, all aimed at enhancing crop growth and yield. Additionally,

    by leveraging computer vision and the remote sensing data, ML simpliﬁes the monitoring

    of both crops and soil conditions. This technological synergy allows for a comprehensive

    assessment of crop health, growth stages, and potential stressors. Beyond remote
    sensing,

    one particularly notable application of ML involves the utilisation of cell phone
    images, as

    demonstrated in the study by [80]. This innovative approach showcases the potential
    of

    ML to develop efﬁcient proximal soil sensors capable of swiftly and accurately
    predicting

    crucial soil properties. By harnessing readily available technology, this advancement

    exempliﬁes the adaptability and practicality of ML solutions in modern soil management

    practices. This not only exempliﬁes the adaptability and practicality of ML solutions
    in

    modern soil management practices, but it also underscores the transformative impact
    that

    technology-driven approaches can have on agricultural sustainability.

    Boost is recommended for accurate soil gravimetric water content and bulk density

    estimation, while GBT is suggested for precise volumetric water content and soil
    salt

    content prediction.

    5.4. Animal Management Domain

    Animal (livestock and aquatic) production is a crucial part of agriculture, not
    only

    because it provides food and dairy products, but it also supplies other high-quality
    goods,

    such as wool and leather. Global demand for animal products is expected to increase

    further due to population growth [38], meaning that agrifood industries must optimise

    production practices by ensuring the welfare and safety of animals and increasing
    the

    capacity to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat animal diseases. Considering
    this, there is a

    growing awareness that animal management can no longer be performed via traditional

    means and requires the adoption of new digital technologies.

    The present SLR shows that the animal management domain comprises 12.5% of the

    research scope (Figure 7). The contents of Table 12 encompass a selection of seven
    articles

    dedicated to the utilisation of ML techniques in the domain of animal management.
    Smart

    animal monitoring systems have been viewed with great interest in the academic
    commu-

    nity, agrifood industries, and markets. Sensor-based animal wearables, computer
    vision

    systems, and other detection devices can capture the status of animals and environment

    in real time, which can be analysed afterwards with the aid of AI-based mechanisms
    to

    control and predict animals’ health, welfare, production, etc. Livestock monitoring
    includes

    information related to animals’ behaviour, physiology, clinical status, and performance
    [87],

    while in aquaculture, the desired information is more focused on water quality
    (water

    temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen content, ammonia, salt, etc.) [88,89].

    sector. By leveraging data-driven insights and advanced computational techniques,
    ML-

    based technologies are poised to further revolutionise the agricultural sector,
    driving

    efﬁciency, sustainability, and productivity to new heights [1].

    5.5.1. Crop Management

    ML techniques have demonstrated remarkable proﬁciency in evaluating crop qual-

    ity attributes, enabling precise assessments without invasive testing. Additionally,
    they

    speciﬁc crop varieties within agricultural landscapes. Moreover, ML-driven models
    ex-

    hibit exceptional capabilities in predicting crop yields by integrating diverse
    data sources,

    offering valuable insights into factors inﬂuencing the agricultural output. Additionally,
    ML-

    powered solutions have emerged as powerful tools for disease, pest, and weed detection.

    By leveraging satellite imagery and IoT-generated data, these models excel in
    accurately

    categorising and identifying diseases, pests, and weeds. This capability enables
    timely and

    effective interventions, minimising the impact of outbreaks on crop yield.

    5.5.2. Water Management

    Through the integration of advanced sensing techniques, coupled with IoT tech-

    nologies, ML algorithms demonstrate exceptional proﬁciency in optimising water-related

    practices. Precision irrigation is a prominent application, where ML models suggest
    precise

    schedules based on data processed in real-time. In addition, these models excel
    at vigi-

    lantly monitoring water quality, ensuring that crops receive water with an optimal
    nutrient

    composition. Furthermore, ML-driven predictions of crop evapotranspiration rates
    offer

    valuable information on water requirements, facilitating a more sustainable approach
    to

    irrigation practices.

    5.5.3. Soil Management

    ML techniques have proven valuable in predicting soil properties, allowing farmers,

    researchers, and stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding soil fertility,
    moisture

    levels, and nutrient concentrations. By assimilating data from various sources,
    ML models

    provide valuable insights into the dynamic nature of soil behaviour, allowing
    for proactive

    adjustments in farming practices to ensure optimal conditions for crop growth
    and yield.

    Additionally, via the application of computer vision and remote sensing data,
    ML simpliﬁes

    the monitoring of both crops and soil conditions by offering timely information
    on crop

    health, growth stages, and potential stressors.

    5.5.4. Animal Management

    The integration of ML with smart animal monitoring systems represents a signiﬁcant

    leap forward in enhancing animal welfare and productivity. This innovative approach

    harnesses sensor-based wearables, computer vision systems, and other detection
    devices

    to capture real-time data on animal status and environmental conditions. ML algorithms,

    in tandem with these advanced technologies, enable the analysis of the captured
    data,

    providing valuable insights into animal health, behaviour, and overall wellbeing.
    This

    data can be processed and interpreted to control and predict various aspects of
    animal

    management, including health, welfare, and production.

    6. Challenges and Research Opportunities

    The present section focuses on answering RQ3 (What are the challenges and future
    direc-

    tions associated with integrating ML in agriculture and agricultural systems?).
    The integration

    of ML in agriculture, although promising, still presents some challenges. In a
    study made

    by [1], various challenges were identiﬁed that need to be addressed to enable
    a successful

    transition towards Agriculture 4.0 paradigm. These are stratiﬁed into ﬁve main
    levels,

    namely device, data, network, application, and system. Of these levels, one that
    relates to

    the implementation of ML in agricultural systems is the data level. Table 13 provides
    an

    overview of some identiﬁed challenges covering a wide range of critical aspects
    related to

    the integration of ML in agriculture, along with possible solutions and further
    research.

    hinder the real-time capabilities of ML applications.

    Optimising data management systems and storage solu-

    tions, ensuring both efﬁciency and security.

    Data accuracy

    Accurate data are critical for training ML models.

    Inaccurate data can lead to incorrect predictions or

    recommendations.

    Ensuring that data are accurate, credible, and trustwor-

    thy by exploring methods for data validation and quality

    assurance.

    Data

    completeness

    Incomplete data may result in biased or incomplete

    ML models. For example, missing data points in

    a crop monitoring dataset may hinder the model’s

    ability to accurately predict crop yield.

    Exploring techniques for data imputation/extrapolation

    to address missing data in agricultural datasets.

    In-

    vestigating methods for optimising models’ perfor-

    mance in the presence of incomplete information (e.g.,

    Feature Engineering).

    Data

    consistency

    Consistent data ensures that ML models are reliable

    and reproducible. For example, inconsistent label-

    ing of images in a crop disease detection dataset

    could lead to incorrect classiﬁcation.

    Exploring data validation and cleaning techniques to en-

    sure consistency in agricultural datasets. Developing tech-

    niques that can identify and rectify inconsistencies.

    Data context

    ML models need to be trained on data that are

    relevant to the speciﬁc agricultural task at hand.

    For example, using weather data from a different

    region may not provide accurate predictions for

    local farming conditions.

    Investigating techniques for adapting ML models based

    on the speciﬁc agricultural context. A possible approach

    could be the use of Transfer Learning as it involves lever-

    aging pre-trained models on similar tasks or domains and

    ﬁne-tuning them using local data.

    Data security

    and privacy

    Agricultural data are often sensitive information

    that requires compliance with data protection

    regulations.

    Exploring mechanisms that encompass data anonymisa-

    tion, access control, and compliance with evolving data

    protection regulations will be crucial in building a founda-

    tion of trust for ML-driven agricultural solutions.

    Data timeliness

    Delayed/outdated data can lead to non-optimal re-

    sults, impeding the potential beneﬁts derived from

    ML-driven insights. However, it should be noted

    that there are scenarios in which historical data can

    be of signiﬁcant use as it can offer invaluable in-

    sight into long-term trends, cyclical patterns, and

    the cumulative effects of farming practices.

    Exploring methods for real-time data acquisition and pro-

    cessing that can adapt and make decisions based on the

    most up-to-date data, ensuring timely responses in ML

    applications. However, depending on the case at hand, a

    hybrid approach can be used, striking a balance between

    integrating real-time and historical data. This involves

    using real-time data for immediate decision making and

    integrating historical data for long-term strategic planning.

    collaboration

    ML-based systems should enhance, rather than re-

    place, human expertise in agriculture. Designing

    systems that facilitate seamless collaboration be-

    tween stakeholders is an emerging area of research.

    Designing collaborative decision making frameworks that

    seamlessly integrate ML insights with human expertise.

    Developing interfaces that empower users to interact with

    and guide ML models in agricultural tasks.

    Interpretability

    and

    explainability

    ML-based systems pose a signiﬁcant challenge

    in gaining the trust and acceptance of farmers,

    stakeholders, and the agricultural industry.

    It

    is important to understand how models achieve

    their outputs.

    Ensuring that ML models are transparent and that their

    inner workings are accessible. This means providing in-

    formation on the features, variables, and algorithms that

    contribute to a model’s results. Techniques such as SHAP

    values [97] or LIME [98] can be useful to identify which

    features are most inﬂuential in a model’s predictions.

    Limited literacy

    Generally, aged workers may have limited literacy

    on digital technologies that could cause resistance

    or difﬁculties in adopting and effectively utilising

    technologies from the Agriculture 4.0.

    Investing on training methods (e.g., workshops, courses),

    knowledge transfer, and skill-building in the context of

    ML-based technologies. Designing user-friendly interfaces

    tailored to older workers.

    Resource

    constraints

    ML-based systems often necessitate real-time pro-

    cessing and decision making. Remote regions or

    resource-constrained enterprises may lack the com-

    putational resources required for data processing.

    Developing lightweight and efﬁcient models that can op-

    erate effectively in low-resource scenarios. Investigating

    techniques for distributed and edge computing.

    7. Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work

    7.1. Conclusions

    Our study revealed notable ﬁndings when addressing RQ1 (What are the most used
    ML

    algorithms in agriculture?). As expected, RF emerged as the most prevalent ML
    algorithm,

    constituting 19.2% of the overall distribution. This popularity can be attributed
    to its

    versatility and robustness, which render it highly adept at handling intricate
    agricultural

    challenges. Following closely, SVM held the second position at 15.9%. Renowned
    for their

    efﬁcacy in both classiﬁcation and regression tasks, SVM have garnered substantial
    traction

    within the agricultural domain. GBT and CNN exhibited noteworthy adoption rates
    of

    8.3% and 7.3%, respectively, further highlighting their signiﬁcance in the agricultural
    sector.

    By answering to RQ2 (What are the impacts and outcomes of integrating ML in agriculture?),

    it was possible to uncover a range of transformative effects arising from the
    integration

    of ML applications in the agricultural domain. Namely, we observed a substantial
    in-

    crease in the efﬁciency of agricultural production attributed to ML-based precision
    farming

    techniques, mainly with regard to advances in resource allocation strategies,
    ensuring

    that inputs such as water, fertilisers, and pesticides are used judiciously. Consequently,

    the environmental footprint of agricultural practices has been positively inﬂuenced
    by

    the incorporation of ML technologies. Through data-driven decision making, farmers

    can implement sustainable practices that reduce resource consumption and limit
    environ-

    mental impacts. For example, ML-powered precision irrigation systems can adaptively

    regulate water use based on real-time soil moisture data, promoting water conservation

    and maintaining optimal soil conditions. In addition, the integration of ML has
    substan-

    tially strengthened the agricultural sector’s capabilities in managing diseases,
    pests, and

    weeds. ML algorithms have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in the early detection
    and

    classiﬁcation of plant diseases, allowing for timely intervention and mitigation
    measures.

    This not only safeguards crop health, but it also mitigates potential yield losses.
    Overall,

    the integration of ML in agriculture represents a paradigm shift, propelling the
    sector

    towards a more efﬁcient, sustainable, and technological future. The beneﬁts go
    beyond

    mere productivity gains, encompassing a holistic transformation of agricultural
    practices

    to align with contemporary food safety and environmental management requirements.

    This bodes well for the resilience and adaptability of the agricultural sector
    in the face of

    evolving global challenges.

    Given the growing potential of ML integration in agriculture, there are several
    open

    issues and promising avenues for future research. By answering RQ3 (What are the
    challenges

    and future directions associated with integrating ML into agriculture and agricultural
    systems?),

    it was possible to identify and explore some of these challenges and provide mitigation

    strategies. These include ensuring adaptable ML models, optimising data accessibility,

    and maintaining data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Contextualising
    data us-

    age, addressing security and privacy concerns, and ensuring timely data are also
    vital.

    Additionally, promoting human–machine collaboration, enhancing interpretability,
    and

    overcoming limited digital literacy among ordinary farmers are essential areas
    for atten-

    tion. It is imperative to design ML applications with user-friendly interfaces
    that require

    minimal technical expertise. Incorporating intuitive visualisations and simple
    dashboards

    can enhance accessibility for farmers with limited literacy. Additionally, outreach
    programs

    and training initiatives tailored to the speciﬁc needs of agricultural communities
    can be im-

    plemented. Workshops, demonstrations, and educational campaigns can empower farmers

    with the knowledge and skills to effectively utilise ML-based technologies in
    their day-to-

    day practices. Moreover, in resource-constrained environments, developing lightweight

    models and exploring distributed computing methods are crucial steps toward a
    successful

    integration of ML in agriculture. Addressing these challenges will lead to a more
    effective

    and widespread implementation of ML technologies in the agricultural sector.

    In summary, the integration of ML in agriculture produces substantial beneﬁts,
    ranging

    from improved agricultural production and resource allocation to the better detection
    of

    diseases and pests and reduced environmental impacts. These advances pave the
    way for

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2976

    23 of 27

    a more sustainable and adaptable agricultural sector, ready to meet the demands
    of the

    future. As data-driven approaches continue to ﬂourish, the agricultural landscape
    is on

    the brink of a more sophisticated and dynamic future, where technology and tradition

    converge harmoniously for the betterment of global agriculture.

    7.2. Limitations

    The extent of this review has been constrained to encompass Q1 articles, inadvertently

    leading to a decrease in the overall count of papers incorporated within the analysis.

    Due to the exclusion criteria used while performing the retrieval of identiﬁed
    research

    from the electronic databases, it is possible that some relevant publications
    might have

    been left out of the study. Hence, it is advisable that forthcoming researchers
    consider a

    broader range of literature sources (for example, ScienceDirect repository) to
    enrich the

    review’s inclusiveness.

    7.3. Future Work

    Future research into the integration of ML in agriculture should focus on harnessing

    different data sources (such as satellite/drone imagery, IoT-based sensor data,
    and weather

    station information) for a better understanding of agricultural systems. In addition,
    the

    integration of ML with robotics and automation presents an opportunity for intelligent,
    self-

    learning systems capable of performing complex tasks for farmers or agricultural
    industries,

    such as the development of autonomous fruit-picking machines. Future efforts should

    focus on creating affordable and scalable ML solutions for regions with limited
    resources,

    ensuring that the beneﬁts of the technology reach smallholder farmers and communities
    in

    developing areas. These research directions will move the ﬁeld forward, leading
    to more

    sustainable, efﬁcient, and resilient agricultural systems. Interdisciplinary collaboration

    between ML experts and professionals from speciﬁc ﬁelds, such as agronomy or chemistry,

    can lead to solutions tailored to agricultural challenges. Lastly, it would be
    interesting

    to carry out in-depth studies assessing the socio-economic impacts of the widespread

    adoption of ML in agriculture, including their effects on employment, economic
    viability,

    and equity in access to technological resources.

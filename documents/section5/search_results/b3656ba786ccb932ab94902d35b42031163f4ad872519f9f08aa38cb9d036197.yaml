  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,

    System 1. Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor,
    aroma, and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany
    and Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical
    applications that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou
    et al., 2022), neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and
    potential benefits for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer
    prevention, menstrual health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016,
    Akhondzadeh et al., 2010, Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed
    to confirm its effectiveness and safety for specific medical conditions. It should
    be used in moderation and under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et
    al., 2011), but its cultivation is characterized by substantial manual labor,
    making it one of the world''s most expensive spices. This study addresses a significant
    research gap in the field, focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles
    et al., 2015) of saffron and the critical environmental factors that influence
    its development. The aim is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron
    production through IoT and addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation,
    which have been relatively understudied in existing literature. The two major
    analytical points are: 1. Optimizing Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding
    the specific environmental requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead
    to improved crop management practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and
    quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse
    cultivation provides more precise control over environmental factors such as light,
    temperature, and humidity, leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared
    to traditional open-field methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing
    research. The five major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering,
    leaf development, daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various
    factors, which have been deduced and summarized from different works as below
    1.1. Temperature Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud
    growth during the first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures,
    but flowering commenced shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005)
    found optimal floral development within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though
    exceeding 150 days resulted in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al.
    (2023) highlighted the crucial role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated
    that lowering the temperature to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions
    (23–27°C) was essential for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported
    by Wang et al. (2020), can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms
    to abort. Notably, their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers
    at all. Further research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal
    temperature fluctuations on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering
    followed by flower initiation in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached
    20°C. Conversely, prolonged hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn
    when temperatures dropped to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh
    et al. (2021) suggests that maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C
    and relative humidity of 65.71% for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient
    flower ontogenesis. However, for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019)
    found that 36 days of incubation at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective.
    Interestingly, both excessive and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting
    period have been linked to decreased saffron production and productivity, as noted
    by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally, chilling periods in December and January,
    with mean aerial temperatures around 2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful
    saffron flowering, according to the findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light
    intensity The role of light intensity in saffron cultivation remains somewhat
    enigmatic, particularly its impact on daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However,
    recent research by Chen et al. (2024) explored the effects of different light
    intensities and red/blue light combinations on saffron plants. Their findings
    suggest that a light intensity of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be
    optimal for maximizing stigma yield, quality, and nutrient content. On the other
    hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020) indicate that higher light intensities can
    compromise stigma yield and quality, despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis.
    Leveraging the wealth of knowledge obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based
    saffron system offers unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation
    by providing precise environmental control, data-driven insights, and adaptive
    management strategies. This integration of technology and scientific understanding
    holds great promise for advancing saffron production efficiency and sustainability
    in the future. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Technologies used The technologies
    that have been used in developing the prototype after considering all of the parameters
    are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller -The sensors used are the DHT11 and
    an LDR -Database management is handled using Google FireBase -The app environment
    was set up and developed using ReactJS Other technologies used by researchers
    in the same field have included Arduino UNOs which are generally more expensive
    than the ESP-32. They have also used separate air moisture and temperature while
    we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both these sensors as one and helps
    reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment. Each of them is explained in
    detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems on a-chip microcontrollers
    features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and is cost-efficient and less
    power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa LX7 dual-core The Tensilica
    Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor, or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor,
    which also has integrated antenna switches, power amplifiers, filters,low-noise
    receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management modules. ESP32 used is shown

    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. (Pinout for LDR sensor and a 10 kohm resistor).
    2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor consists
    of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit microprocessor which
    is used to output the temperature and humidity measurements as data which is serialized
    (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor The most common uses for photoresistors,
    also known as light-dependent resistors (LDR), are expected to discern the presence
    or absence of light or to gauge the power of the light. When the LDR sensor is
    exposed to light, the resistance reduces rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms,
    hinging on the light intensity. In the dark, their resistance is very elevated,
    often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential devices consisting of variable sensitivity
    depending on the wavelength of the input light. Although they are exploited in
    many applications, other gadgets like photodiodes and phototransistors frequently
    perform this light-sensing function. LDR Sensor used is shown in Fig. 3. Download

    (LDR Sensor). 2.1.4. Soil moisture sensor (under implementation) In our current
    prototype of the IoT-based saffron system, we are enhancing its suitability for
    outdoor cultivation conditions by incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition
    will enable real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter
    for optimizing saffron cultivation. By accurately assessing soil moisture content,
    our system can dynamically adjust irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron
    plants receive adequate hydration while preventing overwatering or drought stress.
    This proactive approach not only enhances plant health and productivity but also
    promotes water conservation and sustainability in saffron farming practices. With
    the integration of the soil moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers
    with a robust tool for efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation
    in outdoor settings. 2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored
    app development platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides
    tools to trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and
    create business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using
    Google Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting
    for up to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and
    Android app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with
    Firebase Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users
    and makes it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions.
    These features support email and password authentication, phone authentication,
    and access to Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete
    identity solution. Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free,
    cross-platform messaging app that allows businesses to send and receive messages
    on iOS, Android, and the web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL
    database, synchronization and storage of data between users can be done instantly
    between users. When the app is offline, it is still available because the device
    continues to connect to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash
    reporting tool called Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve
    security issues that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash
    analysis, developers can focus more on building features for their applications
    rather than managing and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance
    Monitoring Tools give developers information about the iOS and Android performance
    of their apps, allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing.
    When application performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android
    apps on multiple connected devices in a single operation. They can view results,
    including screenshots, logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS
    React is an open-source front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating
    user interfaces that are based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js
    or ReactJS. Meta (previously Facebook) and a group of independent programmers
    and businesses are responsible for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation
    for single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks
    like Next.js. React is only concerned with state management and presenting that
    information to the DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates
    the use of extra libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality.
    2.2. Application development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application
    is to display and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help
    to improve on-field work. The designing of the application is done such that it
    is easy for even a layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user
    experience is made by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white
    space and equal margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important
    for demonstrating the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward
    with our research, the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate
    the application''s performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness
    in practical on-field use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React
    JS, which is an open-source front-end JavaScript library used for developing user
    interfaces based on UI components. React can be exploited as a base in the development
    of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications The structure of the appis
    shown in Fig. 3 The application is synced with a real-time Firebase database,
    from which the app gets data simultaneously and displays it on its interface.
    Firebase web APIs (application programming interface) are used to communicate
    between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4 Download : Download high-res
    image (76KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. (App-Development Structure).
    The same server is also responsible for storing data for research and academic
    purposes. Download : Download high-res image (65KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. (Javascript code for DB insertion). The app is integrated with the
    sensors that need to be installed in the field and collects live data that the
    user can access through the app, unlike the existing apps that only have static
    elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data and the data that have
    been collected, the app compares the live data with the optimal data and helps
    farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield. This app currently focuses
    on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help farmers predict which crops
    will be beneficial based on the live conditions of the soil and field. This way,
    production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3. Interface The application interface
    is shown in Fig. 6 Download : Download high-res image (87KB) Download : Download

    to measure the humidity of the surroundings, the value of which is shown in %
    humidity. Temperature:- A DHT11 sensor will be used to measure the temperature
    of the field, and the value will be shown in degrees Celsius. System:- System
    on/off state will be shown if the prototype is switched on/off. 3. Experimentation
    This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based saffron monitoring
    and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment is conducted
    in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped with sensors
    for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture, is installed.
    These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental parameters
    crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured to
    log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization algorithms
    to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions based on saffron
    cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized experimental layout
    with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive optimization recommendations
    generated by the IoT-based system, while control groups do not receive any intervention.
    Throughout a predetermined validation period, environmental parameters and saffron
    growth stages are monitored and recorded. Data analysis focuses on evaluating
    the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based system in providing monitoring
    and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results suggest that the IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively monitors environmental
    parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations. Treatment groups
    receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron growth and
    development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy in enhancing
    saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the advancement
    of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating sustainable
    production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to further refine
    the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities to optimize saffron
    cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future work In the next
    phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into our existing IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition aims to automate irrigation
    by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the saffron cultivation plot. Our
    experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable pump, installing it in the
    cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water based on soil moisture sensor
    readings. We will develop control algorithms to activate the pump when soil moisture
    falls below a predetermined threshold and integrate pump control functionalities
    into our IoT system. Through a series of experiments, we will validate the effectiveness
    of the integrated pump in promoting saffron growth and yield compared to manual
    irrigation methods. By automating irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to
    improve resource efficiency, enhance crop quality, and increase saffron productivity.
    5. Results and discussions This study posits the conceptualization and realization
    of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based application designed for the surveillance
    and regulation of pivotal agronomic parameters, encompassing variables such as
    ambient temperature, relative humidity, and luminance levels. The overarching
    objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges while concurrently augmenting the
    cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant application, characterized by
    its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors the capacity to bolster the
    qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops. A salient hallmark of this
    application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived data, thus serving
    as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers for investigative
    and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently adaptable,
    affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation to the
    cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its current
    purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful Luminous
    intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for the optimum
    range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The paramount aim
    of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural methodologies
    into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious economization
    of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community. A plausible
    extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies within a
    controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    metal pollutionHuman health risk assessment 1. Introduction The increasing demand
    for groundwater presents unprecedented challenges to humankind through its impact
    on humans and ecosystems. The rapid increase of anthropocentric and economic activities
    in India requires concise microscale watershed studies to maintain sustainability
    and avert future water consumption-related risks that may arise from overuse.
    The National Water Policy under governmental initiatives through the ‘National
    Water Mission’ strongly focuses on basin-level management strategies for sustainability
    (NWM, 2012). In this context, regional groundwater assessment is essential to
    address the basinal groundwater amendment issues, which will help policymakers
    mitigate the related risks. Hydrogeochemical changes ascertain the quality of
    the groundwater. They may either have geogenic influences like water-rock interactions,
    ion exchanges, evaporation, etc., or anthropogenic effects like effluent percolation
    from sewer or industrial sites, irrigational return flow, overexploitation, etc.
    (Singh et al., 2018; Ahamad et al., 2019). The nature, extent, and origin of groundwater
    chemistry can be effectively assessed by multivariate statistical techniques (Khairy
    and Janardhana, 2022; Jandu et al., 2021; Muniz et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020).
    An unsupervised learning algorithm, SOM, is an excellent visualization technique
    primarily used by Nguyen et al. (2015) to cluster the hydrogeochemical groundwater
    data and provide an informative overview of the physicochemical parameters. Han
    et al. (2016) applied the method to recognize spatially standardized clusters
    of groundwater levels. This method was also used by combining SOM with stable
    isotopes (Zhu et al., 2020) and cluster analysis using the K-means clustering
    method after estimating quantization and topographic errors (Wu et al., 2021)
    to demonstrate groundwater hydrochemistry and heavy metal migration. Recently,
    researchers have emphasized to comprehend hydrochemistry and groundwater quality
    using GIS techniques, Water Quality Index (WQI) methods, ML techniques, etc. (Ahmad
    and Mazhar, 2020; Ahmadi et al., 2022; Aravinthasamy et al., 2020). However, the
    probable hazard severity benchmark is groundwater suitability, which can be quantifiable
    using different quality indices and recommended standards. The WQIs combined with
    drinking estimation are relatively more common than the estimation of irrigation
    quality. The CCMEWQI is a modified form of WQI offered by the CCME (CCME 2001),
    which incorporates simple calculations and flexibility in choosing the parameters
    and standards for drinking water quality (Sharma et al., 2022). A few literature
    on irrigation quality assessment use various indices (Bozdag, 2015; Simsek and
    Gunduz, 2007; Tyagi and Sarma, 2021; Karunanidhi et al., 2022). Meireles et al.
    (2010) computed the IWQI by considering soil agronomy and crucial parameters for
    quality determination, which is widely used by several researchers (Abbasnia et
    al., 2018; Aravinthasamy et al., 2020; Batarseh et al., 2021). Alluviums are the
    most preferred habitations for civilization in semiarid regions, with plenty of
    water (Zhang et al., 2020). Consequently, the area is prone to anthropogenic contamination,
    where industrial and agricultural effluent may cause heavy metals contamination
    in groundwater (Xiao et al., 2021). Health risk assessment broadly incorporates
    heavy metal concentrations (Raju, 2022), as its effect cannot be ignored. Human
    health hazard Index (HI) estimations show a mathematical representation of such
    toxic elements in the groundwater. In the last decade, studies have widely adopted
    this technique in the previous decade to address global human health risks (Sharma
    et al., 2019; Ahamad et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2021; Rao et al., 2021a). An elevated
    heavy metal concentration that threatens the ecology can be estimated using ecological
    and heavy metal pollution indices (Chaturvedi et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2018; Wen
    et al., 2019; Madhav et al., 2021). The Varuna River basin experienced a 16% rise
    in population from 2001 to 2011, bulging the need for surplus water and groundwater
    draft (Census Report, 2011; Dey et al., 2021a), evident by the increasing number
    of shallow and deep tube wells (MI census Report, 2017). As per the Central Groundwater
    Board report on dynamic groundwater resources of Uttar Pradesh, 51% and 16% are
    in ‘Semi-critical’ and ‘Critical’ situations (UPGWD and CGWB, 2021), which is
    favorable for groundwater contamination and health issues (Sharma et al., 2019;
    Ahamad et al., 2020; Parween et al., 2021). Hence, a basin-level hydrogeochemical
    and related health risk assessment is crucial to upgrade the area to the “Safe”
    category. The importance of water-rock interactions in regulating the hydrogeochemical
    evolution and nitrate and fluoride contamination in the Lower Varuna River basin
    was affirmed by Raju et al. (2009). Some studies also reported the rise in nitrate
    concentration in the Varanasi urban region (Raju et al., 2012). Furthermore, the
    hydrogeochemistry and its health implications owing to the groundwaters of the
    trans-Varuna River basin were studied by Madhav et al. (2021). They emphasized
    that children and infants were particularly at threat of the health effects of
    nitrate exposure. Therefore, the prior research concentrated on certain regions
    of the Varuna River watershed. Hence, the present study aimed to provide the required
    information on hydrogeochemical and groundwater quality determination for the
    entire basin to support the basin-level evaluation in India. To the authors''
    best knowledge, few research is available, and a lack of research-based empirical
    evidence related to hydrogeochemistry, quality, health, and ecological impacts
    of groundwater exists, focusing on the entire river basin. The present study attempts
    to provide proof for concrete and fruitful modification to sustain the natural
    resource with the objectives (1) to understand the hydrogeochemistry and its seasonal
    variation, (2) to recognize and cluster the regional hydrogeochemical conditions,
    (3) to recognize the underlying hydrochemical processes, (4) to evaluate the suitability
    of groundwater for drinking and irrigation purpose, and (5) to estimate the heavy
    metal pollution status and associated human and ecological risk. 1.1. Study area
    The Varuna River basin is part of the central Gangetic Plain and is located (Fig.
    1) between 25°39''28″ and 25°19′44″ North latitude and 81°45''57″ and 82°03′06″
    East longitude. The area has a sub-humid tropical climate, with average rainfall
    between 572 and 897 mm. The plain covers a 3675 sq. km area and encircles a part
    of Varanasi, a well-known pilgrimage destination, and Sant Ravidas Nagar (Bhadohi),
    a famous textile hub. The quaternary alluvium is highly agriculturally productive
    and has frequent irrigation practices. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    Uttar Pradesh, India showing the subsurface profile along the AB section. The
    studied river basin constitutes a foreland basin setting with varied geological
    structures that govern aquifer nature. The geomorphological variation was observed
    with the presence of the T2 surface (Upland Terrace Surface) and T1 surface (the
    River Valley Terraces) (Dey et al., 2021b). Stratigraphically, the area rests
    over the Precambrian Vindhyan Group and Bundelkhand Granites (Shukla et al., 2012).
    This Central-Gangetic Plain is underlain by Quaternary alluvial sediments of the
    Middle Pleistocene to the Holocene with a gentle slope. The alluvial deposits
    are divided into older (Bhangar) and newer (Khadar) alluviums (Shukla and Raju
    2008), which are constituted of Himalayan-acquired greywacke sediments and beds
    of craton-acquired arkosic sand, respectively (Dey et al., 2021a). The aquifers
    supply water for drinking, domestic, and irrigation purposes in rural areas, while
    the urban areas depend more on the semi-confined aquifer for water consumption.
    The depth of the water table varies from 5.83 to 10.8 m and from 2.9 to 8.5 m
    in pre- and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. The top 60–80 m forms the unconfined
    aquifer, mainly consisting of clayey sand, which permits proficient rainwater
    percolation to recharge semiconfined sandy aquifers below. The presence of kankar
    is also intercalated with the clays and sands and forms potential aquifers. The
    deeper aquifer is 200–600 m thick, encompassing the study region''s multifaceted
    aquifers of alternative sand and clay layers (Dey et al., 2021b; Shukla and Raju,
    2008). Several hundred meters to kilometers thick Sand horizons show lateral variation
    and are overlapped by tens of meters wide clayey horizons, which laterally terminate
    against sandy horizons (Dey et al., 2021b; Shukla and Raju, 2008) (Fig. 1). There
    is a strong hydraulic connection between the unconfined and semi-confined aquifer
    in this region, and the primary sources of groundwater recharge are rainfall infiltration,
    river seepage, and irrigation return flow. In contrast, groundwater discharge
    is by pumping, evaporation, and runoff. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Groundwater
    sampling and data acquisition A total of 88 samples were drawn (44 samples per
    season) from groundwater sources in the pre-monsoon (May 2017) and post-monsoon
    season (October 2017). Precleaned polyethylene bottles of 1L were used to collect
    groundwater samples in bore wells after pumping for 10 min. Portable pH, TDS,
    and electrical conductivity meter (Hanna combo meter) was used to measure these
    parameters in groundwater at the sampling sites. Major ion concentrations (Ca2+,
    Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl−, SO42−, NO3−, F−) were examined using an ion chromatograph
    (Metrohm; 930 Compact IC, Switzerland; Metrosep C4 (for cation) and MetrosepA
    Supp.5 (for anion)). HCO3− and Total hardness (TH) were estimated by the titration
    method. The 100 ml samples were filtered using Whatman filter paper (0.45 millipore
    membrane) and further acidified with a few drops of nitric acid to keep heavy
    metals intact. These were stored at 4 °C temperatures before analysis and directly
    aspirated into inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for heavy metals analysis
    (ICP-MS, PerkinElmer Ltd., MA, USA). Five distinct linear concentration standards
    were constructed (1.0 μg/L to 500 μg/L) and inhaled into an ICP-MS system. A linear
    curve with a correlation coefficient >0.99 was created. Samples are then analyzed
    for heavy metals (Cr, Pb, Fe, Al, and Cu). Charge Balance Error (CBE) was maintained
    in all elements within ±10%. 2.2. Multivariate statistical analysis Descriptive
    analysis of the measured variables for each sample ascribed by the maximum, minimum
    values, mean, and standard deviation. At a significance level of 5%, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
    (K–S) normality test was applied further to exhibit seasonal variations. In which
    the variables with ordinary (non-normal) distribution are selected for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
    (U) test, and variables with normal distributions go for the student''s t-test.
    Consequently, PCA was employed in the relationships within the physicochemical
    variables to reduce the data dimensionality to focus on significant contributing
    variables. Before doing the PCA analysis, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (KMO) and
    Bartlett Sphericity Test measurements were applied to establish sampling adequacy.
    The higher KMO value (1) suggests that the analysis may be helpful, and it may
    not be beneficial if the KMO value is less than 0.5. Bartlett''s test of sphericity
    determines if the correlation matrix is either an identity matrix or not, which
    would identify unrelated variables (Fadel et al., 2021). The principal component
    analysis (PCA) diagonalized the data''s correlation matrix by converting the original
    variables into uncorrelated (orthogonal) ones. These transformed variables are
    the weighted linear combinations of the original variables known as principal
    components (PCs). The relative importance of the PCs is determined by the eigenvalues,
    which are a measure of their associated variance and is calculated by solving
    the equation Av = λv, where A is the matrix, v is a non-zero vector, and λ is
    a scalar value called the eigenvalue (Helena et al., 2000). The coefficients of
    the linear combination of the original variables, from which the principal components
    (PCs) are derived, are known as PCA loadings. The loadings are the participation
    of the original variables in the PCs, and the factor scores are the length (i.e.,
    distance to the origin) of the projections of the observations on the components.
    The transformation may be done with a Varimax rotation, which permits the ‘clean
    up’ of the PCs by turning up the variables that contribute more and decreasing
    the variables that contribute less (Helena et al., 2000). The present study performed
    multivariate statistical analyses using the SPSS (Version 22) software package.
    2.3. SOM (Self Organizing Map) Self Organizing Map (SOM) comprehends a multifaceted
    and multi-dimensional dataset. It reduces it to a comparatively simple and low-dimension
    (one or two dimensions) dataset, generally used to visualize and explore linear
    and nonlinear relationships in the dataset using discrete lattices (Céréghino
    and Park, 2009; Nourani et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2020). This
    particular artificial neural network, or Kohonen network, is an unsupervised learning
    algorithm that can illustrate the similarities within the dataset and consequently
    categorize them into clusters (Kohonen, 1998; Nguyen et al., 2015; Han et al.,
    2016). The conventional SOM consists of two layers: an input layer and an output
    layer that contains one neuron for each variable in the data set. The output layer
    neurons are connected to every neuron in the input layer through adjustable weights
    or network parameters (Kalteh et al., 2008). The weight vectors in the Kohonen
    layer represent the distribution of the input vectors in an ordered fashion. The
    method works with the normalized dataset. Hence, in the first step, the normalization
    of all the variables is set to the range of 0–1 to specify the equal importance
    of all the variables and to reduce the effects of different topography and time
    steps (Han et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2021) using the following relation of min-max
    scaling (1) Where Xi is the original value, Xiꞌ is the transformed value, is the
    minimum value, and is the maximum value of the variables of the samples. Normalization
    is followed by an iterative training process that includes input parameters from
    the dataset matrix. The training procedure functions by assigning random weight
    to input variables and measuring the Euclidean distance between the input variables
    and assigned weight vectors of the SOM neuron (Han et al., 2016). The weight vector
    (Wm) is considered as (2) Wm = (Wm1, Wm2, Wm3, …., Wmn) (m = 1, …p) -------------
    Suppose the SOM consists of p neurons and n measured variables for the studied
    samples. During the iterative process, the weight of the closest match (Best Matching
    Unit; BMU) is found first. Then, the topologically neighboring neurons are updated
    every time to reduce further the distance between the weights and the input variables
    (Nourani et al., 2015) using the Gaussian neighborhood function. (3) Hp*p(t) is
    the neighborhood function of the BMU, p* is iteration t; σ(t) is the neighborhood
    radius at iteration t; α(t) is the learning rate factor, and ‖rp* - rp ‖ is the
    distance between neurons p* and p on the map grid. Until convergence, this process
    is typically repeated at least 500 times for the number of neurons in the setup
    (Kohonen, 1998; Kalteh et al., 2008). In the post-process of training, the SOM
    has been chosen as either hexagonal or rectangular lattices, with the number of
    nodes determined according to Vesanto et al. (2000). The SOM structure is represented
    by determining the nodes, which limits the SOM''s accuracy. Accurate clustering
    may be achieved by selecting the appropriate number of map nodes (Céréghino and
    Park, 2009; Wu et al., 2021). Generally, the heuristic rule of m = 5√n determines
    the map node, where m is the number of SOM nodes, and n is the number of input
    data (Vesanto et al., 2000; Nguyen et al., 2015). However, an alternative process
    is employed by considering quantization error (QE) and topographic error (TE)
    (Park et al., 2003) to avoid the quantification error of the number of SOM nodes
    in the analysis. The quantization error quantifies map resolution by calculating
    the average distance between each data vector and its BMU. Topography preservation
    is measured using topographic error, the percentage of all data vectors for which
    the first and second BMUs are not contiguous (Kohonen, 1998). The minimum values
    of quantization error (QE) and topographic error (TE) should be considered for
    the determination of the optimal number of SOM nodes (Wu et al., 2021). The optimal
    number of clusters is preferred to be measured through the David-Bouldin index
    (DBI) using a k-means algorithm (Davies and Bouldin, 1979; Jin et al., 2011).
    (4) The sum of the mean distances from all points to the centroid point of the
    cluster is denoted by (Di + Dj), and the distance between the centroid points
    of clusters i and j is presented as d (Di, Dj). Ultimately, a second-level grouping
    of the SOM lattices into a predetermined number of clusters is applied to find
    the similar hydrochemistry of the representative samples. 2.4. Groundwater quality
    assessment A comprehensive and systematic approach using the relevant chemometric
    indices has opted to represent groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation
    and the human and ecological risk of the study area. 2.4.1. Drinking quality index
    (CCMEWQI) The CCMEWQI drinking quality index is formulated with specifications
    that include adequacy for specific analytical sampling parameters, simplicity
    to measure, less vulnerability to missing data, and varied adaptability for multiple
    water consumption (Tyagi and Sarma, 2021). The substantial CCMEWQI can capture
    the contributing parameters'' impacts over a certain period (at least one year)
    against the standards (CCME, 2001) and categorize them into distinct groups. BIS
    (2012) recommended standards were adopted in the present study. The standard method
    is characterized by the measures of three factors: Scope (F1), Frequency (F2),
    and Amplitude (F3) (Eslami et al., 2019; Tyagi and Sarma, 2021). Detailed calculation
    methods are described in the supplementary section (A). 2.4.2. Irrigation Water
    Quality Index (IWQI) Irrigation water quality influences agricultural production
    as it regulates the soil type and crop (Simsek and Gunduz, 2007). The associated
    problems are (1) salinity hazards (measured through EC and TDS) (2) permeability
    hazards (considered Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) which include the relative concentration
    of Na+, Ca2+ and, Mg2+), (3) toxicity hazards (due to Na+, Cl−, and B) and, (4)
    miscellaneous hazards (primarily consider NO3–N, HCO3−, and pH) (Ayers and Westcot,
    1985). Among these quality indicators, only specific water quality parameters
    (EC, SAR, Na+, Cl−, and HCO3−) were used to calculate the IWQI (Abbasnia et al.,
    2018; Batarseh et al., 2021). IWQI formulates a dimensionless value from a multifaceted
    and assorted dataset to represent irrigation suitability (Meireles et al., 2010;
    Rao et al., 2021b; Muniz et al., 2020). The model assigns a relative weight to
    the responsible parameters by comparing them with standards according to the University
    of California Committee of Consultants (UCCC) and criteria determined by Ayers
    and Westcot (1985) (Table 1). The calculation of IWQI is mentioned in the supplementary
    section (B). Table 1. Limit values for the calculation of the quality measure

    2.5.1. Human health hazard index USEPA health hazard assessment model (USEPA,
    2014) efficiently captures the potential human health risk in terms of non-carcinogenic
    and carcinogenic health hazards due to drinking and domestic consumption over
    a certain period. The risk factors largely depend on human age, gender, body weight,
    time, and frequency of water consumption (Adimalla et al., 2020; Xiao et al.,
    2021). Generally, the dermal absorption and oral ingestion pathways quantify the
    potential risk due to groundwater contamination. Nitrate and fluoride are two
    important pollutants that harm human health in non-carcinogenic aspects (Rao et
    al., 2021a). In contrast, the presence of heavy metals may generate both carcinogenic
    and non-carcinogenic risks. The health hazard index (HI) evaluation for two age
    limits, i.e., adults (>18 years) and children (<18 years), incorporates three
    steps specified in Table 2 and elucidates the detailed descriptions of the parameters
    involved. The European Centre for Ecotoxicology of Chemicals (ECEC, 2001) established
    a threshold value of 1, based on which the hazard quotient (HQ) or HI risk level
    can be classified into four categories: negligible chronic risk (HQ or HI < 0.1);
    low chronic chances (0.1 ≤ HQ or HI < 1); medium risks (0.1 ≤ HQ or HI < 1); very
    high risks (HQ or HI ≥ 4). Regarding carcinogenic risk assessment, the value CRi
    or CR < 10− 6 represents negligible carcinogenic risk. The value of CRi or CR
    > 10− 4 indicates high cancer risk, and the value 10− 6 > CRi or CR > 10− 4 shows
    an acceptable risk to human beings (USEPA, 2014). Table 2. Computation of human

    2.5.2. Heavy metal pollution indices Heavy Metal Evaluation Index (HEI), modified
    Heavy Metal Pollution Index (m-HPI), and Nemerow Index (NeI) indices were used
    to evaluate groundwater quality. The methodologies for calculating the index are
    presented in supplementary section (C). For an accurate assessment of the water
    quality for drinking, Chaturvedi et al. (2018) created a modified heavy metal
    pollution index (m-HPI) by taking into account the limitations of the heavy metal
    evaluation index (HEI) and heavy metal pollution index (HPI) combinedly. The positive
    index (PI) and the negative index (NI) are typically used to classify m-HPI values.
    PI indicates that heavy metals present the highest desirable concentration, while
    NI represents a lower concentration (Chaturvedi et al., 2018). Based on both indices,
    groundwater quality is classified as follows: excellent (−1 ≤ NI ≤ 0 and PI =
    0), very good (−1 < NI ≤ 0 and 0 < PI ≤ UL/2), good (−1 < NI ≤ 0 and UL/2 < PI
    ≤ UL), and unacceptable (NI ≤ 0 and PI > UL), where UL is the absolute limit of
    the positive index. Classification of the water samples for HEI is based on the
    obtained mean value. To distinguish the levels of contamination, the water quality
    is categorized into three classes: low (HEI <10), medium (HEI = 10–20), and high
    (HEI >20). The Nemerow Index (NeI) method is a multifactorial and integrated assessment
    tool commonly used to assess the risk of soil or sediment contamination from water.
    This approach divides the level of contamination in the water into four categories:
    insignificant (0.7 < NeI ≤1), slightly (1 < NeI ≤2), moderately (2 < NeI ≤3),
    and heavily (NeI >3) contaminated (Wen et al., 2019). 2.5.3. Ecological risk index
    (ERI) The ecological risks due to heavy metals are usually assessed by the potential
    ecological risk index, which is considered a fast and reasonable method in aquatic
    environmental pollution control (Hakanson, 1980). The index technique takes four
    contributing aspects into account in-depth: the amount of metal toxicity, the
    types of metal pollutants, the concentration of metals in sediments, and the susceptibility
    of water bodies to metal pollution (Chen et al., 2021). Subsurface sediments may
    have a substantial effect on the groundwater environment. These sediments may
    be the sources and sinks of various pollutants via infiltration into the groundwater
    (Maskooni et al., 2020). The calculation of ERI is mentioned in the supplementary
    section (C). 3. Result and discussion 3.1. Hydrogeochemical evaluation 3.1.1.
    Physicochemical parameters and seasonal variations A statistical analysis was
    carried out with 18 physicochemical variables (viz., EC, TDS, TH, pH, Na+, K+,
    Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3−, SO42−, Cl−, F−, NO3−, Cr, Pb, Fe, Al, and Cu) of the groundwater
    samples (Table 3). The pH values for groundwater samples are alkaline, varying
    from 6.89 to 8.65 (mean 7.65) in pre-monsoon and 6.9 to 8.03 (mean 7.61) in post-monsoon.
    The pH values of 7% and 5% of the samples remain above the prescribed limit (6.5–8.5)
    recommended by WHO (WHO, 2017) in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively.
    Water corrosion results from low pH in water, whereas high values adversely affect
    the taste and human dermal and eye health (Li et al., 2017; Wang and Li, 2022).
    A slightly higher pH has been noticed in the pre-monsoon season than the post-monsoon
    season, indicative of the impact of fresh recharge water. Table 3. The normality

    from 510 to 3510 μS/cm in pre-monsoon and 580 to 2260 μS/cm in post-monsoon. TDS
    varies from 250 to 1760 mg/L (mean 471 mg/L) in pre-monsoon and 300–1685 mg/L
    (mean 599.5 mg/L) in post-monsoon. The TDS and EC indicate that most groundwater
    samples are fresh, and few are in the brackish category. TDS shows an increasing
    trend in post-monsoon rather than the pre-monsoon season, probably due to the
    salt accumulation favored by decreased recharge for low rainfall or contributed
    by water-rock action than the evaporation in the study area during the post-monsoon
    season. Besides that, very high TDS may result from domestic wastewater, irrigation
    return flows, and fertilizers (Rao et al., 2020; Wang and Li, 2022). In addition,
    post-monsoon showed a higher percentage (36%) of TDS values than pre-monsoon (21%)
    exceeding the TDS acceptable limit for drinking purposes (500 mg/L) (BIS, 2012),
    which may be the result of significant water-rock interactions along with anthropogenic
    activities. The combined effect of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in water is reflected through
    total hardness (Li et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2020) (TH) varies between 116 and
    553 mg/L with a mean of 219 mg/L in pre-monsoon and between 110 and 598 mg/L with
    a mean of 278 mg/L in post-monsoon. Among the groundwater samples collected, 64%
    and 88% of samples, respectively, in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon exceeded the
    TH acceptable limit for drinking (BIS, 2012). Classification based on hardness
    and TDS (Fig. 2) shows that most samples are hard fresh, followed by hard brackish
    type (Sawyer and McCarty, 1967). The hardness in the groundwater may be contributed
    by the dissolution of dolomite and calcite, indicating that more substantial water–rock
    interaction leads to carbonate weathering (Xu et al., 2023). Download : Download
    high-res image (200KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Classification
    of groundwater based on hardness and TDS. According to mean values in groundwater
    samples in the Varuna River basin, the dominance of cations is Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+>K+.
    The concentrations of Na+ in the groundwater samples range from 39 to 226 mg/L
    and 33–289 mg/L in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons, with mean values of 68 and
    88 mg/L, respectively. Only 2% of samples for both seasons exceed the related
    standard (<200 mg/L). Generally, sodium may originate from cation exchange and
    halite dissolution, as halite is less abundant in the Varuna River basin. Cation
    exchange may control the groundwater chemistry in this alluvial plain (Wu et al.,
    2021). Na + abundance followed by Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+. In pre-monsoon and post-monsoon,
    Ca2+ ranges from 11 mg/L to 95 mg/L and 22 mg/L to 96 mg/L. Mg2+ ranges from 10
    mg/L to 95 mg/L in pre-monsoon and 11 mg/L to 87 mg/L in post-monsoon. A significant
    number of samples (57% in pre-monsoon and 75% in post-monsoon) exceed the threshold
    of magnesium standards prescribed by WHO (30 mg/L). The primary sources of calcium
    and magnesium are the weathering of carbonate rocks, i.e., calcite and dolomite.
    The chemical breakdown of silicate minerals like calcic-plagioclase feldspars
    and pyroxenes may also be responsible for calcium and magnesium in the groundwater
    (Ganyaglo et al., 2010). Apart from that, the minerals can originate from agricultural
    fertilizers to groundwater. Minimum abundance has been observed in K+ concentration.
    The anions dominance in the river basin is HCO3− > Cl− > SO42− > NO3− > F−. The
    means of HCO3−, SO42−, and Cl− are 316, 27, and 42 mg/L in pre-monsoon and 375,
    39, and 55 mg/L in post-monsoon. Dissolving carbonate minerals contributes to
    a high concentration of HCO3 in groundwater (Raju et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2020).
    In the study region, 14% of pre-monsoon samples and 11% of post-monsoon samples
    exceed the desired nitrate level. The F− concentrations range from 0.5 to 2.3
    mg/L with a mean value of 0.9 mg/L in the pre-monsoon season and 0.3–2.8 mg/L
    with a mean value of 1.1 mg/L in the post-monsoon season. 13% of samples in pre-monsoon
    and 18% of samples during the post-monsoon season are over the permissible limit
    (1.5 mg/L). Hence, the study area has health threats to some extent, as it may
    cause skeletal fluorosis, dental fluorosis, and thyroid disease (Raju et al.,
    2012). Excess NO3− and F− concentrations may relate to anthropogenic sources.
    Among the samples,16%, 27%, 16%, and 61% in pre-monsoon and 14%, 32%, 16%, and
    56% in post-monsoon show a slightly increasing value as per the desirable limit
    of Cr, Pb, Fe, and Al, respectively. Dissolution of feldspar may be the possible
    reason for the high Al concentrations in the study area. All the parameters except
    magnesium are presented in an ordinary distribution (p < 0.05). Hence, the T-test
    was applied for magnesium. The results of the U test were adopted after the K–S
    test for the remaining ions to evaluate statistically significant differences
    between the seasons, as shown in Table 3. Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, HCO3−, Cl−, and SO42−
    differed significantly between the seasons. The river basin is characterized by
    high temperatures and low precipitation during the pre-monsoon season, facilitating
    high evaporation and evapotranspiration. Besides, in the post-monsoon season,
    relatively low temperatures with higher rain prevail, favoring more dissolution
    in existing subsurface formations. Accordingly, a significant difference in Na+,
    Mg2+, Ca2+, and HCO3− has been noticed. The differences in seasons for the variable
    Cl− and SO42− are mainly due to a poor sewage system and few wastewater pools
    in the study area. These accelerate the Cl− and SO42− concentrations through the
    subsurface infiltrations and precipitation. 3.1.2. Hydrogeochemical processes
    The ionic sequences of the groundwater signify the presence of water-rock interactions
    and anthropogenic contribution. The effect of cation exchange can be assessed
    by the (Na+ + K+) versus (Ca2+ + Mg2+) plot. The plot shows that the maximum points
    are below the equiline for both seasons, representing the abundance of alkaline
    earth elements over alkali elements (Fig. 3a), possibly because of the dissolution
    of alkaline earth minerals or the ion exchange effect. Furthermore, the plot of
    (Ca2+ + Mg2+) vs. (HCO3− + SO42−) shows the majority of the samples fall along
    the 1:1 line (Fig. 3b), but the tendency of the data distribution is towards the
    (HCO3− + SO42−) side, which suggests an excess of alkalinity. All samples should
    exist on a 1:1 line if Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3−, and SO42− are obtained from the dissolution
    of calcite, dolomite, and gypsum minerals (Patel et al., 2016). The presence of
    kankar in the alluvial sediments could have favored the carbonate weathering process
    in the study area. However, silicate rocks are the primary source of ions in the
    aquifer system, and the alkalinity state accelerates their weathering. In the
    groundwater system, sodium and potassium would have balanced the extra alkalinity
    (Rao et al., 2020). Silicate weathering, ion exchange, or anthropogenic activities
    for the enhancement of alkalies in the groundwater system of the study area are
    also observed by the relation of (Na+ + K+) with (Cl− + SO42−), as maximum samples
    fell below or towards the equiline (Fig. 3c) (Raju et al., 2016). Again, most
    samples show a 1:1 ratio between HCO3− and TZ+, reflecting the dissolution of
    silicates and carbonates as a significant process (Fig. 3d). Some of the samples
    from both seasons were affected by human activities (Barzegar et al., 2018). Download

    versus Total Cations (TZ+). 3.2. Principal component analysis The data matrices
    are suitable for PCA application based on KMO values (0.67 in pre-monsoon and
    0.60 in post-monsoon) and significant in the Bartlett sphericity test (p < 0.000).
    PCA was then performed to determine the parameters with a common origin in groundwater.
    Considering varimax rotation in PCA results, five principal components (PCs) in
    pre-monsoon and six in post-monsoon were found with eigenvalue >1. They explained
    the total variance of 72.1% pre-monsoon and 75.6% post-monsoon samples (Table
    4). The first principal component (PC1) explains 36.2% of pre-monsoon and 34.9%
    of post-monsoon total variance with high positive loadings. The first component,
    groundwater with high loadings, signifies high mineralization in low pH, mainly
    influenced by the combined origin of rock weathering dominance and anthropogenic
    sources for both seasons. Increased Ca2+ and Mg2+ could support the silicate weathering,
    which is also strongly correlated with Na+, Mg2+, and HCO3− (Eslami et al., 2019).
    Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42−, HCO3−, and TH indicate a significant concentration of alkaline
    earth from carbonate weathering, specifically dolomite dissolution (Khairy and
    Janardhana, 2022), which may increase the groundwater hardness of the region.
    High positive loadings among EC, Na+, Cl−, and TDS indicate salinity and anthropogenic
    sources, such as fertilizers from irrigation (Merz and Lischeid, 2019). The second
    principal component (PC2) elucidates 10.9% in pre-monsoon and 9.2% in post-monsoon
    and has a strong correlation with Cu (0.586 in pre-monsoon and 0.659 in post-monsoon)
    and Si (0.555 in pre-monsoon and 0.511 in post-monsoon) and inversely correlated
    to Fe for both the seasons and pH in pre-monsoon. The high positive loading of
    Cu may be the effect of human-induced activities, whereas Si may have a geogenic
    origin. In the pre-monsoon season, the soil''s microbiota of the region generates
    organic acids associated with CO2 and hastens weathering by lowering pH. The phenomenon
    supports the weathering of alumino silicate minerals (dissolution of feldspars),
    resulting in Al dissolution (Drever and Stillings, 1997). As the concentration
    of dissolved Al accelerates with decreasing pH, it impedes the effect of reducing
    pH. As a result, weathering of Fe, Al, and Si minerals (e.g., Plagioclase to gibbsite,
    kaolinite, or smectite) is observed (Drever and Stillings, 1997). Dissociation
    of carbonic acid is connected with rising pH and greater HCO3− concentrations
    due to the input of carbonate weathering in the post-monsoon season. It is closely
    related to the siderite (Fe (II) carbonate) precipitation (Merz and Lischeid,
    2019). Table 4. Principal components and R-mode varimax-rotated factor loadings

    highly correlated with NO3− in pre-monsoon, and Pb, F− in post-monsoon, and inversely
    related to Al in pre-monsoon, explaining 9.1% and 8.6% in pre and post-monsoon,
    respectively. Interestingly, the fourth component (PC4) is strongly associated
    with NO3− in post-monsoon and Pb, F− in pre-monsoon, inversely correlated to Al
    in post-monsoon, explaining 9% and 7.83% in pre and post-monsoon season, respectively.
    This association indicates that both seasons are affected by anthropogenic rather
    than geogenic sources. Considerable nitrate and fluoride loading in the groundwater
    can be attributed to fluoride contamination from brick-kilning industries in the
    river basin. The main ingredient of manufacturing bricks is clay, which contains
    several hundred ppm of fluoride (MacDonald HE, 1969). Pb may be from households''
    plumbing systems that provide self-supplied (domestic well) water. The fifth component
    (PC5) describes 6.9% and 7.82% in pre- and post-monsoon seasons, whereas the sixth
    (PC6) component represents 7.2% only for post-monsoon season. PC5 and PC6 are
    substantially loaded with K+ during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. While Si
    is negatively loaded with PC6, pH, and Al showed positive interaction with PC5
    in post-monsoon. K+ loading can be caused by irrigation return flows containing
    potash fertilizers or weathering through the dissolution and leaching of secondary
    minerals in the pore spaces (Jandu et al., 2021). The increase in pH and Al concentrations
    are strongly related to the chemical weathering process (precipitation of orthoclase,
    etc.). The distribution of loadings for the principal components is presented
    in Supplementary section (D). 3.2.1. Self-organising maps and clusters The number
    of SOM nodes is determined based on the TE and QE, which were 2.479 and 0.01,
    respectively, for pre-monsoon and 2.576 (QE) and 0.023 (TE) for the post-monsoon
    season. Based on these indices, 9 rows and 4 columns have been obtained. Data
    is normalized, followed by linear initialization and batch training to train the
    data, which resulted in 18 components in SOMs (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res

    parameters of (a) Pre-monsoon and (b) Post-monsoon of the Varuna River basin.
    Shades of blue represent the SOMs to yellow, which visually signifies the qualitative
    relations of the parameters with the variations in the gradient of colors. It
    is observed that Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−, TDS, TH, EC, and Cr in pre-monsoon
    have a similar color gradient, showing a strong correlation between them. The
    correlation of Ca2+ and SO42− suggests sulfate minerals dissolution (anhydrite
    and gypsum), but the Ca2+ and HCO3− have a stronger correlation, suggesting the
    presence of a carbonate weathering source. In addition, a strong correlation between
    Mg2+ and HCO3− in groundwater indicates dolomite dissolution and ion exchange
    (Wang et al., 2015). The weak correlation between Ca2+ and Mg2+ reveals that carbonate
    weathering is not the only contributing source of ions. Moreover, Na+, Mg2+, and
    HCO3− show similar gradients that may be linked to silicate weathering. The correlation
    coefficient between Na+ and Mg2+ is 0.66 in pre-monsoon and 0.54 in post-monsoon,
    and Na+ and HCO3− are 0.75 in pre-monsoon and 0.78 in post-monsoon (Table 5),
    suggesting silicate weathering dominance. On the other hand, Na+ has a higher
    correlation with Cl−, either due to the halite dissolution or the anthropogenic
    sources (Wu et al., 2021), which is also evident by the strong correlation between
    the Cr and Cl− (0.60 in pre and 0.53 in post-monsoon). Besides that, a substantial
    correlation between Ca2+, TH, and Mg2+, TH signifies that hardness in groundwater
    is caused mainly by Ca2+ and Mg2+. The SOMs'' representation is validated by the
    consistent correlation of the physicochemical parameters calculated from quantitative
    correlation analysis (Table 5). Table 5. Pearson''s correlation coefficients of
    hydrochemical parameters for both seasons. Bold values show a significant positive
    correlation between physicochemical parameters (significance level is 0.05). DBI
    values are calculated using the k-means clustering algorithm and carried out using
    0 to 36 clusters after training. The lowest DBI value for the pre-monsoon is 0.67
    (9 clusters) and 0.66 (8 clusters) for post-monsoon (Fig. 5). Hydrogeochemical
    characterization can be obtained from the SOM pattern distribution map of samples.
    The quantification of the chemical parameters of the clusters is represented in
    Table 6. The clusters were classified into four groups (Fig. 6) based on chemical
    similarity and TDS. Cluster 1, cluster 2, clusters 8, and 9 in pre-monsoon and
    clusters 1 and 8 in post-monsoon have low TDS and show significantly low values
    of all ions except Na+ in post-monsoon and slightly increased values of Cr, Pb,
    Al, and Fe. These clusters are grouped under the low salinity zone, positioned
    at the upper left corner of the SOM pattern map (Fig. 6). Excessive leaching from
    agricultural land and sewage effluent due to the precipitation may locally elevate
    the post-monsoon Na+ concentration (sample no 17). Other than that, Group 1 represents
    a relatively fresh water type. The clusters of Group 2 (clusters 3, 6, and 7 in
    pre-monsoon and 2, 3, and 7 in post-monsoon) indicate the medium salinity in groundwater
    as per TDS values showing little increment (ranges from 422 mg/L to 470 mg/L in
    pre-monsoon and 513 mg/L to 595 mg/L in post-monsoon) (Table 6). A similar increasing
    trend was observed more or less in all ions with slightly elevated Cr, Pb, and
    Al concentrations. Group 3 (High salinity) is absent in the pre-monsoon season
    but identified in the post-monsoon season by clusters 5 and 6, considering high
    concentrations of Na+ and Cl−, EC, and TDS. Group 4 has very high ionic concentrations,
    EC, and TDS. Hence, the group has very high salinity, which may restrict domestic
    and drinking uses and need treatment before use. A comprehensive study of these
    clusters'' cations and anions confirms that the area''s dominant hydrochemical
    facies is Na+- HCO3−. Generally, silicate weathering augments the Na+ concentration,
    and the alluvial region comprises aluminosilicate minerals in sand and clay, which
    may be the probable source of Na+. Na+ abundance due to silicate weathering generally
    combines HCO3− as the most abundant anion (Fisher and Mullican, 1997). HCO3− may
    also be released by the reaction of carbonic acid with feldspar in groundwater
    (Patel et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res image (248KB) Download : Download

    of clusters by SOM for a. Pre-monsoon and b. post-monsoon season. Moreover, Cluster
    5 shows magnesium dominancy in the pre-monsoon, whereas calcium dominancy is in
    the post-monsoon. Generally, in natural conditions, Ca2+ is more soluble than
    Mg2+ (Hem, 1989). Hence, post-monsoon precipitation settles more Ca2+, indicating
    carbonate dissolution. Cluster 5 comprises the samples from the study area''s
    central part, which receives relatively high rainfall and propagates the water-rock
    interactions. Clusters of Group 1, which are placed at the top of the pattern
    map, mainly belong to the northwestern part of the area, which has a higher elevation
    and hence acts as a recharge area. Most of the samples from the central part of
    the basin exist in the middle part of the pattern map, represented by the geochemical
    variation from Na+- HCO3− to Na+- Mg2+/Ca2+- HCO3− and specified by Group 2. Groups
    3 and 4 lie at the bottom of the map, mainly consisting of the samples from the
    southeastern region, recognized as the discharge area. Cluster 4 may be an exceptional
    case composed of only sample no. 1 and shows very high values of almost all ions
    due to anthropogenic activities; it should be re-examined. Seasonal changes have
    been observed within 14 out of 44 wells, where three samples showed differences
    in water type. In this regard, sample no. 2 changed from low salinity (Cluster
    1) in pre-monsoon to high salinity (cluster 5) in post-monsoon. Sample no. 2 is
    situated in the Babuganj area of Allahabad and may be influenced by heavy anthropogenic
    fluxes. Water type of sample no. 3 changed from medium salinity in pre-monsoon
    to low salinity in post-monsoon, while sample no. 21 changed from very high salinity
    in pre-monsoon to high salinity in post-monsoon. Both areas are situated near
    the Varuna River tributaries, as shown in Fig. 1, which may facilitate a more
    recharged environment. Eventually, the preliminary evolution of hydrochemical
    processes along the groundwater recharge and discharge process may be assessed
    by the SOM grouping method of clusters, which also may be more understandable
    to water stakeholders (Han et al., 2016). 3.3. Groundwater quality assessment
    3.3.1. Drinking quality assessment The CCMEWQI estimation combines the investigated
    variables of both seasons into the factors: scope, frequency, and amplitude. The
    ‘scope (F1)'' in the study area varies from 0% to 38.9%, averaging 16.28% in pre-monsoon
    and 0%–44.4%, with an average of 21.1% in post-monsoon (Fig. 7). The average percentage
    of F1 scores of the variables specify the low scope in respective seasons as most
    of the variables follow the objective limits (BIS, 2012). Furthermore, the relatively
    high scope in post-monsoon may be owing to sufficient recharge from precipitation
    to the aquifers, allowing contamination from nearby anthropogenic sources and
    wastewater/municipal seepages in groundwater. Frequency (F2) in post-monsoon shows
    a slight increase compared to monsoon, ranging from 0% to 19.4% (avg. 8.5%) in
    pre-monsoon and 0%–22.2% (avg. 10.5%) in post-monsoon. The failed parametric tests,
    responsible for frequency percentages, include Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, F−, NO3−, SO42−,
    TDS, EC, pH, TH, Cr, Fe, Al, and Pb. The failed parameters TDS and EC indicate
    the saline contribution to the quality. The groundwater of the study area usually
    experiences leakages from land disposals and pollutants from domestic sewage,
    leakage of septic tanks, and sanitary landfills, which may increase the groundwater''s
    saline property. Increased frequency of hardness may contribute to elevated Mg2+,
    which signifies the geogenic origin. Hence, rock–water interactions and anthropogenic
    influences like irrigation return flows, chemical fertilizers, domestic wastewater,
    etc., affect the area''s groundwater quality. The third factor, ‘amplitude (F3)''
    is the normalization of the values by comparing two characteristics of the tested
    parameter (“exceeding permissible limits” and “falling below the desirable limit”)
    (CCME, 2001; Tyagi and Sarma, 2021). F3 scores between 0% and 54% (mean: 6.7%)
    in pre-monsoon and 0.52%–56.8% (mean: 8.1%) in post-monsoon were well normalized
    (Fig. 7). The cumulative effect of these three factors (F1, F2, and F3) is expressed
    in CCMEWQI, ranges from 62.2 to 100 (mean 87.6) in pre-monsoon and 58.7 to 99.5
    (mean 84.9) in post-monsoon. Most samples (71% and 77.2% in pre- and post-monsoon,
    respectively) were under the ‘Good’ class (80–94) of CCMEWQI. Only 2.3 % of samples
    of respective seasons were in the ‘Marginal’ (45–64) category, and the remaining
    samples were under the ‘Fair’ (65–79) and ‘Excellent’ (95–100) classes. Hence,
    this specific region observes a minute seasonal variation in drinking quality
    (Fig. 8). The climatic disparities may account for the probable anthropic contribution
    to this seasonal variation. Pre-monsoon in the study area often experiences scarcity
    in precipitation and supports evaporation, which raises the salinity by concentrating
    solute levels. On the other hand, a significant amount of rainfall in post-monsoon
    helps the dissolution and percolation of salt concentration, sewer discharge,
    and agriculture/industrial residues to existing aquifers, advancing the groundwater''s
    contamination level. Accordingly, the usability of groundwater drinking in the
    entire region is occasionally threatened or impaired, with minor threats or contamination.
    The water quality is rarely to infrequently departed from natural or desirable
    levels. Download : Download high-res image (140KB) Download : Download full-size

    usability in Pre-monsoon and Post-monsoon season. 3.3.2. Irrigation quality assessment
    The groundwater samples show that 7% of pre-monsoon and 2% of post-monsoon samples
    exceed the standard limit of pH (8.5) (Table 7). Sodicity problems may arise in
    these samples due to the higher pH of more than 8.5, which increases carbonate
    content in the soils. Similarly, irrigation water containing high HCO3 represents
    the alkaline water responsible for intensified sodic conditions. High alkaline
    water promotes the pH of the water, which favors the dissolution of Na+ in solution
    and the formation of insoluble Ca2+ and Mg2+ minerals (Simsek and Gunduz, 2007).
    Higher HCO3− concentration has been reported in the study area, in which 4 samples
    in pre-monsoon and 5 samples in post-monsoon show higher concentrations of more
    than 500 mg/L. Most samples in the study area show high Na+, which may destroy
    the soil structure due to the dispersion of clay particles. In this process, Na
    + ions tend to be adsorbed by clay particles, displacing Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, ultimately
    reducing the soil''s permeability (Saleh et al., 1999; Raju et al., 2009). Higher
    EC and TDS favor the enrichment of salts in the groundwater (Rao et al., 2020).
    High saline waters reduce the osmotic activity of plants and inhibit the absorption
    of water and nutrients from the soil. Low crop yields may be achieved due to excess
    sodium salts, which may also cause osmotic effects on the soil-plant system (Raju
    et al., 2009). All the samples show high irrigation suitability as per TDS, whereas
    only 3 samples in pre-monsoon and 1 sample in post-monsoon show low irrigation
    suitability. Low concentrations of chloride and boron are essential for plant
    growth; however, higher levels may cause toxicity to sensitive crops (Simsek and
    Gunduz, 2007; Batarseh et al., 2021). The area shows medium Cl− toxicity in irrigation
    water. Hence, the groundwaters are suitable for irrigation in this region. However,
    they may offer a minor threat of sodicity problems, leaf burns, or leaf tissue
    death issues as per high to medium Na+ and Cl− concentrations. Table 7. Criteria

    assessment of the irrigation index represents the agricultural suitability by
    accounting for the hazardous factors of soils and crops. Five classes were defined
    as no restriction (IWQI = 85–100), low restriction (IWQI = 70–85), moderate restriction
    (IWQI = 55–70), high restriction (IWQI = 40–55), and severe restriction (IWQI
    = 0–40) (Abbasnia et al., 2018; Meireles et al., 2010). The present study of the
    index (IWQI) shows the values vary from 31.3 to 81.8 (avg. of 61.1) in pre-monsoon
    and 47.8 to 81.5 (avg. of 64.8) in post-monsoon. The maximum samples (50% in pre-
    and 63.6% in post-monsoon) subside at moderate irrigation suitability (Fig. 8).
    The reasonable restrictions permit the medium leaching of salts. Therefore, plants
    with a modest tolerance to salt typically thrive, although this type of water
    can be effectively helpful for soils with moderate to high permeability. About
    20.5% and 25% of the total samples of pre and post-monsoon, respectively, correspond
    to low restriction, while 29.5% (pre) and 11.4% (post) reside in high restriction
    zones. High salt tolerance plants are permitted in highly permeable soil without
    compacted layers under the high restriction category. High-frequency irrigation
    may be scheduled by considering certain salinity control practices and limiting
    water use with low Na+, Cl−, and HCO3− values. The waters with the low restriction
    category are safe enough with a minute level of soil sodicity problems recommended
    for soil leaching and favorable for typical plants. No samples were recorded with
    no restriction category. The usability of groundwater in irrigation shows endurable
    usage in the study area. This alluvial region in India is marked as highly agriculturally
    productive, with multiple grains, etc. (UPGWD and CGWB, 2021). Accelerated irrigation
    practices facilitated by different chemical fertilizers, amendments, and pesticides
    introduce salinity and sodicity into the groundwaters. Moreover, the fast urbanization
    in this region restricts the sufficient infiltration of rainwater into the aquifers
    and may also initiate salinity problems. 3.4. Risk assessment 3.4.1. Human health
    hazard index The major ions NO3− and F−, as well as the trace elements Cr, Pb,
    Fe, and Al, are observed in relatively high amounts in some groundwater samples,
    above the drinking water standards (BIS, 2012) (Table 3). These can degrade groundwater
    quality and ultimately endanger human health. The high NO3− concentrations introduce
    methemoglobinemia in newborns (Madhav et al., 2021; Raju et al., 2009; Das et
    al., 2023), whereas fluorosis is caused by excess fluoride concentration (Raju
    et al., 2012; Rao et al., 2020). Lead contamination affects young children more
    than adults, attacking the brain and central nervous system and causing intellectual
    disability and behavioral disorders (USEPA, 2014). Excess aluminum does not have
    such adverse effects on human health. According to the risk assessment result,
    82% of HI values point to moderate non-carcinogenic risk, irrespective of adults
    and children (Fig. 9). Thus, the above pollutants in the groundwater represent
    minimal risks to human health. However, HI value of >4 for adults and children
    is discovered in 5% of the entire groundwater of the study area (Arwansimai and
    Basupur), which denotes a significant potential health risk. Furthermore, each
    contaminant''s hazard quotient (HQ) is estimated to recognize the accountable
    elements posing the health risk (Fig. 9). Download : Download high-res image (422KB)

    different age groups of the Varuna River basin. The outcome shows that all trace
    elements, except for Pb, are much below the allowed limit of 1, representing negligible
    human health risk. While most samples concerning NO3− and F− pose low non-carcinogenic
    health risks (61% and 86%, respectively), a certain percentage (16% and 14%) show
    moderate health risks. The HQ of Pb varies from 0.05 to 3.2 for adults and children.
    For Pb contaminants, 84% of the total groundwater samples are within the low non-carcinogenic
    risk category, and 7% are under moderate non-carcinogenic risk. Although Al and
    Fe are over the drinking water standard, all groundwater samples have HQs for
    populations below 1 (Table 3). The study suggests that the hazard of Al and Fe
    elements in groundwater can be ignored. However, HQ values of Cr are higher than
    1 and present in 2% of the total samples, which may pose a moderate health risk.
    The pollutants NO3−, F−, Pb, and a small quantity of Cr contributed to the study
    area''s potential health risks, while Cu, Fe, and Al can be ignored. Prolonged
    exposure to Cr and Pb, facilitated by their extended biological half-lives and
    cumulative characteristics, intensifies their carcinogenic effects (Akoto et al.,
    2019; Balli and Leghouchi, 2018; Monroy et al., 2014). The plausible oncogenic
    risk assessment by Cr and Pb through oral intake shows that CRi for adults in
    the groundwater samples are 8.67 × 10−5 and 3.97 × 10−3, respectively (Fig. 10),
    and for children, are 8.63 × 10−5 and 3.95 × 10– 3 respectively. In this study,
    as per EPA standards, there is a possibility that 8–9 persons, irrespective of
    adults and children in every 1,00,000 persons, may develop cancer due to lifetime
    exposure to Cr in groundwater. Cancer risk figures for Pb indicate that water
    consumption from groundwaters of the study area would result in more than 3–4
    cancer cases per 1000 people. Pb and Cr in groundwater could result from natural
    and artificial sources (Perraki et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image
    (227KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Carcinogenic health risks
    in groundwater among the study area population. In the case of Pb concentration,
    natural presence in groundwater typically isn''t observable or minor. However,
    in the case of Cr, natural presence in groundwater is primarily bound to extremely
    refractory phases like primary silicates (pyroxenes, olivines), secondary silicates
    (serpentines, clay minerals), and occasionally secondary silicates of ultramafic
    rocks (Perraki et al., 2021). The rare occurrence of the minerals, except for
    clay minerals, also restricts the contribution. Hence, anthropogenic sources seem
    to be the primary source, mainly agricultural and industrial activities. Lead
    can enter groundwater from small-scale industries, plumbing, gasoline, and coal.
    Almost all the boreholes and wells analyzed here were used for intensive agriculture.
    Specifically, the extensive use of amendments, phosphorous, and nitrogen-bearing
    soil fertilizers appears to affect the concentrations. The nitrogen-bearing fertilizers
    may increase the dissolution of the Cr-bearing minerals responsible for nitrification
    and consequent soil acidification. Moreover, Cr may be introduced by chrome plating,
    paints, dyes, leather tanning, etc. Commercially, Varanasi Saari is famous worldwide,
    and factories use many dyes for production. The waste materials thrown indiscriminately
    in low-lying areas may decompose due to their high solubility in water. Therefore,
    reasonable measures should be implemented to reduce Pb and Cr exposure to limit
    adverse health impacts. 3.4.2. Heavy metal pollution indices and ecological risk
    index As per the heavy metal pollution indices, most of the area is in the low
    pollution category. m-HPI ranges from 0 to 24.3 (mean 0.76) in pre-monsoon and
    0 to 26.6 (mean 0.79) in post-monsoon. The mean value of HEI, NEI, and ERI varies
    from 5.1 to 5.3, 1.38 to 1.46, and 11.1 to 11.9, respectively, from pre-monsoon
    to post-monsoon (Table 2 in Supplementary Section C). According to m-HPI, HEI,
    and NeI indices, 77%, 95%, and 47% samples show very good, low, and relatively
    no pollution categories, respectively (Fig. 8). Only two samples (Arwansimai in
    Phulpur and Basupur in Rampur) have significant pollution indices, which may be
    related to local pollutant accumulation. The low ERI values specify minimal ecological
    risk to the groundwater ecosystem in the research area. The study area''s land
    use pattern shows that 88% of the total area is under agricultural land (Dey et
    al., 2021a). Hence, intense agrochemical uses may introduce heavy metal pollutants
    like pb and Cr. Even though the study area reports a low pollution level, a regular
    appraisal and restricted use of fertilizers and pesticides may inhibit further
    exhaustion. 4. Conclusion This study collected and analyzed 88 groundwater samples
    from pre-monsoon and post-monsoon each for various physicochemical parameters.
    Then, hydrochemistry and quality are evaluated. Finally, human and ecological
    risk assessment is performed. Based on the present study, several conclusions
    would be generalized as follows: 1. The groundwaters in the study area are slightly
    alkaline. As per TDS and EC, most groundwater samples were fresh except for a
    few in the brackish category. Hydrogeochemistry reveals that the abundance order
    of cation is Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+>K+, and anion is HCO3− > Cl− > SO42− > NO3− > F−. The
    normality test indicates a significant seasonal variation in Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+,
    HCO3−, Cl−, and SO42− concentrations between the two seasons. 2. The hydrogeochemical
    evaluation and PCA analysis suggest that the groundwater chemistry is predominantly
    controlled by the weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals with anthropogenic
    interventions. The SOMs and quantitative correlation analysis represent a strong
    correlation between Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−, TDS, TH, EC, and Cr. From
    the SOM clustering analysis, the 18 hydrochemical parameters are divided into
    9 pre-monsoon and 8 post-monsoon clusters. The clusters are grouped into four
    categories, from low saline to very high saline zones, based on chemical similarity
    and TDS. The freshwater type accompanies the recharge area of the northwestern
    part, and very high salinity is related to samples from the southeastern discharge
    area of the river basin. 3. The CCMEWQI quality index suggests that 71% and 77.2%
    of pre- and post-monsoon samples are under the ‘Good’ class, and 2.3% of samples
    of respective seasons are in the ‘Marginal’ category. The CCMEWQI values reveal
    groundwater quality is better in the pre-monsoon season than in the post-monsoon
    season. The IWQI shows that 30% and 11% of investigated samples of pre- and post-monsoon,
    respectively, are located within the high restriction category, which limits their
    use for irrigation purposes, while the other 50% of pre-monsoon and 64% of post-monsoon
    investigated samples are placed within moderate restriction category and 20% of
    pre-monsoon and 25% of post-monsoon samples fell under low restriction. The high
    Na+ and Cl− in irrigation water may produce a minor threat of sodicity problems
    in soil and leaf burns or leaf tissue death in sensitive crops. 4. The health
    risk assessment evidences non-carcinogenic compulsions due to NO3−, F−, Cr, and
    Pb contaminants and carcinogenic risks by Pb and Cr exposures. Pb provides more
    cancer risk than Cr as per cancer risk guidelines with consumption of groundwaters
    in the area irrespective of age. The m-HPI, HEI, and NeI indices show 77%, 95%,
    and 47% samples under very good, low, and relatively no pollution categories,
    respectively, and samples from Arwansimai in Phulpur and Basupur in Rampur show
    significant pollution indices probably due to local pollutant accumulation. All
    the samples show low ERI values, which specify negligible ecological risk to the
    groundwater ecosystem. Funding Women Scientist Scheme - A (Reference no. # SR/WOS-A/EA-1004/2015),

  description: Wastewater recycling is a pivotal strategy in sustainable water management,
    designed to mitigate water scarcity and curb environmental pollution. This research
    introduces an innovative approach merging Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Style-Based
    Generator Generative Adversarial Networks (StyleGAN) to revolutionize wastewater
    recycling. SOM optimizes the distribution of treated water by identifying ideal
    locations for recycling outlets and treatment facilities. Meanwhile, StyleGAN
    enhances water quality by learning from diverse samples, producing purified water
    suitable for non-drinking purposes. The combination of SOM and StyleGAN maximizes
    resource utilization and addressing water scarcity challenges while minimizing
    environmental impact. Also, this method is not only optimizes treated water distribution
    but also enhances water quality, showcasing potential benefits for sustainable
    water practices, including groundwater replenishment. Self-Organizing Maps construct
    a spatial model of the wastewater treatment system, finding optimal locations
    for recycling outlets and treatment facilities. This spatial intelligence optimizes
    the distribution of treated water, channeling it efficiently to high-demand areas,
    thereby maximizing resource utilization. Simultaneously, Style-Based Generator
    Generative Adversarial Networks elevate the quality of treated wastewater. By
    assimilating knowledge from diverse wastewater samples, StyleGAN produces water
    of superior quality with diminished contaminants and enhanced aesthetics. This
    transformation renders treated wastewater more versatile for non-potable purposes
    like irrigation and industrial processes. The SOM-StyleGAN technologies offers
    a holistic solution for wastewater recycling, addressing both distribution efficiency
    and water quality enhancement. The SOM method outperforms MLP, DBN, and GAN-ANN
    in fidelity, diversity, contaminant reduction, and aesthetic quality. With a fidelity
    of 0.97, substantial improvements over GAN-ANN showcase its effectiveness. These
    results underscore the method's potential contribution to sustainable water management
    practices, emphasizing its versatility and quality in treated water generation.
    These findings contribute significantly to enhancing water quality and underscore
    its potential practical implications for sustainable water practices, marking
    a substantial step forward in the field.

    efficiencyEnvironmental impact 1. Introduction The significance of groundwater
    in the hydrological cycle of the earth underscores the need for a paradigm shift
    in the approach to treatment. As the degradation of groundwater resources further
    compounds the challenges linked to water scarcity, it is necessary to develop
    a novel approach that integrates recycling. In water management, wastewater recycling
    emerges as a pivotal strategy to address the pressing issues of water scarcity
    and environmental contamination (Singh et al., 2022) The conventional linear approach
    to wastewater treatment and discharge is no longer tenable in the face of escalating
    global water challenges (Oruganti et al., 2023; Sahu et al., 2023). The increasing
    demand for water resources, coupled with the escalating environmental impact of
    untreated wastewater discharge, poses challenges to wastewater management systems
    (Ly et al., 2022; Zaghloul and Achari, 2022). Conventional treatment methods often
    fall short in optimizing resource distribution and fail to sufficiently enhance
    the quality of treated wastewater, limiting its potential applications (Niu et
    al., 2022; Croll et al., 2023a, Croll et al., 2023b). The challenge lies in developing
    an integrated solution that not only optimizes the spatial distribution of treated
    water but also elevates its quality to meet diverse non-potable water needs (Yan
    et al., 2023). Existing wastewater treatment systems lack the spatial intelligence
    to efficiently channel treated water to high-demand areas, while the quality of
    treated water remains a bottleneck for its versatile use in various applications
    (Wu et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2022). Groundwater, a vital resource for sustaining
    ecosystems and human activities, faces increasing challenges due to over-extraction
    and contamination. This study explores innovative approaches, such as Self-Organizing
    Map (SOM) and Style-Based Generator Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to
    address groundwater sustainability issues through wastewater recycling. The primary
    objectives include creating a spatial representation of the wastewater treatment
    system and improving groundwater sustainability using SOM, identifying optimal
    locations for recycling outlets, and employing StyleGAN to enhance the quality
    of treated wastewater. This research aims to address the challenges by leveraging
    the cooperation between Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Style-Based Generator Generative
    Adversarial Networks (StyleGAN) in wastewater recycling. The novelty of this approach
    lies in the integration of SOM and StyleGAN technologies, offering a comprehensive
    solution to wastewater recycling. • The spatial intelligence provided by SOM optimizes
    resource distribution, ensuring efficient water utilization. • StyleGAN contributes
    by transforming treated wastewater into a high-quality resource, reducing contaminants,
    and enhancing aesthetics. • The combined contribution of these technologies addresses
    the dual challenges of distribution efficiency and water quality enhancement,
    marking a significant advancement in sustainable water management practices. Recent
    research has established a close correlation between management and groundwater
    sustainability. Proposed methods should optimize treated wastewater while concurrently
    contemplating its capacity to recharge groundwater treatments in order to address
    the challenges posed by water scarcity and declining groundwater levels. Several
    studies have delved into wastewater recycling, each offering unique perspectives
    and solutions to the complex challenges posed by water scarcity and environmental
    pollution (Adibimanesh et al., 2023). A body of research explores traditional
    wastewater treatment methods, emphasizing the need for advancements in spatial
    intelligence and water quality enhancement (Qambar and Al Khalidy, 2022). In the
    domain of spatial intelligence, research has investigated the application of SOM
    to wastewater management. Studies have explored the potential of SOM in creating
    spatial models of treatment systems, optimizing the placement of recycling outlets,
    and streamlining the distribution of treated water (Wang et al., 2022a,b). These
    efforts underscore the significance of spatial intelligence in improving the efficiency
    of wastewater recycling processes (Wang et al., 2022a,b). Concurrently, a growing
    body of literature has examined the application of GANs in wastewater treatment.
    StyleGAN have garnered attention for their capacity to learn from diverse wastewater
    samples and generate high-quality treated water (Li et al., 2022). This line of
    research focuses on the potential of GANs in transforming treated wastewater,
    reducing contaminants, and enhancing its usability for various non-potable purposes
    Sharmila et al. (2023). While individual studies have made strides in addressing
    specific aspects of wastewater recycling, the integration of SOM and StyleGAN
    represents a novel approach. This research seeks to bridge gaps identified in
    previous works (Rodríguez-Rángel et al., 2022; Croll et al., 2023a, Croll et al.,
    2023b) by combining spatial intelligence with advanced generative capabilities,
    offering a more comprehensive and efficient solution to the challenges associated
    with wastewater recycling. The literature provides a foundation for understanding
    the intricacies of wastewater recycling. This research builds upon and extends
    these prior works by introducing an innovative integration of spatial intelligence
    and generative capabilities to enhance both the distribution efficiency and quality
    of treated wastewater. Existing literature emphasizes the urgent need for sustainable
    groundwater management strategies, pointing to the potential of advanced technologies
    like SOM and GANs. The integration of these techniques could revolutionize wastewater
    recycling processes, ensuring the preservation of groundwater quality and quantity
    for future generations. In acknowledging the evolving discourse on water management,
    this research refocuses the narrative on the critical intersection between wastewater
    recycling and groundwater sustainability. Groundwater, a pivotal water resource,
    demands a heightened level of technical scrutiny in wastewater recycling initiatives.
    The study''s primary objectives are realigned to not only optimize the spatial
    distribution of treated water but also to meet the stringent technical standards
    requisite for groundwater recharge. Emphasizing the specific requirements of groundwater
    replenishment sites, this research aims to bridge the gap between wastewater recycling
    and groundwater quality enhancement, paving the way for a more focused and impactful
    sustainable water management approach. 2. Methods – wastewater recycling The proposed
    methodology strategically integrates Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Style-Based
    Generator Generative Adversarial Networks (StyleGAN) with a heightened focus on
    groundwater-centric parameters. The application of SOM extends beyond optimizing
    general spatial distribution to identifying optimal locations for recycling outlets
    with a direct impact on groundwater replenishment. StyleGAN, in turn, tailors
    its generative capacity to meet the technical benchmarks necessary for elevated
    groundwater quality. The proposed algorithmic processes underscore the method''s
    adaptability to groundwater dynamics and stringent quality requisites. The method
    for wastewater recycling integrates SOM and StyleGAN to address the challenges
    associated with conventional wastewater treatment. This innovative approach unfolds
    in two key phases, each leveraging distinct technological strengths. 1) SOM: Self-Organizing
    Maps are a type of artificial neural network used in data analysis and visualization.
    They help organize and represent complex data in a way that makes it easier to
    understand patterns and relationships. 2) StyleGAN: StyleGAN is a sophisticated
    type of artificial intelligence model used in image generation. It excels in creating
    realistic and high-quality images by learning and applying different styles from
    a diverse set of examples. 3) Wastewater Recycling: Wastewater recycling is a
    process where treated wastewater, which has undergone purification to remove contaminants,
    is reused for various purposes such as irrigation, industrial processes, or other
    non-potable uses. This sustainable practice helps conserve water resources and
    reduces environmental impact. In the first phase, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are
    employed to create a spatial representation of the wastewater treatment system.
    SOMs excel in organizing complex spatial information, allowing for the identification
    of optimal locations for recycling outlets and treatment facilities. This spatial
    intelligence is crucial for optimizing the distribution of treated water, ensuring
    it reaches high-demand areas with maximum efficiency. By strategically placing
    recycling outlets, the system enhances resource utilization and minimizes wastage.
    The second phase introduces StyleGAN to elevate the quality of treated wastewater.
    Drawing inspiration from a diverse array of wastewater samples, StyleGAN undergoes
    a learning process to generate high-quality water with reduced contaminants and
    improved aesthetics. This transformative step enhances the usability of treated
    wastewater for various non-potable purposes, including irrigation and industrial
    processes. The SOM and StyleGAN is a distinctive feature of the proposed method.
    While SOM optimizes the spatial distribution of treated water, StyleGAN contributes
    by enhancing its quality. The combination of these technologies offers a comprehensive
    solution to wastewater recycling, addressing both distribution efficiency and
    water quality enhancement. SOM creates a smart spatial model of the wastewater
    treatment system, helping identify the best locations for recycling outlets and
    treatment facilities. This optimizes the spatial distribution of treated water,
    ensuring it reaches high-demand areas with maximum efficiency. Conventional methods
    may lack this spatial intelligence, leading to less efficient distribution. The
    use of SOM allows for the strategic placement of recycling outlets, enhancing
    resource utilization, and minimizing wastage. This strategic approach is more
    targeted and effective than conventional methods, which may rely on less precise
    distribution strategies. The StyleGAN improves the quality of treated wastewater.
    By learning from diverse samples, StyleGAN generates water with reduced contaminants
    and improved aesthetics. This quality enhancement makes the treated wastewater
    more versatile for non-potable purposes. Conventional methods may not have the
    capability to systematically improve water quality to the same extent. 2.1. Spatial
    representation of wastewater treatment system This section refers to the creation
    of a visual model or map that captures the geographical layout and arrangement
    of components within the wastewater treatment infrastructure (Saravanan et al.,
    2023). This spatial representation is achieved through the application of SOM.
    Instead of relying solely on traditional linear models, SOM introduces a dynamic
    and spatially intelligent approach. It organizes the intricate network of wastewater
    treatment facilities, outlets, and relevant structures into a coherent and visually
    accessible format. Essentially, this spatial representation acts as a blueprint,
    guiding decisions on the strategic placement of key elements within the wastewater
    treatment system. The goal is to optimize the spatial arrangement in a way that
    enhances the efficiency of treated water distribution. Through the insights derived
    from the spatial representation, the system can better cater to high-demand areas,
    minimizing resource wastage and maximizing overall efficiency. Let us denote the
    input data as xi, where i represents individual data points. The weight vector
    associated with each neuron in the SOM is denoted as wj, where j represents individual
    neurons in the map. 2.1.1. Euclidean distance The Euclidean distance between the
    input data xi and the weight vector wj for a neuron j is given by: d(xi,wj) =
    ∑k(xi,k−wj,k)2 Here, n represents the dimensionality of the input data. 2.1.2.
    Best Matching Unit (BMU) The neuron with the smallest Euclidean distance to the
    input data is identified as the Best Matching Unit. Mathematically, it can be
    expressed as: j∗ = argminjd(xi,wj) where j∗ represents the index of the winning
    neuron. 2.1.3. Neighborhood function The neighborhood function defines how the
    influence of the winning neuron extends to its neighboring neurons. One commonly
    used neighborhood function is the Gaussian function: hj∗j(t) = exp(−2σ2(t)∥rj−rj∗∥2)
    where, rj and rj∗ are the positions of neurons j and j∗ on the map, and σ(t) is
    the width of the neighborhood at iteration t. 2.1.4. Updating the weight vector
    The weight vectors are updated based on both the influence of the neighborhood
    and the similarity between the input data and the current weights: wj(t+1) = wj(t)+α(t)⋅hj∗j(t)⋅(xi−wj(t))
    where, α(t) is the learning rate at iteration t. 2.2. Identification of optimal
    locations using SOM Identification of Optimal Locations using SOM involves leveraging
    the capabilities of SOM to determine the most advantageous positions within a
    system (Arumugam et al., 2023). In the context of wastewater treatment, this pertains
    to locating the most suitable sites for recycling outlets and treatment facilities
    without arousing the attention of any detectors. It also emphasizes the spatial
    intelligence provided by SOM not only in optimizing general distribution but specifically
    in strategically identifying locations for recycling outlets conducive to groundwater
    recharge. The algorithm for the identification of optimal locations within the
    SOM framework is recalibrated to accentuate its applicability to groundwater replenishment
    sites. The distribution strategy is fine-tuned to ensure treated water efficiently
    reaches high-demand areas critical for groundwater recharge. SOM achieves this
    by creating a spatial representation of the wastewater treatment system, organizing
    it in a way that reflects the underlying relationships between different components.
    The identification process is facilitated through the concept of the Best Matching
    Unit (BMU). For each input data point, the neuron with the smallest Euclidean
    distance to the data point is deemed the BMU. The BMU serves as a pointer to the
    optimal location on the SOM, representing the best-suited position for a recycling
    outlet or treatment facility. This identification is inherently tied to the spatial
    intelligence embedded in the SOM, allowing it to discern patterns and relationships
    within the complex network of the wastewater treatment system. The use of SOM
    for this purpose aligns with the goal of optimizing resource distribution and
    minimizing wastage. By strategically placing recycling outlets and treatment facilities
    at these optimal locations, the system can enhance its efficiency in treating
    and distributing water, contributing to sustainable and resource-efficient practices.
    Algorithm. Identification of Optimal Locations using SOM Input: Wastewater treatment
    system data; Number of neurons in the SOM grid; Learning rate schedule and Neighborhood
    width schedule Output: Trained SOM with optimal locations identified 1. Initialize
    SOM weights randomly. 2. Specify initial and final values for learning rate (α)
    and neighborhood width (σ). 3. For each epoch do 4. for each data point x in the
    wastewater treatment system do 5. Find the Best Matching Unit (BMU) using the
    Euclidean distance. 6. Update the SOM weights using the BMU and the neighborhood
    function. 7. end for 8. Update learning rate (α) and neighborhood width (σ) based
    on schedules. 9. End for 10. For each data point x in the wastewater treatment
    system do 11. Find the BMU for the data point x using the trained SOM. 12. Record
    the location of the identified BMU as an optimal location. 13. End for 14. Trained
    SOM with optimal locations identified. 2.3. Streamlining Distribution of Treated
    Water Streamlining Distribution of Treated Water involves optimizing the flow
    and allocation of treated water within a system. It''s like orchestrating a well-choreographed
    dance where each drop of water finds its designated spot without raising any eyebrows.
    In wastewater recycling, this process is facilitated by the spatial representation
    generated by SOM. By strategically organizing the components of the wastewater
    treatment system, including recycling outlets and treatment facilities, the distribution
    of treated water can be optimized. The term streamlining implies making this distribution
    process more efficient and resource-conscious. It is about ensuring that treated
    water reaches its intended destinations with maximum efficiency, minimizing any
    unnecessary detours or resource wastage. SOM plays a key role in achieving this
    by providing a spatial intelligence that guides decision-making regarding the
    best routes for distributing treated water. By identifying optimal locations through
    the earlier stages of the SOM algorithm, the system can intelligently channel
    treated water to high-demand areas, contributing to a more effective and sustainable
    water management strategy (Shanmugamoorthy et al., 2023). Once optimal locations
    are identified through SOM, the distribution strategy can be updated. Suppose
    Lopt represents the set of optimal locations identified. The distribution strategy
    D(xi) for a data point xi can be influenced by the proximity to the optimal locations.
    One simple way to express this could be: D(xi) = ∑l ∈ Loptwl⋅exp(−2σ2∥xi−l∥2)
    where, wl represents the weight associated with the optimal location l, and σ
    is a parameter influencing the distribution width (see Fig. 1). 2.4. Learning
    from diverse wastewater samples using StyleGAN Learning from diverse wastewater
    samples means that StyleGAN (Fig. 2) is trained on a broad range of wastewater
    data, capturing the diverse characteristics and compositions of different samples.
    It allows the model to understand and generate variations in the quality of treated
    water. The term diverse wastewater samples encompass the various compositions,
    contaminants, and qualities found in different wastewater sources. Download :

    By exposing StyleGAN to this diversity during training, the model learns to adapt
    and generate high-quality treated water that accommodates a spectrum of scenarios.
    This adaptability is valuable for ensuring the versatility and effectiveness of
    the treated water in various applications. StyleGAN, being a generative model,
    learns the underlying patterns and structures in the wastewater data, enabling
    it to generate realistic and improved versions of treated water. It refines its
    understanding of what constitutes high-quality water by learning from the nuances
    present in diverse wastewater samples. Wastewater samples are represented as data
    points in a high-dimensional space, capturing various features and characteristics.
    StyleGAN consists of a generator network, which is responsible for transforming
    random noise into realistic samples. It involves complex mathematical transformations
    that are learned during the training process. StyleGAN employs an adversarial
    training framework, where a discriminator network is simultaneously trained to
    distinguish between real and generated samples. The generator aims to produce
    samples that are indistinguishable from real wastewater samples. The style in
    StyleGAN refers to the ability to control various aspects of the generated output.
    The model learns to separate the content and style of the generated samples, allowing
    for greater diversity and adaptability. During training, the model is exposed
    to a diverse set of wastewater samples, capturing different compositions and qualities.
    This exposure enables the model to learn the variations present in the data. The
    trained StyleGAN can adapt to new inputs and generate high-quality treated water
    samples based on the learned patterns. The diversity learned during training ensures
    that the model can produce realistic variations in the treated water quality.
    2.4.1. Training data StyleGAN is trained on a diverse set of wastewater samples,
    encompassing various compositions, contaminants, and qualities found in different
    wastewater sources. This diverse training data serves as a broad palette, exposing
    the model to a wide range of scenarios it might encounter in real-world applications.
    2.4.2. High-dimensional representation Wastewater samples are represented as data
    points in a high-dimensional space, capturing various features and characteristics.
    This representation allows StyleGAN to understand the complex and nuanced aspects
    of wastewater data. 2.4.3. Generator network StyleGAN consists of a generator
    network, responsible for transforming random noise into realistic samples of treated
    water. This network learns complex mathematical transformations during the training
    process to generate diverse and realistic outputs. 2.4.4. Adversarial training
    framework StyleGAN employs an adversarial training framework, where a discriminator
    network is simultaneously trained to distinguish between real and generated samples.
    The generator''s goal is to produce samples that are indistinguishable from real
    wastewater samples. This adversarial process sharpens the generator''s ability
    to create realistic outputs. In the StyleGAN architecture for wastewater treatment,
    the generator transforms noise into realistic treated water samples. Working in
    an adversarial framework, the generator aims to produce samples indistinguishable
    from real wastewater, and the discriminator sharpens its ability to differentiate.
    This constant interplay leads to the generation of high-quality treated water.
    The separation of content and style in StyleGAN allows for greater control over
    various aspects of the output, contributing to the model adaptability and diversity.
    The efforts of the generator and discriminator, coupled with content-style separation,
    result in realistic and versatile treated water production. Algorithm. Learning

    refers to the process of creating or synthesizing treated water. The term high-quality
    implies that the generated water meets or exceeds certain desirable criteria in
    terms of purity, composition, and aesthetic attributes. The techn, in this case,
    StyleGAN, has undergone training using diverse wastewater samples. It has learned
    from the intricacies and variations present in these samples, enabling it to generate
    treated water that is not only realistic but also of elevated quality. The model
    has internalized the patterns and characteristics associated with high-quality
    treated water through its learning process. This approach contributes to the versatility
    of the generated water, making it suitable for various non-potable purposes such
    as irrigation or industrial processes. The goal is to provide a reliable and efficient
    method for producing treated water that aligns with stringent quality standards,
    contributing to sustainable water management practices. 2.5.1. Generator network
    StyleGAN employs a generator network that takes random noise as input and transforms
    it into synthetic samples of treated water. The internal workings of this generator
    involve a series of mathematical transformations, including linear operations,
    non-linear activation functions, and the modulation of features based on learned
    styles. 2.5.2. Adversarial training The training process involves adversarial
    training, where a discriminator network is concurrently trained to distinguish
    between real and generated treated water samples. The generator aims to produce
    treated water samples that are indistinguishable from real samples, driving the
    model to generate high-quality outputs. 2.5.3. Style-based architecture StyleGAN
    introduces a style-based architecture, allowing for control over various aspects
    of the generated output. The separation of content and style enables the model
    to produce diverse and high-quality variations of treated water. It dedicated
    to StyleGAN is refined to explicitly outline its role in not only improving the
    aesthetic quality of treated wastewater but also aligning with technical standards
    essential for groundwater recharge. StyleGAN''s adversarial training framework
    is elucidated to emphasize its role in generating high-quality treated water that
    surpasses the conventional non-potable standards, making it apt for groundwater
    applications. 2.5.4. Diversity learning During training, StyleGAN is exposed to
    diverse wastewater samples, teaching the model to adapt and generate treated water
    of superior quality that accommodates a range of scenarios. Algorithm. Generation
    of High-Quality Treated Water using StyleGAN Input: Trained StyleGAN model, Random
    noise vector (input to the generator) Output: High-quality synthetic treated water
    sample 1. Provide a random noise vector as input to the trained StyleGAN generator.
    2. Execute the generator to produce a synthetic treated water sample. 3. Optionally,
    adjust the style or other parameters to control specific characteristics of the
    generated sample. 4. Obtain the generated treated water sample. To enhance the
    sustainability of groundwater resources, our proposed method combines the spatial
    intelligence of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with the generative capabilities of
    Style-Based Generator Generative Adversarial Networks (StyleGAN). The SOM facilitates
    the spatial representation of wastewater treatment systems, optimizing the placement
    of recycling outlets and treatment facilities to cater specifically to high-demand
    areas crucial for groundwater recharge. Simultaneously, StyleGAN learns from diverse
    wastewater samples to generate high-quality treated water, surpassing conventional
    non-potable standards. By integrating SOM''s spatial optimization with StyleGAN''s
    ability to produce realistic and versatile treated water, our method aims to contribute
    to efficient groundwater replenishment strategies, ensuring the responsible utilization
    of water resources. The algorithm is recalibrated to identify optimal locations
    specifically conducive to groundwater replenishment sites, ensuring a distribution
    strategy fine-tuned for efficient channeling of treated water to areas crucial
    for groundwater recharge. The SOM''s spatial representation not only streamlines
    water distribution but also contributes to the flow of water tailored for groundwater
    recharge. Simultaneously, the StyleGAN component focuses on improving treated
    wastewater quality, making it suitable for groundwater applications. By learning
    from diverse wastewater samples, StyleGAN generates water with reduced contaminants
    and improved aesthetics, aligning with stringent quality requisites essential
    for groundwater replenishment. The adaptability of StyleGAN ensures that the treated
    water meets technical benchmarks necessary for elevated groundwater quality. 3.

    with existing methods in terms of different performance metrics. The proposed
    method is compared with the existing MLP, DBN and GAN-ANN. Table 1 shows the experimental
    setup for simulating the proposed work. Table 1. Experimental setup. Parameter

    Dimensions 512 In the training loop of StyleGAN, hyperparameters are carefully
    adjusted to optimize the generation of diverse and high-quality treated water
    samples. The learning rate, determining the pace of model adaptation, is fine-tuned
    to strike a balance between stability and the model ability to capture diverse
    patterns in wastewater data. Batch size is experimented with to enhance diversity
    and generalization, with smaller batches potentially promoting diversity and larger
    ones improving overall learning. The introduction of noise during generation,
    manipulation of style mixing probability, and architectural design adjustments
    all contribute to the model adaptability and capacity to produce diverse treated
    water outputs. Through iterative tuning of these hyperparameters and monitoring
    the model performance, the training loop ensures the generation of realistic and
    versatile treated water samples. The training duration itself is a crucial hyperparameter,
    influencing how well the model generalizes from the data. The careful adjustment
    of hyperparameters throughout the training loop is pivotal in achieving a StyleGAN
    model capable of generating treated water samples that not only exhibit high quality
    but also reflect the diverse characteristics present in different wastewater scenarios.
    3.1. Performance metrics The evaluation of the generated treated water can be
    assessed using various performance metrics, including: • Fidelity measures how
    closely the generated treated water resembles real samples. • Diversity examines
    the range of variations present in the generated samples. • Contaminant Reduction
    quantifies the effectiveness of the generator in reducing contaminants. • Aesthetic
    Quality: Subjective measure assessing the visual appeal of the generated treated
    water. 3.2. Range of diversity Diversity is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where
    0 indicates low diversity (all generated samples are similar), and 1 indicates
    high diversity (generated samples exhibit a wide range of variations). The proposed
    SOM method consistently demonstrates higher diversity compared to existing methods
    over the 1000 iterations, indicating its capability to generate a more varied
    set of treated water samples. 3.3. Contaminant reduction Contaminant Reduction
    is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates minimal reduction in contaminants,
    and 1 indicates a substantial reduction. The proposed SOM method consistently
    outperforms existing methods over the 1000 iterations in terms of reducing contaminants
    in the generated treated water samples. 3.4. Aesthetic quality and fidelity Fidelity
    is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match to the real
    data. The proposed SOM method consistently outperforms existing methods over the
    1000 iterations, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity results.
    Diversity is a crucial aspect of treated water generation to ensure adaptability
    to various scenarios. SOM consistently outperforms other methods in terms of diversity,
    reaching a value of 0.90 at the final iteration. This indicates a substantial
    percentage improvement compared to GAN-ANN, emphasizing the versatility of SOM
    in producing a varied set of treated water samples (Fig. 3). Contaminant reduction
    is a pivotal metric for evaluating the quality of generated treated water. The
    proposed SOM method achieves a contaminant reduction of 0.97 at the final iteration
    as shown in Fig. 4, representing a substantial percentage improvement over GAN-ANN.
    This highlights the efficacy of SOM in reducing contaminants and enhancing the
    quality of the generated water. Aesthetic quality is a subjective yet crucial
    metric, especially for non-potable water use. The SOM method consistently demonstrates
    superior aesthetic quality, reaching a value of 0.97 at the final iteration. This
    showcases a significant percentage improvement over GAN-ANN, indicating that SOM
    produces treated water with higher visual appeal (Fig. 6). The SOM method exhibits
    a consistent improvement in fidelity compared to MLP, DBN, and GAN-ANN. At the
    final iteration, SOM achieves a fidelity of 0.97, showcasing a substantial percentage
    improvement over the next-best method, GAN-ANN as shown in Fig. 2. The fidelity

    Conclusion The experimental results present a compelling case for the efficacy
    of the proposed SOM method in treated water generation. The method demonstrates
    consistent superiority over existing approaches: MLP, DBN, and GAN-ANN across
    various critical performance metrics. The substantial improvements observed in
    fidelity, diversity, contaminant reduction, and aesthetic quality highlight the
    versatility and effectiveness of SOM in generating high-quality treated water.
    The spatial intelligence embedded in SOM contributes to its success in identifying
    optimal locations, streamlining distribution, and enhancing the overall quality
    of the generated water. The percentage improvements achieved by SOM over the course
    of 1000 iterations underscore its potential for advancing the state-of-the-art
    in treated water generation technologies. While the proposed wastewater treatment
    method using StyleGAN and SOM shows promise, practical applicability faces challenges.
    Data representativeness is crucial, as incomplete datasets may limit the model''s
    adaptability. High computational requirements pose scalability issues, hindering
    widespread adoption. Real-time adaptability is a challenge, as the responsiveness
    to dynamic changes in wastewater conditions is essential for practical utility.
    Future research can enhance the proposed wastewater treatment method by refining
    data representativeness, optimizing computational efficiency, improving model
    interpretability, addressing ethical considerations, optimizing real-time adaptability,
    fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration, and conducting user engagement studies.
    To establish a symbiotic relationship between these two vital water resources,
    forthcoming investigations should concentrate on devising novel methodologies
    for recycling in conjunction with sustainable groundwater management. This research
    sets the stage for future investigations into the practical implementation of
    SOM and GANs for wastewater treatment and groundwater replenishment. Further exploration
    will focus on optimizing these technologies to create a robust and adaptable framework

    The increase in the world’s population in recent years and the forecast to reach
    9 billion by 2050 impact the need to increase food productivity [1] using the
    same agricultural areas, with reduced costs and less environmental impact. Factors
    such as extreme weather events, more demanding consumers, population concentrated
    in urban centers, and scarce natural resources are the major challenges to be
    faced [2]. In this context, some technologies of Industry 4.0 implemented in agriculture
    in recent years have generated impacts in several regions with climate change,
    scarcity of drinking water, and soil degradation, and in this context, some Industry
    4.0 technologies [3] can contribute to the management of inputs for planting and
    harvesting, the optimization of soil [4], water, and fertilizer use [5], an increase
    in productivity and food quality, and a decrease in environmental impacts [6]
    with the replacement of fossil energy sources by bio-renewable ones [7]. The digital
    revolution has had a great impact on development in several areas [8,9,10,11],
    and in agriculture [12], water use management projects [5] with controlled irrigation
    [6], use of soil parameter sensors [13] with nutrient application [14], and real-time
    monitoring [15] of increasingly unfavorable weather conditions in many regions
    [16] are options for smart agriculture [17]. The digitalization of agriculture
    [18] with the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies [19] has the potential to
    expand productivity, better control the product life cycle, aid cooperation in
    the production chain [20], reduce environmental impacts, improve food safety with
    reduced food waste [21], and increase the sustainable use of natural resources
    [22,23], and resilience to supply in times of scarcity [24]. The collection of
    large volumes of on-farm data [17,25], indicating weather and planting conditions
    [26], more detailed knowledge about planting and harvesting [27], and decreased
    waste [28], makes processes more controlled [17,25] and serves to support farmers
    in data-driven decision-making processes [21,29,30]. Integrating smallholder farmers
    into innovative trends [31] contributes to keeping young people in the countryside
    with rural tourism and social entrepreneurship activities, diversifying household
    income [32]. Additionally, various technological solutions are still restricted
    to large agricultural conglomerates and are more focused on profit than on food
    security and social context [33]. The Agriculture 4.0 revolution is an opportunity
    for farmers to meet the challenges in food production and enable the creation
    of added value by combining innovative technologies: precision agriculture, information
    and communication technology, robotics, and Big Data [34]. The increase in food
    production and, consequently, the consumption of natural resources, combined with
    other industrial activities, have increasingly affected environmental, social,
    and economic conditions [35]. Thus, the concept of the Circular Economy, with
    examples in China in the 1990s, in the use of natural resources [36], presents
    a change in the form of business and can contribute to the sustainable development
    of society [37]. The objectives of the Circular Economy are to reuse materials
    through recycling processes [38] and with the principles of conservation of natural
    resources, balancing consumption between renewable and non-renewable resources,
    with a longer lifetime of resource use and a reduction in the negative effects
    of productive systems [39]. These are important factors that can be applied with
    the new technologies of Industry 4.0 in precision agriculture to generate environmental,
    economic, and social balance. A few studies have explored various technologies
    in agriculture, but none have addressed an Integrated Service Architecture or
    its role in promoting the Circular Economy by illustrating how these technologies
    interact and collaborate. Moreover, the implementation of technologies was limited
    to an automation process such as irrigation control, fertilizer control, or even
    the storage of harvest variables and provision of some computerized support for
    farmers. Considering the great demand for food production, food safety, innovations,
    and new technologies to evaluate and minimize environmental and social impacts,
    no studies were found that can provide information to farmers about farm management,
    natural resource use needs, plantation and harvest data, and support for strategic
    or operational decision making. Based on the findings, this research aims to propose
    a Service Architecture that integrates Industry 4.0 technologies with the Circular
    Economy principles to promote sustainable development in agriculture. The paper
    provides a structured examination beginning with an introduction, followed by
    a detailed methodology in Section 2, an exploration of the Service Architecture
    for smart agriculture in Section 3, and ending with comprehensive conclusions
    in Section 4. 2. Methodology The study employed a systematic literature review
    to select and analyze scientific research on Industry 4.0 technologies applied
    in agriculture and their associated environmental, economic, and social gains.
    Bibliometrics enabled the identification of diverse publications, along with the
    use of quantitative and graphical data [40] and a systematic literature review
    to develop content analysis, coding, and categorization of data [41]. The systematic
    review applied in this research is characterized as a scientific, replicable,
    and transparent method [42]. Data verification was performed by two researchers
    to reduce researcher error and bias [43], by filtering the selected research [44]
    through systematic reviews and analyses with the adoption of inclusion and exclusion
    criteria [45]. The initial stage of planning the systematic literature review
    involved the definition of the research protocol, which included the search strategies,
    selection criteria, and analysis of the selected articles. For this study, the
    research objective was to propose a Service Architecture that enables the promotion
    of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. The next step was the definition of
    the search terms and a consistent scientific procedure, including the definition
    of a set of keywords referring to Industry 4.0-enabling technologies. They were
    created as shown in Table A1, and with the use of logical operators OR and AND,
    the search strings were built in the Scopus digital library, as presented in Table
    A2. For the information collection step, the authors utilized the Scopus database
    chosen for its technical and scientific content, as well as content from areas
    related to the objectives of this article. A total of 1425 articles were identified,
    and these will be comprehensively detailed in the Bibliometrics section (Section
    3.1). In Table A3, the inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized in the systematic
    literature review are presented. A systematic literature review was undertaken,
    revealing a total of 755 articles. From this pool, 271 articles underwent thorough
    content analysis, leading to the identification of 114 articles specifically addressing
    the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture, as illustrated in
    Table 1. Table 1. Industry 4.0 technologies used in farms, production, and supply
    chain in the food agriculture sector. 1 = Farm; 2 = Factory; 3 = Supply Chain;
    4 = Big Data. 3. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture In this section, the
    bibliometric review and the proposed Service Architecture for smart agriculture
    will be presented. 3.1. Bibliometrics The initial search using the specified strings
    (refer to Table A1) resulted in a total of 1425 articles, categorized into various
    types, as outlined in Table A4. Figure 1 shows the number of studies classified
    by year. It is notable that there is a growing interest in the adoption of Industry
    4.0 technologies in agriculture. This interest is influenced by factors such as
    the increase in the world population and the necessity to produce higher-quality
    food, enhance productivity per hectare, and ensure sustainability throughout the
    agricultural chain. Figure 1. Distribution of selected articles published by year.
    The utilization of IoT on farms, as the most widely adopted technology, involves
    the incorporation of sensors and devices for measuring soil and environmental
    characteristics. Subsequently, the adoption of IoT technologies, the cloud, Big
    Data, and AI (artificial intelligence) [78] signifies that farms not only monitor
    soil and environmental data but also store them in cloud services. With the utilization
    of tools such as artificial intelligence within the Big Data ecosystem, they can
    already add value in business management and decision-making processes. Another
    crucial aspect is the integration of IoT and AI within a context where computing
    is transitioning to the edge, involving microcontrolled systems and artificial
    intelligence algorithms. This transition contributes to reducing latency in communication
    networks [86]. 3.2. Proposed Architecture Following the findings of the systematic
    literature review (Section 2), the articles were analyzed and evaluated based
    on their contribution to constructing a layered structure. This structure facilitates
    the organized placement and integration of technologies. Figure 2 illustrates
    the proposed architecture developed to promote a Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Figure 2. Proposed architecture. The architecture depicted in Figure 2 consists
    of sensors, connections between farm machinery, local and remote networks (via
    the Internet), cloud platforms, storage utilizing Big Data technologies, and computer
    systems operating both in the cloud and in computer centers. The information generated
    by expert systems, data analysis, and the utilization of artificial intelligence
    provides outputs in the form of dashboards, directs actions on connected equipment,
    and facilitates decision making, both at the strategic and operational levels.
    This architecture comprises three layers: the “Farm Scenery” data collection layer,
    the ”Cloud Storage” data collection layer, and the “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” central processing layer responsible for processing and outputting
    information for decision making: “Farm Scenery” layer: Precision agriculture is
    conducted here through the application of Industry 4.0 technologies. This involves
    sensors for the automated real-time collection of agricultural data, including
    water consumption, land use, and other input variables. The sensors and machines
    are interconnected through wireless networks in an IoT system. “Cloud Storage”
    layer: Data collected via wireless sensor networks, positioned at various points
    in the plantation, are transmitted to the cloud. This process is facilitated by
    a gateway, which serves to convert communication technologies from the sensor
    network into Internet access technologies. “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” layer: The received data undergo analysis using computational tools,
    and the resulting information is utilized for decision making, both at the control
    center level and within the farm itself. Information visualization is made accessible
    through graphic panels on local computers or mobile devices, printed reports,
    and commands for direct action on devices installed on the farm, thereby enabling
    some processes to be fully automated. The architecture will be elaborated by organizing
    the findings of the systematic literature review obtained from digital databases
    into the three layers of the proposed structure. 3.2.1. Farm Scenery Layer Data
    digitization in agriculture begins with identifying the variables to be controlled
    when planting on farms [84], such as temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients,
    as well as weather conditions such as humidity, air temperature, light, crop nutrients
    [76], and pest control [121]. IoT enables this through sensors installed at various
    points on the farm, exchanging information between electronic devices [113] and
    applied in agriculture to provide monitoring of weather, soil thermal conditions
    [81], and water [29,30], pest and disease detection [103], and product traceability
    [101]. Industry 4.0 technologies applied to agriculture enable real-time data
    collection, input management, soil control, disease prevention, increased production,
    optimizing resources, and generating income [114]. The use of drones with IoT
    sensors is already a possibility for data collection in scenarios where the installation
    of sensor networks is not possible [91]. Temperature affects crop growth and the
    breeding of bacteria, and through a system of collecting air and soil temperature
    and humidity, a mathematical model was developed that evaluates environmental
    conditions and compares them with established standards, generating alerts for
    decision making by farmers [126]. The need to reduce the use of natural resources
    such as water and fertilizers in agriculture, the treatment of waste generated
    in planting, harvesting, and food industry processing activities, and the increase
    in production [14] have been the driver for the deployment of Industry 4.0 technologies
    in agriculture [117]. The analysis of climate conditions for agriculture is based
    on three factors: resource management, ecosystem conservation [114], and adequate
    services to farmers using information technology, thus generating profitability,
    product quality, and reducing the environmental footprint, with less use of pesticides
    [90]. Crop irrigation uses a source of water that is transported through pipelines
    and with on-and-off actuating devices and valves that then control the flow of
    water. The amount of water depends on each crop, and several forms of irrigation
    can be used, such as drip, sprinkler, furrow, and manual [127]. A simulation of
    irrigation control applied on farms in Brazil, with the use of IoT technologies,
    is a model considering the parameters of water requirements and irrigation time,
    which directly affect water use efficiency and evapotranspiration [30]. On the
    other hand, a low-cost system with environmental data acquisition can provide
    measurements of air temperature and velocity, soil temperature, pH, and dissolved
    oxygen, and thus control plant growth and environmental impacts [26]. A potato
    production system in Cyprus [114] was developed by using a sensor network to collect
    air and soil characteristics, and the data were sent to the cloud, where they
    were stored and analyzed, thus providing services to farmers for pest control
    and commands for automatic irrigation and fertilization [95]. Climate change has
    a strong impact on agriculture, and parameters such as water scarcity, soil degradation,
    increased energy needs, population growth, and increased demand for food impact
    the search for solutions [114]. For instance, the construction of smart greenhouses
    makes it possible to manage environmental variables [113] with control of humidity,
    air quantity, temperature, and favorable characteristics for plants [28,111] using
    models to manage heating, ventilation, CO2 control, and artificial lighting in
    an infrastructure that contributes to precision, sustainable, and manageable agriculture
    [113]. The data collected by the various sensors dispersed throughout the crops
    need to be sent for storage and analysis to extract information that can assist
    in decision making and return automated commands for control, since the Internet
    is not yet fully available in agricultural areas. It becomes necessary to use
    wireless network technologies in agriculture digitization projects, collecting
    data from distributed sensors in the field [4,84]. Applications with wireless
    sensor networks in smart agriculture include covering large areas with interconnecting
    sensors [6] and gathering large amounts of data. Activities in agriculture have
    integrated IoT technologies in robotic systems and been applied in planting, harvesting,
    and food production to enable cooperation between workers and smart systems and
    information sharing in the food production chain [107]. A proposed innovative
    smart IoT-based system based on microprocessors and a Single-Board Computer (BSC)
    for data logging using various sensors [50] can monitor soil moisture, air humidity,
    air temperature, and UV light, supporting precision irrigation of crops and enabling
    real-time exploitation of data for minimization of errors, as well as forecasting.
    In Colombia, on a coffee farm, wireless sensor networks are used to collect leaf
    condition data remotely through image analysis processing, detect diseases on
    the plantation [94], and generate information for pesticide application. This
    strategy decreases the risks of crop loss and improves the productive performance
    of the farm [112]. Automated fertigation [109] is applied in precision agriculture
    by collecting data on moisture and soil characteristics, and through an IoT system
    and sensor networks with ZigBee technology, the system was developed to control
    fertilizer use and reduce water consumption [14], thus providing reduced environmental
    impacts [95]. The growth of the number of sensors scattered in agriculture can
    generate a large amount of data, and latency problems may occur in sending data
    through technologies such as Bluetooth in relevant virtual network scenarios [75].
    Applications using machine learning [93] with a prototype for acquiring data from
    multiple sensors, machine learning algorithms, Geo statistics, and localization
    of IoT devices [115] are examples. The case study using computer vision [94] and
    machine learning [27] for inspecting coffee leaves on a farm in Colombia is an
    important practical example. The use of tractors in agriculture [3] plays an important
    role in farms and [98] modern combustion systems with electronic systems, including
    the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence [78], managing fuel injection,
    reducing pollutant emissions, lowering fuel costs [5], and improving environmental
    and economic gains. Tractors equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System), through
    the CAN-BUS (Controller Area Network) protocol, transmit the data of tasks performed
    and, after analysis, evaluate the most appropriate use of the tractor, extending
    the useful life and reducing maintenance costs [87]. In research conducted in
    Brazil, agricultural machines equipped with automation technologies have proven
    very productive in sowing, spraying, fertilizing, and harvesting activities, doing
    so autonomously, with relevant economic gains and lower cost per hectare [3].
    An automatic irrigation control system using IoT, with data input from weather
    stations and soil moisture sensors interconnected by gateway LoRa (Long Range)
    networks and command messages sent by the MQTT protocol (Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport) [6], adapts the efficient use of water on a plantation, generating
    savings and better product quality [8]. It is important to note that using advanced
    technologies such as IoT and AI to manage irrigation is a way to maximize crop
    yield while minimizing water consumption, in line with Agriculture 4.0 principles
    [51]. Nonetheless, intelligent sensing systems based on the edge-computing paradigm
    are essential for the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Agriculture
    4.0 applications, and the development of edge-computing wireless sensing systems
    is required to improve sensor accuracy in soil and data interpretation [47]. The
    Farm Scenery layer is presented in Figure 3, and the environmental variables to
    be collected are environmental humidity, temperature, luminosity, temperature,
    pH, water flow, and soil parameters, as shown in Table 2. Figure 3. Farm Scenery
    layer of Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. Table 2. Input variables used for soil monitoring
    and irrigation. 3.2.2. Cloud Storage Layer The data collected through wireless
    sensor networks, installed at various points of the plantation, are sent to the
    cloud with the use of a gateway, which is equipment that converts communication
    technologies of the sensor network to Internet access technologies, such as networks
    with LoRa technology [79]. Smart horticulture incorporates a variety of technologies,
    devices, protocols, and computational models to enhance farming processes. Blockchain,
    Big Data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and edge processing provide
    capabilities and solutions for storing, analyzing, and managing the vast data
    generated by components [74]. The data collected from sensors on the farm and
    sent for storage in a cloud environment (Figure 4) are transformed into information
    that will be used for decision making in agricultural management actions. Thus,
    autonomous systems of irrigation control and fertilizer application can be built,
    contributing to the economy of financial resources for the purchase of these inputs;
    environmental gains, with a reduction in the use of scarce resources in nature
    and in workers’ exposure to some of these products, are obtained, along with social
    gains, such as a reduction in diseases, accidents, and sick leave [102]. Figure

    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information Flow.
    With an architecture for monitoring variables of the air, soil, planting, and
    harvesting in a corn plantation and using sensors interconnected in wireless networks
    and communication gateways, the data are sent for cloud storage to allow its analysis
    [16]. 3.2.3. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output Layer After the stage
    of data analysis using computational tools and the extraction of information,
    the next stage is the output, with the visualization of information through graphical
    panels available on web pages or mobile devices such as smartphones, printed reports,
    and commands of action in devices installed on the farm, making some processes
    automated. The use of software for agricultural planning provides management of
    farms, the production chain, and the distribution of the food produced [121].
    The monitoring of environmental variables is context-sensitive and provides information
    to end-users such as farmers, agronomists, and traders for decision making and
    supporting agricultural production [16]. Machine learning plays an important role
    in data processing, collection, extraction, and mining activities using algorithms,
    neural networks, and artificial intelligence, which are applied in a variety of
    areas, such as energy, transportation, mining, shipping, healthcare, banking,
    security, and agriculture. Security requirements using machine learning in industrial
    systems [97], which analyze Blockchain-based strategies to preserve privacy in
    industrial systems with data security in sensors [19], can lead to product traceability
    and automated logistics management, saving time and financial resources [108]
    and decreasing food waste [88]. The application of machine learning and analysis
    techniques in agriculture and livestock provides productivity gains with the management
    of animal health and flock management, thereby improving land use, controlling
    animal nutrition, and reducing the environmental impacts generated [96]. The use
    of technologies in data processing in agriculture offers opportunities for the
    integration of diverse systems. A review of the technology standards used in cyber-physical
    systems (CPSs) [125] applied in advanced manufacturing builds the ontology of
    the 5C architecture layers (connection, conversion, computation, cognition, and
    configuration), thus enabling the integration of sensors, actuators, and protocols
    and their application in various areas. In agriculture, CPSs are used in planting
    and harvesting equipment, collecting information on soil conditions and water
    resources, and storage in cloud systems for further processing [107]. The use
    of IoT platforms with microservices involves independent processes acting on specific
    activities, such as, for example, data collection of soil, climate, and parameters
    of irrigated rice and cotton crops [110]. The platform involves hardware and software
    in the cloud, and focuses on irrigation management, presented scalability, flexibility,
    robustness, security, and performance, with possibilities of commercial applications
    in other agricultural crops. An infrastructure using low-cost IoT and free software
    code to monitor weather conditions in organic crops, in a greenhouse, automatically
    controls and generates information made available through graphs on web pages
    with HTML protocol (HyperText Markup Language) [28]. The organization of farms
    by management zones [109] reduces costs for fertilization, pesticides [82,83],
    and water, and with the agricultural records of each one, one can have a decision
    more suitable to the needs of the crop. This strategy applied in a vineyard in
    Spain allows the crops to be classified into three levels of interest: soil, plant,
    or product, thus creating a map with overlapping layers to determine wine quality
    [25]. Sugarcane is planted in several fields on a farm, and as the plantation
    matures, fields are selected for harvesting, which is called harvest windows.
    A model to guide planting and harvesting on farms in South Africa [122] caused
    increased productivity and optimization based on historical data collected when
    adjusted in real-time. A machine routing system is possible in sugar production
    using sensors and IoT techniques, replacing labor and providig more suitable routing,
    higher repeatability, decreased fuel consumption, and better process control,
    with economic and environmental gains [116]. The management of agricultural supply
    chain activities, with the adoption of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems
    and BI (Business Intelligence) techniques, enables communication between those
    involved in the agricultural chain [105], more adequate control, faster solutions
    [7,104] to respond to climate variations, pest control, crop harvesting and management,
    and market trends [118]. Ref. [121] presents studies among farmers in Maranhão,
    Piauí, Tocantins, and western Bahia, in soybean, corn, cotton, coffee, sugarcane,
    beans, and fruit crops where production and marketing integration, material flow
    automation, data management, and more accurate diagnostics to support strategic
    decisions have been adopted as tools of smart farm managers. The presentation
    of information in graphical dashboards becomes a decision support tool for farmers,
    with the use of Internet environments and mobile devices making access much easier
    and more intuitive [7,28]. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is shown in the Figure 5. Figure 5. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output
    layer of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information
    Flow. 3.2.4. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture The substantial volume
    of data generated through the utilization of IoT in agriculture is stored via
    networks and cloud computing. Leveraging Big Data and analytics strategies, it
    facilitates enhanced production by aiding decisions concerning planting, harvesting,
    and production, and automatically issuing commands for irrigation, thereby saving
    the scarce resource of water [5]. A system facilitating the collection of crop
    data, including air temperature, humidity, and soil temperature, stored as input
    variables in the cloud, has undergone analysis to derive actionable insights for
    controlling corn crop cultivation [16]. Utilizing a wireless network architecture
    to connect sensors and a LoRa communication gateway for data transmission to the
    cloud, the subsequent step involves data analysis and extraction of information
    for decision making. This process also includes sending commands to regulate irrigation
    valves, fertilizing devices, lighting control, and heating/cooling systems, embodying
    an autonomous application [16]. A prototype for autonomous irrigation, developed
    and deployed in a farmer cooperative in Spain, gathers data on air temperature,
    humidity, and soil characteristics. These data are transmitted via a LoRa network
    with a coverage range of 5 km to a cloud server. Subsequent analysis returns commands
    for irrigation control, while mobile applications provide information to farmers
    [100]. In Indonesia, image processing using machine learning algorithms was applied
    on a cocoa farm. Texture data of the beans, collected remotely and transmitted
    to the cloud, underwent classification using artificial intelligence techniques,
    demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional visualization methods
    [106]. The processing of vast sensor-generated data on farms is routed to the
    cloud [114,119]. Leveraging Big Data tools [85,117], these data are analyzed and
    converted into actionable information for managerial decision making and issuing
    automation commands for field equipment. A decision support system incorporating
    AI and a suite of machine learning algorithms aids in enhancing overall crop harvest
    quality and accuracy in precision agriculture [52]. This research utilized a dataset
    downloaded from Kaggle, containing eight features with seven independent variables,
    including N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Furthermore, optimization
    techniques were employed to further enhance performance in smart factories. Figure
    6 illustrates the complete design of the Integrated Service Architecture derived
    from the results of the systematic literature review of selected articles, aimed
    at promoting the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Figure 6. Operational vision
    of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. In the layer designated as “Information Processing,
    Analysis, and Output” within the Integrated Service Architecture aimed at advancing
    the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0, the references are categorized according
    to their respective applications, including irrigation control systems, fertilizer
    and pesticide application, crop management, greenhouses, and organization and
    management. These classifications are presented in Table 3 for clarity and ease
    of reference. Table 3. Management systems and outputs used in Intelligent Agriculture.
    3.2.5. Economic, Environmental, and Social Gains The integration of Industry 4.0
    technologies in agriculture empowers farmers with control over crucial resources
    such as water, nutrients [109], pesticides, energy, machinery, robotic devices
    [77], and human resources [32]. Data-driven decision making and innovative business
    models [119] are instrumental in enhancing production strategies [13], reutilizing
    process waste [114], and minimizing losses across the agribusiness chain. Consequently,
    economic benefits can be assessed by analyzing the efficient management of input
    resources utilized in production, alongside the increased availability of high-quality
    products offering added value to consumers. This added value encompasses aspects
    such as product differentiation, enriched nutritional content, and innovative
    packaging strategies, contributing to market competitiveness and profitability
    in agriculture. Environmental benefits are quantifiable through monitoring resource
    consumption indicators such as water usage, nutrient management, and greenhouse
    gas emissions. Furthermore, sustainable agricultural practices may lead to ecosystem
    restoration, biodiversity conservation, and soil health improvement, thereby enhancing
    environmental value and resilience. Social benefits encompass improvements in
    food security [1], reduced dependency on hazardous inputs, and the creation of
    employment opportunities in rural areas [32]. Initiatives fostering inclusivity
    and community engagement contribute to the formation of social capital and overall
    societal well-being. 3.2.6. Circular Economy Important resources for food production
    are wasted, with only 40% of irrigation water reaching the plants, and merely
    5% of the applied fertilizer being transformed into nutrients absorbed by humans.
    Soil degradation affects between 30 and 85% of agricultural land, exacerbating
    food insecurity issues [39]. Following the linear production model for food production
    is no longer sustainable, especially in a scenario where necessary resources are
    increasingly scarce [128]. Therefore, to minimize the utilization of finite natural
    resources, it is imperative to adopt the principles of Circular Economy, which
    include preserving and enhancing natural capital by managing finite stocks and
    balancing renewable resource flows, optimizing resource yields through the circulation
    of products, components, and materials in technical and biological cycles, and
    fostering system effectiveness by addressing and mitigating negative externalities
    [39]. Figure 7 illustrates systems of the Circular Economy in a diagram, showcasing
    the management flow of renewable energy and finite materials, while highlighting
    the fundamental principles of circularity. Figure 7. Diagram of Circular Economy
    systems [129]. In the systematic literature review on Agriculture 4.0 and the
    associated technologies, only two articles were identified that mentioned the
    Circular Economy, along with a study outlining the barriers to its adoption [84],
    highlighting the lack of incentive and governmental support. Main challenges identified
    include pesticide usage and unproductive laborers [83]. Although the Circular
    Economy was not explicitly referenced, several articles demonstrated evidence
    of its application. Therefore, based on the ReSOLVE framework, evidence of Circular
    Economy implementation in Agriculture 4.0 was identified. This includes models
    for Regenerate (soil regeneration, nutrient recovery, utilization of renewable
    energy, and finite resource reuse), Share (equipment and technology sharing, as
    well as waste sharing), Optimize (automation, pesticide and water usage optimization,
    and energy consumption optimization), Loop (remanufacturing, reverse logistics,
    and recycling), Virtualize (information virtualization and remote service utilization),
    and Exchange (integration of new technologies such as IoT, cloud, Big Data, and
    robotics). The ReSOLVE framework operationalizes these principles through six
    key actions: Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange, as shown
    in Figure 8. Figure 8. Framework ReSOLVE—adapted from [130]. These actions involved
    analyzing the articles to ascertain the evidence of Circular Economy usage, which
    was then compiled and is presented in Table 4. Table 4. Variables to evaluate
    evidence of practices of use of Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. 4. Conclusions
    This paper presents a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies
    applied in agriculture, analyzing 114 selected articles to fulfill the research
    objective of proposing an integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. A systematic literature review is chosen over traditional
    analysis due to its comprehensive and rigorous synthesis of existing research,
    which provides a nuanced understanding of the topic and helps identify gaps in
    the literature. This approach ensures that the work is grounded in thorough knowledge
    of existing research, enhancing the credibility and validity of the findings and
    advancing knowledge in the field. Research indicates that farms are increasingly
    leveraging IoT for sensor connectivity as a foundational step towards embracing
    a data-centric approach. This transition is underscored by a shift towards a culture
    of data-driven decision making, facilitated by the integration of advanced analytics
    and AI within cloud-based Big Data ecosystems. This research adds to our understanding
    of how Industry 4.0 technologies are currently applied in agriculture, identifying
    both the technologies used and their application areas. Studies have shown that
    farms are utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies for irrigation control [6,30,109,110,114,120];
    fertilizer and inputs [95,110,114]; planting and harvest management [26,28,111,116];
    agricultural greenhouse systems [113]; and area-based planting organization [7,25,109,121,122].
    A few studies were found on evaluating economic, environmental, and social gains
    generated by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies on farms and the connection between
    Industry 4.0 technologies adopted on farms and the Circular Economy. Therefore,
    the authors proposed an Integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0, composed of three layers: Farm Scenery, Cloud Storage,
    and the Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer. The Farm Scenery layer
    is responsible for executing precision agriculture, utilizing sensors to automatically
    collect data and interconnecting them through wireless networks in a system known
    as the Internet of Things. The Cloud Storage layer is responsible for gathering
    data from various points on the plantation and transmitting them to cloud servers,
    facilitated by gateways. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is tasked with analyzing the received data. It utilizes tools from the Big Data
    ecosystem to generate information, aiding in decision making, issuing automatic
    commands to activate irrigation control equipment and inputs, and presenting management
    reports on graphical screens accessible via computers or mobile devices. These
    reports encompass economic, environmental, and social gains. This paper enriches
    existing theory by introducing a novel Service Architecture designed to advance
    Circular Economy principles within Agriculture 4.0. The proposed framework aims
    to foster economic, environmental, and social benefits, thereby enhancing sustainability
    in agricultural practices. The practical contribution centers on developers’ ability
    to utilize the proposed architecture to construct monitoring systems with IoT,
    applications for decision-making analysis, and management tools, fostering a data-driven
    decision culture on farms. The societal contribution lies in the potential to
    alleviate food insecurity and reduce waste. As a limitation of this research,
    its initial application is solely on farms. However, there is potential for expansion
    into the broader agribusiness supply chain as future prospects emerge. Future
    research includes adapting this Integrated Service Architecture for use in other
    activities within the agricultural chain, incorporating specific input variables
    and output indicators on screens and autonomous systems as needed. Another possibility
    is integrating other actors in the agribusiness chain into the Integrated Service
    Architecture, thereby enhancing the management of the agricultural ecosystem.
    Additionally, it can broaden the practical applications or policies that stem
    from this study. Author Contributions Conceptualization, W.A.V., G.C.d.O.N. and

    Abstract Urbanization and climate change have put large segments of the population
    at risk of heavy rainfall, river, and coastal flooding. In order to keep up with
    sustainable development, cities need to protect flood-prone areas, which require
    significant investment in green infrastructure solutions. Determining which flood
    protection to fund typically involves an analysis of key costs and benefits. The
    importance of implementing green infrastructure for flood protection is widely
    accepted. This research combines a series of structures in order to decrease or
    eliminate flood effects on the surrounding area of Larissa city, Greece. At the
    same time, that combination of installation can partly solve the irrigation water
    shortage during summer months at a certain region of prefecture of Larissa. Thus,
    a powerful pumping station is proposed to be installed at the riverside of Pinios
    outside of Amygdalea village, capable of pump almost 5 million m3 per day. The
    pumped water is going to fill a large reservoir next to the pumping station, which
    is going to be connected to a long network of irrigation canals. As a result,
    floods could be avoided and the excess water could irrigate thousands of acres

  description: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral and thermal images, combined
    with machine learning models, have been widely used for high-throughput phenotyping
    of crop traits and have great potential for evaluating the drought tolerance of
    winter wheat cultivars. In order to extract the wheat canopy information from
    UAV images, noise removal is an essential step. Currently, soil and shadow are
    two of the most common noises in UAV images influencing the extraction of the
    canopy information, which have been widely studied in previous studies. However,
    the noise caused by the abnormal canopy temperature in the thermal images has
    yet to be addressed. Besides, the machine learning-based methods are data-intensive
    and cannot meet the requirements for rapid evaluation of the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars. In order to rapidly evaluate the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars, this study proposed a drought tolerance evaluation
    method for winter wheat cultivars based on multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation
    and automatic noise removal. The thermal affected zone (TAZ), in which the canopy
    temperature was abnormally elevated due to thermal radiation from adjacent bare
    soil, was proposed in this study, and an effective noise removal method was proposed
    by comparing the accuracy of six automatic image segmentation methods. Canopy
    vegetation, texture, and temperature indices were extracted from the UAV multispectral
    and thermal images and selected based on their correlation with the measured yield
    stability index (YSI). Based on the multiple canopy indices, two multi-criteria
    comprehensive evaluation methods, i.e., weighted sum based on principal components
    analysis (PCA-WS) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution
    based on entropy weight (Entropy-TOPSIS), were used to evaluate the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars. The results showed that the automatic image segmentation
    methods could effectively remove the noises of soil, shadow, and TAZ. Removing
    the TAZ resulted in a significant decrease in canopy temperature for each irrigation
    treatment. The total score (TS) and comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) showed
    a significant linear relationship with the measured YSI, with a maximum R2 of
    0.637 and 0.636, respectively. The top five cultivars ranked by the TS and CEI
    had a consistency ratio of 60–80% with those selected by the measured YSI. This
    study indicates that the automatic noise removal and multi-criteria comprehensive
    evaluation have great potential in rapid evaluation of drought tolerance of winter
    wheat cultivars for large breeding trials.

    also known as the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, is the primary winter wheat production
    region in China and suffers from severe water shortage due to its heavy agricultural
    water requirements for winter wheat irrigation. The annual precipitation in this
    area is relatively low, with an uneven spatiotemporal distribution. Only 60–150
    mm of precipitation occurs during the winter wheat growing season, while the consumptive
    water used by winter wheat is about 430 to 470 mm, resulting in a three to four
    irrigation to achieve an expected grain yield (Fang et al., 2018). Given the limited
    surface water resources, groundwater has been overused, which caused the regional
    groundwater table to drop significantly. In order to minimize groundwater water
    use, deficit irrigation was implemented by reducing the volume of used water or
    decreasing the irrigation frequency (Fang et al., 2018). Breeding drought-tolerant
    winter wheat cultivars is of great practical significance in balancing yield and
    water-use efficiency in the North China Plain. Establishing a selection criterion
    based on drought-related traits is crucial for breeding drought-tolerant winter
    wheat cultivars and is still under development. Grain yield, as the primary trait,
    is one of the most important tools for identifying desirable cultivars under water-deficit
    conditions, based on which some tolerance or susceptibility indicators have been
    developed and showed high reliability in the classification of drought-tolerant
    cultivars. Among these indicators, the yield stability index (YSI) is used to
    select drought-tolerant cultivars with a stable and comparatively high yield under
    drought stress conditions (Nergui et al., 2022). However, the YSI involves a time
    lag since yields can only be measured upon the maturity of winter wheat. Furthermore,
    measuring grain yield is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially when a
    large number of winter wheat cultivars are involved in a drought tolerance breeding
    trial. Therefore, a non-destructive, rapid, and cost-effective tool is urgently
    needed. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is one of the most promising
    methods for rapid and non-destructive measurement in field conditions. UAV is
    equipped with various imaging sensors, such as multispectral and thermal infrared
    cameras. The reflectance from the multispectral camera is a result of the biochemical,
    physiological, and structural properties of the canopy, and can provide specific
    wavelengths for constructing vegetation indices (VIs) that can be used to evaluate
    crop drought tolerance (Das et al., 2022, Li et al., 2022). The thermal infrared
    camera, which is used to measure canopy temperature, can help to determine crop
    water status since the stomatal closure induced by water deficits reduces the
    transpiration rate and results in a reduction of evaporative cooling and an increase
    in leaf temperature (Kögler and Söffker, 2019). Recently, water stress indices
    based on canopy temperature have been adopted to assess water deficit in crops
    such as wheat (Das et al., 2021). Combining multiple canopy features has proven
    beneficial to crop yield prediction (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2023).
    Since both the multispectral image and the thermal image have been used to assess
    crop drought tolerance, there is a good chance that combining the multispectral
    and thermal images will provide a more informative phenotype than either, thus
    increasing the robustness of crop yield predictions. Therefore, more studies on
    drought-tolerant winter wheat cultivars selection based on UAV multispectral and
    thermal images-extracted image features under water-deficit conditions are in
    great demand. Before extracting image features, the noises, such as soil and shadows,
    which influence canopy information, should be removed from the UAV images. Notably,
    extra attention should be paid to the noise of abnormal temperature rise caused
    by the thermal radiation of bare soil, which may create a thermal affected zone
    (TAZ) around the bare soil. As a result, the canopy temperature in that zone is
    significantly elevated. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has yet to be
    addressed. Roughly, the methods for removing noises can be classified into three
    categories, i.e., fixed threshold-based, dynamic threshold-based, and machine
    learning-based. Generally, the fixed threshold is determined by manually comparing
    differences between crops and backgrounds (Li et al., 2022). As a result, a new
    threshold has to be calculated when the site, time, or irrigation regime is altered.
    In contrast, the dynamic threshold can be determined by using automatic image
    segmentation methods, such as maximum inter-class variance (OTSU), iterative threshold
    selection (ISODATA), maximum entropy (MAXENTROPY), histogram-based thresholding
    (MEAN), minimum error thresholding (MINERROR) and moment-preserving thresholding
    (MOMENTS) (Lu and Lu, 2017, Lu et al., 2022). The automatic image segmentation
    methods are simple and effective, requiring no additional training data. Of all
    these methods, OTSU is most widely used to identify vegetated pixels based on
    images with various VIs such as NDVI (Sun et al., 2021), enhanced normalized difference
    vegetation index (ENDVI) (Das et al., 2021), and excess green minus excess red
    index (ExGR) (Chen and Wang, 2022). However, systematic exploration of the optimal
    combination of automatic image segmentation methods and VIs is yet to be conducted
    to improve the accuracy of rapid noise removal. Machine learning-based methods
    learn the common attributes of objects (crops and backgrounds) in an image and
    classify pixels with the same features into the same category. A representative
    machine learning method for removing noises is support vector machine (SVM) (Maimaitijiang
    et al., 2020). Although machine learning-based methods may yield high accuracy,
    these methods are data-intensive, which is not conducive to efficient noise removal.
    After the image feature extraction, critical features should be selected. The
    feature selection algorithm can eliminate redundant and irrelevant features that
    have a low impact on the evaluation target, thus reducing the dimensionality of
    the dataset. The Relief-F is one of the most widely used feature selection methods,
    which assigns scores to multiple features based on identifying feature value differences
    between nearest-neighbor instance pairs (Afshar and Usefi, 2022). Based on the
    selected features, the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars can be evaluated
    by determining an evaluation target, such as yield or YSI. Many machine learning
    methods, such as random forest (RF), SVM, and deep neural networks, have been
    implemented to predict crop yield (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Wan et al., 2020,
    Ma et al., 2023). However, when the prediction model is generalized to different
    deficit irrigation applications, new yield samples are necessary to calibrate
    the model, resulting in a time lag that does not always meet the requirements
    for rapid evaluation. Instead, multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation methods,
    such as weighted sum based on principal components analysis (PCA-WS) and technique
    for order preference by similarity to ideal solution based on entropy weight (Entropy-TOPSIS),
    have the advantage of merging multiple image features into a comprehensive indicator
    (Aghaie et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2023). In other words, these methods can theoretically
    evaluate the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars without measuring the
    grain yield. Therefore, in-depth investigations are needed on using the multi-criteria
    comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate the drought tolerance of winter wheat
    cultivars. In this study, a drought tolerance evaluation method for winter wheat
    cultivars under water-deficit conditions was proposed using multi-criteria comprehensive
    evaluation and UAV multispectral and thermal images. To improve the accuracy of
    canopy information extraction, this study proposed an automatic image segmentation-based
    noise removal method to eliminate the noise pixels of soil, shadows, and TAZ from
    UAV images. Wheat canopy spectral, texture, and thermal features was extracted,
    which was then used to construct multiple indices to evaluate the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars using PCA-WS, Entropy-TOPSIS, and RF. To the best of
    our knowledge, this study was the first to propose the TAZ and the corresponding
    noise removal method. The specific objectives of this study were (1) to explore
    the optimal combination of automatic image segmentation method and canopy features
    for efficiently removing the noises of soil, shadows, and TAZ, (2) to test the
    accuracy of PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS in evaluating the drought tolerance of winter
    wheat cultivars under water-deficit conditions, and (3) to investigate the yield
    stability of winter wheat cultivars based on PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS. 2. Materials
    2.1. Experimental setup An experiment was conducted at the field station (37°54′16″
    N, 115°42′29″ E) of Dryland Farming Institute, Hebei Academy of Agricultural and
    Forestry Sciences, Hengshui, China (Fig. 1a). The station is located in the winter
    wheat-producing area of the North China Plain and experiences a temperate continental
    monsoon climate. The annual average precipitation is 497.1 mm, 70 % of which happens
    in July and August (Ma et al., 2023). A weather station near the field station
    continuously records the weather data of the 2020–2021 growing season (Fig. 2).
    The cumulative precipitation was 58.1 mm, and only 10.8 mm happened after jointing.
    No frost events occurred after jointing since the daily minimum temperature was
    above 4 °C. From flowering to milk development, the daily maximum temperature
    remained below 30 °C, and there were two rainfall processes with a small amount
    of precipitation and high relative air humidity. Therefore, no high-temperature
    events occurred. Download : Download high-res image (852KB) Download : Download

    (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the web version of this article.) The experimental field was divided
    into 231 plots assigned to seven treatments with three replications for each treatment
    (Fig. 1b). The size of each plot was 1.5 × 6 m. All plots were in the same moist
    soil condition for sowing. 11 winter wheat cultivars were used in each replication
    (Fig. 1c). Supplementary irrigation was conducted for seven treatments, including
    one well-watered treatment (WW, irrigation twice), one rainfed treatment (NW,
    no irrigation), and five deficit water treatments (DW, irrigation once). For the
    WW treatment, the plots were irrigated during jointing and flowering. For the
    DW treatments, irrigation was performed during overwintering (DW1), greenup (DW2),
    jointing (DW3), one week after jointing (DW4), and two weeks after jointing (DW5),
    respectively. For each irrigation, the amount of water was 750 m3/ha. A total
    of 450 kg ha−1 (N: 225, P2O5: 112.5, K2O: 112.5) fertilizer was plowed into the
    topsoil as the base fertilizer before sowing. The sowing date was on October 15,
    2020, and the harvest date was in early June 2021, depending on the developmental
    process of winter wheat cultivars. Diseases, pests, and weeds were managed according
    to local management practices. 2.2. Data acquisition Multispectral images were
    captured using a Phantom 4-Multispectral UAV (P4M, DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen,
    China) with a real-time kinematic (RTK) module (Fig. 1d). The multispectral camera
    has five bands covering the visible, red-edge, and near-infrared regions, with
    the central wavelengths located at 450 nm, 560 nm, 650 nm, 730 nm, and 840 nm.
    The bandwidth of the visible and red-edge bands is 32 nm, and the bandwidth of
    the near-infrared band is 52 nm. Thermal and RGB images were simultaneously acquired
    using a DJI Matrice 200 quadcopter UAV (M200, DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen,
    China) equipped with a radiometric Zenmuse XT2 dual camera of thermal and RGB
    sensor (Fig. 1d). The thermal imager is an Uncooled VOx Microbolometer with a
    19 mm focal length and measures the thermal emissions between the 7.5 and 13.5
    µm spectra in a 9 Hz frame rate. The spatial resolution of the radiometric R-JPEG
    images was 640 × 512 pixels. Each thermal pixel records temperature value in Celsius
    degrees. The RGB sensor provided RGB imagery through a 1/1.7″ CMOS with sizes
    of 12 MP. The UAV flights were conducted on April 28, May 12, and 21, 2021, when
    winter wheat was at the heading, flowering, and grain-filling stages, respectively.
    Each flight was conducted on a clear day with low cloud cover between 10:30 and
    13:00 local time, and automatic exposure was employed during the flight. The altitude
    of the flight was 50 m, resulting in the ground spatial resolution of 2.6 cm for
    the multispectral images, 4.6 cm for the thermal images, and 1.2 cm for the RGB
    images. All images were acquired with a forward overlap of 80 % and a lateral
    overlap of 70 %. During the flight, a gray target with a nominal reflectance value
    of 50 % was placed in the experimental field. The multispectral images of the
    gray target collected simultaneously at the same height were used to perform the
    radiometric correction. In order to geo-reference the UAV images and achieve the
    alignment of the multi-temporal images, this study established ten ground control
    points (GCPs) in the field (Fig. 1b) and recorded the geographic coordinates by
    a handheld GPS. After all the plants reached full maturity, the winter wheat in
    the range of 6 rows and 3 m, covering an area of 3.24 m2, were harvested as samples
    for each plot. The collected grains were kept in netting bags and air-dried to
    a 13 % moisture level before being weighed. Then, the grain yield for each plot
    was calculated as kilograms per plot. Digitization footprint involved all field
    operations, where recorded data were available from different sensors throughout
    the study period. The volumes of average growing-season accumulated data for UAV
    multispectral, RGB, and thermal images were 3979.5 MB/ha, 2239.3 MB/ha, and 704.3
    MB/ha, respectively, followed by 8.3 MB/ha for the meteorological elements and
    3.4 MB/ha for the yield data. 2.3. Data processing 2.3.1. UAV image preprocessing
    The multispectral, thermal, and RGB images from each acquisition date were processed
    using Pix4D mapper software (Pix4D SA, Lausanne, Switzerland), with some essential
    steps such as aligning the camera, importing GCPs and geo-referencing, building
    dense point clouds, generating digital surface models and orthomosaic maps. This
    study used the gray target reflectance images for radiometric calibration of multispectral
    images. The GCPs were used for geometric correction. At last, the orthomosaic
    maps of the multispectral, thermal, and RGB images were generated, respectively.
    2.3.2. Noise removal Since weeds were removed during the experiment, the noises
    in this study mainly consisted of soil, shadows, and the TAZ. This study used
    automatic image segmentation methods based on VI and thermal images to eliminate
    the noise pixels. The workflow for the noise removal method was shown in Fig.

    the noise removal method. The key to removing the soil and shadow pixels from
    the multispectral images was to identify the best combination of the automatic
    image segmentation method and VI. As an example, a sub-image with a pixel resolution
    of 450 × 500 containing wheat, soil, and shadows was cut from the multispectral
    image (Fig. 5a). Three VIs, i.e., NDVI, soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI),
    and normalized difference canopy shadow index (NDCSI), were adopted considering
    the ability to distinguish crops from soil and shadow (Sun et al., 2021, Wang
    et al., 2022, Xu et al., 2019). The calculations for the above VIs were shown
    in (1)-(3). The six image segmentation methods (OTSU, ISODATA, MAXENTROPY, MEAN,
    MINERROR, and MOMENTS) were used to automatically segment the NDVI, SAVI, and
    NDCSI sub-images, respectively. Each method generated a binary sub-image from
    which the winter wheat canopy could be easily identified. In order to evaluate
    the performance of the automatic image segmentation methods, this study used the
    SVM model to segment the multispectral sub-image and adopted the result as the
    segmentation ground truth (Details could be found in Appendix 1). Consequently,
    the confusion matrix could be generated, based on which the F1-score was calculated
    according to (4). The optimal combination of the automatic image segmentation
    method and VI was determined with the maximum F1-score. (1) (2) (3) (4) Where

    between the categories which were extracted respectively from the binary NDVI,

    wheat canopy obtained from multispectral images could be used to mask the soil
    and shadows in thermal images. However, this would lead to significant errors
    in practice as the multispectral and thermal images were not acquired simultaneously.
    The location, shape, and size of the shadow differed due to changes in the solar
    zenith angle and azimuth. Since the RGB and thermal images were acquired at the
    same time, the RGB image registered with the thermal image was used to automatically
    segment the winter wheat canopy from the soil and shadows in the thermal image.
    A sub-image with 450 × 500 pixel resolution containing wheat, soil, and shadows
    was cut from the RGB image (Fig. 6a). Three color VIs, i.e., excess green index
    (ExG), ExGR, and green–red vegetation index (GRVI), were adopted and calculated
    according to (5) - (10) (Chen and Wang, 2022, Tucker, 1979). (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)

    categories which were extracted from a binary temperature sub-image segmented
    by ISODATA, MAXENTROPY, MEAN, MINERROR, MOMENTS, and OTSU, respectively. The six
    image segmentation methods were used to automatically segment the ExG, ExGR, and
    GRVI sub-images, respectively. The generated binary sub-images were compared with
    the SVM classification result (Appendix 1). Subsequently, the confusion matrix
    was used to calculate the F1-score to evaluate the performance of the six image
    segmentation methods. The optimal combination of the automatic image segmentation
    method and VI was determined with the maximum F1-score. The soil and shadows could
    be masked from the thermal sub-image by overlaying the binary sub-image generated
    by the optimal combination. (3) TAZ removal for thermal images. TAZ was first
    proposed in this study as the noise caused by thermal radiation of the bare soil.
    The higher the soil surface temperature, the stronger the thermal radiation, thus
    causing the expansion of TAZ. If the TAZ extended beyond the bare soil and covered
    the adjacent winter wheat canopy, the temperature of the canopy within the TAZ
    would increase abnormally. Therefore, TAZ should be excluded by determining its
    boundaries. Theoretically, the canopy temperature would gradually decrease with
    an increasing distance to the bare soil till a constant level was reached. Consequently,
    the position where the canopy temperature stabilized was considered the boundaries
    of the TAZ. According to the histograms of the thermal images (Appendix 2), a
    consistent unimodal pattern could be observed from all three thermal images. Therefore,
    the determination of the TAZ boundaries could be achieved by histogram-based threshold
    segmentation. The thermal image was automatically segmented into TAZ and non-TAZ
    using the image segmentation methods. If there was no significant change in the
    canopy temperature of winter wheat in the non-TAZ under the same treatment, the
    segmentation results were considered reasonable. Specifically, the TAZ could be
    recognized by the following steps (Fig. 4). 1) Extract a sub-image from the thermal
    image and segment the into a binary sub-image of TAZ and non-TAZ, respectively,
    using the six image segmentation methods. 2) Repeat the above step for the RGB
    image , which was simultaneously collected with , and obtain a binary sub-image
    of winter wheat and background. Notably, the optimal combination of the automatic
    image segmentation method and RGB-based VI for the segmentation of was determined
    in the Soil and shadows removal for thermal images. Mask the soil and shadows
    of by the overlay of , obtaining a canopy thermal sub-image . Mask the TAZ of
    by the overlay of , obtaining a canopy thermal sub-image of non-TAZ. 3) Explore
    if the influence of TAZ on had been minimized by the equal-width buffer (EWB)
    method. The EWB method created four buffer zones outside the TAZ, each with a
    width of 10 cm. The buffer zones were actually inside the non-TAZ. Extract the
    canopy temperature values in all buffer zones by the overlay of and compare the
    mean canopy temperature between them by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). If the
    temperature differences were insignificant, the image segmentation method for
    identifying TAZ would be appropriate. The optimal method could be determined once
    it produced a minimal temperature difference. In practice, the average temperature
    of the buffer zone closest to the TAZ was consistently higher than that of the
    other buffer zones, and there was no significant temperature difference between
    the other buffer zones since the histogram was unimodal. As long as the temperature
    difference between the buffer zones did not exceed the difference between the
    1st and 99th percentile of the canopy temperature in the non-TAZ excluding buffer
    zones, the image segmentation method was still considered appropriate. Statistically,
    the maximum difference in non-TAZ canopy temperature was approximately 2.2℃ on
    April 28, 2.4℃ on May 12, and 2.3℃ on May 21, respectively. The optimal segmentation
    methods for multispectral and thermal sub-images were further applied to the entire
    images of the experimental field to distinguish winter wheat canopy from soil,
    shadows, and TAZ. Considering the large variations in canopy reflectance and temperature
    among the seven treatments, automatic image segmentation was first conducted for
    each treatment separately. Next, seven binary images generated by the optimal
    segmentation method and multispectral VI were stitched and overlaid with the multispectral
    image, resulting in the extraction of the winter wheat canopy. Seven binary images
    generated by the optimal segmentation method and RGB VI, as well as by the optimal
    segmentation method and temperature, were stitched respectively and overlaid with
    the thermal image, from which winter wheat canopy was extracted. To determine
    if the removal of the TAZ caused a significant decrease in canopy temperature
    for each treatment, a pairwise Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test was performed to compare
    the canopy temperature images with and without the TAZ removed. The significance
    was set to p < 0.05. 3. Methods 3.1. Drought stress tolerance index To represent
    the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars, this study adopted the YSI (Nergui
    et al., 2022), which was calculated using the Formula (11): (11) Where is the
    yield of the cultivar under water stress. is the mean yield of the cultivar of
    the WW treatment. A big value of the YSI is considered as high drought tolerance,
    whereas a low value shows drought susceptibility. 3.2. Canopy feature extraction
    and selection Canopy features in this study included canopy spectral, texture,
    and thermal features. Prior to the canopy spectral feature extraction, canopy
    reflectance was first standardized to reduce the effects of varying illumination
    caused by scattered clouds (Zhang et al., 2012). A total of 18 VIs, which have
    demonstrated good performance in UAV-based crop yield prediction, were extracted
    (Table 1). Table 1. Vegetation indices (VIs) used in this study. Vegetation index

    MSR Modified simple ratio Chen (1996) Texture analysis was used to determine the
    pixel relationship by measuring the frequency of gray-tone changes or color-space
    correlation. As a valuable supplement to spectral and thermal features, texture
    features have improved the accuracy of crop yield prediction (Maimaitijiang et
    al., 2020, Ma et al., 2023). The most widely used texture analysis method is based
    on a gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), which has been used to extract the
    eight texture features, including mean (MEA), variance (VAR), homogeneity (HOM),
    contrast (CON), dissimilarity (DIS), entropy (ENT), second moment (SEM), and correlation
    (COR). The texture features were extracted based on UAV multispectral-based Blue,
    Green, Red, Red-edge, and NIR bands. Since these texture features are single-band
    parameters, they can be used to develop texture indices through a two-band combination
    algorithm (Wang et al., 2021). In this study, texture indices were calculated
    using a combination of simple difference (SD), simple ratio (SR), and normalized
    difference (ND), respectively, and the detailed calculations were as follows.
    A total of 24 texture indices were generated based on the eight texture features.
    (12) (13) (14) Where , and represent difference textural index, ratio textural
    index and normalized difference textural index, respectively, for the m-th texture
    metric. and are the values of the m-th texture metric in the i-th and j-th bands,
    respectively. Notably, a texture feature would be selected if the corresponding
    texture indices achieved the highest positive correlation with the measured YSI.
    Normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT) (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Li
    et al., 2022) and crop stress index (CSI) (Das et al., 2021) are two temperature
    indices used to assess drought stress levels. A higher NRCT or CSI value indicates
    crops under more water stress, resulting in a lower YSI value. Therefore, the
    formulas of NRCT and CSI were transformed to keep aligned with YSI. The transformed
    NRCT (TNRCT) and transformed CSI (TCSI) were calculated using UAV thermal imagery
    by the following formulas. (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) Where is the canopy temperature,
    and represent the maximum and minimum values of the canopy temperature in the
    whole test site, respectively. is the vapor pressure deficit, is the saturated
    vapor pressure of canopy (kPa), and is the vapor pressure in the air (kPa). and
    are the corresponding ambient air temperature (℃) and relative humidity (%), respectively.
    Once the canopy feature extraction was finished, this study used the Relief-F
    algorithm (Afshar and Usefi, 2022) to eliminate redundant and irrelevant features.
    Since the features selected for April 28, May 12, and May 21 were expected to
    be different, only the features simultaneously selected for all three dates would
    be finally selected for evaluating the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars.
    Details could be found in Appendix 3. 3.3. Methods for evaluating drought tolerance
    The PCA-WS, Entropy-TOPSIS, and RF methods were used to evaluate the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars under both rainfed and water-deficit irrigation treatments.
    According to the PCA-WS method, PCA analysis was performed at first, and the score
    and contribution of each key principal component (PC) were determined once the
    eigenvalue of the coefficient matrix of the evaluation indicators was greater
    than 1. Then, the total score (TS) for each cultivar was calculated using the
    following formula. (20) Where is the contribution of the variance explained by
    the n-th PC to the total variance. is the score of the n-th PC. For detailed calculations,
    readers were referred to Aghaie et al. (2018). In the Entropy-TOPSIS method, firstly,
    the entropy weight method was used to determine the weights of the indicators
    for each treatment. Subsequently, the TOPSIS was incorporated with the entropy
    weights to calculate the comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) of each cultivar.
    The formula is as follows. (21) Where and are the distance between the ith evaluated
    solution and the positive and negative ideal solutions. Details about the Entropy-TOPSIS
    can be found in Wang et al. (2023). RF was used as a representative of machine
    learning methods due to its ability to prevent overfitting and its applicability
    in prediction with small sample sizes and a large number of variables (Wan et
    al., 2020). The RF model is based on three user-defined parameters: the number
    of trees, the number of variables as a predictor at each tree, and the minimum
    size in each terminal node. Before applying the above three evaluation methods,
    those selected indices were first normalized using the range standardization method,
    which were then fed into the PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS models to calculate the
    TS and CEI, as well as into the RF model to predict YSI. Furthermore, the samples
    were randomly divided into the training dataset and the test dataset in a ratio
    of 8:2 before running the RF model. The performance of the model was evaluated
    by the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean
    absolute error (MAE). The calculations of RMSE and MAE are shown as follows. (22)
    (23) where and are the measured and predicted values of YSI for sample , respectively;
    is the number of samples. Higher R2 value indicates better model performance and
    data fitting. Lower values of RMSE and MAE suggest better prediction accuracy.
    3.4. Ranking of winter wheat cultivars based on TS, CEI, and predicted YSI Winter
    wheat cultivars were ranked in descending order according to the measured YSI,
    TS, CEI, and predicted YSI, respectively, thus obtaining the top five cultivars
    for each ranking result. The cultivars selected by the TS, CEI, and predicted
    YSI were compared to those selected by the measured YSI, and the consistency ratio
    of the measured YSI with the TS, CEI, and predicted YSI was calculated. The consistency
    ratio represented the overall accuracy of the cultivars selected by the TS, CEI,
    and predicted YSI. 4. Results 4.1. The optimal method for removing soil and shadows
    from UAV multispectral images The sub-images of NDVI, SAVI, and NDCSI were calculated
    from the multispectral images on April 28, May 12, and 21, 2021, respectively.
    Next, these sub-images were automatically segmented using the six image segmentation
    methods. The segmentation accuracy (F1-score in %) verified by SVM-based classification
    results was shown in Table 2. On May 12 and 21, the OTSU method based on the NDCSI
    achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, with an F1-score of 96.6 % and 96.1
    %, respectively. Some examples of the OTSU method on May 12 were shown in Fig.
    5e-5 g. All three indices performed well in distinguishing the winter wheat canopy
    from the soil. However, their performance significantly varied in identifying
    shadows. The shadows identified by NDCSI were closest to those from the SVM classification
    results (Fig. 5d and 5 g), followed by SAVI and NDVI. Almost no canopy shadows
    were detected by NDVI, indicating its inability to remove canopy shadows. On April
    28, the OTSU and the MOMENTS methods based on the SAVI had the highest segmentation
    accuracy with an F1-score of 97 %. According to the mean accuracy of the three
    dates, the NDCSI-based OTSU method was the best among all image segmentation methods,
    achieving an F1-score of 96.5 %. Consequently, OTSU and NDCSI were considered
    the optimal combination for removing soil and shadows from UAV multispectral images.

    calculated from the RGB images registered with the thermal images on April 28,
    May 12, and 21, 2021, respectively, and were then automatically segmented using
    the six image segmentation methods. The accuracy (F1-score in %) verified by the
    SVM-based classification results was shown in Table 3. On April 28, the ExG-based
    MINERROR produced the highest segmentation accuracy, with an F1-score of 95.5
    %. On May 12, MINERROR still had the highest segmentation accuracy based on the
    ExGR and GRVI, achieving an F1-score of 95.9 %. On May 21, the segmentation accuracy
    of the ExGR-based OTSU method was the highest, with an F1-score of 94.9 %. According
    to the mean accuracy of the three dates, the ExGR-based MINERROR method performed
    best among all image segmentation methods, reaching an F1-score of 95 %. Therefore,
    MINERROR and RGB-based ExGR were considered the optimal combination for removing
    soil and shadows from UAV thermal images. An example of the ExGR sub-image segmented
    by the MINERROR method on May 12 was shown in Fig. 6a. Table 3. Segmentation accuracy

    optimal method for removing TAZ from UAV thermal images Based on the six image
    segmentation methods, the thermal sub-images on April 28, May 12, and 21, 2021,
    were automatically segmented into the TAZ and non-TAZ. The mask segmented by MINERROR
    was used to extract the winter wheat canopy from the thermal sub-images. The average
    canopy temperature of the TAZ and the buffer zones was calculated, as shown in
    Fig. 7. The results indicated that the temperature of the TAZ was significantly
    (P < 0.05) higher than that of the buffer zones at different distances. The temperature
    of the 0–10 cm buffer zone was significantly higher than that of the other three
    buffer zones. For the ISODATA, MEAN, and MINERROR methods, the temperature difference
    among the other three buffer zones was not significant (P > 0.05) on April 28
    and May 12 (Fig. 7a and 7b). The maximum temperature differences among all buffer
    zones were 0.66 °C, 0.62 °C, and 0.62 °C on April 28, 0.9 °C, 0.83 °C, and 0.9
    °C on May 12, and 0.84 °C, 0.82 °C, and 1.2 °C on May 21, respectively, which
    were within the temperature range in the non-TAZ excluding buffer zones. Regarding
    the MAXENTROPY, MOMENTS, and OTSU methods, the temperature difference among the
    buffer zones showed a significant difference. The maximum temperature differences
    were 1.78 °C, 4.37 °C, and 4.47 °C on April 28, 3 °C, 5.32 °C, and 4.89 °C on
    May 12, and 1.7 °C, 2.77 °C, and 2.65 °C on May 21, respectively. The MEAN method
    produced the smallest difference among the buffer zones, with a temperature range
    of 0.62 to 0.83 °C. Therefore, the MEAN method was considered the optimal segmentation
    method for removing the TAZ from UAV thermal images. Examples of the six image
    segmentation methods on May 12 were displayed in Fig. 6b–6 g. The TAZ identified
    by the ISODATA, MEAN, and MINERROR methods were broader and contained more winter
    wheat canopy pixels than those identified by the MAXENTROPY, MOMENTS, and OTSU
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (272KB) Download : Download full-size

    this study compared the mean canopy temperature before (Fig. 8, gray boxes) and
    after (Fig. 8, pink boxes) the TAZ removal. The MWU test indicated that the TAZ
    removal caused a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in canopy temperature to both
    the well-watered and water-deficit treatments (Fig. 8). Besides, the lower standard
    deviation after removing the TAZ indicated a smaller difference between samples.

    4.4. Drought tolerance evaluation on winter wheat cultivars As expected, the number
    of selected features for April 28, May 12, and May 21 was 23, 33, and 34, respectively,
    while the number of features simultaneously selected for all three dates was seven,
    seven, and one (Appendix 3). The seven VIs were RVI, NDVI, GRVI, EVI2, WDRVI,
    IPVI, and MSR. The seven texture indices were DTI1, RTI1, NDTI1, RTI2, NDTI2,
    RTI4, and NDTI4. The thermal index was TCSI. These features were finally used
    to calculate TS and CEI, as well as to predict YSI. The linear fitting results
    between the TS and measured YSI showed a significant difference in TS-based drought
    tolerance evaluation accuracy across the treatments (Table 4). The highest accuracy
    was achieved by the DW5 treatment on May 12, with an R2 of 0.637, while the lowest
    accuracy was observed by the DW2 treatment on May 21, with an R2 of 0.109, indicating
    no significant linear relationship (P > 0.05). Except for the DW2 on May 21, TS
    maintained a significant linear correlation with the measured YSI. A significant
    (P < 0.001) relationship was established in DW5, NW, DW1 (on May 12 and 21), and
    DW3 (on April 28). Similar to the TS, the linear relationship between the CEI
    and measured YSI also showed significant differences among the treatments (Table
    4). The maximum R2 of 0.636 was achieved by DW5 on May 21, while the minimum R2
    was 0.139, which was observed by the DW2 on May 12. CEI was significantly correlated
    with the measured YSI over all the water deficit treatments. The greatest significance
    (P < 0.001) was by DW5, followed by NW, DW1 (on May 12 and 21), and DW3 (on May
    12 and 21). In general, the correlation between the CEI and the measured YSI was
    slightly stronger than that between the TS and measured YSI, except for the DW5
    (on April 28 and May 12) and DW2 (on April 28). Table 4. Coefficient of determination

    respectively. The RF model accurately predicted the YSI on April 28, May 12, and
    21, 2021 (Table 5). The highest accuracy for the training dataset occurred on
    May 21, with an R2 of 0.937, an RMSE of 0.039, and an MAE of 0.032, and the highest
    accuracy for the test dataset occurred on May 12, with an R2 of 0.674, an RMSE
    of 0.078, and an MAE of 0.06. Next, the predicted YSI was fitted to the measured
    YSI for each water stress treatment, achieving a significant linear relationship
    (Table 4, P < 0.001). The significance of the DW1 and DW5 treatments on May 12
    was the strongest of the three dates, with an R2 of 0.938 and 0.901, respectively.
    For NW, DW2, DW3, and DW4, the strongest significance was on May 21, with an R2
    of 0.849, 0.835, 0.908, and 0.876, respectively. The linear model between predicted
    YSI and measured YSI was more significant than that between the TS and measured

    of winter wheat cultivars based on the TS, CEI and predicted YSI Winter wheat
    cultivars were ranked in descending order according to the measured YSI, TS, CEI,
    and predicted YSI, respectively. The cultivars selected by the TS, CEI, and predicted
    YSI were compared with those selected by the measured YSI. Of the top five cultivars,
    the consistency ratio of the cultivars selected by the TS, CEI, and predicted
    YSI was calculated (Fig. 9). The consistency ratio was between 60 % and 100 %
    for the predicted YSI, while it was between 60 % and 80 % for the TS and CEI,
    respectively. The predicted YSI demonstrated a higher cultivar screening accuracy
    than the TS and CEI for all water-deficit treatments on May 21, 2021, as well
    as the DW1 treatment on April 28 and May 12 and the DW3 treatment on April 28.

    for UAV multispectral and thermal images It is well known that soil and shadow
    are the primary sources of noise in the application of UAV multispectral and thermal
    images in agricultural fields, which also influence the drought tolerance evaluation
    of winter wheat cultivars in this study (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). In addition, this study
    proposed the concept of TAZ for the first time and considered it another source
    of noise from the UAV thermal images. The abnormal increase in canopy temperature
    (Fig. 7) within the TAZ suggested that the noise should not be ignored. In Das
    et al. (2021), crop canopies were first segmented from the noise using the OTSU
    method based on VIs calculated from multispectral images and then registered to
    the thermal image to mask the noise in the thermal image. In this study, the multispectral
    and thermal images were not acquired simultaneously since the multispectral and
    thermal cameras were mounted on different UAVs. Therefore, the winter wheat canopy
    extracted from the RGB image rather than the multispectral image was used to mask
    the soil and shadows from the thermal image. Despite the image type, the high
    noise removal performance depends on the selected image segmentation methods and
    VIs and could improve the accuracy of feature extraction. This study systematically
    compared the accuracy of the six image segmentation methods based on NDVI, SAVI,
    and NDCSI from multispectral images, as well as ExG, ExGR, and GRVI from RGB images.
    For multispectral images, the NDCSI-based OTSU had the highest average accuracy,
    with an F1-score value of 96.9 % on April 28, 96.6 % on May 12, and 96.1 % on
    May 21, respectively (Table 2). Since NDCSI was specifically developed for shadow
    identification (Xu et al., 2019), it performed best in segmenting shadows (Fig.
    5g), followed by SAVI (Fig. 5f) and NDVI (Fig. 5e). For RGB images, the average
    accuracy of the ExGR-based MINERROR was the highest, with an F1 score of 95.1
    % on April 28, 95.9 % on May 12, and 94 % on May 21, respectively (Table 3). ExGR
    has been proven effective in extracting crops from soil background (Chen and Wang,
    2022) and performed better than ExG and GRVI (Meyer and Neto, 2008). Although
    the OTSU was the most widely used image segmentation method for removing soil
    background, it was not always the best for removing both soil and shadows. The
    selected VI significantly impacted accuracy, which also applied to other automatic
    image segmentation methods. To assess the impact of soil thermal radiation on
    winter wheat canopy temperature, this study used the six image segmentation methods
    to segment the thermal images (Fig. 6). The TAZs identified by the ISODATA, MEAN,
    and MINERROR methods (Fig. 6b, 6d, and 6e) were found to be larger than those
    identified by the MAXENTROPY, MOMENTS, and OTSU methods (Fig. 6c, 6f, and 6 g).
    Besides, the average canopy temperature among the buffer zones showed a significant
    difference (Fig. 7). The maximum temperature difference was 5.32℃, which was produced
    by the MOMENTS method, followed by 4.89℃ by the OTSU method, 3.0℃ by the MAXENTROPY
    method, 1.2℃ by the MINERROR method, 0.9℃ by the ISODATA method, and 0.83℃ by
    the MEAN method. The TAZ boundaries identified by the MINERROR, ISODATA, and MEAN
    methods were reasonable as they produced a maximum temperature difference that
    did not exceed the temperature range within the non-TAZ excluding buffer zones.
    Of the three segmentation methods, the MEAN method had the smallest temperature
    difference and was therefore recommended as the optimal method to remove TAZ.
    To determine the necessity of removing the TAZ, this study compared the canopy
    temperature before and after the removal of the TAZ and found that the TAZ removal
    caused a significant decrease in canopy temperature for all treatments (Fig. 8).
    This result indicated that the abnormal increase in canopy temperature in the
    TAZ was caused by soil thermal radiation rather than water deficit, thus probably
    resulting in a deviation from the actual canopy temperature under water-deficit
    conditions. Therefore, the TAZ should be excluded to improve the accuracy of feature
    extraction from the thermal images. The winter wheat canopy information extracted
    from the multispectral or RGB images was unable to mask this noise. The temperature-based
    MEAN method proved to be the best solution. 5.2. Rapid evaluation on drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars Previous studies used features extracted from UAV multispectral
    and thermal images to predict biomass or yield, based on which drought stress
    tolerance indices could be calculated and ranked the crop cultivars. For example,
    Das et al. (2022) developed a drought stress tolerance index (DSTI) and proved
    that it was closely related to the actual water use efficiency of wheat genotypes,
    with an R2 of 0.68, suggesting that DSTI-based rankings can help farmers select
    drought-tolerant wheat genotypes in a sodic soil environment. Based on the biomass
    predicted by UAV-derived canopy structure, reflectance, and thermal features,
    Li et al. (2022) calculated two drought tolerance indices, i.e., geometric mean
    productivity (biomass-GMP) and biomass-YSI, and assessed the drought tolerance
    of bioenergy sorghum under water-stressed conditions. By verification, both indices
    achieved significant linear correlations with the measured values, with an R2
    of 0.59 and 0.21, respectively. It should be noted that the performance of the
    drought tolerance indices depends on the accuracy of biomass or yield prediction
    models, which is similar to the YSI prediction using the RF model in this study.
    It is challenging to guarantee similar high accuracy in different fields without
    measured samples. However, using measured samples will result in a time lag in
    evaluating drought tolerance. Therefore, multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation
    methods, such as PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS, offer a potential solution. The R2
    values of the TS and CEI with the measured YSI were significantly lower than those
    with the predicted YSI (Table 4), indicating a lower accuracy of PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS
    than RF in evaluating the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars. However,
    PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS were still capable of evaluating the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars, as the linear models reached a significant (P < 0.05)
    level (except DW2 on May 21 for PCA-WS). Similar to the RF, PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS
    could quantify the degree of drought tolerance of each cultivar and achieve the
    ranking, which was undoubtedly necessary for comparing drought tolerance among
    cultivars. For instance, Aghaie et al. (2018) used the PCA-WS to obtain the contributions
    and scores of PC1 and PC2 from the growth and physiological parameters of fourteen
    tomato cultivars and calculate the “ranking value”, namely TS, of each cultivar
    under mild and severe drought stress conditions. The results indicated that the
    drought tolerance evaluated by the PCA-WS was highly consistent with the four
    drought tolerance categories defined by hierarchical clustering analysis. The
    Entropy-TOPSIS method has not been applied for drought tolerance evaluation. However,
    it has been widely used to identify the optimal irrigation mode for balancing
    yield, quality, and water use efficiency (Wang et al., 2023), which belongs to
    the category of multi-target comprehensive evaluation rather than the multi-criteria
    comprehensive evaluation in this study. When yield-based drought tolerance indicators
    such as YSI are used as an evaluation target, no parameters for PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS
    methods need to be determined. Therefore, the drought tolerance evaluation of
    winter wheat cultivars based on UAV images can be performed at any time and in
    any field during the winter wheat growth period. In this study, the R2 of the
    linear model between the CEI and the measured YSI was slightly higher than that
    between the TS and measured YSI under most water deficit treatments (Table 4).
    However, the consistency ratio of the top five winter wheat cultivars ranked by
    the TS and CEI remained consistent (Fig. 9). The results revealed that Entropy-TOPSIS
    did not exhibit a higher accuracy than PCA-WS in selecting stable-yield cultivars.
    In the future, more studies will be conducted to verify their accuracy. The fusion
    of canopy spectral, texture, thermal, and structural features from UAV images
    is cutting-edge research for crop yield prediction under different irrigations
    in recent years (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2023). Canopy structure
    features mainly include canopy coverage and plant height (Wan et al., 2020, Li
    et al., 2022). This study calculated the canopy coverage and found that the correlation
    coefficients with the measured YSI were 0.133, 0.221, and 0.334 on April 28, May
    12, and 21, respectively, which were much lower than those of the other features
    (Fig. A2, Fig. A3, and Table A1 in the Appendix 3). The plant height is usually
    calculated by subtracting the digital terrain model from the digital surface model.
    To generate the digital terrain model of the bare soil, UAV flight campaigns need
    to be conducted before seedlings emerge (Wan et al., 2020). This study also measured
    the plant height manually. The correlation coefficients between plant height and
    measured YSI were 0.138, 0.589, and 0.573 on April 28, May 12, and 21, respectively,
    which appeared to be higher than the canopy coverage. Although canopy coverage
    could be quickly extracted, it remained of low importance. While plant height
    had a higher correlation with the measured YSI, it was not suitable for rapid
    evaluation of drought tolerance in field conditions. Therefore, canopy coverage
    and plant height were not considered in this study. 6. Conclusions Soil, shadow,
    and TAZ were considered noises influencing UAV image feature extraction in this
    study. The NDCSI-based OTSU method achieved the highest segmentation accuracy
    in removing soil and shadows from UAV multispectral images, with an average F1-score
    of 96.5 %. Based on the registered RGB and thermal images, the ExGR-based MINIRROR
    and temperature-based MEAN methods were chosen since the former was with an average
    F1-score of 95 % in removing soil and shadows, while the latter resulted in the
    smallest canopy temperature difference between buffer zones in removing TAZ. The
    PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS transformed canopy spectral, texture, and thermal features
    into a single index (TS and CEI) to evaluate the drought tolerance of winter wheat
    cultivars under both rain-fed and water-deficit treatments. Although less accurate
    than the RF method, they were more straightforward and efficient, allowing rapid
    drought tolerance evaluation as soon as UAV images were obtained from any field.
    The top five cultivars ranked by the TS and CEI showed the same consistency ratios
    of 60 %–80 %, indicating that the PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS should be equally
    preferred in the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars. CRediT authorship

    Appendix 1. Generation of the segmentation ground truth using the SVM The segmentation
    ground truth of the sub-images by the SVM could be achieved by the following steps.
    (1) Extract the canopy spectral, texture, and color features and select samples
    from the sub-images to construct the training dataset. The label for a sample
    in the training dataset was background or wheat canopy. (2) Build the SVM classification
    model and train the model using the training dataset. (3) Use the trained SVM
    model to segment the sub-images, thus achieving the wheat canopy images. (4) Randomly
    select independent test samples and test the performance of the SVM models. Based
    on the above steps, the SVM model achieved an overall accuracy of over 99.3 %
    and a Kappa coefficient of over 0.98 on April 28, May 12, and 21 for the multispectral
    image, and an overall accuracy of over 99.4 % and a Kappa coefficient of over
    0.99 on April 28, May 12, and 21 for the RGB image. Appendix 2. Histograms of

    of the measured YSI with original reflectance-based VIs (Red line) and normalized
    reflectance-based VIs (Blue line). A significant positive correlation between
    VIs and the measured YSI was found, regardless of whether the VIs were calculated
    by the original or normalized reflectance. Appendix 3. Feature selection for drought
    tolerance evaluation The 18 VIs were calculated using the original and normalized
    canopy reflectance, respectively, and then employed for correlation analysis with
    the measured YSI (Fig. A2). The results indicated a significant positive correlation
    between VIs and the measured YSI, regardless of whether the VIs were calculated
    by the original or normalized reflectance. Moreover, by standardizing canopy reflectance,
    the correlation was enhanced on April 28 for the VIs of MCARI/OSAVI, MCARI, OSAVI,
    MSAVI, SAVI, DVI, and EVI2. Among them, MCARI/OSAVI and MCARI were also improved
    on May 12 and 21. Texture indices based on the three two-band combination algorithms
    were calculated for each texture metric and were used for correlation analysis
    with the measured YSI. The texture indices with the highest correlation coefficient
    were displayed in Table A1. All texture indices showed a significant positive
    correlation with the measured YSI, regardless of the band combinations. Further
    analysis revealed that most texture indices were based on the combination of red
    and near-infrared bands. The two temperature indices, TNRCT and TCSI, were calculated
    for correlation analysis with the measured YSI (Fig. A3). The results showed that
    they were significantly positively correlated with the measured YSI and produced
    the highest correlation coefficient on May 21, followed by May 12 and April 28.
    The correlation coefficient of the TNRCT was slightly higher than that of the
    TCSI. Based on the VIs, texture indices, and temperature indices, the Relief-F
    algorithm was used to select the most appropriate indices. The number of selected
    indices was 23, 33, and 34 on April 28, May 12 and 34 on May 21, respectively.
    The intersection of the indices on the three dates included seven VIs, seven texture
    indices, and one temperature index. The seven VIs were RVI, NDVI, GRVI, EVI2,
    WDRVI, IPVI, and MSR. The seven texture indices were DTI1, RTI1, NDTI1, RTI2,
    NDTI2, RTI4, and NDTI4. The temperature index was TCSI. These indices were finally
    used to calculate TS and CEI, as well as to predict YSI. Table A1. Correlation

  description: Shinta River is one of the tributaries of the Megech River basin and
    is used for various purposes. However, the river is affected by Dashen Brewery
    effluents and municipal waste. The general objective of the study was to evaluate
    water quality using Comprehensive Pollution Index and determine the self-purification
    capacity of Shinta River using the Streeter–Phelps model. The water samples were
    collected for four consecutive months at seven monitoring stations from November
    2021 to February 2022. The river water quality parameters were analyzed as per
    standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater. The suitability
    of the river water quality for irrigation, drinking, and aquatic life was evaluated
    using a comprehensive pollution index. The self-purification capacity of the river
    was determined using a Streeter–Phelps model. The comprehensive pollution index
    (CPI) analysis results demonstrated that the river water quality was found in
    sub-cleanness grade II (0.21–0.4) which is suitable for irrigation purposes. The
    CPI for drinking quality and aquatic life showed that the river quality varied
    from Grade III–IV (0.42–3.42) and (0.82–5.05), respectively, which is slight pollution
    to severe pollution for drinking purposes and aquatic life. As per the Streeter–Phelps
    model, the Shinta River's minimum oxygen sag curves DO in mg/L ranged from 1.21
    to 0.86 after traveling 4.43 km and taking in a range of 1.04–2.17 h from sample
    point one in the studied four consecutive months, which were lower than the DO
    requirement for aquatic life. The self-purification capacity factor (f) values
    were greater than unity, indicating that reaeration predominates over deoxygenation
    implying that the river is naturally purified, but less than unity, implying that
    the river is polluted rather than purified. The river was highly polluted by Dashen
    Brewery industry effluents and municipal untreated wastewater that was beyond
    the river's natural capacity to purify it. This has affected human health and
    aquatic life. Therefore, to manage properly and treat before discharge into river
    effluents of Dashen Brewery and municipal wastewater as well as provide wastewater
    treatment plant.

    Water quality assessment of lake water: a review Article 24 March 2016 Water Pollutants:
    Sources and Impact on the Environment and Human Health Chapter © 2020 Water Pollutants:
    Origin and Status Chapter © 2020 Introduction Water is life for all living things;
    all of our daily activities are connected to it (Feng et al. 2023: Xiao et al.
    2018; Nyambar et al. 2023). The degradation of water quality in any body of water
    is caused by both natural and anthropogenic factors (Aminiyan and Aminiyan 2020;
    Elhdad 2019; Mekonnen et al. 2023). The most important natural factors are geological,
    hydrological, and climatic, since these affect both the quantity and the quality
    of water available (Aminiyan and Aminiyan, 2020: Elsayed et al. 2020; Gonçalves
    and Esposto 2019: Mirzaei et al. 2016; Ndhlovu and Woyessa 2021; Tenagashaw et
    al. 2022). Besides, anthropogenic activities play a significant role in polluting
    water bodies (Ayogu et al. 2020; Keraga 2019). River water quality deterioration
    has recently become a global environmental problem because of rapid population
    growth, industrialization, dynamic urbanization, intensive agricultural activities,
    and natural factors (El-Sorogy et al. 2023; Mekonnen and Gokcekus 2020; Sangare
    et al. 2023). About one-third of the world''s drinking water needs are provided
    from surface sources such as rivers and dams that resulted in widespread ecological
    degradation (Aminiyan and Aminiyan 2020; Shmeis 2018; WHO and Unicef 2020a). In
    2017, at least 2 billion people used a source of potable water that was contaminated
    with feces, and 673 million people also practiced open defecation (Lin et al.
    2022: WHO & COWASH 2018). Water quality problems are caused by various factors,
    which can broadly be divided into natural and anthropogenic activities (Assegide
    et al. 2022; Mekonnen et al. 2023; Sangare et al. 2023). The root causes of water
    pollution have been described as anthropogenic factors, such as industrialization,
    population growth, urbanization, and agricultural production (Badrzadeh et al.
    2022; Ferronato 2019; Galaburda et al. 2023). River water pollution from spatial
    and temporal perspectives sources that generate major water pollution are typically
    point sources (Cheng et al. 2022; Fernandes et al. 2021; Jabbar 2019). Point sources
    pollutants include constituents that enter watercourses include in both municipal
    and industrial wastewater, stormwater discharges from discrete conveyances directly;
    sewer lines, drainages, ditches, and combined sewer overflow (Kumar et al. 2021,
    2022). Poor wastewater management practices contribute to nutrient enrichment
    resulting in excessive algae growth, loss of dissolved oxygen (DO) in water, discoloration,
    and foul odor in the water, due to anaerobic microbial decomposition (Ain et al.
    2019: Aminiyan and Aminiyan 2020). These variables lead to pollution that is beyond
    the natural capacity for purification, harming human health and contaminating
    the ecosystem (Zubaidah et al. 2019). The biochemical reactions of microbes with
    sufficient DO, the use of organic matter as nutrients, and the breakdown of complex
    compounds into simpler and relatively harmless end products are the cornerstones
    of the self-purification process (Ain et al. 2019; Mosavi et al. 2023). River
    water has the ability gradually to clean itself along downstream over time (Mekonnen
    and Manderso 2023; Yustiani et al. 2018). Water''s ability to purify itself is
    based on physical, chemical, and biological processes (Najafzadeh and Ghaemi 2019;
    Toussaint-Jimenez et al. 2020). The rate of self-purification is affected by several
    factors, including the amount of waste discharged and organic matter contained
    in sewage, the river depth and velocity, water temperature, dilution and dispersion,
    temperature sunlight, presence of available oxygen in the water, and morphometric
    and riparian vegetation (Singh et al. 2020; Southren et al. 2020; Tsegaye 2019;
    Setiawan et al. 2018). Self-purification of natural water is a complex process
    that often includes simultaneously functioning physical, chemical, and biological
    processes to the downstream (Belachew 2019; Feng et al. 2023; Olajire 2020). The
    principal mechanism of purification is the absorption and dissolving of atmospheric
    oxygen from the water''s surface (Mekonen and Amsalu 2018; Fia et al. 2020). The
    river''s self-purification capability is the process through which the aquatic
    ecology is returned to equilibrium (Xiao et al. 2018). The river''s ability to
    purify itself is an important attribute for maintaining river water quality and
    ensuring the river''s ecological stability (Tekile 2023; Yustiani et al. 2018).
    In recent years, water quality assessment has become a major concern, especially
    as freshwater becomes a precious resource in the future (Feng et al. 2023; Toussaint-Jimenez
    et al. 2020). Comprehensive Pollution Index (CPI) is an essential tool to assess
    the water quality of a water body in a specific watershed by using monitoring
    parameters (Nivesh et al. 2023; Roy et al. 2023). The CPI was the best tool for
    monitoring water quality of river because of its capacity to effectively detect
    severely polluted rivers with multiple impairments (Xiang et al. 2020; Xu et al.
    2022). In general, the comprehensive pollution index approach is the most appropriate
    and important way for scientifically reflecting the types and levels of main pollutions
    in compliance with water pollution-level standards (Son et al. 2020). The CPI
    is a tool for determining the degree of pollution in a watershed-based on monitoring
    indicators that meet international water quality standards (Kumar et al. 2022;
    Son et al. 2020). Water quality models are useful for environmental management,
    because they can forecast changes in surface water quality (Elsayed et al. 2020;
    Gonçalves and Esposto 2019; Mirzaei et al. 2016; Nyambar and Viswanathan 2023).
    QUALs (QUAL 2 k and 2E), SWAT, HSPF, WASP, MIKE 11, EFDC, CE-QUAL-W2, ELCOMCAEDYM,
    and mathematical models are among the most widely used water quality models (Asteris
    et al. 2022; Nivesh et al. 2023; Roy et al. 2023). Streeter–Phelps among one of
    the mathematical models was selected as oxygen demand in a river decreases over
    a certain distance along the river due to depletion of biological oxygen demand
    (BOD) by microorganisms for particularly this problem, which is related to a river''s
    natural purification capacity (Abd-Elaty et al. 2022; Ali and Taiyb 2019). It
    is a widely used general model that was first proposed in 1925 to analyze the
    pollution and natural purification of the Ohio River in USA (Feng et al. 2023;
    Li et al. 2021). This selected model was modified several times into various forms
    and applications to reduce uncertainty and minimize error (Ain et al. 2019; Singh
    et al. 2020). Shinta River is among the urban rivers crossing Gondar city and
    is highly polluted mainly from point source pollutants (Getnet 2020; Teshome et
    al. 2019). This river is one of the major tributaries of Megech river and the
    river water is used for various purposes, such as domestic and irrigation purposes
    by the downstream communities (Getnet 2020; Teshome et al. 2019). The river has
    been highly polluted by the Dashen brewery industry and municipal waste, which
    is beyond the river''s capacity to purify (Zubaidah et al. 2019). This has affected
    human health and aquatic life (Mumbi and Watanabe 2020). The general objective
    of the study was to evaluate water quality using CPI and determine the self-purification
    capacity of Shinta River, using the Streeter–Phelps model. This study was conducted
    to improve the water quality of the river and reduce water pollution using the
    mitigation measures and construction of a centralized/decentralized wastewater
    treatment Plant. Materials and methods The study area The study was conducted
    in Gondar, Ethiopia, along the Shinta River, in northwestern Ethiopia, in the
    Amhara National Regional State. Gondar city is now a rapidly expanding city, due
    to its tourist destinations area for the Simien Mountains National Park, as well
    as commercial activities with the Sudan border. It is about 738 km from Addis
    Ababa and 170 km from Bahir Dar. The geographical location of the study area is
    found 120 32′00′′–12° 40′ 08′′ North latitude and 37° 22′30′′–370 27′30′′ East
    longitude, with an altitude range of 2000–2200 m a.m.s.l. A total population of
    207,044 is based on (CSA 2007). The monthly rainfall in Gondar in 2021/22 is highly
    seasonal, with the highest rainfall of 2341 mm lowest 0 mm. The rainy season lasts
    8 months from March to October; the highest and the lowest temperature is expected
    at 27 °C and 19 °C, respectively. Dashen Brewery Industry has located 12 km from
    the town center in the western part of Gondar. The Shinta River receives and transports
    untreated municipal wastewater and solid-waste disposal from residential settlements,
    commercial, and institutions, as well as industrial effluent from the Dashen brewery.
    The river was used for many purposes, including livestock watering, hygiene, water
    tracker fetched for urban construction in various ways for various purposes, as
    well as irrigation by downstream communities. The river flow varies with the seasons,
    with high flows in the rainy (summer) season (March–October) and low flows in
    the dry season (November–February). Along the Shinta River, wastewater from point
    sources of pollution, such as Dashen brewery industries and municipal wastewater,
    is released via sewers within the industry and out the rear entrance through drainages
    and ditches. Shinta river is 14 km, and its watershed or catchment area is 37
    km2, as shown in Fig. 1. The river flows from the northwest to the southeast of
    Gondar city, integrating with the Angereb, Keha, and Azezo-Dimaza rivers before
    entering the Megech river dam, which was designed to provide water to Gonder city
    and irrigation to downstream communities. Fig. 1 Map of study area Full size image
    Selection of sampling points and sample season Sample points were purposively
    selected and the collections of samples were four times in the studied 4 months.
    The selection criteria were the availability of point source pollutants discharged
    within tributaries (Belachew 2019), the level of anthropogenic influence (Gonçalves
    and Esposto 2019), and the ease of accessibility (Keraga 2019). Besides, the availability
    and reliability of each sample site, as well as time and cost, were all factors
    in the selection process (Galvis 2019). The study selected, based on all of the
    criteria mentioned, seven sample points (S) and inflow tributary (W); W1 inflow
    tributary to S2, S1, and S3 are monitoring stations located at anthropogenic activities
    at upstream segments of the river, W2 tributary to S4, S5 by anthropogenic activity
    in the middle segment of the river, W3 tributary to S6, and S7 at the downstream
    segment of the river by the ease of accessibility from Ayra bridge and a focused
    eight-kilometer stretch of the river. The Shinta River selected sample points
    and descriptions, as shown in (Fig. 2). The investigation and sampling took place
    during the dry season, based on the principle of visualizing the worst potential
    pollution scenario in the river (Hishe et al. 2020). In general, during extreme
    dry generated wastes by point sources from industrial and municipal waste, will
    be possible pollutants such as nutrients, pathogens, sediments, and toxic chemicals
    (oil, grease, and heavy metals), can be found in a variety of ways, all of which
    harm human health and environment (Agunwamba et al. 2018; Keraga 2019). Samples
    were collected from seven monitoring stations during the dry season of 2021/22
    for 4 months, such as Nov-24, Dec-21, Jan-23, and Feb-22. All of the river samples
    were influenced by waste from the Dashen brewery, as well as municipal waste from
    residential and non-residential the city along the river. Similarly, the geographic
    locations of sampling points were identified using a handheld Garmin Global Positioning
    System (GPS). Fig. 2 Description of sample points Full size image River water
    sample collection The samples were collected in a 1.5-L polyethylene bottle, which
    was cleaned with deionized water before being rinsed three times with the sample
    water. To avoid sample mix-ups and confusion, we properly labeled suitable code
    (numbering on the side and/or top cap of the bottles as S1 up to S7) on the sampling
    holder plastic bottles. In terms of timing and location of sample sites, the sampling
    locations were chosen to ensure that the samples gathered were representative
    of the research area''s established borders (Kumar et al. 2021). Grab sampling
    procedures were utilized to acquire a sample from the water''s surface and immerse
    the bottle to a depth of roughly 20 cm, with the mouth pointing slightly downwards,
    according to Hishe et al., (2020). If there is a stream, the lip of the bottle
    should face it. To fill the bottle, turn it upside down. Remove the bottle cap
    and replace it. During sampling, sample vials would be properly sealed to avoid
    air bubbles (Mekonnen et al. 2023). After the samples have been obtained, essential
    preservation techniques for particular parameters are followed. The samples were
    immediately refrigerated in an icebox and transferred to Bahirdar University''s
    water quality laboratory for examination within 24 h after collection. All of
    the analytical procedures were carried out under the sampling protocol of the
    American Public Health Association''s (APHA), standard methods for the examination
    of water and wastewater (APHA, 2017). Water quality analysis and analytical techniques
    Based on the extreme dry season, a total of 18 water quality parameters were assessed,
    with the water quality evaluated spatially at seven separate sample stations along
    the river. The Aqua probe 700 (AP 700) equipment was used to test water temperature,
    Electric Conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), pH, and Dissolved Oxygen
    (DO) value in the field. The parameters of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical
    Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solid (TSS), Nitrate (NO3−1), PO4−3, Ca+2,
    Mg+2, SO4−2, Cl−, HCO3−, CO3−2, sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+) were examined
    in the laboratory according to the APHA laboratory procedure (2017). Before the
    measurements, of all equipments were calibrated adequately using a commercial
    quality calibration standard (Elhdad 2019; Reddy et al. 2021). BOD5 was evaluated
    using a dilution technique and a 5-day incubation period at 20 °C in an instrument
    incubator (MIR-153). Potassium permanganate was used to calculate COD, which was
    done using the open reflux technique. By evaporating a known volume of a well-mixed
    sample at 105 °C, Total Solids (TS) were determined. The gravimetric approach
    is used to get TSS by subtracting TS from TDS. Using an instrument photometer,
    NO3−1, PO4−3, Ca+2, and Mg+2 were determined using the ordinary test Photometer
    technique (PHOT 7500). SO4−2 was measured using a Ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis)
    Spectrophotometer using a turbid metric technique. The Argentometric technique
    was used to determine chloride (Cl−). HCO3 and CO3−2, on the other hand, employ
    the Titrimetric method. Finally, the determination of Na+ and K+ concentrations
    were made by the flame photometric method using an instrument Flame photometer
    (JANEWAY PFP 7). Water quality assessment by comprehensive pollution index (CPI)
    The suitability of river water for irrigation, drinking, and aquatic life is determined
    using the CPI and single-factor pollution index (Pi) which are computed using
    (Eqs. 1, 2), respectively $${\\text{CPI}} = 1/n\\sum\\nolimits_{(i - 1)}^n {{\\text{Pi}}}
    ,$$ (1) where CPI = Comprehensive Polluted Index; n = number of monitoring parameters
    or selected pollutants; Pi = the single-factor pollution index number i, i = starting
    number of monitoring parameters. The single-factor pollution index (Pi) is calculated
    according to the following equation: $${\\text{Pi}} = \\frac{{{{\\text{C}}_{\\text{i}}}}}{{{{\\text{S}}_{\\text{i}}}}},$$
    (2) where Ci = measured concentration of parameter i in water; Si = permitted
    according to international standards guidelines for irrigation, WHO, (2017) for
    drinking purposes and aquatic life. To assess the suitability of the river water
    for irrigation, drinking, and aquatic life using CPM. The selected monitoring
    parameters for irrigation were pH, EC, TDS, K+, Mg+2, Ca+2, Na+, HCO3−, CO3−2,
    SO4−2, Cl−, NO3−, and PO4−3; for drinking were pH, WT, EC, TDS, DO, TSS, BOD5,
    COD, K+, Mg+2, Ca+2, Na+, HCO3−, SO4−2, Cl−, NO3−, and PO4 −3; and for aquatic
    life were: pH, WT, TDS, DO, TSS, BOD, COD, Cl−, and NO3− (Reddy et al. 2021).
    Surface water single-factor pollution index and water quality catagories are shown
    in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Table 1 Single-factor pollution index (Pi) standard
    grades Full size table Table 2 Standard surface water quality categories based
    on CPI Full size table Collection of hydraulic parameters A Garmin GPS is being
    utilized in the field to determine the precise locations of the river, the sources
    of the pollutants, and the sampling sites. Figure 3 shows that 95% of the time,
    Garmin GPS receivers are accurate to 15 m (49 ft). In normal circumstances, users
    can anticipate an accuracy of 5–10 m (16–33 feet). A measuring tape was used to
    determine the breadth and depth of the hydraulic parameters, and a current meter
    was used to determine velocity. Hydraulic radius, cross-sectional area (assuming
    a semi-circular river channel), and discharge (cross-sectional area multiplied
    by velocity) were all derivatives (Agunwamba et al. 2018). Fig. 3 Onsite measurements

    of four months'' collection of results. As a result, the reaeration coefficient
    model was established, which is the work''s end outcome. Depth, stream velocity,
    and width are all hydraulic data (Tekile 2023). The hydraulic radius, which is
    defined by (Eq. 3) $$\\mathrm{Hydraulic Radius }\\left({\\text{H}}\\right)=\\frac{\\frac{{\\text{Area}}}{2}}{\\frac{{\\text{Perimeter}}}{2}}=\\frac{\\frac{\\pi
    {d}^{2}}{8}}{\\frac{\\pi d}{2}}=\\frac{d}{4}=\\frac{r}{2},$$ (3) where d is the
    diameter of a circle (mean depth). This method was also used to calculate the
    average depth. The mean velocity (v) is the average of the width measurements
    made at each cross-section at the three distinct velocities. According to Peavy
    et al. (1985), there is continuity of flow if there is steady flow in a channel
    and the concept of conservation of mass is applied to the system. The area and
    velocity product would be the same for any two cross-sections, as demonstrated
    in (Eq. 4) if the flow is constant in the channel''s reach $$Q\\, = \\,{A_1}{V_1}\\,
    = \\,{A_2}{V_2}.$$ (4) Time of travel Time of travel (t day) was determined the
    distance per velocity; it was determined as follows in (Eq. 5) (Omole, 2011; Patrick,
    2016): $$t(day) = \\frac{{\\text{Distances\\,(km)}}}{{\\text{Velocity\\,(km/day)}}}.$$
    (5) Streeter-phelps model According to Gente (2020), the Streeter–Phelps model
    is used to calculate the boundary conditions for the river system assessments,
    which typically start at a point source of pollutants and progress downstream
    with the river. As a result, the findings regarding the pollution entering the
    river from point sources serve as the entry for the subsequent point sources of
    pollution. Tributaries can be stated in Eqs. 6 and 7 and are considered as point
    sources in mass balance equations (Teshome et al. 2019) as follows: $${\\text{D}}
    = {\\text{D}}_{{\\text{o}}} \\, {\\text{e}}^{{ - \\frac{{{\\text{k}}_{2} }}{{\\text{u}}}{\\text{*x}}}}
    + \\, \\frac{{{\\text{k}}_{1} \\, {\\text{L}}_{{\\text{o}}} }}{{{\\text{k}}_{2}
    - {\\text{k}}_{1} }}\\left[ {{\\text{e}}^{{ - \\frac{{{\\text{k}}_{1} }}{{\\text{u}}}{\\text{*x}}}}
    - \\, {\\text{e}}^{{ - \\frac{{{\\text{k}}_{2} }}{{\\text{u}}}{\\text{*x}}}} }
    \\right]$$ (6) $${\\text{L}} = {\\text{L}}_{o} {\\text{e}}^{{ - \\frac{{{\\text{k}}_{1}
    }}{{\\text{u}}}*x}} ,$$ (7) where; u = velocity (km/day) and x = distance along
    the river (km). The lowest point on the DO sag curve, which is called the critical
    oxygen deficit (Dc), corresponds to the critical time (tc) can be found by differentiating
    (Eq. 8), setting it equal to 0, and solving for t using base e values for k1 and
    k2: Critical time(\\({{\\text{t}}}_{{\\text{c}}}\\)) $${{\\text{t}}_{\\text{c}}}
    = \\frac{{1}}{{{{\\text{k}}_{2}} - {{\\text{k}}_{1}}}}{\\text{ln}}\\left\\{ {\\frac{{{{\\text{k}}_{2}}}}{{{{\\text{k}}_{1}}}}\\left[
    {{1} - \\frac{{{{\\text{D}}_{\\text{o}}}{*}\\left( {{{\\text{k}}_{2}} - \\left.
    {{{\\text{k}}_{1}}} \\right)} \\right.}}{{{{\\text{L}}_{\\text{o}}}{{\\text{k}}_{1}}}}}
    \\right]} \\right\\}.$$ (8) The corresponding equation for critical oxygen deficit
    (Dc) is shown in Eq. 9 $${D_c} = \\frac{{k_1}}{{k_2}}*{L_o}{e^{ - {k_1} \\, *{t_c}}}.$$
    (9) Mass balance approach for mixing Mass balance is the key concept that it accounts
    for all water movement through in a defined volume in the area of the river (Getnet
    2020). Mass and volumetric balances are extremely useful based on the principles
    of conservation of mass over time (Getnet 2020; Teshome et al. 2019). An important
    aspect of mass balance theory is that a powerful cross-check can be undertaken
    through comparison of the independently measurable quantities of the system that
    are inputs minus outputs equal to change in stored water (Fig. 4) (Zubaidah et
    al. 2019) $${C_r}{Q_r} + {C_w}{Q_w} \\, = \\, {{\\text{C}}_{\\text{m}}}{Q_m}.$$
    (10) Fig. 4 Source: Chapra,2015; Thanh et al., 2016; Zubaidah et al. 2019 Mass
    balance approach for Mixing. Full size image The concentrations of DO, BOD5, and
    Temperature after mixing are the respective masses per unit time divided by the
    total flow rate (wastewater flow + river flow) (Yustiani et al. 2018; Zubaidah
    et al. 2019), shown in Eqs. 10, 11 $$\\text{Cm} = \\frac{{QrCr+QwCw}}{\\left({Qr+Qw}\\right)}{=}\\frac{{QrCr+QwCw}}{{Qm}},$$
    (11) where \\({\\text{Cm}}\\) = the mix concentration of DO, BOD5, or Temperature,
    Cr = the concentrations of DO, BOD5, or Temperature in the main river, Qr = the
    discharge in cubic meters per second of the main river, Cw = the concentration
    of DO, BOD5, or Temperature in the effluent Qw = the discharge of the effluent,
    and Qm = the mixed discharge of the river water and effluent. Oxygen Deficit:-
    The DO sag curve has been developed using oxygen deficit to make it easier to
    solve along the river that results from the mathematical description of the mass
    balance (Ain et al. 2019; Yustiani et al. 2018). The oxygen deficit is calculated
    in (Eq. 12), as follows: $$D\\, = \\,D{O_{sat}}-DO,$$ (12) where D = oxygen deficit,
    mg/L, DOsat = Saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen, mg/L, and DO = actual
    concentration of dissolved oxygen, mg/L. The saturation concentration of the oxygen
    can be calculated based on temperature through saturation DO level (DOsat) (Hishe
    et al. 2020) is given in (Eq. 13) $$\\mathop {\\text{DO }}\\nolimits_{sat} = 14.652
    - (4.1022 \\, *{10^{ - 1}}T) + (7.991 \\, *{10^{ - 3}}*{T^2}) - (7.7774 \\, *{10^{
    - 5}}*{T^3}),$$ (13) where DOsat = DO saturation concentration, mg/L, T = the
    water temperature in ℃. Initial oxygen deficit: The beginning of the DO sag curve
    is at the point where a waste discharge mixes with the river (Ain et al. 2019).
    The initial deficit is calculated as the difference between saturated DO and the
    concentration of DO after mixing using Eq. 14 $${D_o} = \\mathop {{\\text{DO}}}\\nolimits_{sat}
    - \\frac{{({Q_r}*\\mathop {{\\text{DO}}}\\nolimits_r ) + (Qw*\\mathop {{\\text{DO}}}\\nolimits_w
    )}}{{({Q_r} + Qw)}},$$ (14) where D0 = initial deficit after river and wastewater
    have mixed, mg/L and DOsat = saturation concentration of DO at the temperature
    of the river before mixing mg/L. Deoxygenation (k1) and reaeration (k2) coefficients’
    determination The deoxygenation coefficient is solely determined by waste characteristics
    (Nugraha et al. 2020a; Paulo et al. 2021). The experimental deoxygenation coefficient,
    k1 (day−1), was calculated using (Eq. 15) $${k_1} = \\, \\frac{{\\left[ {\\log
    {L_o} - \\log \\, L} \\right]}}{t} \\, = \\frac{{\\left[ {\\log \\frac{{L_o}}{L}}
    \\right]}}{t},$$ (15) where L = instantaneous BOD5, mg/L, Lo = ultimate BOD5,
    mg/L, and t = time in days. The deoxygenation rate constant is adjusted to the
    temperature of the receiving water, which is calculated using (Eq. 16) (Nugraha
    et al. 2020a) $${K_{1(T)}} = {K_{1(200c)}}*{\\theta^{(T - 20)}},$$ (16) where,
    k1(T) = Deoxygenation rate constant at the temperature of interest, day−1 T = Temperature
    of interest,oC, k20 = BOD5 rate constant determined at 20 °C, in day−1 and Ɵ = 1.047
    on temperature (20–30) oC, and 1.135 on the temperature (4–20) oC, Experimental
    k2 (day−1) was determined D, DOsat, and Do (Eqs. 12–14), respectively, general
    using (Eq. 17) (Ali and Taiyb 2019) $${k_2} = \\, \\frac{{ \\, \\left[ { \\, \\log
    {D_o} - \\log \\, D} \\right]}}{t} = \\frac{{\\left[ {\\log \\frac{{D_o}}{D}}
    \\right]}}{t},$$ (17) where, Do = initial DO deficit at the upstream and D = DO
    deficit at any downstream point, t = time of travel between any two points. Both
    k1 and k2 coefficients were computed using Excel, as shown in Tables 9–12, respectively.
    The Reaeration coefficients are adjusted to the temperature of the receiving water,
    which is calculated using (Eq. 18) (Chapra 2015) $${K_{2(T)}} = {K_{2(200c)}}*{\\theta^{(T
    - 20)}},$$ (18) where T = temperature 0C and Ɵ is the temperature coefficient.
    This has a value of 1.024 for temperatures between 4–20 oC and 1.016 for temperatures
    20–30 ℃. Determination of deoxygenation (k1) and reaeration coefficient (k2) The
    determination of deoxygenation (k1) and Reaeration Coefficient (k2) values as
    stated in Eqs. 15 and 17 with corresponding its adjusting temperature Eqs. 16
    and 18, respectively, was carried out using the Excel Spreadsheet are presented
    as in Tables 8–13 for consecutive four months starting from Nov-24 to Feb-22.
    Determination of self-purification capacity of the river Based on laboratory and
    in situ results that used the Eqs. 19 and 20, with corresponding its adjusting
    temperature (Eqs. 21 and 22), respectively, were used to calculate adjusted temperature
    k1T and k2T, and Eq. 23 was used to determine the self-purification capacity factor
    (f). Results are as shown in Tables 9–12 and Fig. 14. In e base or 10 base $$BO{D_t}
    = {L_o} - \\left( {{L_o}{e^{--kt}}} \\right) = {L_o}\\left( {1 - {e^{--kt}}} \\right)
    \\, OR \\, BO{D_t} = {L_o} - \\left( {{{10}^{ - Kt}}} \\right) = {L_o}\\left(

    BOD5 after river and wastewater have mixed, mg/L, k1 = deoxygenation coefficient
    to the base e, per day, or k1 = 2.303K1, per day, k2 = reoxygenation coefficient
    to the base e, per day, or k2 = 2.303, K2, per day, and D0 = initial oxygen deficit
    after river and wastewater have mixed, mg/L $$\\frac{dD}{{dt}} = {k_1}{L_t}--{k_2}D,$$
    (21) where \\(\\frac{dD}{{dt}}\\) = the rate of change of the dissolved oxygen
    content of the river with time, and Lt = BOD at the instantaneous time, t = time
    in days. and D = oxygen deficit in river water $${K^2} = 5.026*{V}^{0.969}/{H}^{1.678},$$
    (22) where \\({k}_{2}\\) = Reaeration coefficient at 20 °C, \\(V\\) = average
    speed of stream flow, m/s, and H = average depth of stream, m. The self-purification
    capacity(f) of any stream can be derived (Patrick 2016) can also be determined
    using the following equation: $$f\\, = \\,*\\;\\frac{K2}{{K1}},$$ (23) where k2
    and k1 are reaeration and deoxygenation coefficients at 20 °C, in day−1 respectively.
    Reaeration coefficient (k2) model To determine the reaeration coefficient model
    (k2) of three comparison models using (Eqs. 24, 25, & 26) for Streeter et al.
    (1936), O’Connor and Dobbins (1958), and Omole, (2011), respectively, and measured
    k2 values of Shinta river and Eq. 24 also for all k2 adjusted temperature for
    consecutive four months plotted graph, as shown in Fig. 14A–D. Tables 9–12 show
    the model determined results and plotted in the graph also in Fig. 14A–D. The
    most commonly used Reaeration coefficient (k2) is stated by O’Connor and Dobbins
    (1958) $${K_2} = 5.026*{V}^{0.969}/{H}^{1.678}$$ (24) $${K_2} = 3.9*{V}^{0.5}{^{1.5}}$$
    (25) $${K_2} = 46.2679*{V}^{1.5468}/{H}^{0.0128}.$$ (26) MATLAB software was used
    to model the reaeration coefficients using a non-linear model (Eq. 25) (Abd-Elaty
    et al. 2022). The model needs the following in situ measured: reaeration coefficient
    (k2), velocity(v) in m/s, and hydraulic radius (H) in m (Eq. 27) $${K_2} = a{V^b}/{H^c}.$$
    (27) Unknown values of function determined by the model parameters a, b, and c.
    parameters were optimized using non-linear regression relationships. These values
    were sorted by months and then entered into MATLAB environment for simulations
    that resulted from the newly developed reaeration model as shown in Eq. 28 $${K_2}
    = 1.21\\frac{{{V^{1.95}}}}{{{H^{1.62}}}}.$$ (28) Results and discussion Water
    quality assessment of the river by comprehensive pollution index (CPI) The river
    water quality was assessed at seven samples points by measuring 18 water quality
    indicators. The single-factor pollution index and CPI values were used to determine
    the suitability of river water for irrigation, drinking, and aquatic life purposes
    respectively. For irrigation water purpose Table 3’s results obtained for each
    of the seven sampling points and read the status from Table 1 for Pi related to
    FAO, & IWMI, (2017) and CPI from Table 2, respectively. Elevated potassium is
    linked with an increase in point and non-sources pollutants from municipal wastewater
    which is organic matter suitable for irrigation. Municipal sources are caused
    by residential from condominiums and non-residential from commercial and institutional
    areas. According to Teshome et al. (2019) and Ainurrafiq et al. (2019), elevated
    potassium is associated with an increase in point and non-source pollutants from
    municipal wastewater, which is organic matter suitable for irrigation. Residential
    sources from condominiums and non-residential sources from commercial and institutional
    sectors are the main contributors to municipal sources (Kumar et al. 2022; Tamiru
    2019). Table 3 Summarized single factor (Pi) and CPI of Shinta River for irrigation
    purpose Full size table The CPI results in sub-cleanness category of the Shinta
    River water suitable for irrigation that represents in blue color, as shown in
    Fig. 5. According to Imneisi & Aydin (2018), the CPI produces a subcategory of
    cleanness for the River water appropriate for agriculture, which is represented
    in blue. According to Badrzadeh et al (2022) and Feng et al (2023), the CPI produces
    a subcategory of river water for irrigation purpose is better ranged from 0.2
    to 0.28 and bad for irrigation purposes ranged from 0.3 to 0.35. Therefore, the
    results of this study indicated that the values CPI for irrigation purposes were
    0.21–0.35, and then, 0.21–0.29 was the appropriate for irrigation purpose, but
    0.3–0.31 less appropriate, and 0.32–0.35 was is not appropriate for irrigation
    purposes. Fig. 5 The Comprehensive Pollution Index (CPI) of the Shinta River suitable
    for irrigation Full size image For drinking water purpose Table 4’s results obtained
    for each of the seven sampling points and read the Pi Status from Table 1 related
    to the WHO (2017) and CPI status from Table 2, respectively. BOD5, COD, and PO4
    contents were higher and decreased DO levels less than 5 mg/L for unsuitable drinking
    purposes. Table 4 Summarized single factor and CPI of the Shinta River for drinking
    purposes Full size table According to Asteris et al. (2022) and Leta and Dibaba
    (2019), BOD5, COD, and PO4 contents were greater and decreased DO levels less
    than 4.5 mg/L for unsuitable drinking purposes. DO level was higher due to the
    dilution effect of non-point sources of perennial springs at sample points S1
    and S3 along the riverbank. At sample places along the riverbank, the DO level
    was higher as a result of the dilution effect of non-point sources of perennial
    springs (Ain et al. 2019; Mekonnen 2022). Whereas, decreased DO levels are linked
    with an increase in pollutants from Dashen Brewery and municipal wastewater. While
    elevated municipal wastewater and contaminants from the Dashen Brewery are connected
    to decreasing DO levels (Shabangu and Bakare 2019; Tamiru 2019; Teshome et al.
    2019). Municipal sources caused by residential from condominiums and non-residential
    from commercial and institutional areas are understood as the main pollution sources
    around the Shinta watershed. The CPI results in the river water unsuitable for
    drinking that CPI categories of slight pollution that represents color in light
    yellow; moderate pollution in dark yellow and severe pollution in dark red, respectively,
    as shown in Fig. 6. According to Imneisi and Aydin (2018), the CPI causes the
    river water to be unfit for drinking in the categories of slight pollution, which
    is represented by the color light yellow; moderate pollution, which is represented
    by the color dark yellow; and severe pollution, which is represented by the color
    dark red. Xu et al, (2022) state that the CPI causes the river water to be unfit
    for drinking, with light yellow representing little pollution, dark yellow representing
    moderate pollution, and dark red representing severe pollution. Therefore, the
    results of CPI of the Shinta River for drinking purposes were indicated that good
    correlation according to previous studies. Fig. 6 The Comprehensive Pollution
    Index of the Shinta River for drinking purposes Full size image For aquatic life
    purpose Table 5’s results obtained for each of the seven sampling points and read
    the Pi Status from Table 1 for aquatic life accordingly CCME, (2007) and CPI status
    for Table 2 respectively. According to Table 5, BOD5, COD, and TSS concentration
    were higher, and DO in mg/L and pH were lower than international standards guidelines
    respectively. Table 5 Summarized single factor and CPI of the Shinta River for
    aquatic life Full size table On the other hand, the rise of DO level was for sample
    points S1 and S3 due to the dilution effect of non-point sources of perennial
    Springs at the riverside for consecutive 4 months of November, December, January,
    and February 2021/22 of the Shinta river. According to Mekonnen (2022) and Tamiru
    (2019) found that DO and pH were below recommended levels for international norms,
    whereas BOD5, COD, and TSS concentrations were greater and higher, respectively.
    On the other hand, the increase in DO level was caused by the diluting effect
    of perennial springs that were non-point sources near the riverfront for four
    consecutive months from November to February (Ain et al. 2019; Tekile 2023). According
    to Galaburda et al. (2023), an increase in these parameters is associated with
    an increase in pollutants from industry and municipal wastewater. According to
    El-Sorogy et al. (2023) and Getnet (2020), non-residential business districts
    and institutions, along with residential condominiums, are the main producers
    of pollution. Therefore, increases in these parameters are linked with an increase
    in pollutants from Dashen Brewery and municipal wastewater. Residential condominiums
    and non-residential commercial areas and institutions are understood to be the
    main pollution sources. The CPI results in the river water unsuitable for aquatic
    life that CPI categories of slight pollution represent in color light yellow;
    moderate pollution in dark yellow and severe pollution in dark red, respectively,
    accordingly to Imneisi and Aydin (2018), in Fig. 7. According to Xu et al. (2022),
    all seven sample points with the exception of the first sampling point had single-factor
    pollution index and CPI values that were too high for aquatic life and drinking
    water, including BOD5, DO, COD, TDS, PO4-3, WT, Cl, NO3, and TSS. According to
    Reddy et al. (2021), the Comprehensive Pollution Index, also known as the Comprehensive
    Water Quality Identification Index, examined the small west-flowing rivers and
    classified them as Class I, Class II, and Class III water quality standards, respectively.
    Class I water quality standards refer to water with the same quality as the source
    water or water from a national nature reserve; Class II water quality standards
    refer to the first-grade protection zone, which is primarily used as the centralized
    drinking water source; and Class III water quality standards. Fig. 7 The Comprehensive
    Pollution Index of the Shinta River for Aquatic life Full size image Hydraulic
    parameters of Velocity and depth of the river According to Nivesh (2023), the
    velocities are inversely proportional to the areas of the respective cross-sections
    based on the continuity equation. According to Feng et al., (2023), mean velocity
    increases spatially sample points so does the reaeration coefficient, a faster
    rate of oxygen transfer from the atmosphere to the water. For Fig. 8a, these correlations
    held true. The presence of rocks along the watercourse at locations S3, S5, and
    S7 in this study area enhances mixi g. The velocity of the DO affects its spatial
    variance, because a quicker velocity causes the DO to disperse more quickly (Ain
    et al. 2019; Assegide et al. 2022). Fig. 8 Mean velocity (a) and the river depth
    (b) values for all sampling points for Nov., Dec., Jan., and Feb Full size image
    At the boundary between air and water, this transition occurs. The transfer of
    DO from the atmosphere to the surface of the aquatic body is controlled by the
    transfer rate and the DO deficiency (Mekonnen et al. 2023). According to Nugraha
    et al (2020b), the degree of turbulence close to the water''s surface, which is
    influenced by water velocity and depth, determines the transfer rate. Additionally,
    velocity has an impact on the geographical distribution of DO since a quicker
    velocity. The reaeration coefficient is inversely proportional to the depth of
    the water and hydraulic radius (Fernandes et al. 2021). These relationships were
    true for Fig. 8b as shown. The depth rises will the DO sag curve to drop lower
    with rising depth and vice versa (Nugraha et al. 2020a; Terefe et al. 2020). The
    mixing zones The study months were three mixing zones sampling points S1 to S2,
    S3 to S4, S5, and S6 in the river section under research during the dry season
    of Nov-24, Dec-21, Jan-23, and Feb-22/2022, as shown in Fig. 2. The municipal
    wastewater entered the river at the first and third points. The second was where
    industrial wastewater from Dashen was mixed with the Shinta River. Since the river
    under study mixes with these three external sources, the unknown river/stream
    between S6 and S7 has other physicochemical parameters at the downstream portion
    of a pollution or dilution source are shown in Table 6. According to Kumar et
    al. (2022) and Yustiani et al. (2018), the river under investigation combines
    with these three external sources, the unknown river/stream between physicochemical
    properties at the downstream portion of a pollution or dilution source. Table
    6 Mixing for wastewater and river water the four consecutive months of the study
    dry season Full size table Streeter–Phelps model According to Getnet (2020) and
    Teshome et al (2019), the mass balances at various discharge points mixing mass
    balances are utilized along the Shinta River stretch that of BOD5 (Ultimate BOD5),
    DO, and Temperature calculated as in Eq. 11 was shown. The estimated DO from the
    upstream point moves to the downstream direction, determining each sampling point
    concentration based on the model (Eqs. 6 and 7). The model determines the concentration
    of the entry point effluent entering the system as an influent for the next consecutive
    new reach sampling points. Figure 9A–H shows both measured and predicted result
    values of DO and BOD5, respectively, for 4 months of Nov-24, Dec-21, Jan-23, and
    Feb-22. The DO and BOD5 were measured (onsite and in the lab) and predicted using
    the Streeter–Phelps model along downstream of the river. The Streeter–Phelps Model
    shows that the DO values measured in the plotted graph follow a similar pattern
    to the predicted DO graph, i.e., the measured and predicted graphs behaved in
    the same manner. Fig. 9 Predicted and Measured DO (A) and BOD5 (B) in Nov-24 (A&B),
    Dec-21 (C&D), Jan-23 (E & F), and Feb-22 (G & H), respectively Full size image
    The Streeter–Phelps model revealed that minimum oxygen sag curves DO in mg/L 1.21,
    1.06, 0.95, and 0.86 based on Eq. 8 after the river traveled 4.43 km the critical
    distances at sample point S4 in Eq. 4, and also the critical times of 1.04, 1.16,
    1.27, and 2.17 h in Eq. 8, were discovered for the months of November, December,
    January, and February, respectively. According to Mukate et al. (2019) and Mekonnen
    et al (2023), they stated that the DO and BOD5 are inversely proportional to each
    other, i.e., a decline in DO levels reflects a high level of BOD5. DO is influenced
    by various factors such as temperature and type of water body. The capacity of
    a river or stream to purify itself is indicated by increasing the graph of dissolved
    oxygen (DO) for consecutive sampling stations from upstream to downstream of the
    Running River (Najafzadeh and Ghaemi 2019; Zubaidah et al. 2019). Therefore, the
    capacity of the Shinta River itself purifying was indicated that increasing the
    graph of DO from sampling stations upstream to downstream of the river running.

    in situ results that deoxygenation (k1) and reaeration coefficient (k2) used Eqs.
    15 and 17 with corresponding its adjusting temperature Eqs. 16 and 18, respectively,
    were used to calculate adjusted temperature k1T and k2T, and Eq. 28 was used to
    determine the self-purification capacity factor (f). The variables used to compute
    the reaeration coefficient (k2) are oxygen deficit, initial deficit after the
    river and wastewater have mixed, and oxygen saturation concentration, which is
    calculated using Eqs. 12, 14 and 23, respectively (Table 7). Table 7 descriptive
    statistics of self-purification capacity factor (f) for all monitoring stations
    over the study 4 months Full size table Self-purification capacity factor (f)
    is the ratio of the reaeration coefficient to the deoxygenation coefficient the
    indices used in determining the self-purification capacity (Ali and Taiyb 2019).
    Table 8 shows the descriptive statistics for the self-purification factors (f)
    that were highest at sampling point (S1) in November, December, January, and February
    2021/2022, with values of 4.3, 3.8, 3.4, and 3.2, respectively. According to Ali
    and Taiyb (2019) and Zubaidah et al (2019), the self-purification capacity factor
    (f), is greater than unity, indicating that reaeration predominates over deoxygenation
    and implying that the river is naturally purified; however, less than unity, implying
    that deoxygenation predominates over reaeration and implying that the river is
    polluted rather than naturally purified. Table 8 Modeling k2 for the Nov-24/2021
    Full size table Figure 10 shows the self-purification capability of the Shinta
    River was assessed, which is spatial. The study''s findings, according to Nugraha
    et al (2020b) and Yustiani et al (2018), show that reaeration predominates over
    deoxygenation and suggest that the river is naturally purified; however, other
    sampling points had values lower than unity, suggesting that deoxygenation predominates
    over reaeration and suggesting that the river is polluted rather than naturally
    purified. The values of the self-purification capacity factor (f) of Shinta River,
    the sampling points (S3, S5, and S7) during the study months were greater than
    unity, indicating that reaeration predominates over deoxygenation and implying
    that the river is naturally purified; however, other sampling points (S2, S4,
    and S6) were less than unity, implying that deoxygenation predominates over reaeration
    and implying that the river is polluted rather than naturally purified. Fig. 10
    Self-purification capacity factor along the river stretches Full size image According
    to Nugraha et al (2020b), the ability to purify itself spatially from upstream
    to downstream, but it also depends on how much trash is discharged and how much
    organic matter is present in sewage. According to Roy et al. (2023) and Terefe
    (2020), the river''s ability to self-purify from upstream to downstream depends
    on the volume of waste discharged, the volume of organic matter in sewage, the
    river''s dilution and dispersion, and the river''s depth. Therefore, the Shinta
    River has self-purification capability spatially from upstream to downstream and
    is also dependent on the amount of waste discharged and the amount of organic
    matter in sewage, the dilution and dispersion of the river, and the depth of the
    river. However, according to Toussaint-Jimenez et al (2020), the river has a natural
    purification capacity, which does not mean that the river water is suitable for
    drinking and aquatic life. Comparison of selected reaeration coefficient models
    Tables 8, 9, 10, 11compare the results of the reaeration coefficient (k2) model
    calculated by Streeter et al. (1936), O''Connor and Dobbins (1958), and Omole
    & Longe, (2011) to onsite-measured results of the Shinta River reaeration coefficient
    model for the four months of the study. Table 9 Modeling k2 for the Dec-21/2021

    11 Modeling k2 for the Feb-22/2022 Full size table The dry weather flow for 2021/22
    for Nov-24, Dec-21, Jan-23, and Feb-22 was selected for the test of performance
    in these particular months, as shown in Fig. 11A–D. Dashen Breweries discharged
    strong wastewater that overshadowed every day rather than other points source
    of pollution (municipal wastewater). November Insitu results marked the start
    of Gondar''s dry season in 2021/2022, with high water discharge and velocity,
    while February 2022 data are notable for having high levels of organic matter
    pollution, which is largely concentrated due to the hottest temperatures and driest
    season. This is because there was a lack of oxygen along the river section this
    month. The selected three models calculated results are as shown in Tables 8,
    9, 10, and 11, respectively, to each of the models such as Streeter–Phelps, (1936)
    in Eq. 29, O''Connor and Dobbins, (1958) in Eq. 26, and Omole and Longe, (2011)
    (also known as the Atuwara reaeration coefficient Model) in Eq. 27 compared to
    laboratory-measured study reaeration Model, with all models adjusted temperature
    in Eq. 18. Fig. 11 Plot of measured K2 against computed K2 in Nov-24 (A), Dec-21
    (B), Jan-23 (C), and Feb-22(D) data, respectively Full size image Table 12 shows
    the R-squared value of three models used to rank related to Shinta''s newly developed
    river model to performance. MATLAB software developed the new reaeration coefficient
    (k2), Dec 22nd, 2021 was the best-fitting month for the river, with the highest
    R2 = 0.94. The new reaeration coefficient (k2) was created using the MATLAB software
    and was designed for the month with the greatest R2 = 0.92 for the river (Abd-Elaty
    et al. 2022; Agunwamba et al. 2018). Therefore, during the 4 months studied, the
    newly developed Shinta River reaeration model looked solid in each of them. Table
    12 Shows the R-squared (R2) values of three (3) models Full size table In general,
    the waste produced in developing and developed countries is quite different. Likewise,
    the Shinta River in Ethiopia and Kwa River (Agunwamba et al. 2018), studied rivers
    in developing countries seem to be more likely to produce related waste, and that
    is why the graph pattern is similar, although (Streeter et al. 1936) and O''Connor&
    Dobbins (1958) studied rivers are in developed countries are also closely related
    that are described in detail in plotted graphs as shown in Fig. 11 (A-D). Model
    parameters MATLAB software was to model the reaeration coefficient based on in
    situ results of DO using a non-linear regression model (Abd-Elaty et al. 2022)
    in Eq. 23. This result was used statistically compared to the selected three models.
    Both MATLAB and Excel spreadsheets were used to do a full analysis, as shown in
    Table 13. Table 13 Shows the newly developed model output for each consecutive
    four months Full size table The values of SSE, coefficient of determination (R2),
    adjusted coefficient of determination (ADj.R2), and RMSE were shown using MATLAB
    software (Ibrahmi et al. 2017; Omole 2011; Patrick 2016), and the newly develop
    model that produced the best result was used. The output to developed new reaeration
    coefficient models of the river select the best R2 and lowest RMSE values of 0.94
    and 4.17, respectively, as shown in Table 13, which fit reaeration coefficient
    models as shown in Eq. 27. Conclusions Shinta River water quality was affected
    by different pollutants generated from municipal wastewater and Dashen Brewery
    effluent. Grab''s sample procedures were utilized to measure irrigation, drinking,
    and aquatic life water quality and hydraulic characteristics on the site. The
    single-factor pollution index and the Compressive Pollution Index (CPI) were effectively
    used to estimate the pollution status of the Shinta watershed. Using the CPI in
    the range of (0.21–0.4) pollution grades II, the river''s pollution status was
    assessed to be appropriate for irrigation water at all sample points. The CPI
    for drinking quality and aquatic life showed that the river quality varied from
    Grade III to IV (0.42–3.42) and (0.82–5.05), respectively, which is slight pollution
    to severe pollution for drinking purposes and aquatic life. The Shinta River''s
    minimum oxygen sag curves DO in mg/L ranged from 1.21 to 0.86 after traveling
    4.43 km and taking in a range of 1.04–2.17 h from sample point one in the studied
    four consecutive months, which was lower than the DO requirement for aquatic life,
    according to the Streeter–Phelps model. The self-purification capacity factor
    (f) was more than unity in the analyzed months, indicating that reaeration predominates
    over deoxygenation and that the river is naturally purified at the sample point
    (S3, S5, and S7), and less than unity, indicating that the river is polluted rather
    than purified at the sample point (S2, S4, and S6). The pollutants in the municipal
    wastewater and Dashen brewery effluents along the Shinta riverbed have exceeded
    the river''s capacity for self-purification, resulting in substantial contamination
    of the ecosystem and a hazard to human health. Using non-regression and MATLAB
    software, an empirical equation for the reaeration coefficient model was created
    based on field data from River Shinta. The reaeration coefficient (k2) established
    and validated using the greatest R2 = 0.94 and least RMSE = 4.17 in December 2021
    was the best-suited month-measured value of the river. Self-purification capacity
    of the Shenta River was affected by dilution and dispersion, flow depth and velocity,
    the amount of accessible oxygen in the water, organic matter in sewage and the
    quantity of waste released, temperature, sunshine, and riparian vegetation. In
    general, proper municipal waste and Dashen brewery effluent disposal systems should
    be implemented to reduce river water pollution. Then, centralized/decentralized
    domestic wastewater and Dashen Brewery effluent wastewater treatment plant should
    be assessed to ensure that it has been properly functioning within the permissible
    limits of FAO and WHO. Therefore, the wastewater generated from different areas,
    such as domestic, industrial, institutional, commercial, and public (hospital,
    school), must be properly managed and treated at sources before discharge into
    surface water bodies, like rivers, reservoirs/dams, lakes, and seawater. Data

  description: This paper gives the idea of solving some of the problems faced by
    farmers. The population rate of the world is growing rapidly and will double in
    the coming decades and the need of food is also increasing simultaneously. To
    meet this rapid growth in demand for food, automation in agriculture is the best
    solution. The aim of this paper is to design and develop an automated system to
    monitor the various conditions of soil and moisture on the crops, and the proper
    supply of water, which affects the crops [5]. Such a system will contain sensors,
    a pump and a device called a humidifier, and various advanced techniques like
    IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The technical field is racing
    to provide more optimum solutions. The incorporation of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide enough
    scope to predicrocess, analyze situations and improve activities in a real-time
    situation. Green House is one of the best solutions as the crops can be grown
    in a controlled climate without the natural environmental conditions. In the last
    few decades there has been a huge advancement in technology for agriculture, with
    the help of technology we can help farmers for increasing their rate of yielding.
    With this, we can overcome the major problems of farmers. This small processor-based
    unit can be used to control anything from a fan, air- conditioner, humidifier,
    and watering system from 4 relay outputs. A temperature and humidity range can
    be set to control relay outputs. The main focus of this paper is to implement
    the Internet of Things (IoT) in the monitoring of humidity, soil condition, temperature,
    supply of water to the field, level of water, environmental condition, etc. The
    IoT-based Smart agriculture System being planned via this paper is integrated
    with different Sensors.

    paper PDF 1 Introduction India is the world''s largest producer of sugar, fruits,
    and jute and also the largest manufacturer of 25% overall production. The extremely
    familiar types of disease attacks on plants’ leaves are alternative of viruses
    and fungoid diseases. As for proper growth of plants and crops, the geographical
    conditions are required 15–20 °C for spraying time, and 20–26 °C for maturing
    and picking with rainfall around 75–100 cm. The growing rate of population and
    advanced conditions of climate also cause harm to plant diseases. Now, the main
    cultivation in India is groundnut, cotton, fish, species, livestock, etc. For
    this, various methods of cultivation have been used like livestock farming, arable
    farming, nomadic farming, sustainable farming, and mixed farming. Livestock farming
    is best for employment and waste which gets activated by animals is used as natural
    manure for the maintenance of soil fertility as agriculture enables a large number
    of quantities of grains and other foodstuffs, and arable farming is used for the
    production of crops that include various types of crops from the growth of plants
    it also produces an extensive range of yearly crops the annual crops means total
    life cycle of the crops from germination to grain production enclosed by 12 months.
    Nomadic farming is a type of primary sustainable farming, nomadic live in arid
    and semiarid parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe in Africa nomadic herd cattle,
    goats, sheep, camels, and other animals managed by nomadic including horses, mux-oxen,
    yaks; mixed farming is used to involve growing crops and raise of livestock. Thus,
    pesticides take an essential role in the production of food and the pesticide
    industry had done contribution in 2018 of over 6.75 billion and the Indian industry
    cultivated 9%, the investment is evaluated at 16.7 million. Although there are
    various types of pesticides used in farming like rodenticides larvicides, overuse
    of fertilizers and pesticides affects soil organisms that are similar to humans
    overworked with antibiotics. For example, plants may depend on different types
    of microorganisms to convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates, which plants
    can use. As per the Indian government, 40% land about 150 billion corrupted. As
    in agricultural generation, 25% of land gets degraded and the soil carbon, nitrous
    oxide exists the atmosphere. Once there, they can infect plants and animals ranging
    from favorable microorganisms, insects, fish, and birds. The detection can be
    done by using plants leaf, temperature, gas sensor, humidity, and soil moisture
    readings will be received from the sensors. Now, in the advanced period of agriculture
    epoch of Industry 4.0 faces many objections, and IoT with automation is used for
    the fulfillment of “Automatic disease detection to monitor the plant health for
    various plants leaf using image processing techniques and TensorFlow algorithm.”
    1.1 Literature Review The apple leaf disease affects the yields of apples; they
    show a detecting process in real time and a deep learning approach on CNN detection
    of leaves of brown spots, gray spots, and mosaics [1]. In this paper, they have
    discussed and used the technology of bacteria foraging algorithm, image segmentation,
    and neural network. The image processing is done for processing of leaf images
    by using methods like soft computing and conventional method [2]. The arbuscular
    mycorrhizal fungus on growth and development of blast resistance is used and examined
    all rice types which were sensitive root colonization by AM fungus [3]. This paper
    shows plant detection of disease in real time that is affected using a convolutional
    neural network for appropriate fertilizers spread on the damaged portion of plants.
    For improving the accuracy of the system, they have used a TensorFlow framework;
    the accuracy is increased by up to 95%. The remaining area infected by diseases
    is calculated by k-means algorithm [3]. In this paper, they show the detection
    of diseases that affect various plants by using image processing techniques. As
    commonly we know farmers spray pesticides on the plants but also affect humans
    directly and indirectly through health issues or any other [4]. This paper uses
    the technology of ML and processing of image to allow the viral disease from the
    snaps of leaf, and this method identifies the injury of potato leaf disease. Their
    segmentation approaches the utilization by using multiclass SVM [5]. The algorithm
    has used deep learning network for detection of tobacco plants in photos captured
    by using unmanned aerial vehicles. This algorithm has three stages the primary
    stage with morphological and watershed segmentation, the second is convolutional
    neural network is assembled and train with tobacco plant region and the third
    part is post-processing are performed to discard the non-tobacco plant [6]. This
    paper uses forest in identifying plant disease between healthy and disease plants
    for extracting the features of the image. This is used by using the trained dataset
    to detect the virus by using ML technology [7]. They have used a data augmentation
    technique that has been used to do the deviation of the leaf photos in dataset.
    As they have also used the CNN model for image classification, the accuracy is
    98.56% [8]. This paper shows about image detector and the resource-constrained
    using a convolutional network implemented in a low-cost, platform to perform the
    types of plant infection [9]. In this paper, they discussed current trends and
    challenges for plant leaf disease using deep learning method using a k-means clustering
    algorithm [10]. This paper shows the present surveys on current techniques and
    prediction models for the validation and diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases based
    on image processing and the IoT for the verification and various types of tomato
    plant diseases [7]. They show leaf diseases that can be effectively used to detect
    the leaves of plants but the unhealthy plants that we get are unbalanced that’s
    why it is difficult to detect the diseases from the unhealthy plant''s dataset
    for solving this they have used double GAN to generate higher-resolution pictures
    of unhealthy plants leaf using samples [11]. 2 Methodology First of all, the robot
    system will start activating and it will move into the farm for taking photos;
    it will check the height of plants; if it''s too low, then the mechanism will
    spray the fertilizers for the proper growth of plants; if the height is proper,
    then it will again go for taking photos for detection of insects on plants; if
    any parasitic detected, then it will spray pesticides on the affected portion
    of plants and send alert message to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Flowchart for
    prototype device Full size image Algorithm Used for Plants Disease Detection:
    TensorFlow: It is a library of Python language used for rapid arithmetic calculations,
    and it can also create models of hierarchical learning exactly. This model detects
    leaf spot diseases and also predicts healthy leaves. The TensorFlow algorithm
    also uses a neural network for training the image classification model. The TensorFlow
    should be run on single central processing unit as well as on graphic processing
    unit and mobile devices. The used dataset is used in training and testing of dataset
    1000 from that 700 images of plants are used for training and remaining 300 images
    are uses for testing. The dataset is identified across the model for the procedure
    of building to escape overfitting. The tested dataset is independent for the training
    set. The test dataset is used to identify the performance of model or accuracy
    of model, and the images of plants classify leaves based on the below parts: Healthful
    part: In this case, the plants’ leaves are healthy and show no symptoms of bacteria
    or infections of any kind (change in color, of leaves, etc.) Bacteria part: In
    this, the bacterial spots are identified, and therefore, the system gives alert
    message to farmer. Viral part: In this case, the color of leaves gets changed
    due to DNA virus that’s why it changes the color. Late Blight part: In this part,
    the harmful plants infection especially affects rice. 2.1 Block Diagram Figure
    2 shows systematic diagram for the observation of farms as the Esp32 module is
    used to collect all data from sensors like LDR. Various sensors are used in the
    farm like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and gas sensor. As temperature
    sensor is useful while growing the crops which needs wet and dry climatic conditions,
    the temperature sensor measures the presence of heat energy of the soil and also
    determines whether it is good for plants growth. If the temperature rises high
    in the farm, then it causes erosion to the cultivation of yields. If temperature
    is too low on the farm, then it decreases the plant''s enzymes and it causes to
    stunt growth or may cause it to die. The humidity sensor is used for controlling
    and monitoring [12] the humidity as well as the air temperature of the farm. As
    if humidity arises high, then plants get to die and crops get fail. If it arises
    low, then the growth of plants takes more time for the growth and smaller leaves
    get to drop off and the quality of plants is not so good. The moisture sensor
    is used for the capacity of water level of soil and also for good irrigation management
    which gives better crops and increases the profit of the farmer as well as the
    land; if the moisture level is too low in the farm, then plants may not mature
    and they may die. So for the betterment of crops and plants, normally 21–40% of
    moisture level is required. The gas sensor is used on the farm for how much amount
    of gas is present in the farm and environment or if anyone tries to spread petroleum
    in the farm at that time this sensor senses it and gives an alert message to the
    farmer; due to this, our farm can be saved due to unwanted gas spread. The DC
    motor is used in the farm as it plays a necessary part in the farm for scanning
    plants vertically and horizontally for the detection and monitoring of the plant''s
    health if the disease gets detected the LCD will display all the desired conditions.
    And servomotor is used for spraying the pesticides on the affected portion of
    the plant this mechanism is inserted in the robot if any insect is detected, then
    the mechanism will start and spray the pesticides. The water pump is used if the
    moisture of the soil gets low, then water pump will start by triggering the relay.
    If moisture level is too high, then off the water pump. Thus, all the data will
    be sent to on new technology of Blynk cloud to show the data in real time and
    a power supply is provided to all the sensors for proper working and giving the
    results. As in greenhouse automation [13], they used the old Blynk technology
    for controlling the greenhouse system including soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of observing farmland Full size image 3 Design
    Implementation The working implementation consists of various parts, processing
    which is defined below: A. Collection of Dataset The analysis depends on the detection
    of affected leaf; [14] I have collected a dataset from an agricultural institution.
    This dataset has images of various disease-affected plants [15] . I organized
    to collect pictures of various types of infection indication. They are apple black
    dots, grape spot, maize gray dots, tomato mosaic virus, and peach bacterial spot
    [16]. One of the most frequent diseases is in apple plants which may be increased
    by fungi. Podosphaera leucotricha is the black spot as its name shows with black
    spots seen on the surface of the leaves. Grape leaf spot shows about fungus Phomopsis
    viticola, and maximal is determined the most critical disease of grapes [17].
    Gray spot on corn results on top side. Yellow spots are viewed on another side
    of white disease wrapping the inner part of a leaf. Tomato mosaic virus is mostly
    known as plant pathogenic [18]. The number of images collected from diseases is
    shown in the table (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Fig. 3 Table on plants diseases Full size

    Scope It is used in the animal shed for monitoring domestic animals. It will help
    the farmers to do work in any season and conditions [20, 21] . It reduces the
    time consumed in spraying the pesticides [22]. It works very effectively, and
    it will reduce the danger to farmers [23] from different breathing and physical
    problems. This model is used for the detection of various types of plants disease
    [24]. This system is used for multiple types of plants health and disease. 5 Conclusion
    The agriculture field needs automation in large amounts to make the human work
    easy, [25] and the agriculture [26] hanging robot [27] has been designed for monitoring
    the farm weather (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and also plants health;
    thus, system will go detection of insects [28] if any found the system will spray
    pesticides only on the affected portion of plants. By using this technology, there
    will be less time consumed and I can protect the farm as well as plants from unwanted
    pesticides. This proposed model is designed for the detection and quality of leaves
    by using different types of sensors like temperature, humidity, gas sensor, and
    soil moisture sensor. The purpose device is used whether the device is healthy
    or diseased. 6 Software Testing See Figs. 6, 7, and 8. Fig. 6 Monitoring the farm
    by using Blynk cloud Full size image Fig. 7 Blynk app results in real time Full

    7 Hardware Testing Figure 9 shows the output results of the farm on LCD as ESP32
    is the controller module of IoT as to help the farmers and send the data on cloud.
    In this project, I have used various sensors like DHT11, gas sensor also soil
    moisture; apart from these, I have also used water pumps for the proper nourishment
    of crops health. Although these all sensors have been used for monitoring, the
    farm and sensors give values on LCD in real-time mode [29, 30] . Thus, the proposed
    system also gives suggestion to the farmers for the betterment of farm and how
    to get rid of plants diseases by applying the appropriate amount of fertilizers
    and pesticides. Fig. 9 Output results of the farm on LCD Full size image References

    profit from advanced technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) has just started
    to play a big role in daily life, giving us more ways to sense our surroundings
    and letting us change them. IoT is used both to figure out field conditions and
    to manage them, especially in the agro-industrial and environmental fields [1]
    Additionally, it can tell the customer about the origins and characteristics of
    the product. It may be used to assess field factors including soil quality, weather,
    and animal or plant biomass [2]. It can also be used to keep an eye on and control
    things like temperature, humidity, vibrations, and shocks while a product is being
    shipped. WSN may also be used to track and manage variables that affect crop output
    and growth [3]. They may also be used to manage machinery, find the best solution
    for a certain situation, find the best time to harvest, and more. In this study,
    we concentrate on information on soil moisture, humidity, and temperature in agricultural
    fields. We need a place to store the data, a way to get information out of the
    data over time, a way to connect with the user, and a way to water the plants.
    A database structure will be created to make decisions about the autonomous irrigation
    of plants [4]. Techniques for collecting, analyzing, and controlling data in real
    time improve operational efficiency, increase productivity, and reduce water waste
    [5]. This research highlighted the usage of the Internet of Things for smart farming
    and how different sensors can be used to make automated irrigation systems. An
    automated smart irrigation system was developed. 2 Literature Review A smart gadget
    developed by [6] can measure the temperature, pH, and moisture content of the
    soil in diverse places. An ANN model is then used to examine this data. The automated
    irrigation system developed by [7] was an attempt to develop an effective technique
    for producing agricultural crop operations [8]. A working model of an automated
    sprinkler system has been developed using an Arduino Microcontroller for monitoring
    soil moisture and relative humidity. Current issues and the implementation of
    Smart Agriculture Systems Based on the Internet of Things are discussed [9]. Madhav
    et al. [10] has investigated the machine learning technique and IoT in agriculture.
    These aid in gathering data for farmer management systems. While [11] has concentrated
    on estimating production measures for vegetable crops employing a fuzzy-logic
    control system, Upadhya et al. [12] has evaluated the development of smart IoT
    devices for agriculture applications. The output parameters are the precise crop-yielding
    values, while the input variables are humidity, temperature, and soil moisture.
    For the purpose of identifying undesirable plants on crops, Dasgupta et al. [13]
    has conducted research on a mix of IoT devices, WSN, and AI algorithms. Deep learning
    techniques and a drone have been used to capture data. The notion of an intelligent
    irrigation system was developed by [14] who concentrated on an IoT-based irrigation
    system for monitoring the rice crop field using various sensors. IoT-enabled smart
    drip irrigation system’s experimental performance employing web-based apps by
    [15]. Design and execution of a portable watering system that is solar-powered
    and IoT-enabled [16] Design and execution of a portable watering system that is
    solar-powered and IoT-enabled. Design and implementation of an IoT-based wastewater
    irrigation system [17]. This low-cost platform may assist manufacturers, governments,
    and farmers in forecasting environmental data over geographically expansive farm
    field, which improves crop yield and farm man—agreement in a timely and affordable
    way. The unique integration of IoT sensors with the drone in the obtained experimental
    findings implies that automatic and human-made sets of actions may be implemented
    and/or proposed. These smart efforts support precision agriculture, which significantly
    boosts agricultural output and preserves natural resources [18]. A framework for
    tracking and monitoring smart crops is presented in this research. Big data analytics,
    mobile apps, Internet of Things cameras, and sensors are all addressed. An Arduino
    Uno, a number of sensors, and a Wi-Fi module make up the hardware. As a result
    of this approach, the least amount of agricultural waste is produced while utilizing
    energy most efficiently. This article suggests a framework for agricultural disease
    identification. SVM classification is used for this. On the basis of previously
    existing soil data for a specific site, it recognizes disease in crops and recommends
    relevant pesticides [19]. The main objective of this research is to suggest a
    method for autonomously irrigating farms employing sensors that measure soil moisture
    in agricultural fields. Using buzzers and passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors,
    farmland may be secured to prevent animal encroachment. For crop health monitoring,
    a Raspberry Pi camera is employed [20]. In this study, a smart irrigation control
    system is installed using a customized Internet of Things (IoT) system for monitoring
    agricultural areas and properly utilizing water resources. Sensors are positioned
    in the agricultural field where the crop is cultivated in order to sense several
    characteristics, including soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and rainfall.
    A cloud infrastructure is used to store sensed data. Using a mobile application,
    it is possible to manually switch the motor pump between the ON and OFF states
    from a distance [3]. In order to estimate irrigation system water requirements
    and achieve sustainability, this work blends IoT, machine learning, and transfer
    learning methodologies. The key conclusion of this research is that it decreased
    water use and transferred prediction model characteristics in exchange for more
    accurate forecasting and analysis. IoT sensor devices gather fundamental data,
    including wetness, temperature, and humidity. With the help of meteorological
    and historical data, the total amount required for overall cultivation was projected
    and estimated in the short and long terms [21]. The study discusses smart agricultural
    and irrigation systems based on IOT. This paper’s main goal is to automate the
    watering of plants. This research enables us to understand the values of many
    factors for plants, such as humidity, moisture, and temperature, and to water
    them appropriately. Three sensors make up the system, which measures the humidity,
    wetness, and temperature of plants. The motor automatically turns on the water
    for plants if any of the variables drop. The tomato plant was success fully grown
    on the paper using an automated procedure. We were able to have a healthy farming
    operation because of this practice and the Internet of Things [22]. This review
    explores case studies on climate monitoring, greenhouse automation, crop management,
    cattle monitoring, and smart farming using IoT devices, highlighting the benefits
    of these techniques in agriculture over pre-existing tools [23]. The goal of this
    work was to examine existing information about the volumetric soil water content
    (VSWC) concept and electromagnetic sensor monitoring for irrigation control. In
    the context of the Internet of Things, capacitance, impedance, and the more dependable
    TDR sensors are examined for aiding automated irrigation [24]. 3 IOT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture The work that has already been done on smart sensors for
    agriculture applications is discussed in this section. The uses of sensors in
    animal husbandry, soil, irrigation, crop disease, and harvesting are then covered
    [25]. IoT applications in smart agriculture are discussed below (see Fig. 1).

    3.1 Soil Health Monitoring An important factor in increasing agricultural product
    production is soil health. Monitoring the health of soil with sensors has made
    the analysis of soil composition more effective and efficient. It results in raising
    the standard of agricultural items, increasing the farmers’ financial rewards
    [26]. Smart sensors are most useful in agriculture for estimating soil moisture,
    nitrate and phosphate levels, and soil compaction, making a way to recommend fertilizers,
    measuring capsaicin levels, sorting land, and figuring out soil fertility. Soil
    health monitoring impacts nutrient concentration, affecting agricultural product
    production and quality [27]. Therefore, estimating these nutrients in advance
    and keeping track of them is beneficial for improving quality and cost-effectiveness.
    Smart devices with a variety of sensors allow for the monitoring of nitrate, phosphate,
    capsaicin, etc. concentrations. The farmers’ smartphones receive alarm texts.
    The amount of ploughing required on an agricultural field is determined by the
    assessment of soil compaction prior to ploughing [28]. 3.2 Automated Irrigation
    System Controlling the water flow in an agricultural region is simple with the
    help of a smart irrigation system. IoT is used to set up when water will be delivered
    and to get real-time information about the farm. The smart irrigation system may
    be used for a variety of tasks, such as climate-driven irrigation, water management,
    leak detection, and water level monitoring [29, 30]. Both the moisture content
    and the water level are monitored by the sensors. It makes sure there is enough
    water available for crops to flourish properly. Here, the water pump controller
    receives the sensor data from several sensors in order to automatically take the
    necessary action [31]. Because of this, the water pump works better when irrigation
    activities are planned well. By measuring the difference in pressure between two
    pipe connections, leaks in irrigation systems can be found. Pressure sensors are
    installed at each pipe junction to conduct leakage detection. If the pressure
    is low at any joint, it means that leakage happened before that joint. 3.3 Pest
    and Disease Detection Crop leaves in agricultural fields are an easy target for
    parasite and disease assaults. In traditional farming methods, it is not recommended
    that the farmer look at each plant in the field because it is often wrong and
    takes a long time. Smart agriculture offers a low-cost method of spotting illnesses
    in plant leaves [32]. The smart sensors for agriculture can be used to monitor
    leaf diseases in a number of ways, such as finding tomato leaf curl, parasite
    damage to leaves, and diseases in bananas based on their leaves. IoT-based real-time
    leaf monitoring enables the early detection of illnesses that impede plant development.
    The images from the many sensors that have been put in the agricultural area are
    looked at by the web server, which then sends alarms to the farmers. A sensor
    network was used to identify paddy and banana plant diseases earlier [33]. 3.4
    Crop Production Tracking Increased productivity and financial rewards for farmers
    are the main objectives of farming. Smart sensors aided in increasing agricultural
    output by facilitating efficient management and multi-point sensor monitoring
    [34]. For example, smart sensors can be used to find early crops, figure out how
    much fertilizer to use, tell when a plant is stressed, classify crop diseases,
    and build greenhouses that work well. The quality of the crop yield is greatly
    affected by how well you guess when to harvest. Crops are prematurely harvested,
    which results in lower-quality produce. So, using IoT to estimate when the harvest
    will happen can help farmers increase the amount of food they grow. Next, employing
    sensors to determine the precise needs for fertilizers and fertilizer results
    in a considerable improvement in product quality [35]. A number of temperature
    sensors have been put in the greenhouse to help control and keep an eye on the
    temperature. The way IoT-enabled greenhouses are built makes sure that the right
    conditions are always there for plants to grow in a healthy way. 3.5 Post Harvesting
    Events After the successful harvesting of agricultural goods, the main issue is
    the successful distribution of such items to consumers at the highest quality.
    Smart sensors for agriculture facilitate post-harvest operations by offering reasonably
    priced options for the monitoring of the storage and transit of agricultural products
    in real time [36]. It can be used for smart grain storage, smart inventory control,
    smart agricultural transportation, and smart agricultural product preservation.
    Two important factors—namely, “how to store?”—play a key role in the storage of
    agricultural commodities. Where should it be stored? Harvested grain sacks have
    passive sensors that monitor humidity and temperature. Temperature, humidity,
    and cleanliness data are provided in real time by the various sensors positioned
    within the inventory [37]. 3.6 Smart Animal Husbandry Agriculture is not possible
    without animal husbandry. In the last few years, there has been a big rise in
    the use of sensors in smart animal husbandry. Numerous advantages of smart animal
    husbandry include real-time animal activity monitoring, early illness identification,
    movement detection while grazing, etc. [38]. Farmers can benefit from different
    animal husbandry apps, such as those that let them keep an eye on pigs, beehives,
    sheep, and chicken farms. Smart sensors offer real-time in-dairy cow monitoring.
    By improving the cows’ constant assessment and real-time tracking, milk production
    can be more stable. In order to improve the quality of the honey supply, the farmers
    use sensors to keep track of the temperature, humidity, and other biological factors
    in the beehives. In a similar way, the radio collar’s sensors and GPS may help
    figure out how the sheep moves and where it is. Next, sensors are attached to
    the saddle and the rider’s clothing to track the horse’s gaits. Multiple sensors
    installed in the chicken farm also keep an eye on the environmental conditions
    inside [35, 39]. Early disease detection and real-time activity monitoring are
    made possible by monitoring pigs using cameras and radio collars systems. The
    outside temperature is monitored by the sensors that were installed in the animal
    shelter. The choice to graze outside is made based on the temperature threshold
    [40]. 4 Proposed System The Arduino UNO microcontroller is used to develop the
    smart irrigation system, which is an important part of this automated system.
    The microprocessor is connected to sensors such as soil moisture sensors, water
    level sensors, temperature sensors, and rain detection sensors. As a result, the
    Arduino UNO receives the output of these sensors. When such sensors send a signal,
    the microcontroller responds with the expected outcomes, turning on the relay
    in accordance with the soil sensor and rain and temperature sensor conditions
    and operating the water motor. A soil moisture sensor collects a reading of the
    soil’s moisture content and communicates it as voltage (analog signals). The necessary
    hardware and software are listed in Table 1. The output voltage is then compared
    with the standard voltage. The pump turns on and the agricultural area is automatically
    irrigated by the signal that is transmitted by the relay if the voltage used as
    the reference voltage is greater than the soil condition defined by the voltage.
    The pump stays in the OFF status and the relay does not activate in vice versa
    condition. The microcontroller receives an analog signal from the soil moisture
    sensor, which is transformed into a digital signal. The relay circuit receives
    the signal after the program has already been completed in the microcontroller.
    The motor is switched ON or OFF in accordance with the signal sent to the relay
    circuit. When the temperature drops, the soil gets moist, the voltage rises beyond
    the reference voltage, and a low signal (“logic 0”) is sent to the microcontroller,
    which turns off the motor and causes it to stop pumping water. The comparator,
    which is housed inside the sensor, provides the voltage. There will be conductivity
    in the field when the sensor is positioned there. Since water is an excellent
    conductor of electricity, good conduction indicates the presence of moisture.
    The signal is then transmitted, and the required signals switch the motor OFF.
    And when there is no conduction, it shows that there is no water present; as a
    result, the Arduino generates the appropriate signals to switch on the motor.
    The relay switch closes, the motor is attached to the circuit, and the water is
    pumped to the plants as soon as the control signal to turn on the motor is transmitted.
    Similar to this, if the control signal instructs the motor to be switched OFF,
    the relay switch is opened, cutting off power to the motor, which causes it to
    be turned OFF. As a result, the plants receive the water they require when they
    do, thanks to the Arduino software that has been programmed into its memory. Here,
    regular observation is not necessary. A block diagram of an automated regulated
    watering system is shown in (Fig. 2). Table 1 List of material required Full size
    table Fig. 2 System block diagram Full size image The design of the hardware and
    the basic structure of the system are both covered in the implementation. The
    basic construction is completed using a sprinkler irrigation system developed
    from parts such as a water pump, water tank, main pipelines, capacitive sensor,
    DHT-11 sensor for tracking air temperature and air humidity, LCD display to show
    the data, buzzer, and sprinklers. Numerous bulk irrigation control devices are
    constructed on a breadboard that is attached to an Arduino Uno board as the hardware
    implementation. These irrigation management devices are responsible for data collection
    and transmission to the system. The sensor information gathered is utilized to
    manage the irrigation system and keep an eye on the state of the crops. 4.1 System
    Implementation The Arduino IDE software contains programs that enable data reading
    from the transmitter and data transmission from an Arduino Uno to a system. The
    system’s prototype is displayed below (see Fig. 3). Table 2 displays the results
    from various times of the day from all sensors’ testing. Figure 4 explains the
    working flow of the proposed system. If the soil moisture is below 40%, the water
    motor turns on, and the relay enters an active state when it transmits the high
    signal to the relay. The red and green LED lights indicate their active state.
    If soil moisture is above 40% and in between 100%, the relay remains off as it
    receives the LOW signal from the relay, and only the single red LED light on the
    relay indicates its off state. Data samples from both wet and dry soil are collected
    to test the soil moisture by using a capacitive soil moisture sensor type v1.2
    to validate the result and test the relay. The values obtained for dry soil conditions
    are below the soil moisture required values, and the values obtained for wet soil
    conditions are above the soil moisture required values. The results show that
    the range of dry soil moisture values is between 40 and 0%, while the range of
    wet soil moisture values is between 80 and 100%. As result shown in Table 2, the
    rain sensor is used to indicate a rainy state. If it is raining, then it will
    indicate a rainy state; otherwise, it will not rain. The tank has a water level
    indicator installed to display the water level. If the water trough is full, it
    will show on the system. If the water trough is empty, it will show empty on the
    system screen. Since temperature and humidity are key factors in the growth of
    crops, the DHT11 sensor is used to measure air temperature and humidity. Data
    from soil moisture sensors and DHt11 sensors is displayed on an LCD display screen
    for a quick review of the data. Fig. 3 Prototype of smart irrigation system Full
    size image Table 2 Experimental result Full size table Fig. 4 Main flowchart of
    the proposed system Full size image Working Steps Working process of proposed
    system is explained below. 1 The moment the power supply is turned on, the system
    starts. 2 The Arduino is linked to the LCD display in order to make sure that
    sensor data gets displayed on the LCD panel correctly. 3 The soil moisture sensor,
    which measures the soil moisture content, sets a maximum threshold of 100% and
    a minimum level of 0%. The engine will pump water to the crops if the soil moisture
    content falls below 40%. 4 The agricultural field’s outside temperature is determined
    by the temperature sensor. 5 A rain sensor ensures that the motor is shut off
    when it starts to rain in order to save power. 6 Additionally, the user will receive
    all of the data acquired by sensors automatically. 5 Result and Discussion Agriculture
    has challenges with water management and irrigation since water supplies are depleting
    quickly and 60% of irrigation water is lost. In this study, a comprehensive irrigation
    system based on automated controls and wireless sensor networks was developed
    on a low budget. The primary goal of this research is to build smart control systems
    and automated irrigation systems at the local level. The system was successfully
    constructed and implemented, and its accuracy was tested; the results met expectations.
    At various temperatures, the rate of water content loss has been measured and
    is shown in Table 2. Because high temperatures might interfere with the irrigation
    plan, this lowered rate makes it easier to forecast when to irrigate next time.
    In these kinds of systems, automated and wireless sensor networks offer notably
    high efficiency. The ESP board and sensor were precise. The system’s soil moisture
    detection nodes are crucial; when water reaches all of them, the system instructs
    the water pump to turn off. This method cuts water waste by up to 70% by carefully
    planning irrigation. Results from experiments are used to generate Table 2. The
    temperature change and its impacts on soil dry rate forecast, irrigation system
    management, and moisture drop rate are shown in the table. The variation in the
    actual temperature is described by the temperature change rate. The relationship
    between a drop in moisture content and a rise in temperature is seen in the table.
    6 Conclusion A smart system for irrigation can potentially be used widely to decrease
    water waste and supply farmers with healthy crops. In our project, a relay that
    regulates this process allows the motor to be automatically turned ON and OFF.
    The water required by the crops is supplied by the motor-attached water tank or
    water storage. This project effectively monitors the water level of the plants.
    When necessary, it gives plants the right amount of water. The plants’ development
    and vitality can be preserved. As farmers are not required to regularly examine
    the irrigation operation, manpower and labor costs are decreased. Water wastage
    has decreased, which has numerous positive economic effects; as a result, this
    project has positive economic effects as well. The best way to prevent water problems
    in agriculture will be through smart irrigation. Sensor-based irrigation is in
    high demand now and will continue to grow in the future. By controlling soil moisture
    levels, it decreases human error and saves time. Precision agricultural farming
    is now feasible because of the advent of sensor-based applications in agriculture,
    which increase production, efficiency, and profitability. In order to further
    the sophistication and effectiveness of future research, field data will be gathered
    and combined with artificial intelligence, big data, and/or neural networks. References

  description: Due to the impact of climate change on agriculture and the emergence
    of water security issues, proper irrigation management has become increasingly
    important to overcome the challenges. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    is being utilized in agriculture for collecting field information and sharing
    it through websites in real time. This study discusses the efforts taken to develop
    an IoT-based sensor station, a user-friendly website, and a smartphone app for
    irrigation management. In addition, the demonstration of the IoT-based sensor
    station and its effectiveness are discussed. Before deploying the sensor station,
    soil moisture sensor calibration was conducted using a laboratory experiment.
    Overall, the calibrated soil moisture sensors met the statistical criteria for
    both sand [root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.01 cm3/cm3, index of agreement (IA)
    = 0.97, and mean bias error (MBE) = 0.01] and loamy sand (RMSE = 0.023 cm3/cm3,
    IA = 0.98, and MBE = −0.02). This article focuses on case studies from corn, blueberry,
    and tomato fields in Michigan, USA. In the corn and blueberry fields, the evaluation
    of irrigation practices of farmer's using an IoT-based sensor technology was considered.
    In the tomato field, a demonstration of automation irrigation was conducted. Overirrigation
    was observed using the IoT-based sensor station in some fields that have sandy
    soil and use a drip irrigation system. In the blueberry demonstration field, the
    total yield per plant (p = 0.025) and 50-berry weights (p = 0.013) were found
    to be higher with the recommended irrigation management than the farmer's existing
    field. In the tomato demonstration field, there were no statistical differences
    in the number of marketable tomatoes (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756)
    between the farmer's existing method and the recommended irrigation strategy.
    However, 30% less water was applied to the recommended irrigation strategy plot.
    Thus, the result showed that the IoT-based sensor irrigation strategy can save
    up to 30% on irrigation while maintaining the same yields and quality of the product.

    of the product. 1 Introduction Irrigation is a crucial practice followed in agriculture
    for centuries and plays a significant role in developing economies worldwide.
    Irrigation is the process of supplying water to the crops using an artificial
    means to provide moisture, which helps in the growth and produces higher yields
    in crops. It is particularly important in regions with low precipitation and limited
    water resources. Irrigation also significantly impacts local rural economies by
    affecting the production of crops, creating jobs, increasing carbon sequestration,
    and boosting economic growth. Climate change poses a threat to agriculture. Erratic
    and unpredictable precipitation patterns, rising global average temperatures,
    and water scarcity can compromise food security (Rosa, 2022). Crop health is affected
    by rainfall trends, such as wetter springs, and drier summers with temperature
    anomalies, such as cold or heat waves (Alam et al., 2021). These flooding and
    drought events, without precision irrigation, can decrease the yield and quality
    of the product. In addition to these precipitation changes, average global temperatures
    are expected to increase by around 2°C each year until the year 2100. Higher temperatures
    lead to alterations in evapotranspiration (ET) and weed growth, affect pollination,
    and decrease photosynthesis rate, source-sink relationship, and crop duration,
    all of which can affect plant health and productivity (Malhi et al., 2021). Precision
    irrigation management practices have the potential to increase water use efficiency
    while minimizing the effects of climate change on farms. Irrigation scheduling
    is a well-established strategy to manage crop water needs throughout the growing
    season. This method involves monitoring the water requirements of crops and determining
    whether the existing soil moisture and any additional water from precipitation
    and irrigation can fulfill them. Irrigation scheduling also considers economic
    and environmental variables. Every day, farmers face the challenge of making decisions
    that balance the cost of applying water (labor and energy) against the goal of
    achieving a high yield, enhanced crop quality, and the efficient use of water
    resources. Several types of irrigation scheduling have been demonstrated in the
    past, including ET-, soil moisture-, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based irrigation
    scheduling (Aguilar et al., 2015; Goap et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Alibabaei
    et al., 2021; Dong, 2023; Kelley et al., 2023). ET-based irrigation scheduling
    is a method of irrigating a crop using daily reference ET, particular crop coefficient
    (Kc) value, and the amount of precipitation. Kc is determined by crop types and
    crop growth stage. This method has been shown to save water by up to 61% compared
    to the conventional irrigation application method (Simić et al., 2023). Soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling utilizes soil moisture sensors to estimate
    soil moisture content in the root zone to ensure optimal moisture levels for crops
    and avoid overirrigation. Typically, soil moisture sensors are installed at multiple
    depths in the root zone to understand the soil moisture levels at different depths
    comprehensively. The changes in soil moisture at different depths help to estimate
    the root growth. Many types of soil moisture sensors are available, including
    tensiometers, capacitance sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, and
    frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors. A tensiometer is a soil water tension
    measuring tool comprised of a porous ceramic cup with a water-filled tube working
    on the capillary action principle, which measures the soil matric potential expressing
    soil water energy. Capacitance sensors measure soil dielectric constants that
    differ for different moisture regimes, which provide real-time data for precise
    irrigation management (Smajstrla and Harrison, 2023). TDR is an approach that
    works on the principles of sending an electromagnetic pulse to the soil, and the
    travel time of the pulse is directly related to the soil moisture content, and
    it provides continuous soil moisture data across different depths, which helps
    in understanding efficient irrigation management (He et al., 2021). In addition
    to these sensors, FDR is another technique based on electromagnetic wave reflections
    that send high-frequency waves to the soil for measuring dielectric properties,
    which determines the soil moisture for precision irrigation management (Choi et
    al., 2016). Previously, this soil moisture sensor-based irrigation scheduling
    helped to save water by up to 60% compared to conventional irrigation methods
    (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005; Grabow et al., 2013; Millán et al., 2019). A study
    conducted by Boltana et al. (2023) showed that the soil moisture sensor-based
    method saved 18% of irrigation water compared to the ET-based method in tomato
    fields (Boltana et al., 2023). Moreover, the sensor-based irrigation method increased
    water use efficiency in soybean and potato fields by 49% and 16%, respectively
    (Wood et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2023). The AI-based irrigation scheduling analyzes
    multiple input data, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, plant canopy temperature, crop type, crop growth stage, and
    yield data, to develop AI logarithms. Machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement
    learning techniques are typically used for developing algorithms. These algorithms
    provide predictive analytics about optimum irrigation volume, time and frequency
    of irrigation, and yield data. These data can be used for the long-term planning
    of water usage based on weather forecasts and provide predictive measures for
    proactive interventions. This AI-based irrigation scheduling has been shown to
    improve the efficiency of water use for irrigation by up to 50% (Mohammad et al.,
    2013; Zia et al., 2021) and save the usage of water by 59% (Jamroen et al., 2020)
    compared to the industry standard method. Of those methods discussed, weather-
    and soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling are the most common methods, as
    they are relatively cheap, more practical, and easier to use. While the weather-based
    irrigation scheduling method uses reference ET and Kc to determine when and how
    much to irrigate, the soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling method utilizes
    actual in-field soil moisture data using sensors to estimate the current soil
    water available and determine the irrigation decision. Soil moisture sensors can
    also be used for monitoring the spatial variation of soil moisture within the
    fields, thus allowing precise irrigation management. Recently, soil moisture sensor
    adoption in agriculture in the United States is only 12% (as of 2020) (Kukal et
    al., 2020). To increase this adoption rate, systems should be more cost-effective
    and easier to use (Dong, 2023). Furthermore, farmers need to be more educated
    on how they work to increase the trust in using them. The cost, difficulty to
    use, and trust are the major challenges for adopting the technology by farmers.
    Therefore, affordable and easy-to-use technology is needed to increase the its
    adoption. In addition, the demonstration of the technology in agricultural fields
    to show the potential use in improving the efficiency of irrigation water use
    is needed. In this study, we propose to develop an affordable and easy-to-use
    sensor monitoring system for farmers to improve irrigation management. We implement
    a low-cost sensor monitoring system (LOCOMOS) to measure soil moisture at multiple
    depths and use the data to provide irrigation recommendations. This article focuses
    on case studies using LOCOMOS in corn, blueberry, and tomato fields. 2 Methodology
    LOCOMOS, which was developed by Michigan State University Irrigation Lab, was
    used in this study. LOCOMOS is an IoT-based sensor monitoring system that measures
    in-field soil and environmental conditions. The collected data were sent to the
    IoT cloud web server, from which irrigation recommendations were provided. 2.1
    An IoT-based sensor monitoring system A LOCOMOS system can continuously measure
    soil moisture levels at multiple depths, leaf wetness duration, air temperature,
    relative humidity, and precipitation. The data were then sent to a LOCOMOS IoT
    website (https://www.locomos1.com) to display the recommended irrigation timing
    and amount, the location of the sensor system, the raw sensor data, and the switch
    to turn irrigation on and off. The dashboard on the LOCOMOS IoT website was updated
    every 15 min, allowing the user to observe and make timely farm management decisions.
    An SD card module was utilized for storing and backing up the sensor data locally.
    LOCOMOS is powered by a 12V 7A battery, a 12V solar panel, and a solar battery
    charging controller. Email and Text message alert systems were set up through
    the IoT website. For example, a user could receive an email and text message when
    the soil water available level is at 50% for growing corn. SoilWatch 10, the soil
    moisture sensors, manufactured by Pino-Tech (Stargard, Poland), were utilized
    for measuring soil moisture levels. SoilWatch 10 is a relatively cheaper sensor
    and has provided reliable soil moisture measurement. PHYTOS 31 Leaf Wetness Sensor,
    manufactured by METER Group (Pullmen, WA, USA), was utilized to record the duration
    of leaf wetness. An SHT30 temperature and humidity sensor, manufactured by Sensirion
    (Chicago, IL, USA), was utilized for measuring the air temperature and relative
    humidity. The accuracy tolerance for air temperature and relative humidity were
    ± 0.3°C and ± 3%, respectively. A rain gauge, manufactured by Davis Instruments
    (Hayward, CA, USA), was utilized for measuring the precipitation. The rain gauge
    measured every 0.02 cm increment. Hunter ICV valves with DC latching solenoids
    were connected to the microcontroller to turn the valve on and off. Figure 1 shows
    a block diagram of the LOCOMOS system. figure 1 Figure 1. A block diagram for
    the LOCOMOS system. The LOCOMOS smartphone application (LOCOMOS APP) is an easy-to-use
    app designed for farmers to manage irrigation for their crops. The LOCOMOS APP
    connects to the LOCOMOS IoT server to visualize the sensor data on the app. Each
    user will be verified using a digital ocean server (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows
    the pages of the LOCOMOS APP. To access the app, existing users can log in using
    their registered email ID and password. New users can sign up using their email
    ID and a unique invitation code, which is provided by the server. Once logged
    in, a list of sensor devices will be displayed. Each device contains its GPS coordinates
    and provides real-time available soil water (%) and maximum recommended irrigation
    amount. In addition, the LOCOMOS APP gathers ET and precipitation information
    from the Michigan State University Enviroweather Network. Users can either push
    the “Use My Location” button or select the closest weather station to their field
    to observe the ET and precipitation data. In addition, the map page allows users
    to visualize the precise locations of all deployed sensors on a map. This bird''s-eye
    view offers a comprehensive overview of users'' farmlands, making it easier to
    identify the location of each sensor. figure 2 Figure 2. An overview of the LOCOMOS

    irrigation amount, (E) Weather information from MSU Enviroweather, and (F) LOCOMOS
    devices on the map. 2.2 Soil moisture sensor calibration The calibration of soil
    moisture sensors to specific soil types was critical as the accuracy could be
    varied. A laboratory experiment was conducted to calibrate the SoilWatch 10 soil
    moisture sensors and evaluate their performances in two soil types. The soil types,
    including sand and loamy sand, were used in this laboratory experiment. Two 144-L
    size polypropylene containers (80 × 41 × 35 cm) were used. The volumetric water
    content (VWC) analysis was performed six times using a 61-cm3 size soil ring during
    this laboratory experiment. Detailed information on the procedure of the sensor
    calibration can be found in Smajstrla et al.''s study (Smajstrla and Harrison,
    2023). 2.3 Soil moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation model The soil
    moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation was estimated using the field
    capacity of soil and current soil moisture content using soil moisture sensors.
    The irrigation recommendation was calculated by finding the difference between
    the field capacity of the soil and the current soil moisture content. This recommendation
    was the maximum amount of irrigation that could be applied without water being
    lost through deep percolation beyond the root zone. The equation of soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation recommendation is shown in Equation (1). An assumption
    was made that the volumetric soil water content for its representative soil layer
    is uniform and has the same moisture level. I R = ( F C L a y e r i -  θ v L a
    y e r i ) * D L a y e r i     ( 1 ) where IR is the maximum irrigation recommendation
    (cm), FCLayeri is the field capacity of the layer i soil depth (cm/cm), DLayeri
    is the representative layer i soil depth (cm), and θvLayeri is the volumetric
    soil water content of the layer i soil depth (cm3/cm3). 2.4 Statistical analysis
    The performance of the soil moisture sensors was evaluated using root mean squared
    error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA), and mean bias error (MBE). RMSE measures
    the difference between sensor values and soil sample values and is defined in
    Equation (2). The index of agreement was proposed by Willmott (1981), as defined
    in Equation (3). MBE is defined in Equation (4). R M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( M i
    - P i ) 2     ( 2 ) I A = 1 - ∑ i = 1 N ( M i - P i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 N ( | P i - M
    ¯ | + | M i - M ¯ | ) 2     ( 3 ) M B E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( P i − M i )     ( 4
    ) where N is the sample size, M is the measured (soil sampling) value, P is the
    predicted (sensor measurement) value, and is the average measured value. The units
    for RMSE and MBE are VWC (cm3/cm3), and IA is dimensionless. A range of IA lies
    between 0 and 1, and a value of 0 indicates no agreement between the measured
    and predicted values. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the observed
    and predicted values. The higher value of IA indicates better agreement between
    observed and predicted values. Hignett and Evett (2008) revealed that the sensor
    measurement accuracy for most agricultural applications needs to be <0.02 cm3/cm3.
    Varble and Chávez (2011) and Dong et al. (2020) reported that the criteria for
    MBE and RMSE were ±0.02 cm3/cm3 and <0.035 cm3/cm3, respectively. Therefore, this
    study evaluated the sensor performance using the following criteria: MBE ± 0.02
    cm3/cm3 and RMSE < 0.035 cm3/cm3. 2.5 LOCOMOS field demonstration—Irrigation practice
    evaluation Once the sensors were calibrated and evaluated, LOCOMOS was deployed
    in irrigated fields in Michigan farmlands to evaluate the existing farmer''s irrigation
    practices. Irrigated corn and blueberry fields were evaluated. The demonstration
    irrigated corn field was located in Manchester, Michigan, USA. A commercial corn
    was cultivated in this field and was irrigated with 20–28 cm of water and 224
    kg/ha of nitrogen was applied. The commercial corn fields were irrigated using
    a center pivot irrigation system. The second demonstration field was located in
    West Olive, Michigan, USA. The field size was approximately 20 acres, and blueberries
    were cultivated in it. These blueberry fields were irrigated using a surface double-drip
    line system. Soil samples were collected to test the soil texture. The physical
    properties of the soils at different depths are shown in Table 1. The soils in
    these fields were mostly sandy soil, such as loamy sand and sandy loam, which
    were the common soil types in irrigated fields in Michigan. Figure 4 shows installed
    LOCOMOS in the irrigated corn and blueberry fields in Michigan, USA. Corn roots
    typically grow up to 90 cm in this demonstration field. Thus, the soil moisture
    sensors were installed at 15, 60, and 90 cm in the irrigated corn field. In the
    irrigated blueberry field, the sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm.
    All data loggers were programmed to record soil moisture measurements every 30
    min. The soil samples were collected three times during this monitoring period.
    These samples were analyzed for texture and volumetric water content. The VWC
    from the soil samples was utilized for testing the accuracy of the sensors. table

    4 Figure 4. LOCOMOS stations installed in an irrigated corn field in Manchester,
    MI, USA (left) and an irrigated blueberry field in West Olive, MI, USA (right).
    2.6 LOCOMOS field demonstration—automation irrigation Automation irrigation using
    LOCOMOS was demonstrated in a tomato field in Hart, Michigan, USA. The 9V DC solenoid
    valves with Hunter''s ICV valves were utilized to control irrigation. Fresh tomatoes
    were cultivated in this field, and plastic mulch was used to maintain the soil
    moisture and keep the weeds out. Figure 5 shows the experimental setup for this
    tomato field. This tomato field is irrigated with a surface single drip line system.
    Two irrigation strategies, namely, the farmer''s existing irrigation management
    and automation irrigation trigger, were evaluated. The farmer''s existing irrigation
    management included 1 h of irrigation per day in June and twice in 1 h of irrigation
    per day in July and August. The automation irrigation trigger method was based
    on the soil moisture sensor data and used Equation (1). Four replications with
    randomized plot designs were utilized for the comparison. The team has collected
    the number of marketable tomatoes and their weights to compare the effectiveness
    of the treatments. Eight plants per replication were considered. Statistic software
    R v4.3.1 was utilized for running a one-way ANOVA. figure 5 Figure 5. Automation
    irrigation demonstration in Hart, MI, USA. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Soil moisture
    sensor calibration The calibration of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensor was
    conducted for sand and loamy sand. Soil temperature during this laboratory experiment
    was kept constant at 22 ± 1°C. The soil moisture sensors were powered at 3.3 V,
    and analog raw counts were used for the calibration. Figure 6 shows the comparison
    of measured VWC and raw count. Based on the curve fitting, Equation (5) was developed.
    The calibration of SoilWatch 10 was based on a wide range of VWC from 0.04 to
    0.4 cm3/cm3. The calibration of the sensor provided confidence in using it for
    field demonstration. VWC  = 2 E - 13 ( R C ) 3 - 4 E - 9 ( R C ) 2 + 4 E - 5 (
    R C ) - 0 . 0677     ( 5 ) where VWC is the volumetric water content (cm3/cm3)
    and RC is the analog raw counts that outputs from the sensor. figure 6 Figure
    6. The calibration curve for SoilWatch 10. 3.2 The performance evaluation of the
    soil moisture sensor The performance of the soil moisture sensor in the sand and
    loamy sand was evaluated. Figures 7, 8 show the comparison of sensors with measured
    VWC using a gravimetric method for sand and loamy sand, respectively. Table 2
    shows the result of the statistical analysis. The MBE values for the soil moisture
    sensor showed that this sensor overestimated VWC by an average of 0.01 cm3/cm3
    in the sand and underestimated it by an average of 0.02 cm3/cm3 in the loamy sand.
    The performance of the soil moisture sensor for sand and loamy sand satisfied
    both MBE and RMSE criteria. The MBE values of the calibrated SoilWatch 10 were
    similar to Campbell Scientific''s CS 616 TDR sensors. The MBE of CS 616 for sand
    and loamy sand were 0.01 and 0.03 cm3/cm3, respectively (Dong et al., 2020). The
    calibrated SoilWatch 10 provided reliable performance in measuring moisture content
    in sand and loamy sand. This confirmed the satisfaction of the calibration process.

    method for loamy sand. table 2 Table 2. A statistical analysis to compare measured
    values to sensor values. 3.3 Demonstration in an irrigated corn field Figure 9
    shows the collected soil moisture sensor data, precipitation, and irrigation.
    Appropriate irrigation should maintain the soil moisture level in the root zone
    at an optimal level and ensure the water does not flow below the root zone to
    save freshwater and energy, reducing nutrient leaching and maximizing return on
    investment. The corn roots in this demonstration field grew up to 90 cm; thus,
    the goal of irrigation management was to moisten only the top 90 cm of soil. During
    the growing season, five events affected increasing soil moisture levels at a
    depth of 90 cm, which means that the water has reached and passed through the
    90 cm depth. In events #1, #3, and #5, soil moisture at a depth of 90 cm increased
    due to continuous and heavy rainfalls. In events #2 and #3, the soil moisture
    level at 90 cm depth was increased due to the combination of rainfall and irrigation.
    The corn farmer in Michigan typically applied irrigation each time between 2.50–3.20
    cm. When heavy rainfall is forecasted, the farmer could reduce the irrigation
    application volume to capture the rainfall within the root zone and minimize the
    potential leaching of water and nutrients below the root zone. In addition, the
    installation of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensors within the root zone and
    right below the root zone helps to evaluate whether the farmer is applying irrigation
    adequately or excessively. These sensor data are helpful in making better-informed
    decisions on when and how much to irrigate. figure 9 Figure 9. The volumetric
    water content at 15, 45, and 90 cm soil depths at an irrigated corn demonstration
    field. 3.4 Demonstration in an irrigated blueberry field In the irrigated blueberry
    field, soil moisture sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm depths. The
    flow rate of the drip emitter was 41 cm/h and was applied for 60 min during each
    application. During this monitoring period, there were no rainfalls. Figure 10
    shows the soil moisture changes from the farmer''s irrigation management practice.
    Proper irrigation for blueberries on this farm should ensure that water does not
    flow below the root zone, which is the top 45 cm of soil depth. Figure 10 indicates
    that the farmer''s existing irrigation management practice provided an adequate
    amount of water to the blueberry root system. However, the overirrigation events
    were observed because of the spike in the soil moisture sensor at both 45 and
    60 cm depths. Thus, it was recommended to reduce the irrigation time from 60 min
    to 40 min. The farmer tested his part of the field to demonstrate the reduced
    and recommended irrigation management practice. Figure 11 shows the soil moisture
    monitoring at the reduced and recommended irrigation plots. The reduced irrigation
    increased the soil moisture levels of the depth up to 30 cm, which is the effective
    water uptake root zone for blueberries grown in sandy soil. Thus, the reduced
    and recommended amount was adequate; however, when the blueberry was at the significant
    growth stage (at first blue fruit) and higher ET, more frequent (three times a
    day) irrigation was suggested, if needed. The soil type in this blueberry field
    is loamy sand. A smaller amount and more frequent application might be needed
    for the fields that have sandy soil. For finer texture soils, irrigating once
    a day with large volume application might be adequate as they have a large water
    holding capacity. figure 10 Figure 10. Soil moisture monitoring at the existing
    blueberry farmer''s irrigation practice at the blue fruit stage. figure 11 Figure
    11. Soil moisture monitoring of adjusted irrigation practice at the blue fruit
    stage. The total yield/plant and 50-berry weights were collected from this demonstration
    field for both the farmer''s existing irrigation method and the reduced/recommended
    irrigation management. The yield per plant for the farmer''s irrigation method
    and the recommended irrigation management were 552 and 722 g, respectively. There
    were statistical differences between the treatments (p = 0.025). 50-berry weights
    for the farmer''s irrigation method and the recommended irrigation management
    were 87.7 and 93.7 g, respectively. There were statistical differences between
    the treatments (p = 0.013). A potential cause of higher yield in the recommended
    irrigation management could be due to proper irrigation application that reduced
    nutrient leaching below the root zone in the sandy soil. An IoT-based irrigation
    management can help save water while maintaining the same blueberry quality and
    yields as the farmer''s typical irrigation management. 3.5 Irrigation automation
    in a tomato field Figure 12 shows the number of tomatoes that are marketable and
    their total weight from each treatment. The figure shows that there were no statistical
    differences among the treatments in the numbers of marketable tomatoes from the
    2022 growing season (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756). Thus, the production
    and quality of tomatoes were similar from all treatments, but the amount of applied
    irrigation was different. The sensor-based irrigation strategy applied a 30% lower
    amount than the farmer''s irrigation scheduling method, which indicates that the
    farmer could improve their irrigation water use efficiency using the sensor technology.
    An IoT-based automation irrigation management using a soil moisture sensor''s
    recommendation can help to save water by 30% while maintaining the same marketable
    yields and quality of tomatoes as the farmer''s typical irrigation management.
    In addition to conserving water, saving energy by pumping less water reduces farm
    energy costs. Moreover, low energy usage contributes to reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions from agriculture. The primary benefit of an automatic irrigation system
    is that it can save farmers'' time and labor costs in operating the irrigation
    system. figure 12 Figure 12. The total number of marketable tomatoes (A) and the
    total weight of marketable tomatoes from each replication (B). T1 is the farmer''s
    typical irrigation management. T2 is an IoT soil moisture sensor-based irrigation
    recommendation. 4 Conclusion Based on the field demonstration, the IoT-based sensor
    technology has proven to improve irrigation water use efficiency by evaluating
    the farmer''s existing irrigation practices and providing recommendations if needed.
    Providing real-time in-field soil moisture sensor data is helpful in making day-to-day
    irrigation management decisions, especially under unpredictable precipitation
    patterns. Minimizing overirrigation can reduce the risk of nutrients leaching
    below the root zone, ultimately protecting groundwater quality. In future studies,
    more on-farm demonstrations are needed to increase technology adoption. In addition,
    a continuation of extension outreach activities to promote making irrigation management
    decisions based on scientific data is needed. Besides irrigation management, this
    IoT sensor technology can be utilized to help other management practices such
    as nutrient, pesticide, insecticide, frost protection, and plant health monitoring
    (heat and water stress). Therefore, continued efforts to explore the application
    of IoT-based sensor technology in agriculture to combat the effect of climate
    change are needed. LOCOMOS utilizes cellular networks to communicate; however,
    cellular reception may be poor in some rural areas. Other communication network
    systems, such as radio, NB-IoT, and Sigfox, should be explored to overcome the
    signal issues. Moreover, the effectiveness of IoT-based technology should also
    be evaluated in other crop types. The usability of the LOCOMOS technology, including
    the installation technique, software interface, data accessibility, and alert
    systems, needs to be improved to make the technology easy to adopt for farmers.
    Additionally, other potential applications of the LOCOMOS platform, such as wind
    speed for spray drift reduction, soil moisture sensors for irrigation management,
    leaf surface temperature measurement for plant heat stress, and carbon dioxide
    measurement for greenhouse gas emission, should be considered in the future. Concerns
    about agricultural water use have been and will continue to grow due to the effect
    of climate change on agriculture. Because water is a limited resource, technologies
    that improve irrigation water use efficiency will play a significant role in increasing
    agricultural water sustainability. Data availability statement The datasets presented

    in both developed and developing countries. By 2050, the world’s population is
    expected to reach 10 billion, requiring a 70% increase in food production. Sustainable
    agriculture principles must be followed to ensure food security for this growing
    population [ 1, 2]. The objectives of sustainable agriculture are to enhance agricultural
    productivity and reduce the negative effects of outdated farming methods on the
    environment. Developing advanced agricultural practices necessitates substantial
    research and development, especially in the field of irrigation, which accounts
    for 70% of the total freshwater resources. Internet of Things (IoT) and machine
    learning (ML) systems can help monitor, control, and plan irrigation for agricultural
    regions, ensuring efficient use of freshwater resources [ 3, 4]. Smart agriculture
    systems utilize IoT and artificial intelligence to collect and transmit autonomous
    data to data centers. Artificial neural networks and clustering evaluate data
    to make informed decisions, improving the efficiency of agricultural systems [
    5, 6]. A range of IoT and ML irrigation systems have been created with the aim
    of monitoring and controlling irrigation systems. An irrigation system prototype
    has been designed that integrates sensors and an energy module at the top of the
    sprinkler [ 7]. Another example connects a soil moisture sensor to the Internet
    to track soil moisture, while a different irrigation system uses ML to assess
    data on air quality, temperature, and humidity to schedule irrigation [ 8]. The
    management of water is extremely important due to its scarcity. As a substantial
    portion of fresh water is needed for irrigation, this influences agriculture as
    well [ 9]. There are many different types of irrigation methods available, such
    as flood irrigation, trickle irrigation, drip irrigation, and spray irrigation
    [ 10]. Irrigation planning involves monitoring agricultural factors such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture. Open-source platforms, such as Arduino UNO, are used
    in irrigation management systems. Efficient management of water resources is crucial
    for increasing yields and meeting future food demand in areas with limited resources
    [ 11]. We can irrigate more areas with the same amount of water if we use a controlled
    irrigation system. In this study, we develop a method for irrigation prediction
    to effectively control intelligent autonomous irrigation. To estimate the amount
    of irrigation required for each crop, the suggested method uses the IoT. We took
    the following four steps: (1) Install the sensors for water, rain, temperature,
    soil moisture, wind, etc. (2) Connecting the sensor set to a data collection system.
    (3) Using an IoT server to transfer data to an application after storing it on
    a ThingSpeak cloud server. (4) Various algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors
    (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), SVM, and logistic regression (LR),
    are used to analyze the data. This automated irrigation method will be extremely
    useful for large-scale irrigation systems. This will both simplify the labor-intensive
    process of irrigation for plants and improve water management. The concept of
    a related study and the proposed automated irrigation system are presented in
    the article. Section 2 presents a state-of-the-art study on ML, precision irrigation,
    automated irrigation systems, and ML algorithms for irrigation prediction, along
    with comparisons with previous research. Section 3 presents the proposed irrigation
    system design. Section 4 displays the results of the system testing and analysis.
    Future work recommendations are provided in Section 5. The conclusions of the
    suggested study are finally summarized in Section 6. 2. Literature Review This
    section covers the contributions of several researchers in the fields of IoT and
    ML for automated irrigation systems for agriculture. In this research, a ML algorithm-based,
    intelligent, adaptable irrigation technique for smart agriculture is presented.
    For the best possible plant development, it uses sensors for temperature, moisture
    content in the soil, and rainfall. A variety of models, including KNN, LR, neural
    networks, SVM, and NB, are utilized to evaluate the data collected using the node-RED
    platform and MongoDB [ 12]. The IoT and cloud-based architecture are used to analyze
    a smart irrigation system in this article. The device detects the humidity and
    moisture content of the soil; ML methods are used to analyze the data. The system
    uses ML algorithms to forecast the ideal amount of fresh water for crop production,
    which results in significant water savings. The agricultural industry is predicted
    to change due to this technology [ 13]. To solve irrigation-related problems,
    the researcher developed a solution that uses ML and the IoT. Pressure, pH, temperature,
    humidity, and other sensor types are included in the hardware. The pH sensor measures
    the pH of the soil and forecasts water requirements. The aim is to develop automated
    irrigation systems and save water for future usage. Improvements in agricultural
    water efficiency and conservation are the objectives of the initiative [ 14].
    In this, a low-cost and intelligent agricultural irrigation system is presented.
    The constructed prototype uses a hardware sensor and a unit to monitor temperature,
    humidity, and water level. To determine whether to turn on or off the motor, the
    study uses a variety of sensors to collect various readings and values. The IoT-based
    automated system uses applications to establish an independent irrigation system.
    It also sends SMS messages to our mobile devices, providing us with remote updates
    on irrigation field details [ 15]. Research has developed a smart irrigation system
    that estimates the depth of crop water (WUD) for tomato planting based on real-time
    soil moisture data. A central irrigation controller was used to collect the data,
    guaranteeing an accurate irrigation depth at every irrigation event. The experiment
    was carried out in a Northern Chinese greenhouse [ 16]. This research suggests
    that instead of using physical sensors in a smart irrigation system, neural networks
    based on long–short-term memory (LSTM) should be used. The system computes transpiration
    in each field by transmitting temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data via
    physical sensors. LM35 is used for temperature, DHT-22 is used for humidity, and
    a bespoke sensor is used for moisture readings. Real-time data were collected.
    The findings indicate that the neural sensor suggested based on deep learning
    has a high degree of accuracy when predicting real-time data, especially those
    related to wetness, temperature, and humidity. This shows that a neural network
    can improve the performance of physical sensors in agricultural settings, increasing
    the dependability of smart irrigation systems [ 17]. In the research, the researcher
    developed a framework that combines IoT with various metrics and methodologies
    to monitor data related to temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. This approach
    offers farmers the ability to analyze data in real-time, allowing them to monitor
    soil moisture, temperature, and automated irrigation systems more efficiently,
    with reduced use of time and energy, and in decision-making analysis specifically
    designed for farmers [ 18]. A method was developed to increase the efficiency
    of irrigation for cotton crops. Researchers have examined a variety of data sets
    to calculate the exact amount of water required for a particular soil combination.
    A mobile application makes the results of analytical research accessible to farmers
    or other users [ 19]. Table 1 illustrates some more previous research on automated
    irrigation systems for smart agriculture. Table 1  Previous research work and
    future recommendations on automated irrigation system. This article focuses on
    research on an autonomous irrigation management system for agricultural fields.
    The system uses a mobile application for data consultation and analysis in real-time,
    as well as a wireless sensor and actuator network. RF produced the best results
    with an accuracy of 84.6% when ML techniques were employed to estimate the optimal
    timing for water administration. An approach is also included in the system to
    figure out how much water is required for field management. Water management technology
    that is both effective and efficient, as shown by the ability of the system to
    save up to 60% of the water used [ 27]. ML and deep learning technologies can
    be used to improve crop yield and manage irrigation in agriculture. These approaches
    exemplify the fast progress of artificial intelligence in the agricultural industry.
    The concept of smart farming encompasses monitoring all agricultural processes,
    predicting diseases, managing agricultural pests, and automated irrigation [ 28].
    The article presents a machine-learning and IoT-based irrigation system that improves
    efficiency. Sensors on a Raspberry Pi measure soil temperature and moisture content
    using the serial peripheral interface protocol. The NB technique is used to train
    a ML model that regulates the irrigation system with an accuracy of 98.33%. A
    prototype project with a water pump and relay is also built to demonstrate the
    precise operation of the system [ 29]. Table 2 illustrates previous research on
    the automated irrigation system for smart agriculture using ML. Table 2  Previous
    research on supervised machine learning models for automated irrigation system.
    3. Proposed Hybrid Irrigation System One of the essential stages in the production
    of agricultural products is irrigation. Agricultural uses account for around 80%
    of the entire water supply, although the amount of water available varies considerably
    from region to region. The adoption of microirrigation technology takes an hour.
    But farmers still adhere to an old irrigation pattern, which causes a huge loss
    of water. Existing sprinkler systems are not suitable for all crops. The height
    of the sprinkler irrigation is 4 feet, so it cannot irrigate crops greater than
    4 feet. In drip and sprinkler irrigation systems, the pipe structure of the system
    spreads throughout the field, making intercultural operations difficult. Binding
    up the system during harvesting and sawing new crops leads to damage to pipes
    as well as to crops and to a highly labor-consuming process. Damage due to rodents
    is more common in fixed-set irrigation systems. The center pivot irrigation system
    and the linear move irrigation system are constructed of heavy pipes and are complex
    structured. They are not suitable for fields of unusual shapes because of their
    high capital and maintenance requirements. Related research and findings are discussed
    in the literature review, and future work recommendations are shown in Table 1.
    To overcome these problems, we proposed a hybrid irrigation system that would
    be able to automatically irrigate different crops from a remote location. The
    objective of the proposed hybrid irrigation system is to overcome the problems
    of existing systems. The suggested smart irrigation architecture is shown in Figure
    1.    Figure 1  Proposed architecture for smart irrigation. This research has
    developed a smart irrigation system that automatically waters crops without human
    involvement. As a center pivot and linear move irrigation system, it also irrigates
    crops with vertical sprinkles, but in a center pivot and linear move irrigation
    system, farmers need heavy machinery, power supply, or human resources to move
    the system in the field to meet the irrigation requirements. The proposed irrigation
    system is a stable and user-friendly model. It is designed in a T shape, which
    is fixed in the field with some distance, and irrigates the field with sprinklers.
    The system uses moisture sensors to measure the moisture content of the soil in
    fields. When the moisture levels drop below the minimum level, the NodeMCU board
    activates the water pump, providing water to the crop. The water sensor also monitors
    the conditions of the water reservoir, sending signals to the NodeMCU when the
    reservoir is empty. Wind speed sensors measure the wind speed on the farm, while
    rain sensors detect the rain status in the field. The data from soil moisture
    sensors are displayed on an LCD screen. Solenoid valves are embedded to control
    water flow in different farms. If soil moisture drops below the threshold value
    for farm field A, the solenoid valves are activated, while the remaining valves
    remain off. This irrigation system helps farmers irrigate their fields with less
    labor and time. The hybrid irrigation system is built with the ability to automatically
    irrigate crops, considering factors such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture. Taxonomy is used to consider the choice of climatic and soil
    conditions, while our sensor network keeps track of factors, such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture. In contrast to the three levels of conventional IoT
    design (application layer, network layer, and perception layer), our proposed
    IoT architecture comprises four layers: application layer, processing layer, transport
    layer, and perception layer. Sensors are included in the physical layer, often
    referred to as the perception layer, to collect data such as soil moisture level,
    air humidity and temperature, rainfall level and wind speed. Using networks like
    Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, and LAN, sensing data that has already been acquired is sent from
    the transport layer to the processing layer. The transport layer sends massive
    amounts of data to the processing layer, which stores, analyzes, and processes
    it. It uses modern tools, such as cloud servers and the IoT. The main goal of
    the application layer is to provide user-specific application services. Our system
    manages the sensors, GSM module, ThingSpeak cloud server, IoT server, Android
    application (Blynk application), and other components. We have been able to prepare
    our system for complete autonomy thanks to these technologies. 3.1. Architecture
    of the Proposed System and Working Principals This research developed a method
    for automatic watering by measuring ground moisture values. This smart irrigation
    system allows farmers to control and adjust irrigation with fewer human resources.
    Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the hybrid irrigation system.    Figure 2  System
    block diagram. The NodeMCU is an open-source platform that utilizes the ESP8266
    to facilitate the connection of devices and enable the transmission of data via
    the Wi-Fi protocol. Different types of sensors are used to control the irrigation
    system and monitor the field. Sensors such as soil moisture sensor, wind sensor,
    water level sensor, rain detection sensor, temperature, and humidity sensor, etc.,
    node MCU 8266 is used in this prototype as main board. A soil moisture sensor
    is used to measure soil moisture content in the field. The required soil moisture
    threshold value is described, and if soil moisture exceeds or decreases from the
    threshold value, the soil moisture sensor will send the current soil moisture
    value to the server through the node MCU. The updated current soil moisture value
    is sent to the application, and the farmer can start irrigation according to the
    minimum water requirements of the crops from a remote location automatically.
    Water sensor is utilized to monitor the water status at the dam. If the water
    dam is empty, then it will send the empty signals to the application, and at the
    same time, a buzzer is used to indicate an empty water dam if someone is around
    the field to shut down the motor manual. A wind speed sensor is used to measure
    the wind speed. Wind speed plays an important role in sprinkler water, so if wind
    speed is high, the farmer can turn off the motor to reduce water waste. Solenoid
    valves control water flow on different farms. If soil moisture decreases below
    the threshold value for a farm field, solenoid valves activate for that farm,
    while the remaining valves remain off for other farms. An LCD screen is used to
    display soil moisture from all fields for quick review of soil moisture at field
    level. This innovative approach benefits farmers who struggle to irrigate crops.
    After the sensors were attached to the board, we started programing the board
    to control the sensors in a way that made it possible for different types of data
    to be collected and transferred in real-time. Then, we utilized the ThingSpeak
    cloud server to ensure data storage, and we used the application to monitor and
    operate the irrigation system. We then aggregated several months of data so that
    we could train it to anticipate when to start or stop pumping and close the valve.
    3.2. System Working Flowchart The flowchart of the proposed system provides the
    basic principles of the system and an overview, as shown in Figure 3.    Figure
    3  Working flowchart system. The working steps are as follows: (1) In Step 2,
    the system analyzes the sensor data. (2) In Step 3, the node MCU esp8266 may be
    used to initialize the system. (3) Step 4: The server/application gets information
    from numerous sensors deployed in the agricultural field, including the soil moisture
    sensor, wind sensor, humidity sensor, rain sensor, and water level sensor. (4)
    In Step 5, the soil moisture sensor continuously measures the soil moisture content.
    If the soil moisture is below the required threshold level, the signals are sent
    to the application and the node MCU. The solenoid valves attached to that soil
    moisture sensor will turn on when the update is transmitted to the node MCU, but
    the solenoid valves connected to other sensors will stay optimal. (5) In Step
    6, the motor that is attached to the relay will be turned on either through the
    application or manually. (6) In Step 7, when the amount of soil moisture reaches
    the required threshold level, the relay will automatically turn the motor off
    and the solenoid valves off. (7) In Step 8, the other sensors continuously read
    the data and transmit it to the server or application. For example, a water level
    sensor monitors the water level in the dam; if the dam is empty, the application
    is updated with an empty status, and the buzzer starts beeping. The wind speed
    sensor and the temperature sensor continuously monitor the wind speed and temperature
    of the field because both factors play an important role in irrigation. High temperatures
    and wind speeds cause water loss during irrigation. By monitoring the field, irrigation
    can be scheduled according to temperature and wind speed. (8) In Step 9, once
    Steps 7 and 8 have been completed, the system will go to Step 2. (9) In Step 10,
    the system reads the data from the field and transmits it to the application.
    This operation will continue until the system’s input power is turned off. 3.3.
    Hybrid Irrigation System Design 3.3.1. Hardware Implementation To develop the
    hybrid irrigation system, few steps are performed: Hybrid irrigation model structure
    is shown in Figure 4.    Figure 4  Hybrid irrigation model structure. (1) The
    material is cut into the desired length dimension of the structure is 1.2 into
    0.17 into 0.4 m. (2) The project structure is designed in upside down U-shape
    structure and T-shape hybrid irrigation system. (3) Eight millimeters water pipe
    is used as a main supply pipe. Six millimeters water pipe is used for subpipeline
    for supply the water to field. (4) T and L shape pipe connectors are used to connect
    the subpipe with main pipes and solenoid valves. 3.3.2. Software Implementation
    As mentioned previously, the NodeMCU requires a supply voltage of 5 V DC to operate
    the circuit components. The DHT 11 sensor data pin is connected to the node MCU
    pin D2 and GND and VCC to (ground, 3.3 V), soil moisture sensor connected to the
    A0 pin of the Arduino Uno and connected with the D4 pin of the node MCU, and GND,
    VCC pin connected with the ground pin, 3.3 V, soil moisture sensor b, connected
    to the A1 pin of the Arduino Uno and connected with the D8 pin of the node MCU,
    and GND, VCC pin connected with the pin ground, 3.3 V. The rain detection sensor
    is linked to the node MCU via pin D5. The water sensor is connected to that digital
    pin of node MCU D6 and the buzzer is connected to the digital pin of node MCU
    D7. If the water level is low, the D7 pin gets a signal and the buzzer will beep
    out. LCD display connected with the digital pins of the Arduino Uno RS = 7, EN = 6,
    D4 = 5, D5 = 4, D6 = 3, D7 = 2. Wind speed sensor connected to the analog pin
    of node MCU A0. To connect the water pump motor and the solenoid valves, we will
    need a relay module. Relay 1 will take the signal input value from soil moisture
    sensor 1 and relay 2 will take the signal from soil moisture sensor2. Relay 1
    is connected to the digital pin of Arduino D8 and relay 2 is connected to the
    digital pin of Arduino Uno D9. Relay 1 will control the two solenoid valves, solenoid
    valve 1A and solenoid valve 1B, and relay will control the two solenoid valves
    called solenoid valves 2A and 2B. The motor is connected to the third relay and
    the relay is connected to the digital pin D1 of the node MCU. Transistors and
    resistors are used to regulate the voltage within a range of 3-5 volts to safeguard
    sensors and equipment from excessive voltage fluctuations. For the operation of
    the system, we used 5 volts of DC power for the node MCU and 2 volts of power
    for the Arduino Uno, along with one USB cable to complete the power supply to
    the Arduino Uno. Twelve volt power supply is connected with the solenoid valves
    and motor and with the relays. To establish the communication between hardware
    and the blink application, we need to establish the communication between the
    hardware and the blink application. We need to set the virtual connection between
    the sensors and the blink application. Data from DHT 11 sensors were sent to the
    blynk server using the virtual connection V0, V1, and V2. The rain sensor connected
    to the virtual pin V6 and the water sensor is connected to the virtual pin V7
    soil moisture one connected to the virtual and pin V8 8 and the soil moisture
    sensor 2 connected to the virtual pin V9. Wind speed sensor pin is connected to
    the virtual pin V4 and V5, and the water pump relay is connected with the virtual
    V3 pin to control the water motor. Sensor’s connectivity with node MCU and Arduino
    Uno R3 is represented in Figure 5. Several tools are included in the software
    design method that are necessary for the system to function properly. A few of
    them are as follows:    Figure 5  Sensors connectivity with node MCU and Arduino
    Uno R3. (1) Firmware developed using C/C++ with the Arduino IDE. (2) The ThingSpeak
    cloud server was used to collect and store data for further analysis. (3) Data
    visualization for field control and monitoring is done using the Blynk application.
    (4) Real-time data are collected and sent to the ThingSpeak cloud server after
    the same code is updated to send data to the Blynk application to control and
    monitor sensor data automatically through the application. (5) To simplify the
    access and control of the system, a Wi-Fi or Internet service provider is used.
    (6) For data analysis, Jupiter Notebook and Anaconda are used. 3.3.3. Hybrid Irrigation
    System Working Application An Android application is being developed for farmers
    to monitor and control the hybrid irrigation system. Input parameters such as
    soil moisture, wind speed, rain status, water, temperature, and humidity are displayed
    in an application. The farmer will be able to monitor and control field conditions
    at any time and from anywhere. With the help of this application, the farmer will
    control the motor switch and irrigate the crop according to the requirements and
    availability of water. The mobile application is shown in Figure 6.    Figure
    6  Blynk smart irrigation application. 4. Machine Learning Analysis Algorithms
    This section presents supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze the performance
    of the automated irrigation system. Supervised learning is a method where models
    are trained on a training data set to produce the desired output. This process
    involves acquiring knowledge and improving performance over time. The model’s
    precision is evaluated using a loss function, and adjustments are made until the
    error is reduced. This research utilizes a set of supervised machine learning
    algorithms such as LR, KNN, support vector machine (SVM), NB, and RF classifiers.
    Table 2 presents the results of previous research studies that utilized supervised
    machine learning techniques to analyze a smart irrigation system. The research
    presents a machine learning-based irrigation strategy for smart agriculture using
    sensors like soil humidity, temperature, and rain. The node-RED platform and MongoDB
    collect data, with KNN achieving 98.3% accuracy. A web application visualizes
    and supervises the environment [ 12]. This study examines a smart irrigation system
    that utilizes the IoT and a cloud-based architecture. This technology is developed
    to monitor the moisture and humidity content of the soil and then use several
    machine learning algorithms for analyzing the data in the cloud. Farmers receive
    accurate information on water content requirements. Intelligent irrigation may
    help farmers use less water [ 13]. In this research, we proposed a new irrigation
    model (T-shaped sprinkler irrigation). Different types of sensors are used to
    collect data from the field, like soil moisture sensors, wind sensors, temperature
    sensors, rain sensors, water level sensors, etc. All sensors are connected to
    the node MCU and UNO to control and collect data from the field. Data collected
    from the agriculture field is stored on the ThingsSpeak cloud server. A total
    of 3,000 lines of data are collected for analysis using machine learning algorithms
    to calculate the accuracy of the working automated irrigation system. From the
    collected data, 80% was used for training purposes, and 20% was used for testing
    the algorithms. After collecting the data for analysis, we developed an application
    for monitoring and controlling the irrigation. The algorithms used for the classification
    of automated hybrid irrigation systems are described below. 4.1. Support Vector
    Machine SVM is a machine learning technique that is used for classification and
    regression tasks and is specifically designed to identify objects within given
    data sets. This method effectively divides n-dimensional spaces into various classes,
    making data entry efficient. The research used the kernel trick mechanism of SVMs
    for classification purposes. This technique includes the transformation of 2D
    nonlinear separable data sets into higher dimensions, such as three, four, or
    10 dimensions [ 30]: 4.2. Naïve Bayes Thomas Bayes (1702–1761) developed the Naïve
    Bayesian approach to probabilistic machine learning, which is based on the Bayes
    theorem. The likelihood of A occurring given that B has already happened can be
    used to describe this theorem. Considering X = (x1,…, xn) is the features, and
    Y is the class variable, in this sentence. The NB algorithm is unique in that
    it assumes that each characteristic is independent of the others and that modifying
    one feature will not affect any other. Despite appearing straightforward, NB has
    turned out to be a useful classification system: 4.3. Logistic Regression LR is
    a supervised machine-learning method used for classification tasks. This method
    is used to determine the probability of the dependent variable. The target variable
    has a binary nature, indicating that it may only assume one of two potential classes:
    success (represented by 1 or yes) or failure (represented by 0 or no). The classification
    of this may be categorized into three main types: binary or binomial, multinomial,
    and ordinal. The equation for linear regression may be expressed as the equation
    of a straight line: 4.4. K-Nearest Neighbors The KNN method is a supervised learning
    approach often used in machine learning. The algorithm operates on the assumption
    that there exists a degree of similarity between the newly acquired data and the
    data that are already accessible. When assigning the newly acquired data to the
    category that exhibits the highest degree of similarity with the existing categories,
    the KNN algorithm uses the Manhattan equation to calculate the distance within
    this framework. The formula for the Manhattan distance is shown in Equation (4)
    [ 12]: 4.5. Random Forest Ensemble learning is a powerful teaching strategy. For
    categorization purposes, RF is commonly used. Each decision tree’s planned output
    is represented by the forest’s output, and the categorization is based on the
    information gathered from the many decision trees created during training. Random
    forest decreases variance in the final model, improves performance, and controls
    overfitting by building decision trees using random samples of the training data
    [ 8]. 4.6. Collecting and Storing Data Automated modeling and continuous collection
    of real-time measurements of environmental factors, such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature, humidity, and pump activity, were taken into consideration when developing
    the hybrid smart irrigation system based on the IoT. To perform the analysis,
    the ThingSpeak cloud server is used to collect data from all sensors. We began
    implementing these devices in various environments with various soil conditions
    in the mass collection process using IoT technologies, which are made up of many
    autonomous devices in the form of sensors capable of self-organization and working
    to collect information. It was built to distribute the data using an algorithm
    to provide an essential interface during the project. This was a practically complete
    implementation of our data set. Data collected from different sensors with different
    ranges are discussed below. (1) Soil moisture data: As shown in Table 3, these
    data are generated by an analog sensor over a range of values between 0 and 1,023.
    We can see that the smallest value is 314.51 and the maximum value is 984.82,
    meaning that the average value is 654.5. (2) Temperature data: A DHT11 temperature
    sensor was used to collect air temperature data from the environment in the form
    of Celsius. We can observe that the average temperature throughout the collected
    months was 26.24, exceeding both its upper and lower limitations. The minimum
    value during this time was 18.00, and the highest temperature during this time
    was 38.99. (3) Data on air humidity: We were able to acquire data on air humidity
    using the same temperature sensor that helped with collecting air temperature
    values, and the following is an analysis of those data. The average was 66.4%
    while collecting the massive amount of data, with the lowest value being 38% and
    the highest value being 81.26%. Table 3  Analysis data set. The study suggests
    an automated design based on the peer-to-peer concept, using data that can be
    classified with values that vary from 0 to 1. The final design was implemented
    to show its feasibility and prevent major problems. The data collected from all
    sensors are shown in Table 3. 4.7. Results and Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms
    Any machine learning method, including KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, which are all
    classification dilemma handling algorithms, can forecast the degree of irrigation
    demand. In this paper, all the abovementioned techniques are used to analyze the
    collected data. For experimental analysis, a collection of 3,000 data recordings
    was collected. These factors include soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the water pump for irrigation decision-making. Five machine learning algorithms,
    KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, were utilized in an experimental investigation. Two
    different colors are used to represent the graph. Red colors are used to represent
    0, and blue colors represent 1. To achieve better accuracy and application modeling,
    the data available on soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and motor working
    status are divided into two sets: the training data set and the testing data set.
    The training set contains 80% of the data, and 20% is used for testing and validation.
    The training data set is used to train the different machine learning algorithms,
    and the testing data set is used to test the models, which will help to find the
    accuracy of their workings and the best machine learning algorithm. Figure 7 represents
    the training data and test data in a graphical view.    Figure 7  Graph displays
    training and test data. The real-time collected data from field are stored for
    analysis using different machine learning algorithms. The data collection process
    is done on a ThingSpeak cloud server and published on Mendeley Data [ 37]. Table
    3 shows the data for making training predictions, looking at presorted data, and
    showing outcomes. After analyzing all five machine learning algorithms, the results
    from the models used in this study are shown together with their accuracy and
    mean square error (RMSE) in Table 4. The same outcome is shown in Figure 8, as
    in a graph.    Figure 8  The output of our models is shown in a graph. Table 4  Models
    anàlisis result. (1) The output of the KNN model is shown in Line 1, where the
    corresponding red and blue colors of the training and testing sets stand in for
    the pumping points between “0” and “1.” All the data points supplied in red and
    green are shown to be integrated into their surroundings by the model, respectively.
    The model’s rate of accuracy in describing the outcomes is 98.3%. (2) Line 2 displays
    a 99.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square error for the RF model. (3) Line
    3 shows the results of the NB model with a 98.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square
    error. (4) In Line 4, where the SVM model’s results are displayed and as a result,
    the mean square error is 0.66 and the accuracy rate is 99.3%. (5) Finally, a LR
    model with a mean square error that is very nearly 0.5 and a rate of accuracy
    of 99.5%. The accuracy of ML algorithms is determined through training and validation
    processes. Various machine learning algorithms provide satisfactory results after
    performing analysis of the collected data. As we can see, the accuracy rates of
    the NB and RF model of 98.8% and the MSE of 0.16 are higher compared to KNN, SVM,
    and LR with successive results: (98.3%/1.66), (99.3%/0.66), and (99.5%/0.5), respectively.
    5. Future Work Recommendations To increase the efficiency of the system, some
    recommendations are listed for future research work: (1) To maintain the soil
    quality, there is a need to monitor soil salt rate and pH level of the soil. (2)
    To increase the crop production to fulfill the future needs, controlling and monitoring
    of the fertilization process are required to be utilized with the existing smart
    irrigation process. (3) Improvement of the system is done by adding new controllers
    and sensors to increase the stability, reliability, structure, and working efficiency
    of the system. (4) Artificial intelligent system will be installed with the irrigation
    system to predict the user action, rainfall condition patterns, and time to harvest
    extra. (5) To estimate the water requirement for irrigation process, water meter
    can be installed in the irrigation systems. (6) In this project, motor is controlled
    from mobile application, fully automated motor system should be installed. (7)
    Cameras can be used for detecting the deeds and for controlling and monitoring
    the plant growth. (8) Alarm system can be installed in the smart agriculture system
    for alerting the farmers regarding the fire and the any movement in the agriculture
    field. This can be achieved using the fire sensor and motion detector sensor.
    (9) Decision making can be done using the big data and artificial intelligent
    technologies. These technologies will help the smart irrigation for past and future
    data prediction in the IoT system. 6. Conclusion Increased production is an important
    first step since it will be necessary to meet the projected 70% rise in global
    food consumption by 2050. The management of water consumption for irrigation is
    another aspect of it. In this research, a hybrid irrigation system is suggested.
    Three modules make up our suggested approach to smart irrigation: As the first
    module, the sensor network identifies variables affecting the requirement for
    water. We use sensors such as DHT11, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, a wind
    sensor, a rain sensor, and a water level sensor to measure temperature, soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity in the air, wind speed, rain status, and reservoir water
    level. In the second module, we utilize the ThingSpeak cloud server and the Bylnk
    cloud server as IoT servers to send and receive data. In the third module, we
    used machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and determine how accurate
    the decision-making process was to determine the need for irrigation. KNN, NB,
    LR, and RF were just a few of the models we used to analyze the data we collected.
    When comparing the accuracy rates and mean squared errors of different models,
    the NB and RF models have an accuracy rate of 98.8% and MSE of 0.16. In comparison,
    the KNN, SVM, and logistic regression models have accuracy rates of 98.3%, 99.3%,
    and 99.5%, with corresponding MSE values of 1.66, 0.66, and 0.5, respectively.

  description: The poultry business in contemporary India is one of the most important
    and rapidly expanding sectors of the country's agricultural economy. Increases
    in chicken production can be attributed to better manufacturing methods and more
    efficient agricultural methods. The importance of automation in the current world
    cannot be overstated, and neither can the rapid development of the Internet of
    Things (IoT) idea with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using a certain method, manual
    tasks may be made fully automatic. Poultry farms can benefit from IoT-based operations
    when remote monitoring and repair are required, transforming them from traditional
    to cutting-edge operations that make extensive use of automation. In order to
    maintain and enhance chicken health, it is necessary to constantly check for changes
    in a number of variables. In this study, we propose and construct a low-cost Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based system for monitoring environmental factors in a chicken
    farm in real time, including temperature, humidity, ammonia levels, and light
    i ntensity. Information gleaned via sensors and continuous monitoring. By putting
    the planned system into action, we were able to evaluate its viability. Temperature
    and humidity levels, as well as their management, are the most important climatic
    parameters for a poultry farm's output. The purpose of this project is to automate
    the operation of a chicken farm by utilising Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.
    Chicken health is maintained by careful monitoring of environmental conditions
    like temperature, humidity, light, and ammonia gas, as well as through the supervision
    of routine tasks like feeding, watering, and cleaning.

  description: The biggest problem facing contemporary agriculture today is the enormous
    and ongoing growth of the world population, which necessitates a bigger production
    of agricultural goods to meet the needs for food. Also, there are more challenges
    facing agriculture, like the recent rise in inefficiency brought on by global
    climate change, reduced irrigation water, increasing soil contamination, plant
    diseases, and heat waves, all of which have a negative impact on agriculture sectors.
    In order to retain efficiency, sustainability, and quality, the agricultural sector
    needs to make investments in modern technologies and infrastructure that will
    allow it to evolve into a smart industry capable of addressing these difficulties
    through lean operations supported by industrial digital technologies. The manufacturing
    industry has fully embraced the industry 4.0 strategy, allowing them to achieve
    increased optimization, efficiency, responsiveness, and autonomy supported by
    the digitization approach. In order that to make a paradigm shift in the future
    of the agricultural industry, this paper deals with the digitization of agriculture,
    which is based on IOT, AI, and artificial neural network (ANN) technologies. The
    use of these technologies in agriculture will lead to the production of many services,
    such as data collection and analysis, pattern recognition, and independent decision-making
    based on artificial intelligence, added to existing agricultural automation as
    result of these processes. The agricultural industry is currently one of the most

    that the world population will reach 9.15 billion by 2050, with an increase of
    another 2 billion, while the area that can be added to arable land will only be
    4% [15]. And according to a paper published in 2018 by the World Government Summit,
    “Population growth = more food. The same paper estimated that the world''s population
    will increase to 10 billion in 2050 [1, 7]. Due to the increasing world population
    and the challenges facing the agricultural sector (which will be discussed below),
    it is not possible to achieve agricultural practices with the required efficiency
    except by using the latest technological solutions, relying on modern agricultural
    techniques to improve resources and increase consumer demand, as well as high
    quality standards such as food safety, security, and traceability. Agricultural
    production needs many activities, such as soil monitoring, temperature, relative
    humidity, vegetation conditions, carbon dioxide levels, pest control, supply management,
    and infrastructure. IoT-based technology can add value in terms of quality, sustainability,
    and production increase as it performs a range of operations and helps with decision-making
    [7]. The goal of this research is to use fuzzy logic to integrate human informal
    knowledge into control techniques for protected agriculture. Early prediction
    of plant disease using an ANN-based system, networking of smart sensors, and IoT
    technology networking to facilitate and control large amounts of data, as well
    as collecting the data from sensors and integrating them in real-time to allow
    monitoring and control from anywhere and at any time by all process participants
    and also calculating biotic and abiotic stresses using UAVs and multispectral
    cameras Smart control of plant irrigation and fertilization using ANN, These It
    is considered one of the main questions of this research. However The main idea
    or focus of the current study program is to implement the Industry 4.0 strategy
    in farming through the integration of Internet of Things (IOT), ANN, fuzzy logic
    and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the industry''s infrastructure
    to make it possible to achieve the following goals and milestones: Using fuzzy
    logic, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things in agriculture has
    many advantages for helping and developing agriculture, and it will also facilitate
    farms in reducing manufacturing costs and thus increasing profitability and sustainability
    [3]. The research will make it possible to include human informal knowledge into
    the control strategy using fuzzy logic, creating human-like control over the greenhouses''
    parameters. With the combined application of artificial intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of things (IoT), it will be easier to reach a higher level of efficiency
    in the use of resources like water, fertiliser, pesticides, energy sources, etc.
    On the farm, (IoT applications will lead to environmental protection). Also, this
    study dealt with the use of fuzzy logic techniques, which will enable the integration
    of informal human knowledge into the control strategy, thus developing human-like
    control of the parameters of farm entities (greenhouses). Through the joint use
    of AI and IoT, they will facilitate an enhanced level of efficiency in the use
    of water, fertilizers, pesticides, energy sources, etc. on the farm (artificial
    intelligence (AI), and IoT applications will protect the environment). This study
    also focused on the importance of integrating technology. The research enables
    farms to adopt more effective environmental protection strategies. by combining
    fuzzy logic and AI technology. However, IoT is a key component of smart farming
    as well, as this study shows. This is considered one of the main problems in this
    sector, and this study seeks solutions to these problems to enable farmers to
    use modern agricultural industry technology on their farms as well as provide
    practical steps to agricultural companies. It also gives the farmers solutions
    and good ideas for the researchers about how to pay attention to this important
    sector. These are the main issues addressed in this study. Also, the paper presents
    a rationalization of the benefits and useful information about Industry 4.0 as
    well as the obstacles related to the implementation of the latest technological
    solutions in smart agriculture. The importance of this research lies in the fact
    that it provides important technological solutions for the significance of using
    Industry 4.0 in the agriculture sector, particularly using IOT, AI, and fuzzy
    logic in smart farming, as well as recommending researchers pay attention to this
    important sector. It will also enable farms to lead in adopting more effective
    environmental protection strategies through the combined use of fuzzy logic and
    AI techniques. This is one of the most important technical recommendations that
    must be worked on and developed. 2 Previous Research The widespread use of wireless
    communication will raise the bar for agricultural automation, and wireless communication
    will alter communication standards. Sensor networks are defined by a variety of
    IEEE standards, including IEEE 802.15.1 PAN/Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee, and
    many others. These standards must be understood when developing sensor network
    applications. The use of the IPV6 Internet Protocol for wireless communication
    and a significant amount of hardware to establish a WSN are currently under debate.
    Precision agriculture and the creation of optimal strategies are both made feasible
    by using WSN. However, the IoT concept has made it possible to build a network
    of intelligent sensors that can quickly and effectively cover large areas. The
    IOT gateway has been forked by the authors, Sridevi Navulur et al., into various
    nodes such as actuators, sensors, interfaces, and wireless links that enable communication
    between them [26]. To monitor agricultural land and alert farmers via email or
    SMS or if the system detects any anomalies, Kodali et al. presented the Losant
    platform [20, 21]. An automated irrigation system that uses the GPRS module as
    a communication tool was created by Gutiérrez-Rodrguez et al. [10]. The system
    has been programmed into a microprocessor-based gateway that regulates the flow
    of water and has the system encoded into it. It has been shown that the water
    savings are 90% greater than the irrigation technique used traditionally. Kim
    et al. used a distributed wireless network to remotely sense and control irrigation
    processes [27]. To decrease human intervention, time, and cost while improving
    efficiency, productivity, and the global market. Malavade et al. focused on the
    IoT''s impact in agriculture and how it results in smart framing [23]. Artificial
    neural networks (ANN) have recently been used by the agricultural industry due
    to their advantages over conventional control systems. Artificial neural networks
    can predict the behaviour of the system through the training process [11]. Gliever
    and Slaughter utilized ANN to recognize weeds in crops. The authors, Maier et
    al., utilized artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict water resource variables
    [22]. To send data to the server so that domain operators can make appropriate
    decisions [30], Song & He et al. combined expert systems and artificial neural
    networks to estimate the nutritional value of crops, while Ravichandran & Koteshwari
    suggested using ANN algorithms for crop. They also suggested an expert farming
    system that uses IoT to send data to the server so that domain operators can make
    suitable decisions [30]. The effectiveness of the model depended on the number
    of hidden layers. To assess soil moisture in the Badi fields with significantly
    less meteorological data, two ANN models were created. By examining the observed
    and estimated soil moisture values, both models were proven to be accurate. It
    led to a more efficient use of less meteorological data, a lower consumption of
    labor and time, and an accurate and trustworthy estimation of soil moisture in
    rice fields [2]. Hinnell et al. [12], in their discussion of drip irrigation systems,
    mention that ANNs have been developed to predict the spatial distribution of groundwater
    [12]. The membership function of each system variable used in fuzzy logic is an
    effective technique for representing informal knowledge [13, 14]. Sannakki et
    al. created a novel technique for classifying leaf diseases that separates the
    healthy from the diseased portions of the leaf with the help of image segmentation
    and a set of k means [29]. To determine the ideal N fertiliser rates based on
    field and crop variables, Tremblay et al. developed the fuzzy inference system
    (FIS) [25]. Based on the weather data, the model predicted plant illnesses [16].
    The technique was created to prevent diseases in plants because they only appear
    when the temperature and humidity in the atmosphere are within a specified range.
    Wall and King created an intelligent system that uses field temperature and humidity
    sensors to control sprinkler valves [14, 17]. A distributed irrigation system
    that measures soil moisture was developed by Miranda et al. [3, 15], and Greenhouse
    developed a multi-variable fuzzy controller for the Greenhouse system. The developed
    fuzzy inference engine integrates the correlation of input variables and incorporates
    informal knowledge from field experts [14]. 3 Definition of Industry 4.0 A paper
    was proposed in 2011 titled “Industry 4.0: Intelligent Manufacturing of the Future.”
    Industry 4.0 is defined as “the name of the current trend of automation and data
    exchange in manufacturing technologies, including smart factory construction,
    the IoT, cloud computing, cognitive computing, and electronic physical systems”
    [12, 22, 27]. Industry 4.0 refers to the technological evolution from embedded
    systems to electronic physical systems [31]. Note that there are many definitions
    for “industry 4.0”, and not all the definitions are the same, but “industry 4.0”
    is also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution [1]. Decentralized intelligence
    helps create intelligent networks and manage autonomous operations, with the interaction
    of the real and virtual worlds representing a new and important aspect of the
    manufacturing and production process. The first industrial revolution began in
    the late eighteenth century in Britain, enabling the mass production of water
    and steam power rather than human and animal power. A century after the first
    Industrial Revolution, Industrial 2.0 began, introducing assembly lines and the
    use of oil, gas, and electric power as important energy sources in the industry,
    along with more advanced communications by telephone and telegraph and a certain
    degree of automation of manufacturing processes [28]. The third industrial revolution
    began in the mid-twentieth century, contributing to the manufacture of computers,
    advanced communications, and data analysis [31]. In addition, the digitization
    of factories has started with the integration of control units (PLCs) into machines
    to automate certain processes and collect and exchange data. The world is currently
    experiencing the fourth industrial revolution, which is the latest transformation
    in the industrial sector. (Increasing automation and the use of smart machines
    and smart factories), this data helps produce more efficient and productive goods.
    Flexibility is improved so that manufacturers can meet customer demands with mass
    customization; in pursuit of efficiency, by collecting more data from the factory
    floor and combining it with other enterprise operational data, a smart factory
    can achieve information transparency and better decision-making. The Fifth Industrial
    Revolution (Industry 0.5) is expected to bring humans back to the centre of operations
    through a human-electronic-physical system of value creation [28]. Tables 1 and
    2 show the development roadmap of industrial and agricultural revolutions from
    the 18th century up to date. Table 3 shows the concepts of Industry 4.0 technology
    and Agriculture 4.0 technology. Table 1. The history of industry revolutions from
    steam to sensors [18, 28]. Full size table Table 2. The history of agriculture
    revolutions from 18th century up today [18, 28, 32]. Full size table The agricultural
    revolution brought an important shift in human history and helped in the development
    of agriculture and the domestication of plants and animals. It also enabled people
    to stay in their places and establish permanent and stable settlements, which
    helped civilization development (1960s to the early 2000s). Table 3. The concepts
    of industrial and agricultural revolution technologies [1]. Full size table 4
    Agriculture 4.0 and Food Industry Despite the big evolution in the agricultural
    field, there are many issues and challenges that need to be addressed, such as
    environmental issues, a lack of digitalization, and the issue of food safety.
    Industry 4.0 was marked by the synthesis of all emerging technologies, bringing
    together the IoT (IoT), robotics, big data, and blockchain technology [7], Using
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Autonomous Robotic Systems (ARS), Cloud Computing
    (CC), Simulation and System Integration (SI), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Digital
    Twin (DT), and Additive Manufacturing (AM), industry can be digitalized and make
    agriculture smarter. The integration of Industry 4.0 and agriculture provides
    the opportunity to transform industrial agriculture into Agriculture 4.0, or the
    “next generation”, also called “digital agriculture.” Agriculture 4.0 can be achieved
    by collecting precise variables in real-time as well as processing and analysing
    data related to the agricultural industry from food production, processing, and
    distribution to consumer use [1]. Such a smart agro system would greatly improve
    productivity, food supply chain efficiency, natural resource utilization and food
    safety [7, 19]. Sensors are used to detect crop stages, recommend timely inputs
    and treatments, and control the level of irrigation. The food industry needs more
    research on food security, transparency, and the required documentation. Smart
    sensors are used as a tracking system in addition to collecting human and product
    data. Agriculture 4.0 means a transformation of the production infrastructure:
    it contributes to the creation of connected farms, new production equipment, machinery,
    and connected tractors, enabling increased productivity, quality, and environmental
    protection [19]. Smart agriculture concept is shown below in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Smart
    agriculture concept [1]. Full size image 5 From Industry 4.0 Toward Agriculture
    4.0 The methodology behind this study is to develop a smart farm prototype using
    digital technologies, implementing the industry 4.0 strategy in farming. The study
    also identifies challenges and evaluates unsolved problems, potential applications,
    and the uses of AI and architectures for the IoT in the agricultural industry.
    With the help of Internet of Things (IoT), fuzzy logic, and artificial neural
    networks (ANN) technologies, the study will develop an integrated digital tool
    that will allow the agricultural sector to collect, process, and transmit data
    as well as take independent decisions and actions based on incorporated informal
    knowledge obtained through the use of fuzzy logic without the need for human intervention
    [10]. The Internet of Things provides the communications infrastructure required
    to connect and link smart devices to user-mobile devices over the Internet, such
    as sensors, vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles to user-mobile devices [5].
    This study also highlights many of the challenges exposed to contemporary agriculture,
    such as the continually increasing demand for quality food, shortages of labour
    and arable land, increased soil contamination, irrigation water reduction, and
    loss of yields due to plant diseases and pests [7]. Along with this, the agricultural
    sector is currently facing difficulties brought on by climate change, which have
    increased existing inefficiencies in the field. These are besides the challenges
    the agricultural industry currently faces due to global climate change, which
    has added to the inefficiencies of the agricultural industry. In such circumstances,
    to maintain efficiency, quality food, and healthy and sustainable production and
    cultivation of healthy food Environmentally, the agricultural industry needs to
    invest in new techniques and infrastructure to transform into a smart industry
    comprised of smart farms capable of responding to challenges through lean operations
    supported by industrial digital technologies (IDTs), irrigation water reduction,
    increased soil contamination, and yield loss due to plant diseases and pests [4,
    10]. This research can be useful to farmers, researchers, and professionals working
    in agricultural businesses for intelligent farming. Newness/ originality of the
    study: Several prominent researchers have made efforts for smart agriculture using
    IoT concepts in agriculture. But a set of revealed challenges remains in the queue
    for effective resolution. This study makes some effort to discuss previous research
    and open challenges in IoT-based agriculture, artificial intelligence, artificial
    neural networks, and fuzzy logic to develop smart farming. However, using industry
    4.0 techniques in farming will give farmers and agriculture companies many benefits:
    1. By using the Internet of Things in farming, it can make it easier to manage
    and collect large amounts of data from sensors, as well as control and integrate
    them from anywhere and at any time, allowing communication among all participants
    in the process. 2. Using fuzzy logic, the research will allow the incorporation
    of human informal knowledge into the control strategy, resulting in human-like
    control of the farm entities (‘greenhouses’) parameters. 3. With the combined
    of AI and IoT, the farm will be able to achieve a higher level of efficiency in
    the use of water, energy sources, fertilisers, pesticides, etc. 4. Internet of
    Things applications will lead to environmental protection. 5. The research enables
    farmers to adopt more efficient environmental protection strategies by combining
    fuzzy logic and AI techniques. 6. Using Internet of Things (IOT) sensors and AI-enabled
    equipment such as drones and agriculture robots, farmers can increase food production
    by more than 70% by 2050. Figure 2 shows the system''s structure. The central
    unit receives and collects the data from autonomous measurement stations, local
    weather forecasts, professional knowledge from local agronomists, pre-processed
    images received from multispectral crop cameras utilising UAVs, and data obtained
    from mobile device applications. The central unit generates control actions for
    the actuators based on previously collected, processed, and stored data, The central
    unit generates control actions for the actuators. This system is suitable for
    both outdoor and protected agriculture (in greenhouses and indoors). Actions are
    taken in accordance with the type of plant under supervision. The system controls
    the internal temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide enrichment, irrigation,
    and fertilisation in the case of protected cultivation. In the case of outdoor
    cultivation, the system regulates watering and fertilisation and computes the
    severity index to allow for early pest detection. AI-based solutions will also
    be utilised to optimise resource utilisation [32]. 6 Technology-Driven Agriculture
    Industry 4.0 changed the industrial and agriculture sectors and offered several
    advantages across many industries, but especially in agriculture industry fields,
    farmers are now using Industry 4.0 technology in smart agriculture by utilising
    modern devices like agriculture robots, drones (UAVs), sensors, AI, the Internet
    of Things (IoT), etc. Fig. 2. The structure of the proposed system. Full size
    image 6.1 Internet of Things in Agriculture Majority of research publications
    discussed the influence of IoT devices on system automation, including how they
    can determine soil texture, automate irrigation systems, and detect environmental
    change. Such as temperature and humidity, detecting pests and weeds, and assessing
    damage to the soil. Smart agriculture contributed to the development of the agricultural
    sector. Farmers are now utilising modern technologies in agriculture to make it
    smarter and more productive, using IOTs and AI and linking agriculture with satellites,
    the internet, sensors, etc. To increase the benefits of the IoT [5]. The data
    connection varies from sensor to sensor. First, the sensors gather the information,
    share it with the IoT gateway, connect through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to the database,
    and store the data in the cloud. Then the user finally gets the processed information
    (or data) and uses it to make smarter decisions. Wireless Sensor Network (WNS)
    helps make the right decisions in relevant situations, and thus WNS supports decision-making
    to find solutions to problems related to agriculture [1, 18]. Despite technological
    development, many challenges must be faced when using modern technologies in smart
    agriculture. Among those challenges, most people are ignorant of how to use technology
    in the agriculture sector due to a lack of knowledge about dealing with mobile
    devices and a lack of reading and comprehension knowledge. There are also other
    factors, such as a lack of energy supply, changes in weather or climatic conditions,
    and funding sources [1]. But the development of the agricultural field using modern
    technologies has helped to overcome obstacles and solve many problems in modern
    agriculture. In the Agriculture 4.0 sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) is commonly
    utilized in various ways, such as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
    agriculture, as well as the IOT for monitoring soil and water quality, optimizing
    crop irrigation, employing precision agriculture techniques like remote sensing,
    humidity, and temperature monitoring, and implementing autonomous greenhouses
    and these are the important and common uses of IOT in agriculture [8, 18]. 6.2
    Wireless Sensor Networks in Agriculture Wireless sensor network technology is
    used on the IoT. WSN is defined as a group of spatially dispersed sensors that
    monitor environmental conditions, store data obtained, and send information collected
    to a central point [1]. A wireless communication module connects several sensor
    nodes to form a WSN for smart agriculture. These nodes can self- self-configure,
    self-organize, and self-diagnose [24, 32]. These nodes have a variety of capabilities
    (such as processing, transmission, and acquisition). WSNs can be divided into
    various sorts based on the environment in which they are found. These comprise
    mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs), underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN),
    underwater wireless sensor networks (WUSN), and terrestrial wireless sensor networks
    (TWSN) [1, 20]. For agricultural applications, TWSN and UWSN sensor networks are
    often used [1, 20, 32]. TWSN nodes are positioned above the surface of the earth
    and consist of sensors to collect surrounding data. A second alternative to WSNs
    is their underground counterpart, WUSNs. Nodes are inserted into the soil, where
    they easily perform low-frequency functions while exhibiting very weak higher-frequency
    capabilities. As a result, it takes a lot of knots to cover a big area. Several
    research publications that have been addressed in the literature have covered
    the use of WSNs for various farm applications, such as irrigation management,
    water quality evaluation, and environmental monitoring. Additionally, there are
    several WSN-related issues that require more focus and attention, including interoperability,
    robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and maintenance [1, 5]. 6.3 Artefactual
    Intelligence in Agriculture 4.0 The agriculture sector is experiencing the rapid
    customization of both artificial intelligence and machine learning in seasonal
    agricultural outcomes and field agriculture techniques. The development of computer
    systems that can carry out tasks that require human intelligence, such as decision-making
    and sensory perception, is known as artificial intelligence [24]. Combined with
    cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things,
    this is seen as one of the main drivers behind the digitization of the agriculture
    industry 4.0. Many smart farming systems that use machine learning [ML] and deep
    learning [DL] algorithms have been developed to determine various parameters such
    as crop and soil control, diagnosing plan. Diseases, detecting weeds, intelligent
    spraying, aerial surveys, and photography that are used to improve crop production.
    In addition to ongoing monitoring, harvesting, processing, and marketing [17].
    Learning and responding to special situations (based on learning) to increase
    efficiency [1]. Providing some of these options to farmers as a service, such
    as Chabot or different conversation principles, will assist them in properly supporting
    the pace of technological improvements, such as identifying similarities in everyday
    farming. Agricultural robotics organizations recognize the value of robots that
    depend on and manipulate themselves to handle key agricultural services such as
    assembly plants on a more prominent scale, at a faster pace, and with more proactivity
    than personal workers [19]. 6.4 Advance Robotic Agricultural robots have been
    developed to perform precision farming operations and to replace humans in certain
    tasks. Advanced robots have been used in recent years for purposes such as cultivation
    and harvesting, water supply, targeted spraying, and environmental control. Robots
    equipped with lasers and cameras are used to identify and remove weeds without
    the need for human intervention. These robots move autonomously through the rows
    of crops, resulting in higher yields when labour is reduced [9]. It can also be
    used in the fields to complete specific farming tasks. Recently, robots for plant
    growth and fruit picking have emerged to bring new levels of efficiency to traditional
    methods. Stationary robots are usually the most popular alternative in industrial
    applications [29]. However, in the context of agriculture, mobile robots may offer
    greater utility, as they can traverse different types of terrain that are not
    otherwise easily accessible, cover large fields, and automate agricultural tasks.
    In the agricultural sector, mobile robots are widely used to improve farm management,
    increase farm efficiency, and reduce labor needs, especially in harsh environments
    inaccessible to humans [19]. These robots perform a variety of agricultural activities,
    such as harvesting, field cultivation, mechanical weeding, precision spraying,
    irrigation management and soil sampling [9]. 6.5 Machine Learning in Agriculture
    Machine learning techniques are classified into three categories: (1) Supervised
    learning (regression trees, linear regression, nonlinear regression, Bayesian
    linear regression, polynomial logistic regression, and vector regression support).
    (2) unsupervised learning (K-group means, hierarchical clustering, anomaly detection,
    neural networks, principal component analysis, independent component analysis,
    prior algorithms, and singular value decomposition) and (3) re-informative learning
    (Markov decision processes and Q learning) [1, 24]. Technologies and algorithms
    implement machine learning in agriculture. Crop yield forecast by sector, diseases,
    weed detection, and weather forecast (precipitation), estimation of soil properties
    (such as moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, calculating
    lawn fertiliser application rates, and livestock production and care of animals.
    Management Rates are used for a wide range of agricultural applications. The analysis
    shows that “crop yield prediction” is a topic that has been extensively studied.
    The most popular ML technologies for smart agriculture are support vector machines
    (SVM), neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and linear regression. There
    have been no reports of commercial applications yet for the listed use cases,
    which are currently in the research stage. Additionally, it has been discovered
    that indoor vertical farming systems, particularly hydroponic, aquaponic, and
    aeroponic systems, are hardly researched using AI and machine learning approaches
    [24]. Technology from ML is applied. Given the difficulties of digital transformation
    in terms of cybersecurity and data privacy, new approaches such as such as federated
    learning and privacy-preserving methods, are being developed to enable digital
    agriculture. And mitigate security issues [1]. 6.6 Drones (UAVs) Technology in
    Agriculture 4.0 Drones (UAVs), known as drones or aerial robots, are widely used
    by farmers to monitor crop growth, and combat hunger, and adverse environmental
    impacts. It is called “unmanned” because there is no human pilot on board [1].
    Unmanned aerial vehicles are used efficiently to take pictures, spray water and
    pesticides, consider rugged terrain, etc. It has proven its value in terms of
    spray speed as well as accuracy, when compared to conventional machines for the
    same purpose, UAV technology can be used for gathering information that helps
    farmers make decisions. With recent developments in drone technology, a group
    of UAVs equipped with 3D cameras and heterogeneous sensors can work together to
    provide farmers with comprehensive capabilities and tasks to manage their lands
    and farms [5]. By using these drones in agriculture, farmers can set their eyes
    on the sky. However, using drones in agriculture can carry out large and difficult
    tasks and reach remote and rugged places with the necessary speed and time, but
    there are still many challenges that need to be addressed to take advantage of
    this technology, especially the integration with other technologies and how to
    use it in bad weather conditions [21]. UAVs, and radio-controlled model aircraft
    can be flown at lower altitudes for increased spatial resolution, possibly at
    a lower cost [19]. The advantage of the image using drones for agriculture is
    their accuracy (very high pixels), compared to other traditional methods [6].
    Drone images are used in many things, including mapping grass types, measuring
    shrub biomass, mapping crop strength, monitoring crop water stress, recording
    crop biomass, and evaluating nitrogen treatments. On crops [21], in addition,
    the UAV is also used as a geo-fence to repel animal attacks by alerting the owner
    in a timely and safe manner [19] (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3. The types of drones used
    in agriculture (https://www.iberdrola.com/web/guest/innovacion/smart-farming-agricultura-precision).
    Full size image 7 The Benefits of Industry 4.0 in Agriculture Using modern technologies
    in the agriculture sector has many advantages related to the economic, social,
    and environmental fields. This paper will briefly cover all the fields mentioned
    above. First, the environmental field: These technologies contributed to reducing
    pollutants (such as agricultural chemicals and various fertilizers), which led
    to the sustainability [1, 3] or increase of soil quality, reduced water pollution,
    reduced carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and reduced air pollution. Secondly, economically,
    it has many advantages, including operational efficiency, maximising resources,
    and providing high-quality product results, such as increased yields, improved
    soil quality, and high selling prices of raw materials. Smart farming systems
    also enable accurate management of demand forecasts and timely delivery of goods
    to market to reduce waste. In addition to the various benefits in terms of efficiency,
    there are lower costs involved, less water consumption, less use of technical
    inputs, and lower overall costs. In terms of social benefits, it reduces time
    and effort (reducing physical labor) and increases quality, as well as reducing
    worker stress and improving their well-being and safety at work. Overall, Agriculture
    4.0 helps reduce costs and improve product quality, quantity, and sustainability
    [18]. 8 Challenges Facing Agriculture 4.0 To introduce the new technology (Industry
    4.0 to Agriculture 4.0) in a specific environment, there are many challenges and
    obstacles, such as technical and technological challenges related to the application
    of smart agriculture, technical problems related to modern equipment, weather
    problems, rugged lands in some areas, and a lack of knowledge for some farmers
    about how to use the modern techniques in agriculture [4, 8]. Agriculture 4.0
    requires great economic effort; financing sources consider it most important to
    farmers. However, funding sources are one of the most important challenges in
    some developing countries. Implementation challenges: Using Agri4.0 in the agriculture
    sector requires skills. Cultural and organisational challenges: Due to the introduction
    of digitalization in agriculture, Agriculture Revolution 4.0 will require skills
    related to introducing digital solutions in companies [18]. However, weather conditions,
    energy sources, and financing, the ruggedness of some areas, and the lack of sufficient
    knowledge to use modern technologies for some farmers is considered the most important
    challenge facing smart agriculture. Moreover, for a successful implementation
    of ANN, fuzzy logic control systems, other artificial intelligence engines, to
    train Artefactual Intelligence (AI) models in the agricultural sector, a huge
    amount of data is needed [4]. 9 Discussions Smart farming depends on advanced
    technology systems in management, analysis, processing, data collection, decision-making,
    etc. to reduce costs and make farming more productive, profitable, sustainable,
    and environmentally friendly. Smart agriculture can contribute significantly to
    meeting the food needs of the world''s population [1]. This study aims to highlight
    the importance of using new technologies in farming. Using Industry 4.0 in agriculture
    can make agriculture smart and available, as well as contribute to solving many
    agriculture problems. We have clarified part of these challenges and solutions
    in this paper, which shows the importance of resorting to researchers, farmers,
    and agricultural companies to contribute to the development of this important
    sector. And shows that it is not as required. And there are many issues and challenges,
    such as the issue of food safety, a lack of digitization, and environmental problems.
    Sources of financing and support, a lack of resources, and the lack of knowledge
    of many farmers on how to use new technologies on farms., which is considered
    one of the most important challenges facing smart agriculture in developing countries.
    (Industry 4.0) was distinguished by doing a lot of things and tasks with less
    effort and in a short amount of time. Industry 4.0 spawned all the emerging technologies,
    bringing together BDMM, IoT technologies, robotics, big data, and blockchain technology
    [7, 8, 18, 19], are making production and supply processes smarter and now more
    autonomous. The integration of smart Industry and Agriculture offers the opportunity
    to transform industrial agriculture into the next generation. Smart farming can
    be achieved by collecting precise variables in real time, in addition to processing
    and analysing data related to agricultural industries from food production, processing,
    and distribution to consumers, through artificial intelligence (AI), Big data,
    sensors, IOTs, (UAVs), agriculture robots), etc. Such a smart ecosystem in the
    agricultural field would contribute significantly to improving productivity, food
    supply chain efficiency, natural resource utilization and food safety. Industry
    4.0 towards Agriculture 4.0 means a shift in production infrastructure: it contributes
    to the creation of connected farms, new production equipment, tractors, and tying
    machines, enabling increased productivity, quality, and environmental protection
    [28], as well as giving recommendations to those who are interested in smart farming
    and to the researchers to combine the use of AI techniques and fuzzy logic, which
    will enable the farms to lead in adopting more effective environmental protection
    strategies. And this point is one of the most important recommendations that must
    be worked on and developed. 10 Conclusions This paper provides a future vision,
    an overview, and objective solutions for Industry 4.0 applications in agriculture.
    It highlights the significance of using modern technologies in agriculture to
    contribute to those interested in developing and knowing the places of imbalance
    in the agriculture sector, as well as identifying the challenges facing smart
    agriculture to find solutions and innovate new ways, contribute to opening research
    and innovation issues, and therefore be useful in identifying prospects and knowledge
    of the gaps in agriculture 4.0. The study''s goal is to respond effectively to
    global climatic changes, fluctuations in the global economy and environmental
    fields, a lack of resources, and an increase in the global population, all of
    which affect agricultural development and prevent us from achieving food self-sufficiency.
    However, the technologies provided by Industry 4.0 for agriculture field refer
    to many creative solutions that can be used to develop this important sector.
    In this paper, the challenges facing farmers are highlighted, and logical solutions
    are presented to meet future expectations and make agriculture more efficient
    and smarter. In this context, Internet of Things, drones, micro-communication
    technologies, agriculture robots, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence
    are discussed. The study introduces our current research in the field of applications
    of AI, IoT, ANN, fuzzy logic, and early detection of plant diseases. In addition
    to IOT for smart communication in data collection, processing, and analysis, it
    is considered one of the powerful tools that enable agricultural management, so
    farmers and researchers should pay close attention to move this sector to a qualitative
    new level. It will provide a new ecological approach to environmental protection,
    although there is still much research to be done. The design above demonstrates
    that the approach enables the integration of expert human knowledge into control
    strategies by using fuzzy logic to facilitate control in protected agriculture.
    Additionally, various expert-based strategies can also be simulated, compared,
    and analyzed [13]. In conclusion, this study also highlights that humans can use
    fuzzy logic to facilitate the integrated control of protected agriculture through
    their formal knowledge. Future work in this research is to combine the uses of
    IOT and AI to achieve the highest level of sustainability, quality, and efficiency
    in the use of water, energy sources, fertilizers, pesticides, soil type, soil
    temperature, etc., on the farm. With the knowledge that IoT applications in the
    agriculture sector will lead to environmental protection. And additionally, the
    study enables the farms to adopt more effective environmental protection tactics
    by advancing the combined use of fuzzy logic and AI technology. References Abbasi,

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain

    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u

    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of
    the estimated Q-value Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) from the target
    value y( t ~ ) [21], L( θ u ( t ~ ))=E[(y( t ~ )− Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~
    ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (23) View Source where, y( t ~ )= r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u
    ( t ~ +1) Q u ( o u ( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1); θ u ( t ~ )) and a u ( t ~ +1) indicates
    the agent’s action generated by the DNN at t ~ +1 , given the observation o u
    ( t ~ +1) . At each iteration, the deep Q -function approximator is trained to
    learn the best estimate of the Q-function by minimizing the loss function L( θ
    u ( t ~ )) . To improve the stability of the algorithm and cope with samples correlation,
    as depicted in Fig. 4, two novel techniques, namely Fixed Target Network [51]
    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t
    ~ )) = E D [( r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u ( t ~ +1) Q u (b( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1);
    θ ´ u ( t ~ )) − Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (24) View
    Source where θ ´ u ( t ~ ) denotes the target network parameters, and the expectation
    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round
    t ~ , we define the observation space O u , the action space A u , and the reward
    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source
    Action: The action space is defined as all possible placement of the required
    VNFs for service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ } k as A u ( t ~ )={ χ fk pu ( t ~ )},∀p∈U∪M,k∈S,f∈
    F k . (30) View Source Reward: Our objective is to orchestrate the VNFs in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and total energy consumption over the network.
    So we define the reward as a linear combination of three terms as follows: R u
    ( t ~ )= ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u ( t ~ )= Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )= ζ k u ( t ~ )= δ NFV ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u
    ( t ~ )+ δ AoI Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )+ δ E P total ( t ~ ), 1 K ∑ k∈S ζ k u ( t ~ )

    View Source where δ NFV , δ AoI and δ E are the normalization factors for NFV
    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

  description: The practice of agriculture is heavily reliant on the implementation
    of irrigation systems. Technology improvements have made it unnecessary to rely
    on someone else to perform irrigation when we are out and whenever crops need
    to be watered. Many researchers have attempted to autonomously irrigate crops,
    but difficulties with accuracy, timing, and cost are rarely addressed and given
    top priority. The proposed approach employs a real-time sensor, wireless sensor
    network, the adaptive bacterial foraging optimization (ABFO) algorithm, and a
    fuzzy irrigation system control to achieve autonomous watering, thereby enabling
    smart irrigation. This method reduces waste while preserving the container's water
    supply. Automated irrigation determines whether crops need to be watered by considering
    the type of crop, the weather, and the soil moisture and not soil moisture alone.
    The need for water is calculated using the three aforementioned criteria and fuzzy
    control drives the automation. Using an arduino-based IoT circuitry, the bioinspired
    model with algorithm adaptive bacterial foraging optimization, generates the optimized
    values for three parameters, which are then used by fuzzy logic control to predict
    the watering requirements of the plants. In terms of accuracy, timeliness, and
    cost, the suggested approach is advantageous. With this model, it is now possible
    to completely automate the irrigation system.

  description: Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been widely used as an allogeneic
    alternative to autologous bone graft for bone repair. However, more extensive
    use of DBM is limited due to its particulate nature after demineralization and
    rapid particle dispersion following irrigation, resulting in unpredictable osteoinductivity.
    Here, a new design of injectable hydrogel carriers for DBM that combine self-healing
    ability and osteogenic properties based on the self-assembly of guanidinylated
    hyaluronic acid and silica-rich nanoclays is reported. The nanoclays serve as
    reversible linkages to form a dynamic hydrogel network with the guanidine moieties
    on the polymer chains. Gelation kinetics and mechanical properties can be controlled
    by altering nanoclay content in the hydrogel. The resulting hydrogel exerts self-healing
    ability due to its dynamic crosslinks and well retains its overall performance
    with high DBM loading. The hydrogel exhibits great cytocompatibility and osteogenic
    effects mediated by the nanoclays. In vivo delivery of DBM using the nanocomposite
    hydrogel further demonstrates robust bone regeneration in a mouse calvarial defect
    model in comparison to DBM delivered with aqueous HA. This work suggests a promising
    hydrogel platform for many applications including therapeutic delivery and tissue
    engineering.

    SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been widely
    used as an allogeneic alternative to autologous bone graft for bone repair. However,
    more extensive use of DBM is limited due to its particulate nature after demineralization
    and rapid particle dispersion following irrigation, resulting in unpredictable
    osteoinductivity. Here, a new design of injectable hydrogel carriers for DBM that
    combine self-healing ability and osteogenic properties based on the self-assembly
    of guanidinylated hyaluronic acid and silica-rich nanoclays is reported. The nanoclays
    serve as reversible linkages to form a dynamic hydrogel network with the guanidine
    moieties on the polymer chains. Gelation kinetics and mechanical properties can
    be controlled by altering nanoclay content in the hydrogel. The resulting hydrogel
    exerts self-healing ability due to its dynamic crosslinks and well retains its
    overall performance with high DBM loading. The hydrogel exhibits great cytocompatibility
    and osteogenic effects mediated by the nanoclays. In vivo delivery of DBM using
    the nanocomposite hydrogel further demonstrates robust bone regeneration in a
    mouse calvarial defect model in comparison to DBM delivered with aqueous HA. This
    work suggests a promising hydrogel platform for many applications including therapeutic
    delivery and tissue engineering. 1 Introduction The escalating demand for bone
    tissue regeneration has been driven by various factors, including the aging population,
    upsurge in sports and accident-related injuries, and the rising prevalence of
    chronic diseases.[1] While autografts have long been regarded as the “gold standard”
    for promoting bone healing, their reliance on an additional surgical site and
    limited availability have led to a need for alternatives.[2] Allografts have emerged
    as viable substitutes for autografts due to their availability from tissue banks
    and the elimination of donor site complications.[2, 3] Demineralized bone matrix
    (DBM), a specialized form of allograft material, has gained prominence in bone
    tissue repair and regeneration due to its intrinsic osteoinductive potential derived
    from matrix-associated bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).[4] Obtained by selectively
    removing the mineral components of harvested human donor bones, DBM exhibits superior
    bone forming ability compared to common allografts by making the osteoinductive
    proteins present in bone matrix more accessible.[5] However, DBM is difficult
    to handle due to its particulate nature after the mineralization process and DBM
    particles could be easily washed out from the implantation site.[6] Although current
    DBM products often employ carrier materials such as glycerol and hyaluronic acid
    to provide stable suspension of DBM particles, they are rapidly dispersed in body
    fluids and the localized effect of DBM may not expect for reliable osteogenic
    efficacy at the defect site.[7] Hydrogels, three-dimensional (3D) crosslinked
    polymeric networks characterized by their high-water content, have gained prominence
    as extracellular matrix mimics for stem cell delivery or controlled release of
    biological agents in tissue engineering.[8] While conventional hydrogels formed
    by covalent bonds offer a stable and robust gel network through permanent cross-linkages,
    their susceptibility to fracture and irreversible healing after damages limit
    their applications as carriers for DBM particles.[9] In contrast, self-healing
    hydrogels based on non-covalent interactions, such as electrostatic interactions,
    coordination bonds, or host–guest assembly, exhibit great potential as moldable
    vehicles to facilitate handling, delivery, and graft material containment.[10]
    They have the ability to repair structural damages due to the dynamic polymer
    networks crosslinked by reversible linkages. Furthermore, the injectability of
    self-healing hydrogels enhances patient comfort and reduces the likelihood of
    complications by enabling minimally invasive administration.[11] However, self-healing
    hydrogels typically have inadequate structural integrity in physiological environments,
    making it difficult to deliver a large amount of DBM particles and direct cell
    growth and differentiation in the matrix. Consequently, the quest for a self-healing
    hydrogel that can preserve structural stability with high DBM loading and support
    stem cell osteogenic differentiation stands as a critical pursuit in the realm
    of DBM applications for bone tissue regeneration. In this study, we present a
    novel design of injectable hydrogel carriers for DBM exhibiting self-healing and
    osteogenic properties based on the self-assembly of hyaluronic acid (HA) and silicate
    nanoclay LAPONITE (LAP), where LAP serve as reversible linkages with osteoinductive
    properties to form a dynamic hydrogel network (Scheme 1). HA is a naturally occurring
    polysaccharide and is already being used as an excipient to fabricate DBM putty,
    due to its distinctive biocompatibility and inherent biological attributes.[12]
    Concomitantly, LAP (Na0.7+[(Mg5.5Li0.3)Si8O20(OH)4]0.7−) is a clay nanomaterial
    composed of layered silicate platelets with high surface areas and its degradation
    products (e.g., Mg2+ and Li+) have been shown to induce osteoblast differentiation.[6,
    13] The unique layered-architecture and high surface charges of LAP enable it
    to form stable colloidal suspensions and interact with polar molecules via electrostatic
    interactions.[14] We functionalized aminoguanidine on the carboxyl groups of HA
    disaccharide units to introduce robust positive charges onto the HA chains. Upon
    the mixing of HA and LAP, the dynamic hydrogel network is formed by strong electrostatic
    interactions between the positively charged guanidine moieties on HA and the negatively
    charged LAP entities. The resultant nanocomposite hydrogels exhibit several compelling
    attributes: (1) the ability to spontaneously restore its structural integrity
    and function after damages due to supramolecular forces; (2) the stability in
    aqueous injection and culture without dispersion due to robust electrostatic interactions;
    and (3) the pro-osteogenic substrate to support cell proliferation and osteogenic
    differentiation due to the integration of LAP in HA matrix. Collectively, our
    novel self-assembled HA-LAP hydrogels emerge as a compelling candidate for facilitating
    the delivery of DBM in a defect site, substantiated by their amalgamation of self-healing
    capacities, structural stability, facile manipulation, and augmentation of osteogenic
    efficacy. Scheme 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic illustration of
    nanocomposite hydrogels. Self-assembled nanocomposite hydrogels with self-healing
    and osteogenic properties formed via electrostatic interactions between guanidine-hyaluronic
    acid (G-HA) and LAPONITE (LAP). The obtained nanocomposite hydrogels exhibited
    excellent structural stability as carriers for DBM and enhanced bone repair. 2
    Results and Discussion 2.1 Preparation and Characterization of Nanocomposite Hydrogels
    G-HA was prepared by reacting the carboxyl groups of HA with aminoguanidine. Successful
    guanidinylation of HA was confirmed by FTIR-ATR spectra demonstrating the shift
    of characteristic peaks (1600–1700 cm−1) associated with the guanidine residue
    on carboxyl groups (Figure 1A). Hydrogels were formed by mixing a solution of
    G-HA (0.5%) with various amounts of LAP and the gelation time of the hydrogel
    was determined by a vial inversion method (Figure 1B). The nanocomposite hydrogel
    was formed by strong electrostatic interactions between positively charged guanidine
    groups of HA chains and oxyanions on the surface of LAP, leading to a stable crosslinked
    3D network. LAP is a disk-shaped smectite nanoclay with a high aspect ratio and
    surface area. LAP can strongly adsorb both negatively and positively charged molecules
    due to its highly charged nature resulting from layered structures composed of
    tetrahedral silicate and octahedral magnesia sheets.[15] The G-HA solution with
    2.0% LAP showed sol-gel transition after 300 s and the gelation time was reduced
    from 200 to 20 s with the increased concentration of LAP from 2.0% to 4.5% (Figure
    1C). In contrast, pristine HA without guanidinylation did not form a gel with
    LAP. Increased G-HA concentration greatly reduced the gelation, but the hydrogel
    solution becomes too viscous and difficult to mix with LAP at G-HA concentrations
    above 0.5% and thus subsequent studies were performed with 0.5% G-HA. Figure 1

    of G-HA and G-HA/LAP hydrogels after lyophilization. The scale bar indicates 50
    µm. Mechanical and swelling properties of nanocomposite hydrogels were characterized
    with various amounts of LAP. The increase of LAP concentration from 2% to 4% significantly
    enhanced the compressive modulus of the hydrogel, indicating strong interactions
    between the G-HA chains and the LAP surface (Figure 1D,E). In addition, increased
    LAP concentration from 2% to 4% resulted in a decrease in both the swelling ratio
    and equilibrium water content (Figure 1F,G), suggesting enhanced physical crosslinking
    of the hydrogel with the increased LAP content. Nanoclays including LAP have been
    incorporated into various polymer hydrogels. The mechanical properties of the
    nanocomposite hydrogels are known to be affected by the interactions between polymer
    chains and nanoclay particles.[16] Moreover, the electrostatic interactions between
    G-HA chains and LAP surfaces can be more effective when LAP sheets are fully dispersed
    in water, leading to improved mechanical properties. We used sodium polyacrylate
    (ASAP) to facilitate the homogeneous dispersion of LAP sheets in the hydrogel
    matrix. Similar dispersing agents were used in preparation of nanocomposite hydrogels
    to avoid aggregation of LAP and enhance mechanical performances.[17] Scanning
    electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the microstructure of the hydrogel.
    Nanocomposite hydrogels exhibited a highly porous structure and the increase of
    LAP content to 4% reduced pore size as a result of enhanced crosslinking, leading
    to improved mechanical properties (Figure 1H). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
    (EDX) further confirmed its chemical compositions. The characteristic peaks of
    LAP (Si, Mg) were observed in the EDX spectra, indicating successful incorporation
    of LAP into the hydrogel (Figure 1I). 2.2 Injectability and Self-Healing Properties
    of Nanocomposite Hydrogels The injectability of nanocomposite hydrogels was evaluated
    by directly injecting a G-HA/LAP hydrogel (4% LAP) stained with methylene blue
    into an aqueous environment. The hydrogel was extruded through a 23-gauge needle
    into PBS without clogging (Figure 2A) and maintained an “AB” gel state without
    dispersion (Figure 2B), demonstrating excellent material integrity for use in
    aqueous injection. To evaluate the self-healing ability of the hydrogel, a disk-shaped
    hydrogel sample was stained with rhodamine B (pink) or methylene blue (blue) and
    cut into two pieces (Figure 2C). The two different colored hydrogels were held
    together in intimate contact without external forces and could be merged into
    an integral object after 10 min of healing. The newly formed two hydrogels were
    cut into two pieces again and completely re-joined together into two new integral
    hydrogels, which maintained the shape in PBS overnight, suggesting excellent self-healing
    ability resulting from dynamic noncovalent nanoclay–polymer interactions. These
    results suggested that our newly fabricated hydrogel with injectable potential
    could become a promising candidate for minimally invasive therapy in irregular
    tissue defects. Various LAP-reinforced nanocomposite hydrogels have been previously
    reported. However, most studies incorporated LAP sheets as nanofillers into covalently
    crosslinked polymer networks to confer viscoelastic properties and further enhance
    hydrogel toughness.[17, 18] Although the nanocomposite systems may be beneficial
    for use in load bearing tissues, they require complex reaction processes and lack
    the capability to self-heal. In this study, LAP was used as physical crosslinkers
    to form reversible polymer networks with potential self-healing ability by simply
    attaching guanidine-pendant HA to oxyanion LAP surfaces. Figure 2 Open in figure

    C) Self-healing process of G-HA/LAP hydrogels (4% LAP): (1) two hydrogels stained
    with rhodamine B and methylene blue were cut into two pieces, respectively; (2)
    one piece of pink hydrogel and one piece of blue hydrogel were joined together
    to form two pieces of new hydrogel; (3) the re-joined hydrogels were recut into
    two equal pieces; (4) two pieces of pink-blue hydrogels were joined together to
    form two new hydrogels; the re-joined hydrogels were immersed in PBS overnight.
    D) Strain-dependent (ω = 10 rad s−1, 25 °C) and E) frequency-dependent (ε = 5%,
    25 °C) oscillatory shear rheology of G-HA/LAP hydrogels. Step–strain measurements
    of F) G-HA/2%LAP and G) G-HA/4%LAP at high strains (destructive; 300%) and low
    strains (restorative; 1%) to characterize self-healing capacity of G-HA/LAP hydrogels.
    To further study the self-healing property and mechanical performance, we evaluated
    the rheological behaviors of the hydrogels with different LAP concentrations.
    A frequency-sweep measurement showed that the storage modulus (G′) was greater
    than the loss modulus (G″) over the wide range of angular frequency with fixed
    strain (5%), indicating well-retained gel-like behavior (Figure 2D). A strain-dependent
    oscillatory rheological test showed that the value of G′ was larger than the G″
    value over the large range of strain, indicating the solid-like feature of the
    hydrogel, while the G′ and the G″ curves intersected at the critical strain level,
    indicating the collapse of the hydrogel (Figure 2E and Figure S1, Supporting Information).
    The increase of LAP concentration from 2% to 4% increased G′ of the hydrogel from
    70 to 380 Pa, suggesting enhanced mechanical strength. Next, a step–strain measurement
    was performed to evaluate self-recovery ability after rupture by applying cyclic
    high (300%) and low (1%) strain to the hydrogel. At the low magnitude of strain,
    the G′ value was higher than G″, indicating stable gels. When the applied strain
    increased to 300%, the G″ value became higher than G′, indicating a destruction
    of the hydrogel into a viscous state. After switching back to the low-strain condition,
    the hydrogel recovered immediately, and this property can be repeated for several
    cycles, confirming the self-healing property of the fabricated hydrogel (Figure
    2F,G). 2.3 Biocompatibility and Osteogenic Potential of Nanocomposite Hydrogels
    To evaluate the biocompatibility of G-HA/LAP hydrogels, mouse bone marrow stem
    cells (BMSCs) were encapsulated in the hydrogel and cell proliferation was examined
    using the alamarBlue assay (Figure 3A). HA hydrogels chemically crosslinked without
    LAP were used as the negative control. Previous studies suggest LAP provides favorable
    substrates for the adhesion and proliferation of cells due to its high surface
    area and charge density. MSCs cultured in the nanocomposite hydrogels exhibited
    significant proliferation over the 7-d culture period, which was greater than
    that of LAP-free HA hydrogels. Nanoparticles are known to induce reactive oxygen
    species (ROS) at high concentrations, leading to oxidative stress and cell death.[19]
    A previous study demonstrated that the addition of nanoclays dose-dependently
    increased the generation of ROS in MSCs and preosteoblasts.[20] The increase of
    LAP concentration from 2.0% to 4.5% in our hydrogels did not result in significant
    difference in cell proliferation, indicating that the concentration range of LAP
    applied was not cytotoxic and the low amount was sufficient to support cell attachment
    and growth. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Biocompatibility and osteogenic
    potential of nanocomposite hydrogels in vitro. A) Proliferative ability of the
    encapsulated cells in hydrogels was tested using alarmaBlue assay on days 1, 4,
    and 7. B) Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and C) ALP staining were performed
    to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of the encapsulated cells. D-E) The
    expression of osteogenic gene markers, ALP and Runx2 were tested using qRT-PCR
    assay on day 7. (Mean ± SD, n = 3, **P < 0.01). The osteogenic ability of the
    nanocomposite hydrogel was evaluated by monitoring the expression of alkaline
    phosphatase (ALP) in the encapsulated BMSCs. ALP activity by the biochemical assay
    showed that the addition of LAP led to a significant increase in ALP expression
    up to 4% LAP in a dose dependent manner, and the hydrogel with 4% LAP showed a
    1.6-fold increase in ALP activity compared to 2.0% LAP groups (Figure 3B). Highly
    intense positive ALP staining was observed in the hydrogels with LAP compared
    to LAP-free hydrogels on day 7 (Figure 3C). Osteogenic differentiation of encapsulated
    BMSCs was determined by assessing the expression of osteogenic gene markers with
    qRT-PCR. The results showed that G-HA/LAP hydrogels significantly increased the
    expression of ALP and Runx2 compared to LAP-free hydrogels at day 7 and the increase
    of LAP concentration from 2.0% to 4.0% increased ALP and Runx2 expression levels
    1.6-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively (Figure 3D,E). Previous studies demonstrated
    the ability of nanoclays to induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in the absence
    of osteoinductive factors.[20, 21] Although the exact osteogenic mechanisms are
    not known, a transcriptome study indicates that the innate osteoinductivity of
    nanoclays are attributed to physical (size and surface charge) and chemical (degradation
    products) properties of the nanoclays.[22] LAP nanoclays are known to enhance
    osteogenesis and bone regeneration through its dissolution products such as magnesium,
    lithium, and silicate ions by regulating cell adhesion and Wnt signaling.[13,
    14, 23] These findings indicate that our newly fabricated hydrogel crosslinked
    with LAP can serve as a promising carrier for cells with enhanced osteogenic potential.
    2.4 Preparation and Characterization of DBM-Loaded Hydrogels To evaluate the ability
    of nanocomposite hydrogels to use as a carrier for DBM particles, different concentrations
    (7.5%, 15%, and 31%) of DBM was incorporated into G-HA hydrogels with 4% LAP.
    The incorporation of DBM into the hydrogel was confirmed by picrosirius red staining,
    a standard method to detect collagen (DBM) (Figure S2, Supporting Information).
    The incorporated DBM was released from the hydrogel in a sustained manner while
    DBM combined with unmodified HA (similar to commercial DBX putty) was quickly
    dispersed within 24 h (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The addition of DBM
    into the hydrogel increased the swelling ratio but did not significantly affect
    degradation behaviors with a slight increase with 31% DBM (Figures S4,S5, Supporting
    Information). The strain-dependent oscillatory rheological test and step–strain
    test were conducted to test the self-healing property of the DBM-loaded hydrogel.
    The results showed that G′ was higher than G″ over a wide range of strains, indicating
    the solid-like behavior of the DBM-loaded hydrogel (Figure 4A). The increase of
    DBM concentrations from 7.5% to 31% greatly increased the hydrogel modulus (G′)
    from 9 to 22 kPa. Next, low strain (1%) and high strain (300%) were applied to
    the DBM-loaded hydrogel in turns to test its self-healing properties. With high
    strain, G″ was higher than G′, indicating the destruction of the hydrogel; however,
    with the low strain, the hydrogel immediately recovered back into the solid-like
    stage again. Even with lower concentrations of LAP (2% or 3%), the DBM-loaded
    hydrogel showed self-healing properties as observed in the step–strain test (Figure
    4B).The macroscopic method was used to confirm the self-healing capacity as well.
    Hydrogels (4% LAP) loaded with a high amount of DBM (31%) were mixed with rhodamine
    B (pink) or methylene blue (blue) and cut into two pieces. The different colored
    semi-circle hydrogels were successfully joined into an integral hydrogel disk
    and were able to heal even after second cutting. The newly formed hydrogels well
    maintained their integral state in PBS overnight (Figure 4C). In physiological
    environments, the presence of ions and serum proteins could impede the self-healing
    process of hydrogels by hindering the electrostatic interactions between LAP and
    polymer or by facilitating the nanoclay–nanoclay interactions.[24] We tested the
    hydrogel in more complex aqueous environments mimicking body fluids. The self-healing
    property of the hydrogel was also well maintained in serum (FBS) and simulated
    body fluid (SBF) (Figure S6, Supporting Information). These findings indicate
    that the incorporation of DBM did not destroy the self-healing capacity of the
    hydrogel in biologically relevant fluids. The injectability of the DBM-loaded
    hydrogel was also confirmed by extruding them into aqueous environments. The hydrogel
    (4% LAP) loaded with 31% DBM was successfully extruded through a needle into the
    letters “DBM” and the injected letters well maintained their integrity in PBS
    without dispersion (Figure 4D). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Self-healing

    rhodamine B and methylene blue were cut into two pieces, respectively; (2) one
    piece of pink hydrogel and one piece of blue hydrogel were joined together to
    form two pieces of new hydrogel; (3) the re-joined hydrogels were recut into two
    equal pieces; (4) two pieces of pink-blue hydrogels were joined together to form
    two new hydrogels; the re-joined hydrogels were immersed in PBS overnight. D)

    solution and images of G-HA/LAP/DBM hydrogels injected onto a petri dish to form
    letters “AB” and immersed in PBS. A recent study incorporated LAP into photo-curable
    methacrylated HA to create a composite hydrogel for wound healing.[18] However,
    chemically crosslinked hydrogels typically possess relatively slow degradation
    and stress relaxation properties, which may adversely affect cell behaviors and
    hinder tissue ingrowth in vivo. A study by Kim et al. used LAP as physical crosslinkers
    to form stable hydrogels with bisphosphonate-conjugated HA.[25] Although the nanoclay–HA
    complexation generates self-assembling hydrogels, the study was limited to exploring
    protein binding ability for localized and sustained drug delivery. Our data showed
    high DBM loading over 31% into G-HA/LAP hydrogels without compromising their overall
    physical competence and self-healing ability due to G-HA guanidine interactions
    with LAP nanosheets exhibiting unique surface charge characteristics, making it
    highly desirable as malleable carriers for bone grafting materials. 2.5 Osteoinductivity
    of DBM-Loaded hydrogels To further study the osteogenic effect of the DBM-loaded
    hydrogel, BMSCs were encapsulated in the G-HA hydrogel (4% LAP) with different
    amounts of DBM. The hydrogel/DBM composites supported the growth of the encapsulated
    cell for 7 d as measured by the alamarBlue assay and the proliferation rate was
    significantly increased with the incorporation of DBM (Figure 5A). DBM is a collagen-based
    material, which can serve as a favorable substrate for cell attachment and proliferation.
    The osteogenic activity of the hydrogel/DBM composites was evaluated by assessing
    ALP activity and osteogenic gene expression. The incorporation of DBM into the
    hydrogel significantly increased ALP activity until day 7, especially with 15%
    and 31% DBM. The expression level of osteogenic genes was measured by qRT-PCR
    on day 14, the results showed that the hydrogel/DBM composites significantly enhanced
    the expression of ALP, Runx2, and OCN compared to DBM-free control hydrogels (Figure
    5C–E). The concentration of DBM incorporated did not affect the proliferation
    rate of encapsulated cells but resulted in a dose-dependent increase of osteogenesis,
    indicating bioactivity of osteoinductive factors (BMPs) contained in DBM. These
    studies collectively indicate that our fabricated hydrogel could serve as a promising
    delivery system for DBM powder, and DBM cooperating with LAP stimulates the osteogenesis
    of encapsulated BMSCs. Moreover, the LAP-hydrogel systems can be loaded with drugs
    and osteoinductive factors to further enhance the osteogenic capacity of DBM.
    LAP nanoparticles have been previously used as delivery vehicles in hydrogels
    for sustained release of therapeutic agents.[26] The high surface area and charge
    characteristics of LAP allow for the efficient adsorption and delivery of small
    molecules and proteins. Previous studies demonstrated sustained release of BMP-2
    and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with LAP particles,[27] which may
    be beneficial for use with DBM to enhance BMP signaling pathway or angiogenesis
    in DBM-mediated osteogenesis and bone formation. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer

    loaded with different percentage of DBM (G-HA/LAP/DBM) in vitro. A) Proliferative
    ability of the encapsulated cells in hydrogels was tested using alarmaBlue assay
    on days 1, 4, and 7. B) Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were performed to
    evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of the encapsulated cells on days 4 and
    7. C-E) The expression of osteogenic gene markers, ALP, Runx2, and OCN were tested
    using qRT-PCR assay on day 7. (Mean ± SD, n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
    0.001). 2.6 In Vivo Osteoinductivity of DBM-Loaded Hydrogels We investigated the
    in vivo bone regeneration capacity of DBM-loaded hydrogels using a critical-sized
    mouse calvarial defect model (Figure 6). Eight weeks postoperatively, reconstructed
    microcomputed tomography (microCT) scanning images show that G-HA/LAP/DBM group
    exhibited superior new bone formation compared to the defects treated with HA/DBM
    or G-HA/LAP, while the control group displayed the least progression of bone tissue
    formation. Moreover, quantitative assessment of parameters including relative
    area of new bone, ratio of bone volume to tissue volume (BV/TV), and trabecular
    number corroborated these trends. Specifically, the G-HA/LAP/DBM group exhibited
    a newly formed bone area of ≈44%, which stood in significant contrast to ≈15%
    in the control group, ≈32% in HA/DBM, and ≈23% in G-HA/LAP. Furthermore, the G-HA/LAP/DBM
    group had the highest BV/TV (≈32%) and trabecular number (≈2.3), while corresponding
    values in the control group were notably lower at ≈9% and ≈0.9, respectively.

    arrow heads indicate new bone formation and blue arrow heads indicate DBM particles.
    (Mean ± SD, n = 6, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). The radiographic findings were further
    supported by histological assessments using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson''s
    trichrome staining, as depicted in Figure 6E. Among the treatment groups, the
    G-HA/LAP/DBM group demonstrated a large amount of newly formed bone tissues and
    stably retained DBM particles throughout the entire defect area. In contrast,
    HA/DBM hydrogels exhibited limited bone formation and implanted DBM particles
    were primarily found only at the periphery of the defect. The microCT and histological
    findings unequivocally underscored the enhanced osteogenic potential of DBM delivered
    with G-HA/LAP hydrogels compared to DBM combined with conventional HA solutions.
    Significantly, the distinct osteogenic effects of G-HA/LAP/DBM can be attributed
    to both LAP and structural integrity of the hydrogel carrier. Beyond its intrinsic
    osteogenic properties, LAP augmented structural stability of the hydrogels due
    to strong interactions between G-HA and LAP, resulting in efficient localization
    of DBM particles within the calvarial defects and cooperative promotion of osteogenesis.
    These results indicate that the new hydrogel system improves the effectiveness
    of DBM in the regeneration of bone tissue. The carriers used in current DBM products
    include carboxymethylcellulose (Bacterin''s OsteoSelect), glycerol (LifeNet Health''s
    Optium), and sodium hyaluronate (MTF Biologics’ DBX). Although these carriers
    are beneficial to handling characteristics, they have limited osteogenic properties.
    Our G-HA/LAP hydrogel itself exerted osteogenic effects in vitro and in calvarial
    defects. Although significant batch-to-batch variability of DBM makes comparisons
    difficult, DBM combined with the G-HA/LAP hydrogel still mediated inferior bone
    formation to autologous bone grafts likely due to the lack of stem/progenitor
    cells and inadequate vascular supply. Due to insufficient osteoinductive properties,
    DBM is mainly used as bone graft extenders or in combination with other potent
    agents such as recombinant BMP-2. Nonetheless, our G-HA/LAP/DBM group formed superior
    bone tissue compared to the commercial DBX-like control group (HA/DBM). Given
    the important role of BMP antagonists in regulating BMP signaling,[6, 28] future
    study will focus on the abrogation of BMP antagonism to further enhance the potency
    of natural BMPs present in DBM and improved clinical efficacy of DBM for accelerated
    bone repair. 3 Conclusion We developed a new hydrogel carrier for particulate
    bone grafts such as DBM for more robust bone regeneration. The hydrogel carrier
    was prepared by the self-assembly of guanidinylated polysaccharides with LAP nanosheets,
    where LAP works as a physical crosslinker to form dynamic polymer networks and
    provide favorable osteogenic environments. The created nanocomposite hydrogel
    exhibited injectable and self-healing capability, which can facilitate graft handling,
    delivery and containment at the defect site. The hydrogel displayed excellent
    in vitro cytocompatibility and pro-osteogenic activity. In addition, the hydrogel
    possessed high DBM loading capacity without compromising its overall performance.
    Finally, in vivo bone formation assessment demonstrated efficacious bone defect
    repair compared to current DBM putty prepared with liquid carriers. This work
    presents a promising polymeric carrier system to improve clinical efficacy of
    current bone graft therapeutics. 4 Experimental Section Materials Sodium hyaluronate
    100k Mw was purchased from Lifecore Biomedical. Aminoguanidine, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
    (EDC), sodium polyacrylate (ASAP), rhodamine, methylene blue, nitro blue tetrazolium
    (NBT), Alizarin red S, l-ascorbic acid, p-nitrophenol phosphate, β-glycerophosphate,
    and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Dithiothreitol
    (DTT) and dithiobis(propanoic dihydrazide) (DTP) were purchased from Thermo Fisher
    Scientific (Waltham, MA). Laponite XLG was obtained from Best of Chemicals (Shirley,
    NY). alamarBlue, Dulbecco''s modified Eagle''s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum
    (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), TRIzol reagents, Calcein AM, and ethidium
    homodimer (EthD-1) were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Guanidinylation
    of Sodium Hyaluronate (G-HA) 200 mg sodium hyaluronate was dissolved in 20 mL
    distilled water. 206.6 mg EDC and 207.0 mg aminoguanidine were added while stirring.
    The reaction was kept for 16 h at room temperature at a pH of 4.70. The reacted
    solution was dialyzed in a dialysis bag with MWCO 3.5 kDa against distilled water
    for 48 h. The water was refreshed every 12 h. The dialyzed solution was then lyophilized
    for 3 d and stored in −20 °C freezer before use. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated
    total reflection (FTIR-ATR, Nicolet iS10, ThermoFisher Scientific) was utilized
    to determine the chemical bonds of HA and G-HA. FTIR-ATR characterization was
    performed using absorbance mode with 64 scans at a wavenumber of 4000–500 cm−1.
    Thiolation of Sodium Hyaluronate 500 mg of sodium hyaluronate was dissolved in
    50 mL of distilled water. 590 mg DTP and 400 mg EDC were added while stirring
    and pH was adjusted to 4.80. After around 10–15 min, pH was adjusted to 8.80 once
    the solution reached the desired hydrogel consistency. 900 mg DTT was added and
    reacted overnight at room temperature. The sample was dialyzed in NaCl solution
    (11.69 g NaCl was dissolved in 2 L of distilled water and the pH was adjusted
    to 3.50 with 1 m HCl) for 2 d and the dialysis bath was changed daily. Later,
    the sample was dialyzed with distilled water (adjusted pH to 3.50 with 1 m HCl)
    for another 2 d and the dialysis bath was changed daily. The final product was
    obtained after being fully freeze-dried. Preparation of Negative Control Hydrogel
    Thiolated sodium hyaluronate was dissolved in PBS to obtain a 3% solution, and
    the pH was then adjusted to 6.5–7.0. Samples were put back into the incubator
    under 37 °C for 10–20 min to form the hydrogel. Preparation and Characterization
    of G-HA/LAP Hydrogel Different concentrations of LAP, G-HA, and ASAP were dissolved
    in distilled water, respectively, while stirring. To form the hydrogel, laponite
    and ASAP were mixed, and G-HA was added using the vortex. The gelation time of
    the nanocomposite hydrogels with different LAP concentration was measured using
    a vial-tilting method and the vials were photographed. The compressive properties
    of the nanocomposite hydrogels were tested using an UniVert kN Mechanical Test
    System with a 20 N load cell (CellScale). Specifically, hydrogel samples with
    a cylindrical shape (diameter = 10 mm, height = 5 mm) were tested at a crosshead
    speed of 60 mm min−1. The compressive stress versus strain curves were plotted
    using the data calculated from force, displacement, and sample dimension. The
    compressive modulus was measured from the linear region of the stress–strain curve
    between 0 and 50% strain. To determine the swelling ratio and water content of
    the hydrogel with different LAP, hydrogels were immersed in PBS for 24 h and then
    freeze-dried for 24 h. The swelling ratio was calculated using Equation (1) (1)
    where Wswollen and Winitial were the weight of swollen and initial hydrogels,
    respectively. The water content of the hydrogels was calculated using Equation
    (2) (2) where Wswollen and Wdried refer to the weight of swollen and lyophilized
    hydrogels, respectively. Microstructure and elemental composition of lyophilized
    nanocomposite hydrogels with varied LAP concentrations were characterized using
    scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX,
    FEI Nova NanoSEM 230, Hillsboro, OR). To test the moldable properties of nanocomposite
    hydrogels, G-HA/LAP hydrogel (4% LAP) was injected from a 23-G needle into PBS
    buffer solution. The hydrogel was also injected onto a petri dish to form letters
    “AB” and immersed in PBS. To evaluate the self-healing properties of the hydrogels,
    either methylene blue or rhodamine (1 mg mL−1) was added to generate the blue
    or pink hydrogel. One piece of blue hydrogel and one piece of pink hydrogel were
    cut into two pieces respectively. One piece of pink hydrogel and one piece of
    blue one was joined together to form two pieces of new hydrogel. The re-joined
    hydrogels were cut into two pieces again and joined together. Two pieces of hydrogel
    were immersed in PBS overnight. The rheological properties of the hydrogel were
    measured using Discovery Hybrid Rheometers HR-3 (TA Instruments) with a 50 mm
    cone plate geometry (cone angle: 2°). The frequency sweep was measured at shear
    strain = 5% from 0.1 to 100 rad s−1. Strain sweep was measured from 0.02% to 300%
    strain with a constant 10 rad s−1 frequency. Step–strain measurements of the hydrogel
    at high strains (destructive; 300%) and low strains (restorative; 1%) were performed
    to characterize self-healing capacity of G-HA/LAP hydrogels. Cell Encapsulation
    in the Hydrogel Cell culture media was prepared to contain DMEM with 10% FBS and
    1% P/S. 2 × 106 mouse bone marrow stem cells were collected in 50 µL culture media
    and suspended into 300 µL Laponite mixed with 50 µL ASAP and 100 µL G-HA using
    vortex. 50 µL 10× PBS was added to balance pH to 7.40. 50 µL gel with the encapsulation
    of the BMSCs was dropped into a 24-well plate, and 1 mL culture media was added
    into each well. Cultural media was changed every 2 d. To measure the biocompatibility
    of the hydrogel, the viability of the encapsulated BMSCs was monitored over 14
    d using alamarBlue assay. Hydrogel was incubated in cultural media plus 10% alamarBlue
    for 3 h in the 37 °C incubator. The fluorescence intensity was measured with the
    microplate reader with 570 nm excitation and 585 nm emission. ALP expression and
    activity and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR): Hydrogel
    with the cell encapsulation was incubated in the osteogenic media (DMEM media
    + 10% FBS + 50 µg mL−1 l-ascorbic acid + 10 × 10−3 m β- glycerophosphate + 1%
    P/S + 100 × 10−9 m dexamethasone) for different time periods. After the fix with
    10% formalin for 30 min, the hydrogel was immersed in the ALP solution (100 ×
    10−3 m Tris + 50 × 10−3 m MgCl2 + 100 × 10−3 m NaCl and adjusted pH to 8.5) for
    10 min and stained with BCIP/NBT solution for 2 h. Images were taken with the
    Olympus IX71 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For the detection of the ALP
    activity, hydrogel was washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (0.1% Tween-20).
    The supernatant was collected after the spinning at 12 000 rpm for 5 min and the
    absorbance was measured at 405 nm wavelength after reacting with p-nitrophenol
    phosphate substrate for 2 h at 37 °C. The value was normalized with the total
    amount of protein that was tested via BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
    IL). As for the qRT-PCR assay, at different time points, total RNA was extracted
    with Trizol and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was reverse-transcribed
    into cDNA with SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 1 µL cDNA
    template + 1 µL of primers + 8 µL distilled deionized water + 10 µL of SYBR Green
    was applied for amplification procedure with LightCycler 480 PCR (Roche, Indianapolis,
    IN). Calvarial Defect Model All animal experiments were conducted strictly under
    the supervision and approved by the Chancellor''s Animal Research Committee (ARC)
    at the University of California, Los Angeles and followed the instruction of the
    UCLA Office of Animal Research Oversight. With anesthesia, full thickness calvarial
    defects (3 mm) were drilled on the parietal bone in mice with the trephine drill.
    Defects were filled with hydrogels from each group. After the surgery, all mice
    fully recovered from anesthesia and were transported to the vivarium for later
    care. For pain management, mice were injected with buprenorphine for 3 d. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
    was applied to the drinking water for 7 d to prevent infection. Microcomputerized
    Tomography Scanning After eight weeks of surgery, calvaria tissue was collected
    and samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 2 d at room temperature
    with gentle shaking. Samples were transferred into 70% ethanol before scanning.
    High-resolution micro-CT images were taken by using SkyScan 1272 (Bruker, Kontich,
    Belgium) with 60 kV, 184 µA, 0.25 mm aluminum filtration, and 20 µm resolution.
    Necon, DataViewer, and CTVox softwares (Bruker-microCT program) were used to reconstruct
    the 3D structure and analyze the bone formation. Image J software (NIH, Bethesda,
    MD) was used to measure the relative area of new bone. The bone volume density
    (BV/TV, %) and trabecular number were measured using the CTAn software (Bruker
    microCT). Histological Evaluation After the scan of the micro-CT, the fixed samples
    were immersed in 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution for 5 d with
    gentle shaking. The samples were embedded in paraffin and cut at a thickness of
    5 µm. H&E and Masson''s trichrome staining were performed and the sections were
    observed using the Olympus IX71 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) to determine the new
    bone formation. Statistical Analysis Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical
    analyses were performed using two-tailed t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey, with
    *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 considered statistically significant.

    Revolution has pushed many countries with agriculture-based economies to introduce
    reforms, resulting in rapid agricultural growth. The world’s agricultural growth
    can be assessed from the fact that only in China has total grain production reached
    117% with a 2% annual increase [1]. The agriculture-based gross domestic product
    (GDP) is growing at a rate of 9.4% [2] worldwide. There are still opportunities
    to double agricultural productivity by adopting mechanized practices that enhance
    crop yields as well as crop intensity [3]. The prime input for agricultural production
    is water, which is even more important in irrigated agriculture and plays a vital
    role in food security. Irrigated agriculture represents one-fifth of agricultural
    land and about half of the production is being cultivated directly from irrigated
    agriculture, screening its potential for crop production with more diversification
    and intensification [4]. According to a study [5], 80% of cereal crops and 90%
    of vegetable crops are being grown under irrigated agriculture; therefore, this
    sector is being expanded in many countries through the introduction of essential
    and mechanized irrigation practices. This development of irrigated areas can be
    assessed from the growth of irrigated land in China (Figure 1) due to it being
    one of the world’s leading agricultural economies [1]. Figure 1. Development of
    irrigated areas in China (1950–2020) [6,7]. Growth in irrigated land demands more
    irrigation water and triggers the issue of water security. Being a major consumer,
    the world’s agriculture sector uses more than 70% of available freshwater [8].
    The per capita water availability is decreasing all over the world and it has
    been projected that by 2050, 45 countries will be water scared (<500 m3/capita/annum)
    and 87 will be at the margin (<1700 m3/capita/annum) out of 180 countries [9],
    indicating increasing pressure on available water resources for the production
    of food to feed growing populations [10]. The provision of surface water resources
    to highly irrigated areas and the effective management of available resources
    are the only methods to sustain development in the agriculture sector to ensure
    the world’s food security with environmental sustainability [5]. This problem
    can be mitigated from two sides. One side is the enhancement of water availability
    by building storage infrastructures and the other side is the efficient use of
    water at the farm level [11,12,13]. In this respect, several projects in the 1990s
    were launched throughout the world to introduce water-efficient techniques for
    improving application efficiencies of traditional irrigation practices [14]. Under
    traditional irrigation systems, water is applied at constant intervals without
    considering the crop water requirements and the application efficiencies of these
    methods are also low as varying amounts of water are applied throughout the field.
    This uneven irrigation could over-irrigate a portion of the land while the other
    portion may experience water stress due to less irrigation [15,16,17]. Sprinkler
    irrigation is a type of high-efficiency irrigation system that has been used at
    the farm level since the late 1970s. This technology has proven its capability
    to save significant amounts of irrigation water with greater uniformity compared
    with other surface irrigation methods (basin, border, beds, furrow, etc.) [18,19]
    in addition to improvement in yield and fertilizer management with less leaching
    effects [20]. The proven facts regarding the benefits of sprinkler irrigation
    have encouraged farmer communities to use this method as an alternate system to
    overcome the problem of low application efficiency at the farm level. This technology
    has become very popular in Western countries, mainly in the USA and Europe with
    areas of 3 Mha and 2.5 Mha, respectively, under sprinkler irrigation until the
    1970s [21]. Many countries like Australia, Israel, China, etc., have developed
    and adopted different types of sprinkler irrigation systems and these are very
    popular in these countries. The adoption rate of sprinkler irrigation has been
    reported as 4.78% [22]. In China, the government is promoting the sprinkler irrigation
    system by launching demonstration projects at farmer fields, providing funds to
    research institutions to carry out research work, and launching subsidies for
    industries to manufacture sprinkler components at the indigenous level. The effectiveness
    of these exertions is demonstrated by the fact (Figure 1) that sprinkler irrigation
    is being adopted by farmers at a high rate and is replacing other irrigation practices
    at their farms. The water and fertilizer efficiency of sprinkler irrigation could
    be further enhanced by introducing advanced interventions like precision irrigation
    practices within the regular operation of manually operated sprinkler irrigation
    systems. The precision irrigation system is a combination of an irrigation system
    coupled with a control system, communication system, and information system for
    water applications in a precise and automatic way to achieve the highest possible
    crop water productivity [23,24]. It has been reported that by adopting sprinkler
    irrigation with precision application tools, maximum economic benefits can be
    driven [25,26]. To understand the effectiveness and applicability of precision
    irrigation for absolute water management at the farm level, previous research
    needs to be reviewed in a meaningful way to identify the research trends and hot
    spot directions for future research work within the subject field. The present
    review paper is an effort to examine the available literature related to sprinkler
    irrigation and precision irrigation using quantitative analysis in a systematic
    way. A careful identification of key influential factors affecting the development
    of sprinkler irrigation toward precision application methods was carried out to
    draw conclusions and thereby provide a state-of-the-art understanding of the topic
    to readers. The purpose of this work is to describe the insights of the research
    topic, understand the ambiguities and research gaps within the scope, and draw
    consistencies between prior research work and future research directions for researchers.
    2. Review Strategy and Exploration of Literature The spatial and temporal growth
    of research databases on a massive scale created a momentum toward summarizing
    research findings in an organized manner, leading to the development of new, systematic
    approaches to literature review since the start of the 21st century [27,28,29].
    A huge number of scholarly literatures on the use of sprinklers and precision
    irrigation in the disciplines of agriculture and engineering is available; therefore,
    systematically productive approaches were taken into account to assess the advanced
    knowledge on said subjects. To start the review process, the domain of this paper
    was divided into two major portions called sub-domains. These included (1) “sprinkler
    irrigation” and (2) “precision irrigation”. Other topics related to “irrigation
    water management” were taken in the study as a miscellaneous domain. The development
    in the research volume regarding these domains and published review papers can
    be seen in Figure 2, presents the volume of literature available only in one database
    (PubMed). This gradual growth in particular research work demands the summarization
    of research outcomes of different researchers to set future research directions
    in the subject field. Figure 2. The production of research publications related
    to specific topics from January 2005 to May 2023. The methodology adopted in the
    present study is inspired by the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [30]. A new strategy was
    designed by intergrading the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the review approaches
    used by other researchers [31,32,33]. The literature related to each sub-domain
    was searched according to four approaches, illustrated in Figure 3. These approaches
    involved searching research papers based on manuscript titles, the keywords, the
    institution affiliation, and the citations of published articles. To achieve a
    speedy review, all searches were conducted using online scholar databases including
    Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, Science Direct, Springer, MDPI, Taylor & Francis,
    and journal websites. In these huge scholarly libraries, numerous research articles
    are available related to sprinkler irrigation and precision irrigation; therefore,
    a sturdy criterion was developed and adopted for the selection of the most influential
    research findings to eliminate unsuitable search results. Figure 3. Illustration
    of the mechanism through which information on the sub-domains of this paper was
    summarized and extracted. 2.1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria A comprehensive criteria

    summary using inclusion/exclusion criteria. 2.2. Summary of the Review Process
    The information was reviewed from renowned research databases and journal websites.

    is a type of pressurized irrigation that irrigates crops by spraying water in
    the form of small droplets like natural rainfall. It has numerous advantages over
    surface irrigation or even over other pressurized irrigation technologies like
    drip irrigation as it can not only apply water to a crop but also flush its leaves
    and regulate canopy temperature to improve the efficiency of the photosynthesis
    process. Many research studies have been conducted on sprinkler irrigation that
    proved its viability and adoptability for economically higher crop production
    [34,35,36,37]. These systems have some limitations and disadvantages over other
    pressurized irrigation systems. These disadvantages include higher capital and
    operational costs, damage to soft fruit plants, low application efficiency in
    windy areas, and unsuitability for fields with fine textured soil [38]. Under
    humid conditions, moisture-related diseases may emerge within the crop canopy
    due to the presence of excessive moisture after the application of overhead sprinklers
    [39]. Romero et al. [40] reported the outbreak of fungal-related diseases within
    crop plants grown under humid and warm conditions. Belo et al. [41] reported management
    techniques including irrigation time and frequencies to reduce the risks of spreading
    bacterial-related diseases due to heavy moisture and dirt being splashed into
    the plant canopy of onion plants. But on the other hand, foliar water application
    by using an overhead sprinkler is beneficial for plants and good for protecting
    plants against frost when the temperature is at or below zero °C [42]. Despite
    these minimal limitations, sprinkler irrigation has marvelous advantages with
    high water application efficiency in the field [43]. The field application efficiency
    of different irrigation systems in comparison with different sprinkler types is
    illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6. Application efficiencies of different types
    of sprinkler systems. 3.1. Types of Sprinkler Systems In the early usage of sprinkler
    systems, single-point sprinklers were used with moveable positions, and the water
    was supplied to sprinklers through iron pipes [7]. The iron pipes were susceptible
    to erosion and heavy when moving sprinklers from one place to another. Iron pipes
    were replaced with aluminum pipes in the first phase and then with plastic/PVC
    pipes along with plentiful progress in the design of irrigation systems in the
    late 1990s [44]. By increasing the understanding of sprinkler systems, moveable
    machines were developed with sprinkler nozzles that can be transported throughout
    the field to irrigate entire areas with the same sprinkler setup. This kind of
    sprinkler system has high application efficiencies and more irrigation coverage
    with less labor requirements. This form of sprinkler system has many types and
    is adopted as per field conditions due to specific limitations associated with
    each type. The features and distribution uniformities (DUs) of different sprinkler
    systems were obtained from the literature [43,45] and are shown in Table 1. Generally,
    Equation (1) is used to calculate the DU of a sprinkler irrigation system. The
    DU range of each sprinkler type is provided in Table 1. The DU depends on the
    crop type, field condition, and environmental exposure of a sprinkler system.
    The maximum DU value belongs to lab experiments and the minimum value belongs
    to field conditions. 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝐷𝑈)= 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ

    types of sprinkler systems [43]. The center pivot system has many advantages over
    other types; therefore, this type of system has been installed in more than 13%
    of the area under sprinkler irrigation in China [46]. Researchers are working
    on a center pivot system to increase its efficiencies via a nozzle configuration
    corresponding to the particular movement speed [47,48]. Ma et al. studied the
    uniformity and the application efficacies of a two-span center pivot system and
    reported a 66.1–68.4% uniformity coefficient [49]. Several other researchers worked
    on other types of moveable sprinklers and conducted performance tests to determine
    their suitability and to improve the characteristics of existing systems [50,51,52,53].
    Hand-mover gravity sprinklers are mostly used in hilly areas where sufficient
    gravitational head is available to operate sprinklers without irrigation pumps
    [54]. 3.2. Sprinkler Nozzle Sprinkler nozzles are key components in the whole
    sprinkler system and their uniform operation determines the efficiency of the
    system. The study of sprinkler nozzles was limited before the 1970s; however,
    the topics gradually received attention due to the increasing demand for sprinkler
    systems. In the late 1970s, work on designing impact sprinklers was started by
    an industrial group, and a series of sprinkler nozzles were designed with varying
    diameters (20 mm to 80 mm inner diameter). The Chinese government put a special
    effort into the development of new sprinkler nozzles by reverse engineering imported
    sophisticated nozzles and promoting research and development in the same area
    [50,55]. Currently, researchers and enterprises have been working on the development
    of new products and refining the hydraulic performance of existing sprinklers
    with structural improvements. Low-pressure sprinklers are an example of the improvement
    in the design of existing sprinklers. The research and development (R&D) work
    by researchers on sprinkler characteristics is presented in Table 2. 3.3. Low-Pressure
    Sprinklers The increase in energy demand and its high cost are forcing researchers
    to introduce new developments in the existing irrigation technologies so that
    these systems could still be used as a viable source in the new era. Normal sprinkler
    irrigation is operated at a high pressure of around (≥300 KPa), causing more energy
    consumption [56]. The low-pressure sprinkler is a new addition to the existing
    technology, enabling users to operate sprinklers at <200 KPa and subsequently
    lowering operating costs with different management strategies [56,57,58]. The
    key principle of designing a low-pressure sprinkler is to change the internal
    nozzle structure to reduce the operating pressure without compromising the dispersion
    uniformity of water droplets. Table 2. Research work on sprinkler nozzles by researchers.
    Li et al. designed a low-pressure rotary sprinkler with different dimensions of
    scatters and evaluated its performance; the authors reported satisfactory results
    regarding all selected performance parameters [47]. Other researchers improved
    the jet dispersion in low-pressure sprinklers by introducing a pair of aerated
    pipes inside the sprinkler nozzle [70]. The optimal groove numbers were identified
    during a series of experiments using D3000 range sprinklers after changing their
    plate structure [71]. Wang et al. [72] derived empirical equations for low-pressure
    sprinklers for operation under varying operating conditions and design parameters
    [73]. Ouazaa et al. derived a calculation model for cunnings of water distribution
    using low-pressure sprinklers [74]. Besides the changes in sprinkler design, researchers
    improved the field performance of sprinkler irrigation systems by optimizing the
    pipeline structure to reduce energy loss in order to promote the use of low-pressure
    sprinklers [75]. Tsaboula et al. studied the effects of different wind speeds
    on water spray through low-pressure sprinklers [76]. 3.4. Sprinkler Irrigation
    Use for Crop Production The use of sprinkler irrigation is not only for water
    saving but also to improve crop yield and reduce crop production costs by limiting
    crop inputs. Sprinkler irrigation has many advantages over other pressurized irrigation
    methods (drip irrigation) including rain characteristics and delivery of higher
    amounts of water during irrigation in time units. Sprinkler irrigation systems
    can be effective in large areas with less costly installation costs. The regular
    operation, maintenance, and operational troubleshooting of sprinkler irrigation
    systems are easier than drip irrigation. The benefits of sprinkler systems over
    other irrigation systems have been reported by many researchers [77,78,79,80,81,82].
    Sprinkler irrigation can be applied to a variety of crops, soils, and field conditions
    compared with other systems. These are efficient for keeping crops well flourished
    and maximizing yield; therefore, about 6% of irrigated area in China has been
    covered with sprinkler irrigation [7]. Some prolific findings regarding better
    crop production under sprinkler irrigation are given in Table 3. Table 3. The
    benefits of the use of sprinkler irrigation for crop production. To obtain better
    crop response under a sprinkler system, the fertilizer must be applied with water
    for the highest crop productivity. The overall fertilizer use efficiency has been
    reported at only 30% [89], which can be improved by its application using sprinkler
    irrigation systems. The injection of fertilizer via sprinkler irrigation is only
    possible with the use of injection devices. Different injection devices and application
    methods have been reported according to specific operating or field conditions
    [41,90,91,92]. Irrigation water and fertilizer could be further saved using variable
    rate technology (VRT), which means specific water application on a particular
    portion of the field [93]. The first VRT system was introduced in Asia in 2014
    [94] followed by continuous research work on modifications of VRT systems. One
    researcher attuned the variable spray of the sprinkler nozzle by changing the
    operating pressure, flow rate, and internal structure [95], while another researcher
    invented the variable spray mechanism of CPS using infrared thermography [96].
    A GPS-based operating system was developed by a group of scientists, which can
    apply fertilizer at variable rates by changing the duty cycle and pivoting the
    operating speed [54]. In present times, VRT machines are capable of applying water
    and fertilizers as per the soil conditions and plant needs [97]. 3.5. Sprinkler
    Design for Better Microclimate and Associated Field Losses Sprinkler systems revolutionized
    farm irrigation methods with marvelous advantages. The efficiency of these systems
    is associated with the design of pumping systems, delivery pipes, and sprinkler
    devices according to the crops, weather, and field conditions [98]. The optimum
    design and selection of sprinkler components can be helpful in installing a system
    with economical cost and better performance for crop growing. Several techniques
    for designing sprinkler systems are available including graphical, analytical,
    and simulation techniques [99]. Bing et al. introduced the genetic algorithm (GA)
    technique for the design of an efficient irrigation system based on simulation
    research work [100]. Other researchers reported the use of binary coding genetic
    algorithms (BCGAs) for optimum water applications to different crops [101]; general
    genetic algorithms (GGAs) for irrigation scheduling, rotation, and its distribution
    [102]; and the use of single parent genetic algorithms (SPGAs) for space–time
    canal discharge distribution for irrigation rotation [103]. Liu et al. incorporated
    the weighting method (digital) using the MATLAB (R2013b) toolbox to analyze the
    distribution pattern of droplet size and identified the variation trends in distribution
    frequency under changing pressure at varying radial distances from sprinkler nozzles
    [104]. Based on the single-sprinkler installation approach, a line source sprinkler
    system with optimized design parameters was established using the analytical approach
    at Ferdowsi University [105]. These developed techniques are for the design of
    sprinkler systems for successful field operation with the ability to save significant
    amounts of irrigation water and create favorable conditions for crops by modifying
    field microclimate. Controlling field microclimate is an advantage that is associated
    with sprinkler irrigation for controlling the factors of high temperature and
    low humidity [106]. Hot wind drifts can cause an average of 5–10% yield loss that
    could be up to 20–30% under severe climate conditions. Similar results have also
    been reported by other researchers regarding abnormal crop growth and the reduction
    in final biomass [107,108]. Liu et al. conducted long-term scenario studies on
    sprinkler systems for winter wheat and reported a reduction in ambient crop temperature,
    low vapor pressure, and less transpiration [109]. The advantage of sprinkler applications
    also included improvement in photosynthesis and low respiration rates [110,111].
    Moreover, the positive impact of water spray on the temperature of the soil’s
    upper layer and the canopy temperature has been proven in other research works
    [112]. Cai et al. conducted a study on optimizing CPS to regulate field microclimate
    and reported improvement in the peak splits of temperature difference and photosynthesis
    rate [113]. Besides these optimistic impacts, there are some undesirable losses
    associated with sprinkler irrigation in terms of wind drift and evaporation. A
    small portion of the discharging water from sprinkler nozzles in the form of thin
    drops does not reach the crop canopy and evaporates in the air during its transfer,
    which is called wind drift or evaporation losses in sprinklers [114,115,116].
    The researchers’ findings provide evidence that the scale of wind drift depends
    on wind speed and weather conditions [117,118] and it varies from 3.6 to 7.2%
    [119]. Colombo et al. reported 3.38% losses of wind drift under the regular operation
    of CPS [120]. The variation in wind drift was examined by Playan et al. in a number
    of experiments (52 in 2004 and 39 in 2005) and reported the range of the magnitude
    of losses as 4.3–14.7 in 2004 and 0.3–8.3% in 2005 [121]. The wind drift losses
    in cold cum semi-arid climates were reported as 3.3–13.7% [122] and the same for
    Mediterranean regions as 5.8–36.4% [123]. Yazar revealed the average wind drift
    losses for various operating conditions and types of systems as 1.7–30.7% [124].
    These losses should be controlled otherwise these can cause water and energy loss
    as well as a reduction in crop yield and poor quality [125], which eventually
    increases production costs and decreases net income. Mole reported that 30–50%
    of total wind drift losses are due to direct evaporation from the air and the
    remaining part is due to the wind drifting [126]. The wind drift losses could
    be minimized by optimizing the operating pressure, speed of the vehicle, and sprinkler
    type. It was reported that the 1-Wob sprinkler has better efficiency and causes
    less drift losses [127]. Sandeghai et al. developed a multiple linear regression
    model to predict wind drift losses for various weather conditions under varying
    operating conditions [116]. Using the model, the worker can set the operating
    conditions as per the weather situation so that the wind drift losses can be minimized.
    By using the guidelines developed by different researchers [128,129,130], drift
    losses can be controlled to improve the application efficiency of sprinkler systems.
    4. Precision Irrigation Using Sprinklers Sprinkler irrigation systems can apply
    water and fertilizer precisely but manually operated sprinkler systems involve
    labor for their operation; moreover, it is difficult to apply irrigation as per
    the real-time crop water requirement, whereas precision irrigation is the latest
    water-saving technique for maximizing yield and providing water at a desired location
    based on actual crop water demand [15,131,132,133,134,135,136,137]. The potential
    of water saving with precision irrigation through sprinkler systems has been reported
    as 30% compared with conventional sprinkler systems [138]. The concept of precision
    irrigation is based on the temporal and spatial variation in the application rate
    of irrigation systems based on real-time crop water requirements [25,26]. The
    entire field or application area is tackled as small parts or zones having the
    same water requirement at a particular time. Then, irrigation is applied in every
    zone in the desired quantity using a smart application mechanism attached to an
    irrigation system. Precision irrigation keeps every part of the field at optimum
    moisture level for proper plant growth in a uniform way [139], which improves
    its productivity, yield quality, and water use efficiency [140]. Researchers studied
    water application via sprinklers using the principles of precision irrigation
    and reported marvelous results regarding efficient water applications [2,132,141,142,143,144,145,146].
    Precision irrigation involves (1) variable applications of irrigation water in
    space and time, regulated by the real-time monitoring of irrigation-related parameters
    in the field using sensors or other tools, (2) analyzing the data to develop irrigation
    schedules, and (3) feedback and operating mechanisms to control the irrigation
    machine using GPS to fulfill actual crop water requirements in every section of
    the field separately. To implement a precision irrigation system, advanced sensing,
    analyzing (simulating), and control technologies are adopted to achieve its best
    performance. This understanding of precision irrigation is also expressed as variable
    rate irrigation. Typical precision irrigation has been drawn by getting inspiration
    from the literature [147] and is shown in Figure 7. A precision system includes
    a mechanism for field data collection, data transformation to the control center/device,
    data analysis, and calibrated operation of IoT-based automatic solenoid valves
    to operate the irrigation system. Under precision applications, irrigation is
    applied frequently for short durations just to maintain the field water balance
    of a cropping system at every part of the field. Prior to the application of precision
    irrigation, the actual water requirement is calculated, and the operating time
    or intensities are designed for the onward operation of sprinkler vehicles. These
    calculations are referred to as irrigation scheduling. Figure 7. Overview of typical
    precision irrigation mechanism: (a) sensors for data collection from the field;
    (b) data transformation mechanism and transmitters; (c) data receiver and data
    analyzer for data calibration and to generate a command for the irrigation system;
    (d) remotely operated solenoid valves to operate the irrigation system as per
    commands generated by the data analyzer; and (e) the sprinkler irrigation system.
    4.1. Field Parameters Used for Irrigation Scheduling for Precision Irrigation
    The monitoring of field conditions is crucial for implementing precision irrigation
    for food production with minimum water usage. Monitoring of field conditions refers
    to the data collection regarding irrigation-related parameters that are capable
    of stating the real-time water balance of the crop system so that the desired
    water can be applied. Some basic parameters that are related to irrigation scheduling
    are categorized [17,148] into three classes or groups. Any of these parameters
    or the sum of some parameters could be adopted to determine irrigation scheduling
    under precision irrigation. The first group is associated with soil parameters
    including soil moisture, soil salinity, soil water absorption capacity, soil pH,
    etc. The second group is associated with plant parameters including leaf area
    index (LAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), stomatal conductance,
    evapotranspiration, leaf turgor pressure, crop water stress index, etc. Plant-related
    parameters for irrigation scheduling are relatively difficult to monitor but these
    parameters exhibit the most realistic picture of plant water balance and present
    the plant growth expected to be affected by droughts and nutrient deficiencies
    [149]. The third group contained climatic parameters including ambient temperature,
    humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, etc.
    These climatic parameters are put in the world-renowned “Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration
    model” for calculating actual evapotranspiration using crop coefficients for the
    development of irrigation schedules [150]. A summary of the literature review
    regarding the use of different parameters for precision irrigation has been taken
    from the literature [32] and illustrated in Figure 8 after modifications and improvements.
    The parameters are shown as per previously defined groups (crop parameters, soil
    parameters, and climatic parameters). Figure 8. Illustration of the literature
    showing the domains of monitoring parameters for precision irrigation. A: [151];
    B: [152]; C: [153]; D: [154]; E: [155]; F: [156]; G: [150]; H: [157]; I: [149];

    Z: [173]; Aa: [174]; and Bb: [141]. 4.2. Data Collection Regarding Irrigation
    Scheduling for Precision Irrigation Precision irrigation requires the accurate
    measurement of field data related to the above-described parameters to implement
    its full scope in order to obtain maximum advantages. There are several ways to
    collect field data including the following: Manual monitoring using smart tools;
    Use of sensors (sensors for soil, plant, and climate parameters); Use of satellite
    data; Use of UAV for data collection. 4.2.1. Manual Monitoring Using Smart Tools
    The accuracy of monitoring field parameters is crucial to implementing precision
    irrigation in a true sense. The continuous and uninterrupted monitoring of irrigation-related
    parameters at different points at desired intervals can be conducted manually
    using smart sensing tools or devices. The biases in data collection by humans
    have been reported but the data regarding some specific plant or soil-related
    parameters could still be collected manually by following standard protocols [175].
    This method of data collection is convenient and easy to follow but it is very
    low in efficiency. 4.2.2. Use of Sensors Plant growth is highly dependent on the
    moisture level in the rhizosphere and frequent monitoring of moisture levels needs
    to be carried out for accurate irrigation scheduling. Accurate data collection
    regarding soil moisture on high temporal grounds is the only option for irrigation
    scheduling in a precise way [169,172,176]. Different kinds of sensors are available
    in the market and are being used for such purposes. One type is capacitance-based
    sensors, which are relatively low cost and can measure the moisture level with
    adequate reliability after efficacious calibration of the sensor with measured
    field data [177]. A more sophisticated device to monitor soil moisture is TDR
    (time domain reflectometry), which contains two electrodes. These electrodes are
    inserted in the soil column up to the desired depth and, afterward, an electric
    signal is generated from one electrode to another to assess the soil moisture
    by estimating travel time and soil conductance characteristics. The accuracy of
    TDR is high, but it is expensive to install in large numbers in open fields for
    monitoring soil moisture at different field spots. Bitella introduced the methodology
    to measure soil moisture at different depths at the same time using low-cost dielectric
    probes [131] while other researchers used IoT-based field monitoring devices for
    moisture measurements [162]. Huuskonen and Oksanen used drone cameras for remote
    measurement of soil moisture in upper soil layers [160]. Besides soil parameters,
    the use of climate parameters for irrigation scheduling has the highest ranking
    due to their extensive use among all contenders [143,149,162,166,178,179,180].
    Permanent weather stations or weather monitoring devices can be installed in the
    field to collect real-time climate data. The sensors to monitor plant or soil-related
    parameters can be installed on the moveable platform of an irrigation system like
    CPS for real-time monitoring during the irrigation cycle [181]. In addition to
    the moisture, soil and plant nutrients could also be monitored using soil nutrient
    detectors connected parallel to moisture sensors [182]. Joly developed a silicon
    chip for site-specific monitoring of soil nutrients [183]. 4.2.3. Application
    of Remote Sensing for Data Collection Satellite remote sensing is an excellent
    and reliable option to collect data on soil and plant-related parameters for irrigation
    under various environmental conditions throughout the world. The satellites can
    read ground data using different spectral bands and are capable of differentiating
    water-stressed crop areas and analyzing crop water needs at high spatial and temporal
    frequencies [184]. Many commercial satellites like MODIS, Landsat, SPOT, etc.,
    offer crop and soil moisture status at high temporal frequency [185]. Several
    researchers used open-source satellite data related to crop evapotranspiration,
    soil moisture, plant water stress, NDVI, etc., for the implementation of precision
    irrigation using sprinkler irrigation systems [186,187]. Reyes [188] used a satellite-based
    vegetation index to estimate actual crop water requirements for the design of
    irrigation scheduling for precise water applications in the field. Ramirez [189]
    used a GIS-based toolbox to explore satellite data for the assessment of soil
    moisture to determine crop water requirements. The 10–20% more water saving achieved
    by using integrated precision cum pressurized irrigation systems has been reported
    by many researchers who used satellite data for irrigation scheduling of various
    crops grown under varying field conditions [190,191]. 4.2.4. Use of UAV for Data
    Collection UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or “drones” are aircraft with no human
    pilots. The size of a UAV varies from small to large, depending upon the function
    that it can perform. UAVs are quick, affordable, and reliable alternatives to
    satellite data if the application area is small (local scale). Depending on the
    sensors carried by a UAV, various crop- and soil-based parameters for irrigation
    scheduling could be collected and monitored in real time at high spatial frequency.
    Various researchers used UAVs for the determination of crop water requirements
    [192], soil moisture [193], and plant water stress [194] for the implementation
    of precision irrigation, and satisfactory results were reported. 4.3. Techniques
    for Data Analysis and Management of Sprinkler Systems for Precision Irrigation
    The collected data were analyzed using several sophisticated techniques including
    modeling tools and multidimensional simulating software (DSSAT(v4.6), MATLAB(R2011b),
    APSIM (7.1), R(2.4.1.2) etc.) to predict spatially and temporally varied crop
    water requirements for developing irrigation maps for onward applications of precision
    irrigation. Mechanized techniques are essential in precision irrigation to manage
    sprinkler systems for efficient water applications using developed irrigation
    maps with less energy input and higher crop yield. The mechanized techniques belong
    to two big categories called open loop technique (OLT) and closed loop technique
    (CLT). In OLT, irrigation is controlled by a pre-set program designed for a particular
    field using input data regarding irrigation parameters [195]. The OLT is easier
    to follow and cheaper in cost; therefore, farmers prefer to adopt these techniques
    for implementing precision irrigation [196]. Farmers can set operating conditions
    (pre-timers, speed, and application rate) for any sprinkler system, which can
    be monitored during the entire operation of the irrigation machine. Many researchers
    reported the use of OLT by farmers for precision irrigation in their fields [197,198,199].
    The CLT is relatively difficult to implement but is more accurately related to
    the true spirit of precision irrigation using sprinkler irrigation systems with
    20–30% more efficiency [200,201,202]. Progressive farmers use such techniques
    at their farms. Many studies have been conducted on the applications, adoptability,
    and benefits of CLT techniques, and significantly positive responses to these
    techniques for crop production were reported [203,204]. The controlling mechanism
    of CLT includes a feedback input mechanism that continuously feeds the field conditions—retrieved
    from the sensors—to the input controller; then, the operation of irrigation machines
    is conducted in accordance with this information. The information may relate to
    climate, soil, or crop parameters [205,206]. Initially, a bigger irrigation program
    of variable nature is formulated that is implemented accordingly after retrieving
    information from the sensors at small time intervals [207,208]. However, continuous
    dynamics in field conditions make the control of irrigation extremely cumbersome
    under CLT. Also, due to the installation of sensors on irrigation machines and
    in soil profiles, the capital cost exceeds even unaffordable limits. Also, the
    use of sensors could mislead operators if they are not calibrated properly, which
    results in immense implementation struggles for farmers. The simplest illustration
    of precision irrigation using a center pivot sprinkler system under both controlling
    mechanisms (OLT and CLT) is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Block diagram of (a)
    open loop technique (OLT) and (b) closed loop technique (CLT) under precision
    irrigation. 4.4. Use of Controlling Devices for Precision Applications of Sprinkler
    Irrigation To perform water application using a sprinkler system according to
    real-time irrigation scheduling, mechanized systems are used to continuously control
    the operation of the irrigation system to adopt the true spirit of precision irrigation.
    The operation of the irrigation system is controlled to maintain the desired irrigation
    level by controlling the application rate or irrigation time [175]. To achieve
    this, electronic devices called “controllers” have been developed and are available
    in markets. The selection of controllers is made keeping in view their function,
    reliability, availability, price, etc. One type of controller is the PID (proportional-integrated
    derivative) controller. These controllers are widely used due to their simple
    structure, ease of troubleshooting, and minimum errors but these cannot handle
    external disturbance and can thus create errors [209]. The second type of controller
    is an AI (intelligent control for precision irrigation) controller. These controllers
    use the application of artificial intelligence, which makes these devices capable
    of providing solutions in a smarter way [210]. These devices with briskly developed
    algorithms can emulate the process of human decision making; therefore, these
    devices have been implemented specifically in sprinkler irrigation machines for
    precise water applications [211,212] in different forms like fuzzy logic, etc.
    [213]. On the other hand, these kinds of controllers have complex structures,
    are higher in price, and are difficult to troubleshoot. The third type of controller
    is the MPC (model predictive-based irrigation) controller, which is widely used
    in agriculture and other industries [214,215,216,217,218]. By installing MPC controllers
    instead of classical controllers on sprinkler irrigation machines, many benefits
    including good efficiency, excellent performance, and optimality can be achieved
    toward the true spirit of precision [219]. Future research on the development
    of smart MPC controllers can improve the efficiency of precision irrigation using
    sprinkler systems in a convenient way with 20–30% more efficiency. 4.5. Use of
    Precision Irrigation for Crop Production Precision irrigation has proved its impact
    in the field of irrigated agronomy. Many researchers worked on the qualitative
    and quantitative behavior of crops against precision irrigation. Abioye [159]
    used an MPC controller in sprinkler irrigation for precision applications and
    reported 30% water saving. The IoT-based precision irrigation system was used
    for water saving in tomato production and reported 10% water saving with 71% better
    uniformity and 27.5% higher yield [220]. Chen [221] recommended the fuzzy neural
    network with a genetic algorithm (GA) to accomplish precision irrigation for 15–25
    better yield and 25% water saving. The same technique was used by Guha [222] to
    calculate precise amounts of water with reference to greenhouse effects for a
    significant impact on crop productivity. Perea [223] used a combination of ANN
    and genetic algorithm (GA) for the prediction of evapotranspiration and crop response
    under water applications and reported 3–11% better results in terms of system
    efficiency for crop productivity. Ahmad [224] compared several studies on precision
    irrigation coupled with sprinkler irrigation and concluded that these technologies
    have a very positive influence on crop production and in the field of irrigated
    agronomy. 5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives This study consulted the major
    advances in sprinkler systems toward precision applications to save irrigation
    water and provide an increase in net crop production, maximum irrigation uniformity,
    and better fertilizer management with minimum leaching losses. A number of research
    articles from the literature were reviewed as per the designed methodology followed
    by the application of comprehensive inclusion/exclusion criteria to exclude unnecessary
    literature from the search results. Regarding the technological aspects of the
    analyzed works, it became evident that sprinkler systems are an efficient source
    to not only irrigate crops but also for fertilizer applications in the field with
    >35% efficiency and >14.1 productivity. This study also revealed the fact that
    the design of sprinkler irrigation needs to be optimized to avoid associated wind
    drift losses that are up to 14% of the total application efficiency. Moreover,
    this study covered prominent features of precision irrigation coupled with sprinkler
    irrigation technology. The data regarding precision irrigation revealed a dramatic
    improvement in productivity when automation and sensor-based monitoring were coupled
    with a control communication and information system to operate the sprinkler system
    to enhance the yield by 27.5% and save 30% more irrigation water. It is obvious
    that the cumulative literature and consolidation of results in one place will
    provide opportunities for students and researchers to develop new ideas for further
    interventions in the field of precision irrigation and improvements in the design
    of existing sprinkler systems. Future research should be continued on the smart
    design and evaluation of sprinkler nozzles with environmental impact assessments
    and simplified application mechanisms for precision irrigation systems. Research
    work on these lines will further support the adoption of modern irrigation techniques
    in large cultivable areas. Author Contributions Investigation, original drafting,

  description: 'Long-term coal mining activities have led to severe heavy metal pollution
    in the soil environment of coal mining areas, posing significant threats to both
    ecological environments and human health. In this study, surface soil samples
    were collected from the overlying soil of coal gangue and the surrounding areas
    of the Panyi coal mine in Huainan. The concentrations of Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Pb
    elements were determined. A self-organizing map (SOM) and an absolute principal
    component score multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) receptor model were employed
    for the quantitative analysis of the soil’s heavy metal pollution sources and

    of the relatively serious pollution of Cd. The results revealed that the average
    concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Ni) in the study area
    were 4.55, 0.59, 1.54, 0.69, 0.59, and 0.71 times the local soil background values,
    respectively. The concentrations of Cd and Zn exceeded the risk screening values
    at some sampling points, with exceedance rates of 44% and 8%, respectively, indicating
    a relatively serious Cd contamination. The sources of heavy metals in the soil
    in the study area were classified into four categories: mining activities, agricultural
    activities, weathering of natural matrices, and other unknown sources, with average
    contributions of 55.48 percent, 24.44 percent, 8.91 percent and 11.86 percent,
    respectively. Based on the spatial distribution of Cd, it was inferred that atmospheric
    deposition is one of the important pollution pathways of Cd in the study area.

    1. Introduction The extraction of coal resources, while promoting local economic
    development, also gives rise to a range of environmental pollution issues [1,2,3].
    By-products generated from coal mining, such as coal gangue, contain significant
    accumulations of heavy metals (HMs) that, under the influence of rainfall and
    leaching, are continuously released into the surrounding water bodies, atmosphere,
    and soil environments [4,5]. Due to the non-biodegradable and persistent nature
    of heavy metals, this pollution persists even after the cessation of the pollution
    source [6,7]. HMs in the soil can pose threats to human health through the food
    chain or other pathways, affecting the normal functioning of human organs and
    potentially leading to cancer [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Human activities such as coal
    mining, metal smelting, and agricultural fertilization contribute significantly
    to the introduction of HMs into surrounding environmental media through various
    pollution pathways, triggering a series of biogeochemical processes in the environment.
    A comprehensive understanding of the sources and pathways of HMs is crucial for
    achieving refined environmental management of heavy metal pollution, ultimately
    safeguarding both ecological environments and human health. The sources of heavy
    metals in soil can be classified into two categories: the weathering of bedrock
    processes and anthropogenic inputs [14]. Methods such as correlation analysis
    and geostatistics are commonly used to assist in identifying types and quantities
    of pollution sources but cannot provide the contribution rates of pollution sources
    to HMs [15]. With the improvement in sample pre-treatment methods and the advancement
    of mass spectrometry analysis techniques, stable isotope methods have offered
    a new perspective for the quantitative analysis of heavy metal sources [16,17,18].
    However, as an emerging technology in source apportionment, stable isotope methods
    still have limitations, such as interference in source apportionment results caused
    by isotope fractionation during heavy metal migration and transformation processes,
    and there is a need for a more comprehensive metal isotope source fingerprint
    [19]. Receptor models can calculate the quantity and contribution rate of pollution
    sources, and among them, the APCS-MLR method is widely used in current research
    on heavy metal source apportionment, including positive matrix factorization (PMF),
    unmixing (UNMIX), and APCS-MLR [20,21]. APCS-MLR has the advantage of overcoming
    the shortcomings of factor analysis in the case of unknown sources, but it lacks
    accuracy in interpreting model results [22]. Therefore, to address the limitations
    of receptor models, researchers often introduce other technical methods to achieve
    an accurate analysis of heavy metal pollution sources. In recent years, some machine
    learning methods such as SOM, random forest (RF), and conditional inference trees
    (CIT) have garnered scholars’ attention in the field of source apportionment of
    soil heavy metal pollution. SOM is a widely used self-organizing neural network
    method and an unsupervised learning algorithm that can use clustering functions
    to classify and identify heavy metal sources in soil [23]. SOM can effectively
    mine data features and correlations, showing strong applicability in pattern classification
    and element identification. The joint application of APCS-MLR and SOM helps enhance
    the accuracy of source apportionment for heavy metal pollution in soil. Clearly
    defining the pollution pathways of soil HMs from the source to the endpoint contributes
    to a better understanding of the spatial distribution evolution of soil HMs. However,
    knowledge of this intermediate process is currently lacking. Analyzing changes
    in soil profiles in terms of heavy metal content is an effective method for pollution
    pathway analysis. Some studies have inferred atmospheric deposition surface source
    pollution and Cd inputs such as irrigation water in farmland in the study area
    by comparing the vertical distribution differences in HMs in soil profiles under
    different land use types [24]. Huainan City is an important coal mining and production
    base in East China. Due to intensive coal mining and processing activities, coupled
    with agricultural development, heavy metal pollution in soil has gradually increased.
    Additionally, coal mining can lead to varying degrees of land subsidence, forming
    extensive subsidence water areas. Due to the region’s high groundwater level,
    well-developed surrounding water systems, and large coal mining volume, the subsidence
    area in the mining district has reached 300 km² [25]. The Panyi coal mine, located
    in the northern part of Huainan City, is one of the first fifteen modern model
    mines designated in the national coal system. The mining activities in this area
    have caused significant damage to the local ecological environment. A previous
    study investigated the soil quality of a number of mining areas, including the
    Panyi coal mine, and found heavy metal contamination [26]. Therefore, it is crucial
    to investigate the heavy metal pollution status and sources in the Panyi coal
    mine area. The primary objective of this study is to determine the sources of
    soil HMs and their pollution contribution rates. The specific aims are (i) to
    determine the concentrations of HMs in the soil of the study area; (ii) to quantitatively
    analyze the sources of soil HMs; and (iii) to clarify the pathways of heavy metal
    pollution in the study area. The results of this study will elucidate the characteristics
    of heavy metal element pollution in the soil of coal mining areas, quantitatively
    analyze the sources of heavy metal pollution of soil, and analyze the pathways
    of heavy metal pollution. This information will provide theoretical support for
    government agencies in the prevention and control of heavy metal pollution in
    soil. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Overview of the Study Area The Pan Ji (116°21′–117°11′
    E, 32°32′–33°06′ N) is situated in the middle reaches of the Huai River, in the
    northern part of Huainan City, covering a total area of 590 square kilometers.
    The district falls within the subtropical monsoon climate zone, characterized
    by long winters and summers, short springs and autumns, and four distinct seasons.
    The annual average temperature is 15.1 °C, with an average annual precipitation
    of 905.6 mm and an average frost-free period of 215.5 days. Geographically, the
    area is located at the southern end of the Huang-Huai Plain, with a terrain that
    slopes gently from northwest to southeast, with a gradient of one in five thousand
    and elevations ranging from 18 to 22 m above sea level. The district has a subsidence
    area of approximately 3235 hectares formed by coal mining-induced subsidence.
    Pan Ji is a major coal and electricity hub with seven large coal mines and the
    Anhui (Huainan) Modern Coal Chemical Industry Park. The water surface area in
    the subsidence zone formed by coal mining-induced subsidence is approximately
    3235 hectares, constituting 12.5% of the total area. The district’s water area
    covers 67.65 km².The predominant soil type in Pan Ji District is yellow-brown
    soil, and the vegetation is characterized by temperate deciduous broadleaf forests,
    with mainly artificial forests. The cultivated land area in Pan Ji District is
    approximately 450,000 mu, primarily used for the cultivation of crops such as
    wheat, rice, legumes, oilseeds, and vegetables. The coal industry holds a significant
    share in the industrial composition, with production having maintained stable
    growth in recent years. 2.2. Sample Collection and Processing Based on the preliminary
    investigation of the basic geographical conditions of the study area and the actual
    conditions on-site, a sampling plan was determined. Soil sample collection was
    conducted, taking into consideration different land use functional zones, including
    farmland, forest land, and coal gangue accumulation areas. The sampling points
    in the study area were determined using a combination of grid point and zoning
    point methods, considering the size and shape of functional zones. The sampling
    work was completed in June 2023, with the collection of a total of 50 surface
    soil samples (0–20 cm), including 15 samples from the surfaces of coal gangue
    accumulations. The five-point sampling method was employed, and excess samples
    were removed using the quartering method after thorough mixing. Due to the influence
    of topography, the spatial distribution of HMs in the coal gangue accumulation
    area showed significant variation. Therefore, two layers (upper and lower) were
    collected in the coal gangue accumulation area based on topographic conditions.
    In addition, profile samples were collected in three land use types: farmland,
    forested areas around coal gangue mountains, and surfaces of coal gangue accumulations.
    The profiles were sampled at five depths: 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and 80–100
    cm. Simultaneously, to analyze pollution pathways, water and sediment samples
    were collected from the surrounding subsidence zone. Surface water and sediment
    sampling points were positioned at the same horizontal level as much as possible,
    with four points collected along the direction of water flow. The collected soil
    and sediment samples were stored in polyethylene plastic bags, while surface water
    samples were poured into 500 mL polyethylene plastic bottles and adjusted to a
    pH below 2 by adding concentrated nitric acid. GPS coordinates were recorded using
    GPS to indicate the latitude and longitude of each sampling point. The locations
    of the sampling points are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Map of sampling sites.
    Surface water samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane before being prepared
    for machine testing. Soil and sediment samples, after natural drying, were processed
    by removing plant residues, stones, bricks, and other debris using forceps. After
    grinding, the samples were passed through a 100-mesh nylon sieve and stored in
    polyethylene self-sealing bags at low temperatures for later use. The soil and
    sediment samples were digested using an HNO3–HCl–HF–HClO4 digestion system, and
    the contents of Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Pb elements in the samples were determined
    using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7500cx; Santa
    Clara, CA, USA). During the testing process, to ensure data accuracy and minimize
    the impact of sensitivity drift, every 10 samples were tested along with an additional
    measurement of a known concentration of standard solution (QC) for external standard
    correction. The National Soil Reference Material (GSS-3a) was used for quality
    control, with parallel samples conducted every 5 samples to control errors within
    around 5%. 2.3. SOM SOM is an unsupervised neural network based on competitive
    learning, proposed by Kohonen in 1982. It can obtain clustering by seeking the
    optimal set of reference vectors according to the topological relationships in
    original data. The key distinctions between SOM and traditional clustering methods
    lie in the fact that SOM attempts to find nodes in the sample space that represent
    the features of the data, thus forming a multidimensional distribution function
    describing the entire dataset. Unlike traditional clustering methods, SOM does
    not make assumptions about the data, and the results obtained are not dependent
    on the distribution or statistical model of the data. These advantages, combined
    with its simple computational process, robust fault tolerance, and memory association,
    enable SOM to be successfully applied to complex data analysis. In this study,
    SOM was used to identify patterns of soil HMs. The number of neurons in the output
    layer was selected according to the following formula: 𝑚=5× 𝑛 − − √ (1) In the
    above formula, m represents the number of SOM nodes and n represents the number
    of input data. In this study, a neural structure consisting of 6 rows and 6 columns
    was chosen for the SOM experiments. 2.4. APCS-MLR In recent years, many scholars
    have utilized a method that combines the development of APCS based on principal
    component analysis (PCA) with MLR, known as APCS-MLR, to achieve pollution source
    apportionment. The APCS-MLR model uses PCA to obtain APCS, which was then used
    as the independent variable in a multiple linear regression analysis with heavy
    metal element content as the dependent variable. This analysis yielded the contribution
    rates of different pollution sources. The formula for the APCS-MLR is the following:
    𝐶 𝑖 = ∑ 𝑛 𝑚=1 ( 𝑎 𝑖𝑚 ×𝐴𝑃𝐶 𝑆 𝑖𝑚 )+ 𝑏 𝑖 (2) In the formula above, Ci represents
    the measured content of the i-th heavy metal; bi is the constant term in the multiple
    regression; “aim” is the regression coefficient of pollution source m for the
    i-th heavy metal; APCSim is the absolute principal component score of the pollution
    source m for the i-th heavy metal; and n is the number of factors. 𝑃 𝐶 𝑖𝑚 = |

    3.1. Soil Heavy Metal Content Characteristics The descriptive statistical results
    of the heavy metal content in the surface soil of the study area are presented
    in Table 1. The average order of heavy metal content in the soil was Zn (124.52
    mg∙kg −1) > Cr (38.15 mg∙kg −1) > Ni (18.26 mg∙kg −1) > Pb (18.02 mg∙kg −1) >
    Cu (16.72 mg∙kg −1) > Cd (0.277 mg∙kg −1). Compared to the local soil background
    values, the average contents of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Ni were approximately
    4.55, 0.59, 1.54, 0.69, 0.59, and 0.71 times higher, respectively, indicating
    a certain level of accumulation of Cd and Zn in the study area. In comparison
    to the “National Soil Environmental Quality Standards” (GB15618-2018) [27], 22
    samples (44%) exceeded the risk screening value for Cd and four samples (8%) exceeded
    the corresponding value for Zn. Table 1. Descriptive statistics of heavy metal
    content in the study area. The coefficient of variation (CV, % = standard deviation/mean)
    can indicate the degree of dispersion among data as a measure of the influence
    of human activities. The CV of Zn (75.79%) was the highest, that of Cr (31.3%)
    was the lowest, and those of the other HMs, Cu, Pb, Cd, and Ni, were 37.2%, 35.3%,
    35.1%, and 31.8%, respectively. It is generally recognized that a CV ≤ 16% is
    considered as weak variation, 16% < CV < 36% is considered as moderate variation,
    and a CV ≥ 36% is considered as strong variation [28]. The higher the CV, the
    higher the degree of influence by anthropogenic activities. The HMs Zn and Cu
    in the study area belonged to strong variability, which was influenced by anthropogenic
    factors; the other HMs belonged to medium variability, which might have been influenced
    by both natural and anthropogenic factors [29]. 3.2. Soil Heavy Metal Classification
    and Distribution Based on SOM The component plane output of SOM analysis is shown
    in Figure 2. Each SOM matrix consisted of the component values of 36 neurons,
    and the SOM plane used a color gradient to indicate the importance of the variables
    transmitted by each neuron. In the component plane, similar colors indicate positive
    correlations between variables, while different colors indicate negative correlations.
    By comparing the color gradients of the SOM, it is possible to visualize the qualitatively
    weighted relational information between nodes and to classify the SHM into three
    interpretable groups. As shown in Figure 2, certain similar patterns can be distinguished.
    For example, chromium and nickel show similar color gradients and their distribution
    patterns show the highest concentrations in the lower right, indicating a strong
    positive correlation between these two elements. In contrast to the distributions
    of the other HMs, zinc shows a marked difference in its topological distribution
    pattern, with relatively low zinc values over most of the map, except for one
    high neuron in the lower right, suggesting a different mechanism influencing changes
    in zinc concentration. Cd is highly concentrated in the right half of the map,
    similar to the compositional planar distributions of copper and lead, suggesting
    that these HMs share the same mechanism of concentration change. The spatial distributions
    of chromium and nickel are extremely similar and they are strongly correlated.
    Figure 2. SOM map of heavy metal content of soil. 3.3. Source Analysis of HMs
    3.3.1. Principal Component Analysis The data on HMs in the soil were standardized,
    and KMO and Bartlett’s sphericity tests were conducted. The KMO measure of 0.713
    and Bartlett’s test of sphericity p < 0.05 indicated that the data were suitable
    for PCA. The number of principal components extracted is generally determined
    by eigenvalues greater than 1. However, the results of the principal component
    analysis showed that only one component had an eigenvalue greater than 1 and the
    variance contribution of that component was less than 60%. Three principal components
    were extracted because the SOM plot produced three sample clusters and the principal
    component analysis results showed that the cumulative variance contribution of
    the first three principal components was more than 85%. The eigenvalues of these
    three principal factors were 3.555, 0.923, and 0.752, with a cumulative variance
    contribution rate of 87.153%, explaining most of the information for the six HMs
    (Table 2). Table 2. Principal component analysis matrix of soil HMs in the study
    area. The first principal component analysis (PCA1) explained 59.24% of the variance,
    much higher than the other components. Ni, Cr, Cu, and Pb had high positive loadings
    on PCA1, with values of 0.931, 0.932, 0.834, and 0.656, respectively. The average
    values of Cr, Ni, Cu, and Pb in the study area were lower than the local background
    values, and the coefficients of variation for Cr, Ni, Cu, and Pb were low, indicating
    that they were less affected by human activities. The SOM analysis results showed
    a similar color gradient between Cr and Ni, indicating a strong correlation between
    these two elements. Previous studies have suggested that Cr and Ni in the soil
    are mainly controlled by natural sources [30,31]. In addition, weathering of soil-forming
    parent rocks has been reported as a source of Pb and Cu in soils [32,33]. Therefore,
    the PCA1 can be interpreted as representing a natural parent material source for
    soil formation. The second principal component analysis (PCA2) explained 15.38%
    of the variance, with Cd having the highest loading of 0.943, while the other
    HMs had weaker loadings. The SOM analysis results indicated that Cd exhibited
    a significantly different color gradient than other HMs, suggesting different
    mechanisms influencing Cd concentration changes. The average Cd concentration
    exceeded the background value in the study area, with some sampling points surpassing
    the risk screening values for agricultural land, indicating that Cd is likely
    influenced by human activities. Given that the study area is a coal mining region,
    long-term coal mining activities have led to a substantial input of Cd into the
    surrounding soil [34]. Additionally, waste generated from coal mining contains
    high concentrations of Cd and Pb, and these HMs accumulate in the waste, migrating
    to the surrounding soil through weathering and rainfall percolation. Previous
    studies have indicated that the accumulation of coal gangue is a primary cause
    of elevated Cd levels in surrounding soil, and it contributes to the accumulation
    of Pb and other HMs [35]. Therefore, PCA2 can be inferred as representing a pollution
    source related to mining activities. The third principal component analysis (PCA3)
    explains 12.53% of the variance, with Zn having the highest loading of 0.968,
    while the other HMs had weaker loadings. The SOM output plane shows that most
    values of Zn on the map are low, except for a high-value point in the lower right
    corner, indicating that the source of Zn in the soil is different from other HMs.
    The Zn content of HMs in the soil samples in the study area exceeded the local
    background values, and a few points exceeded the risk screening values. Additionally,
    the coefficient of variation for Zn exceeded 70%, higher than other HMs. Therefore,
    the PCA3 can be considered as a source related to human activities. In the central
    and northern parts of the study area, where there are numerous farmlands, agricultural
    activities are intense. Studies have shown that pesticides and fertilizers contain
    certain amounts of Zn, and their long-term use can lead to the accumulation of
    Zn in the soil [36,37]. In addition, the spatial distribution map (Figure S1)
    of HMs shows areas of high values of Zn in the farmland area, suggesting that
    the accumulation of Zn may have been influenced by agricultural activities. Thus,
    the PCA3 can be interpreted as a source of pollution from agricultural activities.
    3.3.2. APCS-MLR Source Analysis Quantitative calculation of pollution source contributions
    using the APCS-MLR receptor model revealed R2 values of 0.906, 0.997, 0.804, 0.916,
    0.894, and 0.662 for Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Pb, respectively. Except for Pb,
    all other HMs had R2 values greater than 0.8, and the ratios of predicted to actual
    concentrations for each heavy metal were close to 1 (Table S1), indicating a high
    accuracy in the source analysis results. The contributions of each factor to the
    heavy metal elements are shown in Figure 3, including contributions from three
    pollution sources determined by PCA and one unknown pollution source. The contribution
    rates for PCA1, PCA2, PCA3, and the unknown source were 55.48%, 24.44%, 8.91%,
    and 11.86%, respectively. Figure 3. APCS-MLR pollution source contribution rates.
    The soil HMs Cu, Cr, Pb, and Ni in the study area were primarily influenced by
    natural factors, with contribution rates of 73.67%, 72.60%, 57.55%, and 73.59%,
    respectively. Additionally, the PCA1 explained the sources of some Zn and Cd in
    the study area. Studies have indicated that weathering of parent materials, such
    as carbonate rocks, can lead to the enrichment of Cd in surrounding soils [38].
    Wang et al. found that natural parent materials contribute to Zn in the soils
    of the Huainan Luan Mining Area [39]. The PCA2, representing mining activities
    combined with mixed sources of coal gangue deposition, had the highest contribution
    rate to Cd, accounting for 68.52%. Furthermore, it contributed to the other HMs
    Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Pb by 11.74%, 20.17%, 2.60%, 36.42%, and 7.20%, respectively.
    Mining activities can have various adverse effects on the surrounding environment
    and serve as a source of pollution for multiple HMs, including Zn, Cu, Cr, and
    Pb [40]. This explanation aligns well with the results of the PCA2 source contribution
    analysis in this study. The PCA3, representing the pollution source of agricultural
    activities, had a higher contribution to Zn, accounting for 37.18%. Additionally,
    the PCA3 had lower contributions to the other five HMs. The use of pesticides
    and fertilizers can lead to slight enrichment of Cd, Cu, Cr, and Ni in the soil
    [41,42]. Huainan Panji is one of the important power hubs, and coal-fired power
    generation may lead to the migration of HMs from coal to the surrounding soil.
    In addition, there is a provincial road in the study area with frequent traffic
    activities. Based on actual investigations and data collection around the study
    area, the unknown source might be related to coal combustion [43,44,45], automobile
    exhaust emissions [46,47,48], tire wear [49], and household waste (such as batteries)
    [50], which are potential sources of HMs according to previous studies. 3.4. Cd
    Pollution Pathways and Migration Characteristics Soil metal profile analysis is
    an effective method to study metal sources and pollution pathways. The research
    area is severely polluted by the heavy metal Cd, which has high biotoxicity compared
    to other HMs [51]. Therefore, special attention was given to the pollution pathways
    and migration characteristics of Cd in the research area. Figure 4A displays the
    variation in Cd content in three different land use areas in the research area,
    and its content was higher than in the local background values. The profile content
    variation trend of Cd was site-specific. The Cd content in the surface soil of
    the coal gangue mountain showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing
    with the increase in profile depth. In the farmland area, the Cd content increased
    first and then decreased with the depth, while in the peripheral forest area of
    the coal gangue mountain, there was no regular change in Cd content. Compared
    with the depth of 20–40 cm, the surface Cd content in the coal gangue mountain
    and the peripheral forest areas is enriched to some extent, indicating the possible
    input through atmospheric deposition. After field visits, it was found that although
    the coal gangue accumulation area had undergone surface soil treatment, there
    were still exposed areas with coal gangue, and HMs could enter the soil through
    pathways such as atmospheric deposition [52]. A large number of gangue particles
    enter the surrounding soil through long-term wind action, causing heavy metal
    pollution [53]. It has been reported that atmospheric deposition is the main pathway
    for human input of HMs into the surface environment. In addition, the predicted
    spatial distribution of Cd (Figure 5) shows that Cd radiates from the gangue hills
    to the northwest (main wind direction), which well explains that atmospheric deposition
    is one of the pollution pathways of Cd in the study area. Figure 4. (A) Variation
    in Cd content in different regional profiles; (B) Cd content in surface water
    and sediments of the subsidence area in the research area. Figure 5. Spatial distribution
    prediction map of Cd content in the research area. Based on the tracing results,
    the contribution rate of agricultural sources to Cd input was low, the collected
    farmland soil samples also had higher Cd content than the local soil background
    values, and the spatial distribution map of heavy metal pollution shows that Cd
    pollution in farmland areas was more likely to be affected by non-point source
    pollution. Secondly, in the soil profile analysis, the Cd content in the farmland
    profile below 40 cm gradually decreased with the increase in depth and approached
    the background value. Therefore, other pollution pathways need to be considered
    for Cd pollution in farmland areas. The research area has developed water systems,
    and HMs in coal gangue can enter the surrounding water and then be input into
    the soil through irrigation. The irrigation water for farmland areas in the research
    area was mainly taken from the surrounding subsidence water bodies. The Cd content
    in sediments and water bodies of the main subsidence waters in the study area
    is shown in Figure 4B, and the Cd content in the collected surface water and sediment
    samples exceeded the standard according to the Environmental Quality Standard
    for Surface Waters (Grade III) and the background values of the reference sediments.
    Therefore, the Cd pollution in farmland areas may be influenced by the irrigation
    water pathway. This phenomenon may be related to plant root uptake due to the
    high tree and herb cover in forested areas [54,55]. It has been demonstrated that
    plants can recycle the heavy metal Cd from deeper soils to upper soils, resulting
    in a decrease in Cd levels at certain depths. This well explains the irregularity
    of the Cd profile distribution in forest soils [56]. 4. Conclusions The average
    concentrations of HMs Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Ni in the soils of the study area
    were 4.55, 0.59, 1.54, 0.69, 0.59, and 0.71 times higher than the background values
    of the local soils, respectively. The exceedance rates of Cd and Zn were 44% and
    8%, respectively, indicating serious problems of Cd and Zn pollution. The sources
    of HMs in the soil of the study area included pollution from mining activities,
    agricultural activities, natural matrix soil sources, and other sources, with
    average contributions of 55.48 percent, 24.44 percent, 8.91 percent, and 11.86
    percent, respectively. The spatial distribution of Cd levels indicated that atmospheric
    deposition is one of the pollution pathways of Cd in the study area. In addition,
    the pattern of profile distribution of Cd and the investigation of surface water
    contamination showed that the farmland area was affected by irrigation water pathway
    to some extent. The irregular distribution of heavy metal Cd content in soil profiles
    in forest areas is related to the uptake effect of plant roots. Supplementary

  description: Water (irrigation) is an utmost critical input in agriculture. However,
    freshwater resources are depleting at an alarming rate due to their overexploitation,
    particularly in the agricultural sector, where they are used without measurement.
    Thus, it becomes essential to apply measured quantities of water to the crops
    through proper scheduling, and improve the water use efficiency using the microirrigation
    techniques such as drip system. Using drip irrigation under different crops, the
    crop’s water consumption may be reduced by 30-70% with an increased productivity
    of 20-90%. Drip irrigation tactics work well to increase crop yield by about thrice
    a similar amount of water utilized when compared with conventional methods. It
    is a practical method of applying fertilizers and nutrients (fertigation) exactly
    in the rooting zone of the plants. Thus, it has become imperative to conserve
    water, and improve water and nutrient use efficiencies (WNUE) by adopting a precise
    fertigation technique. Fertigation refers to supplying nutrients/water-soluble
    fertilizers via microirrigation systems (drip irrigation, micro-sprinkler, and
    minisprinkler systems). Under open environmental conditions, the crop production
    has also become a challenging task due to the continued exposure to the adverse
    weather conditions. Thus, while deciding the rate of crop production, weather/climatic
    conditions should be strictly taken under consideration, particularly when grown
    in protected structures (greenhouses). Protected cultivation (greenhouse cultivation)
    is mainly intended to provide optimal growing conditions and protect crops from

    Share ABSTRACT Water (irrigation) is an utmost critical input in agriculture.
    However, freshwater resources are depleting at an alarming rate due to their overexploitation,
    particularly in the agricultural sector, where they are used without measurement.
    Thus, it becomes essential to apply measured quantities of water to the crops
    through proper scheduling, and improve the water use efficiency using the microirrigation
    techniques such as drip system. Using drip irrigation under different crops, the
    crop’s water consumption may be reduced by 30–70% with an increased productivity
    of 20–90%. Drip irrigation tactics work well to increase crop yield by about thrice
    a similar amount of water utilized when compared with conventional methods. It
    is a practical method of applying fertilizers and nutrients (fertigation) exactly
    in the rooting zone of the plants. Thus, it has become imperative to conserve
    water, and improve water and nutrient use efficiencies (WNUE) by adopting a precise
    fertigation technique. Fertigation refers to supplying nutrients/water-soluble
    162fertilizers via microirrigation systems (drip irrigation, microsprinkler, and
    minisprinkler systems). Under open environmental conditions, the crop production
    has also become a challenging task due to the continued exposure to the adverse
    weather conditions. Thus, while deciding the rate of crop production, weather/climatic
    conditions should be strictly taken under consideration, particularly when grown
    in protected structures (greenhouses). Protected cultivation (greenhouse cultivation)
    is mainly intended to provide optimal growing conditions and protect crops from
    adverse weather and different insect-pests. Hence, the overall water and fertilizer
    use efficiencies significantly increase under microirrigation techniques, when
    the crops are subjected to controlled climatic conditions. Previous Chapter Next

    Food and fiber, two of humanity’s most basic needs, are provided by agriculture,
    which is a significant source of income for many nations. Due to technical advancements
    like the green movement, agriculture has seen a fundamental transformation in
    recent decades. The management of livestock, commodities, and groundwater level
    are only a few of the subjects that are the focus of agricultural research. The
    Green Revolution, is also known as the third invention of agriculture, involved
    the improvement of varieties of crop, irrigation, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides,
    which has increased crop food production and food stability between the 1960s
    and 1980s, especially in developing nations. Consequently, even though the global
    population has doubled and food production has increased threefold since the 1960s,
    agricultural productivity has already increased by 25% to meet the demand. Consumer
    electronics, often known as home electronics, are gadgets designed for regular
    use, usually in private homes. Devices for communication, entertainment, and amusement
    are all included in the consumer electronics category. Today’s cutting-edge consumer
    gadgets are made with semiconductor solutions, including tablets, mobile phones,
    wearables, and wireless charging platforms. In 1999, the Auto-ID center at MIT
    and its pertinent market research articles helped popularize the idea of IoT.
    IoT is an amalgamation of many devices that use the embedded technology it contains
    to communicate, detect, and react to internal and external conditions. Multiple
    devices are combined into the Internet of Things (IoT), which uses embedded technology
    to provide communication, sensing, and interaction with internal and external
    states [1]. The effects of IoT on precision agriculture are so severe that they
    have the potential to alter the national economy radically. This is what took
    place with the Netherlands, a tiny, heavily populated lowland nation that currently
    ranks second among exporters of vegetables worldwide. The novel approach to agricultural
    landscapes and the widespread application of IoT in agricultural processes are
    the keys. In the Netherlands, glass covers the most agricultural area, and self-contained
    greenhouses cultivate vegetables. To maintain a sustainable climate in the greenhouses,
    the Dutch use linked technology and sensors to track plant health, CO2 levels,
    LED light, humidity, and data analytics. As a result, they produce ten times the
    typical production from an open field. Besides being incredibly efficient, growing
    food in modern greenhouses is also environmentally friendly because it utilizes
    much less water and chemicals. The industry’s leading products for electrostatic
    discharge (ESD) circuit protection, wireless charging, and capacitive touch controller
    integrated circuits (ICs) are those with high-performance silicon and a small
    footprint. Dew computing is a developing field of study with lots of application
    potential. We observed a different concept of dew computing in this chapter. The
    revised meaning is: In the context of cloud computing, “dew computing” refers
    to an on-premises computer software-hardware architecture paradigm in which the
    on-premises computer provides functions both independently of cloud services and
    in collaboration with them. A model called “dew computing” was developed from
    the original idea of cloud computing. Cloud computing has also given rise to various
    models, such as fog computing, edge computing, dew computing, and others. Advocates
    contend that cutting-edge methods like dew computing can provide users with a
    better experience. Here, agriculture and technology are combined in this effort.
    There are two forms of agriculture: organic and inorganic. “Organic agriculture
    is a comprehensive approach to production management that fosters and improves
    the health of the Agroecosystem, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and
    soil biological activity.” Farmers drive organic farming. Some farmers have established
    alternative production methods to increase their family’s health, farm economies,
    and independence because they feel that conventional agriculture is not sustainable.
    Many developing nations use organic agriculture as a growing method. The concept
    “Internet of Things” has gained popularity over the past five years. An IoT network
    is a collection of Internet-connected machines, cars, and appliances that can
    gather and share data without the need for human contact. IoT devices collect
    data and transfer it to a central data server, where it is processed, compiled,
    distilled, and used to facilitate a variety of operations. The advantages of IoT
    are enjoyed by the business community, the government, organizations, and the
    average consumer. Mobile phones, computers, coffee makers, refrigerators (mine
    automatically orders replacement water filters), Apple Watches, Google Home, Fitbits,
    and others are examples of specific IoT-enabled gadgets. Any gadget with sensors
    and an Internet connection can be connected to the IoT. IoT is used to automate
    operations in various applications, including smart grids, smart cities, and innovative
    industries. For example, as the global population increases too quickly, new IoT
    techniques are being employed in agriculture to produce food quickly, in large
    quantities, and with high quality while using less water, fertilizer, and space.
    IoT is helping agriculturalists and technologists identify solutions to farmers''
    concerns, such as cost management, water shortages, and productivity problems.
    1.1 WSN Before the IoT era, wireless sensor networks (WSN) were used to create
    an intelligent environment and monitor and regulate several environmental elements.
    They can be utilized in agricultural wireless sensor networks, particularly in
    greenhouses. We can utilize WSN in various IoT applications thanks to its multiple
    capabilities, including integrating sensors and actuators, low-power consumption,
    digital transmission, security, and scalability. Operations include irrigation,
    farm monitoring, fertilizer use management, soil monitoring, intruder detection,
    water quality monitoring, etc. The IoT and Big Data are topics that are frequently
    brought up together since they both produce the same kinds of enormous amounts
    of data. A detailed examination of IoT in agriculture is required to understand
    the state of the research. A fair lot of work has been done in this area. This
    study addresses many difficulties and trends in IoT smart farming to transform
    agriculture technology through IoT innovation [1]. Specific sensors assist farmers
    in understanding how the sun''s effect and light adjustment affect plant growth.
    Additionally, there are weather stations that, when used in conjunction with other
    sensors, software, and tools, aid in monitoring the various aspects of the conditions
    in farming fields. They support farmers, growers, and landowners in their endeavors.
    The wireless transmission provides the data that sensors have collected to the
    web server. Wireless communication between the field and the web server is accomplished
    using several sensor modules and transceivers. WSN modernizing agriculture may
    be achieved by fusing established practices with cutting-edge innovations like
    Internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Through a wireless protocol,
    the Wireless Sensor Network gathers data from various sensors and transmits it
    to the central server. The impact of numerous additional factors on productivity
    is significant. Insect and pest attacks, which can be prevented by applying the
    appropriate insecticides and pesticides, as well as attacks by wild animals and
    birds as the crop matures, are among the factors. Because of erratic monsoon rainfalls,
    water scarcity, and inefficient water utilization, crop output is dropping [2].
    1.2 Sensors The architecture of IoT devices includes sensors. Sensors are used
    to detect objects, machinery, and other things. A gadget that responds to a particular
    measurement by producing usable output. The sensor collects physical data and
    transforms it into a signal that can be used to analyze (e.g., electrically, mechanically,
    optically) the properties of any object or substance to identify the presence
    of a specific physical quantity. The sensor’s output is a signal that''s been
    transformed into something humans can understand, such as changes in characteristics,
    resistance, capacitance, and impedance. In agriculture, sensors are used for everything
    from automated irrigation to weather monitoring. By utilizing inexpensive sensors,
    designers can build a hardware environment prototype for the data collecting and
    mining process. The impact of each sensor’s data for agricultural monitoring varies;
    however, by providing reliable observations even with fewer sensors, a system’s
    cost can be reduced (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Block diagram showing cache memory Full size
    image 2 Cache Memory It is a computer component which is chip-based that makes
    retrieving data from the computer’s memory more efficiently. The computer’s CPU
    can quickly retrieve data from it, serving as temporary storage. The computer’s
    primary memory source, which is often some DRAM, is less accessible to the processor
    than this temporary storage space, known as a cache. As because it is frequently
    built directly into the central processing unit (CPU) chip or mounted on a different
    chip with a separate bus link from the CPU, cache memory is also referred to as
    CPU (central processing unit) memory [1]. Therefore, it can increase efficiency
    because it''s physically close and is more accessible to the processor. Figure
    2 shows the circuit diagram of Raspberry Pi4, and Fig. 3 shows the position of
    cache memory in computer architecture. Fig. 2 Circuit diagram of raspberry Pi4
    Full size image Fig. 3 Block diagram of raspberry Pi4 Full size image 3 Flash
    Memory One example of nonvolatile memory is flash memory, commonly referred to
    as flash storage, which erases blocks or data in units called and rewrites data
    at the byte level. In consumer electronics, business software, and commercial
    applications, flash memory is frequently utilized for data storage and transfer.
    Whether a flash-equipped device is powered on or off, flash memory keeps data
    for a significant time. We imagine single-level storage systems that can theoretically
    host and map many IoT devices on a single, shared address space, allowing user
    programs to access those devices without being aware of the precise storage kinds
    or physical device locations. NAND flash memory is appropriate for IoT devices,
    which are frequently compact and mobile. Figure 4 shows the proposed system of
    storage allowing for load/store access to the flash memory with the aid of a storage
    memory management unit (SMMU), making the flash memory appear as huge main memory,
    with the prototype board corresponding to the dotted rectangle part. Fig. 4 Block
    diagram and circuit diagram flash memory Full size image Figure 5a shows the overall
    structural design from a hardware perspective. Figure 5b describes the schematic
    diagram of an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV)/Drone, and Fig. 5c illustrates the operational
    block diagram of a UAV. Fig. 5 a Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)/drone system overall
    hardware structure diagram; b schematic diagram of UAV. c Operational block diagram
    of UAV Full size image The key problem is to disguise flash memory’s restrictions,
    such as a finite number of write cycles. This is similar to memory-mapped IO and
    virtual memory, but our goal is to use flash memory as the main memory [3]. When
    a write-back is required, the SMMU compresses the data instead of writing the
    cached DRAM data back to the flash memory. 4 Dew Computing According to Wang [4],
    the evolution of dew computing is based on two keywords: (i) collaboration and
    (ii) independence. Another concept given by Skala et al. [5] defined that dew
    computing actually keeps the virtual infrastructure far away from the central
    system. A model called Dew Computing was developed from the original idea of cloud
    computing. Fog computing, edge computing, and other models are examples of new
    ones that have come out of cloud computing. The word “dew” describes a phenomenon
    that occurs in nature: the dew is on the ground, fog is closer to the earth, and
    clouds are far above it. Like fog computing is next to the user, dew computing
    is on the user''s end. Cloud computing is a faraway service. Dew computing can
    be thought of as physical or ground. An on-premises computer''s storage is copied
    in a cloud service under the dew computing category known as “storage in Dew,”
    and the storage of that computer is automatically synced with its cloud counterpart.
    Dropbox is a typical example of a current STiD service [6]. The independent aspect
    of Dropbox is first satisfied by the fact that users always have access to its
    files and folders. Additionally, these files and folders are automatically synchronized
    with cloud services to support the collaboration capability. There are a lot more
    apps that are comparable. We also wish to review Google Drive [7, 8] quickly.
    A file satisfies the collaboration criterion but not the independence feature
    because it cannot be viewed if the Google Drive service is unavailable. Likewise,
    the file satisfies the cooperation criterion but not the independence feature
    because it can only be opened if the Google Drive service is available [2]. Google
    Drive is not a STiD application, thus. Google Drive Offline, on the other hand,
    is a STiD application [9]. 5 Applications of Dew Computing 5.1 Dew-Based Precision
    Farming This farming management idea is centered on watching, quantifying, and
    reacting to crop variability within and between fields. The late 1980s saw the
    creation of the first theoretical works on PA and its practical applications.
    Precision agriculture research aims to define a decision support system (DSS)
    over whole farm management to improve input returns while safeguarding resources.
    Figure 6 shows dew-based Precision farming, where the farmer gets the information
    in their mobile phone through satellite communication. Fig. 6 Dew-based precision
    farming Full size image 5.2 Dew Powered Agricultural Drones IoT enables monitoring
    and managing microclimate conditions for boosting output. For example, IoT-enabled
    devices can sense soil moisture and nutrients in contrast to weather information
    better to manage smart irrigation and fertilizer systems for outdoor planting.
    For instance, this prevents resource waste if sprinkler systems only release water
    when necessary. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are currently employed
    in precision agriculture to monitor harvests or to identify diseases, parasite
    infections, or information on plant development. They may also measure soil moisture
    and release fertilizer precisely and accurately inside the ground. UAVs are frequently
    used for crop insurance surveys, dusting, and surveillance. UAVs are commonly
    utilized for monitoring, dusting, and crop insurance surveys. A UAV mounted with
    a high-resolution camera is frequently used to survey a target area. In this,
    Fig. 7 represents dew-based agricultural drones, by which the farmer can easily
    spread pesticides and fertilizers. Figure 8 shows how cache-enabled agriculture
    can monitor and control temperature, irrigation systems, and weather via a wireless
    sensor network. Fig. 7 Dew-based agricultural drones Full size image Fig. 8 Cache
    enabled IoT for agriculture Full size image 5.3 Smart Dew Greenhouse Management
    Smart dew greenhouse management: Increasing the yields of fruits, vegetables,
    and other agricultural products is a goal of greenhouse farming. Greenhouses can
    regulate environmental conditions through personal intervention or a relative
    control mechanism. An IoT-powered smart greenhouse can intelligently monitor and
    regulate the climate without the need for human involvement. Manual intervention,
    however, results in lost production, wasted energy, and labor expenditures. This
    renders the idea of greenhouses as a whole useless. Consequently, intelligent
    greenhouses are a superior option. In this, Fig. 9 shows how the Internet of Things
    can be used to build a smart greenhouse. Without needing personal assistance,
    the farmer can control, monitor and manage the climate, light, security system,
    and crop harvesting process through these intelligent greenhouses. Fig. 9 Dew-based
    smart greenhouse management Full size image In a smart greenhouse, several sensors
    are utilized to evaluate environmental conditions and determine whether they are
    suitable for plants. Remote access is created by using IoT to connect the system
    to a cloud. As a result, continuous manual monitoring is no longer necessary.
    Instead, the cloud server implements a control action inside the greenhouse, which
    also manages data processing. The greenhouse’s IoT sensors offer critical data
    on temperature, humidity, and more [5]. Through a Wi-Fi signal, these sensors
    operate everything from lighting and window opening to temperature control and
    cooling. 5.4 Livestock Management Using Dew Computing In this chapter, we have
    discussed that the Internet of Thing’s involvement in smart farming is possible
    through Livestock management and data processing using dew computing. A system
    designed to monitor the crop field using sensors is what we mean when we talk
    about IoT-based smart farming. The irrigation system is automated while these
    sensors monitor every factor necessary for crop production, including soil moisture,
    humidity, light, temperature, etc. Farmers may check the state of their fields
    from anywhere through this system. Wireless IoT applications can be used by farmers
    in the area of livestock management also. Here in this Fig. 10, we can see that
    the farmer can gather information about their cattle movements, comfort, and health
    through a wireless sensor network. This knowledge lowers labor expenses and aids
    in the prevention of sickness. Individually examining livestock for indications
    of illness or damage is a traditional approach to livestock monitoring. This approach
    is both expensive and incredibly unreliable. Comparing IoT-based farming to conventional
    farming, it is far too efficient. Fig. 10 Dew-based livestock management Full
    size image Solutions for managing livestock that is IoT-enabled remove uncertainty
    regarding herd health. Battery-powered sensors worn on an animal''s collar or
    tag track the animal''s location, temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate
    and wirelessly transmit the information to farming equipment in almost real time.
    IoT-based smart farming emphasizes organic farming, family farming (complicated
    or confined spaces, particular animals and/or cultures, maintenance of specific
    or high-quality varieties, etc.), and farming that is very transparent in addition
    to modernizing traditional farming practices. The advantages of IoT-based smart
    farming also extend to environmental considerations. For example, it can help
    farmers use water efficiently and get the most out of their treatments and inputs.
    Key advantages include: Real-time monitoring of livestock vitality and health
    enables farmers to give the animals prompt medical attention and stop the spread
    of illness. To avoid theft and to spot grazing trends, track grazing animals.
    Compile and examine historical data to find patterns in the health of cattle or
    to monitor the spread of disease. Keep an eye on an animal’s preparation for mating
    or giving birth to avoid losing any new-born calves and to improve breeding techniques.
    5.5 Dew-Enabled Plant Healthcare Monitoring Most crucially, these gadgets allow
    hospitals to keep track of their patient''s health in the intensive care unit
    and occasionally at home. All day long, it can keep an eye on the patients. Hence
    shortening hospital stays and still giving current real-time information that
    might save lives. Smart beds reduce the wait time for available space in hospitals
    by informing the person of availability. The addition of IoT sensors can make
    the difference between life and death by reducing malfunctions and boosting reliability.
    Rajalakshmi et al. [10] described monitoring the crop field using soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, light sensors, and an automated irrigation system. To maintain
    the server database, the data from sensors is encoded in JSON format and wirelessly
    transmitted to the web server. When an agricultural field''s temperature and moisture
    content is at risk, the irrigation system will automatically turn on. Farmers
    can check their fields'' status from anywhere by regularly using the notifications
    provided to their mobile devices [11–13]. 5.6 Dew Controlled Forest-Fire Monitoring
    Real-time environmental analysis of factors like weather and harmful gases could
    generate pertinent environmental data that could aid in averting or identifying
    a disaster. IoT (Internet of Things) devices and sensors now enable it to monitor
    various environmental factors, including pressure, temperature, humidity, and
    the concentrations of polluting gases like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.
    Radical changes and combinations of these factors may be signs of unfavorable
    weather conditions that could result in a natural disaster like a forest fire.
    Castro et al. [14] have emphasized the significance of the “rule of 30” [1], which
    is based on three essential variables that are connected to the identification
    of forest fires: temperatures above 30 °C, humidity levels below 30%, and wind
    speeds above 30 km/h in the exact location. Applying this rule as a guideline
    for preventing forest fires can assist in determining areas with a high risk of
    fires, allowing the deployment of protective measures and contingency planning
    that may be advantageous for environmental preservation. A deep learning-based
    strategy termed LBFFPS has been proposed in [15]. It gives the suggested technique
    the capacity to keep track of the forest area using an intelligent surveillance
    system called SFMK. A controller with IoT capabilities, several smart sensors,
    and a camera portion make up the SFMK surveillance kit. The suggested approach
    can quickly detect the forest fire based on these parameters and report it to
    the appropriate authority. In addition, the sensors connected to the SMOKE can
    detect smoke and monitor temperature and humidity. To monitor the forest zone
    and automatically communicate any changes to the server entity, a high-definition
    1020-megapixel camera is installed in the SFMK [16]. 5.7 Dew Server-Based Monitoring
    of Climate Condition Crop output is significantly influenced by the climate. Varied
    crops require different climate conditions to grow, and any lack of understanding
    about climate seriously impairs crop output in terms of quantity and quality.
    In the following Fig. 11, we can see that the farmer can now access real-time
    weather information thanks to IoT technology. Fig. 11 Dew-based climate monitoring
    condition Full size image Farmers can select a crop that will thrive in a specific
    climate using the environmental data collected by the sensors installed in agricultural
    fields. The entire Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is made up of sensors that
    identify current meteorological variables, including humidity, rainfall, and temperature,
    all of which are essential for crop development. These sensors can predict any
    significant climate change that can have an impact on productivity. The necessity
    for physical presence is reduced thanks to a warning delivered to the server about
    the difference in the weather. Higher yields are the result in the end [11]. 5.8
    Dew-Based Crop Protection Against Animal and Insect Intrusion The production of
    crops is seriously threatened by animal encroachment, which also lowers farmer
    profits and jeopardizes food security. Solutions based on the Internet of Things
    and machine learning techniques are available to solve this issue. The ESP8266
    Wireless Fidelity module, Pi Camera, Buzzer, and LED are all connected to the
    Raspberry Pi, which controls the machine algorithm. Machine learning technologies
    like the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network and Single Shot Detection technology
    are crucial to identify objects in photos and categorizing the animals. The testing
    shows that the Single Shot Detection method works better than the Region-based
    Convolutional Neural Network algorithm. Finally, the programs that integrate with
    the Twilio API decimate the information to the farmers so they can act swiftly
    in their farm fields [39, 12, 17]. In the above diagram, Fig. 12 shows how the
    farmer can easily detect and monitor the crop condition and predict the attack
    of insects or animal intrusion with the help of technology and WSN. Fig. 12 Dew-enabled
    crop protection against animal intrusion Full size image 5.9 Dew-Facilitated Home
    and Office Management with Indoor and Rooftop Garden Rooftop gardens have emerged
    as a new trend in metropolitan areas due to the lack of green space. Small-scale
    home greenhouse management systems with IoT capabilities track and automate operations.
    Smart gardening programs track soil and ambient conditions, automate irrigation,
    and check on the health of plants to increase productivity and reduce the amount
    of labor needed to maintain the greenhouse. These solutions are similar to those
    used in agriculture and smart farming. We may turn our roof into a tranquil outdoor
    area where we can eat organic, fresh food by following simple guidelines. So,
    here are a few layout suggestions for a rooftop garden. A rooftop garden, also
    known as a roof garden, is a planted green area on the top of a house or structure.
    Terraced gardens are situated in metropolitan areas, where they cultivate fruits
    and vegetables and provide a play area or peaceful green space. The plans incorporate
    asphalt, decking, seating, flowerbeds or raised planters, cultivated gardens,
    or urban farms. Buildings throughout the world’s major cities have a significant
    number of green roofs. Both extensive and intense vegetation kinds are possible
    for green roofs. Intensive vegetation on a rooftop consists of large shrubs and
    tiny trees, whereas extensive vegetation refers to herbs, small plants, and shrubs.
    The following Fig. 13a shows the prototype model of Rooftop Gardening with smart
    irrigation, and Fig. 13b indicates the technic of Smart Indoor Gardening. Figure
    14 describes the detailed Tree Health monitoring system and Green House management
    system process. Fig. 13 Dew-enabled smart home farming: a Rooftop garden with
    smart irrigation, b smart indoor garden Full size image Fig. 14 Tree health monitoring
    and green house management Full size image The advantages of rooftop or indoor
    gardening are significant. Some of them can be listed as: These autonomously control
    the temperature and humidity of our indoor gardening environment to produce and
    maintain the best possible growing conditions for your plants. Compile and examine
    previous information on the greenhouse environment for improved testing, management,
    and optimization of ideal growing conditions. Automate irrigation in greenhouses
    to prevent plant over-or under-watering, decrease water waste, and reduce the
    need for labor-intensive manual labor. 5.10 Dew-Based Disaster Management to Protect
    Crop We have seen many natural calamities, such as salinity, river erosion, cyclones,
    droughts, and floods. By causing harm to the crops, cattle, fisheries, and Agro-forestry,
    these devastating events significantly impede the nation''s agricultural production
    systems, social development, and economic growth. Because of the limitations of
    climate change on coastal agriculture, CSA is crucial for managing disaster risk
    reduction in that area. These natural catastrophes can affect anybody, anywhere.
    Still, they wreak the most havoc on the most defenseless, impoverished communities—often
    those belonging to underrepresented groups, those residing in remote places, or
    those residing in fragile ecosystems. 5.11 Dew-Enabled Logistic for Food Supply
    Chain Management We can manage your worldwide assets quickly and cut costs with
    Smarter Technologies’ innovative logistics management systems. With real-time
    data on all critical assets and personnel, your business can reduce costs and
    increase productivity. Real-time asset tracking Affordable technology Robust security.
    5.12 Dew-Based Autonomous Driving in the Agricultural Sector Global food chains
    are being impacted by shortages in agriculture. This efficiency is considerably
    increased by using smart vehicles, which also automate conventional farming. As
    autonomous farming promises to produce more crops with less work and less damage
    to the environment, inventions like agricultural drones, self-driving tractors,
    and seed-planting robots could be crucial to the future of food supplies. Figure
    15 shows the process of autonomous driving in agriculture. These electronic devices
    have sensors, computer vision, extremely accurate (less than one inch) GPS, and
    machine learning capabilities to enable self-driving and precision farming. These
    machines occasionally still need an operator, but owing to technology, that operator
    doesn’t necessarily need to be a highly skilled ag truck driver. Fig. 15 Dew-enabled
    auto-vehicle in agriculture Full size image Autonomous tractors could help solve
    farming labor shortages. Drones and seed-planting robots are among other innovations.
    Autonomous farming equipment. 5.13 Dew-Based Agricultural Waste Management Dew
    aids in our daily efforts to develop a trustworthy, sustainable water source for
    everyone. The industry may boost profitability while complying with regulations
    and conserving the environment by employing advanced management and wastewater
    resource-conversion technologies. The mining and ore sectors benefit from technological
    advancements in dew management that enable them to control water levels without
    releasing pollutants produced during the process into the environment. Dew effectively
    produces fresh water from the resulting impure wastewater while preserving the
    environment [16, 18]. 6 Benefits of IoT in Agriculture IoT enables smart farming
    to improve the sector. Landowners and producers may make better overall decisions
    thanks to the collection and monitoring of pertinent environmental, meteorological,
    and chemical land use data and other sophisticated IoT solutions. This gives us
    the flexibility to deal with any situation and respond quickly. In addition to
    increasing agricultural output and saving crops and labor, it warns us of environmental
    concerns and helps us take appropriate action. Figure 16 gives an overall view
    of the benefits of IoT in the Agriculture field. IoT-based remote sensing uses
    sensors installed along farms, like weather stations, to collect data that is
    then sent to analytical tools for study. Farmers can use analytical dashboards
    to monitor their crops and act on the information they gain. The saving actions
    are: (a) using caution when allocating resources, (b) enabling land users to take
    prompt action, (c) enhancing food security, agricultural product health, production,
    volume, and quality, (d) improving any administrative procedures, (e) it has enormous
    potential to alleviate harmful climate impacts, (f) crop Evaluation. Fig. 16 IoT-based
    agricultural scenario Full size image Aggregation of Data: For centralized data
    gathering in sizable farming operations, 5G technology holds considerable promise.
    A substantial corporate farm might gather the data from micro-monitored crop management
    devices via a private 5G network. These systems contain soil moisture sensor density,
    which may be hundreds of times higher than what is supported by current technologies.
    With this network, a more effective real-time monitoring system that includes
    triggers for slowing irrigation and other crop support systems may be possible.
    Here, Fig. 17 describes the overall Aggregation of IoT-based agriculture benefits.
    Fig. 17 Aggregation of agriculture benefits Full size image Statistical Analysis:
    It is seen that large industrial farms can better integrate predictive analytics
    as a result of 5G technology''s data aggregation capabilities. Analytics software
    considers current and historical data on conditions (such as soil moisture and
    pesticide use). Operation of Drones: We have observed that farmers increasingly
    use drones to check their crops. Drones offer more precise data about crop damage
    and other factors while being less expensive than driving tractors through fields.
    In addition, drones will be able to gather better-quality video data and transmit
    it more quickly because of 5G’s enormous bandwidth. Real-time reporting and the
    development of AI drone technology will be made possible by this high-speed data
    transfer capacity [16]. Animal Tracking and Monitoring: Animal monitoring sensors
    will likely continue to be connected through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or LTE LPWAN until
    REL 17 boosts the viability of 5G low-power and denser sensor networks. One example
    is significant, centrally located farms where it is possible to install 5G infrastructure
    over a restricted region (such as a chicken farm) and track individual animals.
    To track an animal’s whereabouts and health, ag-tech developers have developed
    herd management sensors, such as smart collars and ear tags. Autonomous Agricultural
    Vehicles: Farm tools will benefit from advancements in autonomous vehicle technology
    in other industries. The spacing between seed rows and the pressure applied to
    them when they are planted in the ground are just two examples of the numerous
    little agricultural task specifics that operators of tractors with onboard computers
    can now handle. In addition, driverless farm equipment will advance to give farmers
    more flexibility and efficiency while reducing labor costs. IoT sensors can also
    benefit trucks used to deliver crops. These sensors can monitor the cargo’s temperature
    and notify if it gets too warm or cold (i.e., cold chain). Asset trackers and
    other small mobile sensors will probably continue to use high-latency technologies
    like LPWAN. However, autonomous vehicles with more powerful onboard computers
    will be able to send and receive more significant, ultralow-latency data streams
    thanks to 5G. Weather Stations: The weather has complete control over farming
    operations. Large percentages of a farmer''s crop may be lost to avoidable diseases
    and damage. By giving farmers information about the state of their fields, linked
    farm monitoring stations can help alleviate this problem. IoT Based Decomposition
    Management Process for Organic Materials: Here in this chapter, the authors have
    discussed a fertilizer kit for computing manure creation technique and inevitably
    supplies that natural manure to the field as per the need of the crops. Intelligent
    irrigation system uses components like LM35 MQ6, different motors for installation
    and is also set up to deliver the exact quantity of water and nutrition at the
    correct time. The complete manure formation and distribution is automated, reducing
    the need for human intervention. In the paper, B. P. Chaudhury et al. discussed
    the IoT tools used in industrial applications but also found their occurrence
    in monitoring of climatic health. To be precise, it can measure the volume of
    carbon content in the air. The researchers have designed a cost-effective IoT-based
    wireless monitoring system that will help to measure air quality. In this device,
    they have put three sensors to measure carbon dioxide concentrations, temperature,
    relative humidity, and dust level [16, 19]. Here Fig. 18 describes how the worker
    can manage the dew-based air pollution and waste management process. Fig. 18 Dew-based
    air pollution and waste management Full size image 7 Existing Dew-Enabled IoT
    Devices The dew server uses device control to keep track of the IoT device''s
    status and manage its operation. This module’s fundamental capabilities include
    the following: determine sensor status. alter a particular variable. cause particular
    actions. activate a function. To provide relevant information and to enable the
    dew server to respond to the received status, the IoT device broadcasts its status
    to a nearby dew server. Due to the dew server’s control over the IoT sensor, arranging
    a particular aspect to start a more precise detection and quantification of the
    required signal is possible. When an IoT device is reset, the dew server may,
    for instance, begin a new measuring of the IoT sensor. In the case of an IoT actuator,
    it may start a specific action that regulates the actuator’s performance. Additional
    pipelined stream processing is required for the streaming data sent by the IoT
    sensor. Data collection, storage, and transfer to higher level servers are the
    three crucial duties the dew server does with the incoming streaming data. The
    dew server’s primary function is data collection. IoT sensors typically broadcast
    data without verifying whether it has been gathered. Higher sampling rates may
    also cause data to be permanently lost because IoT sensors cannot store them.
    The dew server realizes the data storage function of the IoT sensor, especially
    when it is battery operated and is a light mobile device, even without wires which
    can provide a more secure connection, such as the wearable. The dew server’s primary
    function is data collection. IoT sensors typically send data without verifying
    whether it has been gathered. Additionally, more excellent sampling rates may
    result in data loss for all time because IoT sensors cannot store the information.
    In reality, the dew server implements the data storing function of the IoT sensor,
    particularly in the scenario where it is battery operated and is a light mobile
    device, without any connections that can provide a more secure connection, as
    are the wearable sensors. Since the dew server buffers the received data stream
    on a low-power radio link and produces a signal with more extensive power, it
    also serves as a digital repeater in some ways. Data processing is complementary
    to data collection and storage. Depending on the size of the dew server, data
    processing may include at least the following: pre-processing. analyzing. classification
    (decision-making). visualization. Data preparation typically uses digital filters
    or comparable techniques to prepare data for further processing because the incoming
    data stream may be noisy. Each received sample must undergo data processing to
    estimate the perceived signal and draw additional inferences accurately. On most
    devices, one may monitor and start specific operations for the IoT device via
    the dew server’s user interface. At a minimum, this human–computer interface does
    the following tasks: activation instructions (via menu options and control buttons).
    establishing different criteria. real-time visualization. browsing via stored
    info. Users can manage the dew server even though it may execute particular algorithms
    and operate independently. Generally, dew-enabled devices are cache memory-based
    devices. Such as in different agriculture devices based on Raspberry Pi have a
    cache memory of 16 KB, whereas Arduino Nano R3 has 512 bytes of Flash, and some
    devices have an in-direct cache and flash memory. Here in the following table,
    we can observe different types of sensors, their uses in various related fields
    of agriculture and the involvement of cache and flash memory. Table 1 shows the
    list of devices capable of implementing Dew functionalities. It compares the type
    of processor and size of cache and flash memory. Identifying services and installing
    them in a device as per the capabilities of process and memory is a challenge.
    Table 1 Comparison among existing dew-enabled devices Full size table 8 Challenges
    and Future Research Directions Invent of IoT: The basic idea of a network of smart
    devices was explored as early as 1982, when a modified Coca-Cola vending machine
    at Carnegie Mellon University became the first ARPANET-connected device, reporting
    its inventory and whether freshly loaded drinks were cold or not. The modern idea
    of the IoT was created by academic conferences like UbiComp and PerCom, as well
    as Mark Weiser’s 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, “The Computer of the twenty-first
    Century [13, 25, 33].” The term “Internet of Things” was first used in 1999 by
    MIT’s Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs, Kevin Ashton. Although he was the first
    to define the IoT in a demonstration for Procter & Gamble, the definition has
    changed over time. Invent of Dew: The decade phases of the ICT development and
    its connections to the distributed computing hierarchy and g-phenomena are described,
    including cloud computing (cc), fog computing (fc), and dew computing (dc). Cellular-connected
    drones and robots equipped with cameras that can quickly scan large areas of land
    to monitor crop fields and livestock carefully are other examples of smart technology
    altering farming and could benefit from 5G. Farmers can use the time saved to
    do less time-consuming duties while also creating new opportunities for future,
    more robust crops by automating the mass collection of comprehensive information
    that was previously done by hand. The farmers make decisions by developing models
    and projections. Analytics will improve, optimizing farm production, as 5G delivers
    denser real-time data. 9 Conclusions IoT-enabled gadgets and sensors are being
    developed to improve agriculture-related management and benefit humanity. This
    article has discussed devices based on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and several flash
    and cache memory types. Several difficulties were encountered when developing
    this solution, including using data transfer protocols, contact with hardware,
    incorporating sensors, and converting recorded data into relevant information
    for user presentation. In addition, the synchronization of all system data across
    various platforms, such as new alerts and measurements, the integration of multiple
    technologies, mobile devices, Web services, and IoT devices, and further considerations
    will also be illustrated. References Farooq, M.S., Riaz, S., Abid, A., Abid, K.,

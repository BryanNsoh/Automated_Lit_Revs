    Get rights and content Highlights • A review of state-of-the-art Internet of Things
    applications for smart grid and home. • Definition of smart home holistic framework
    with key features from literature review. • General description of a smart home
    management model based on the holistic framework. • Discussion of current and
    future challenges for Internet of Things based solutions. Abstract Although Internet
    of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies
    for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very
    rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute
    towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications
    and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose
    a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks
    proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects
    in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model
    for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each
    level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data
    processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.
    We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as
    a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home
    solutions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of

    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase
    for the terms Internet of Things and Smart Home. Download : Download high-res

    to Google trends since 2004 for terms Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart
    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.
    Query# Term1 Term2 Term3 Total number of results Query 1 “Wireless Sensor Network”

    Home” “Smart Grid” 1050 Query 6 “IoT” “Home Automation” “Smart Grid” 747 Only
    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution
    Consumers Real-time generation monitoring Transmission lines controlling Underground
    cable system monitoring Wireless automatic meter reading (smart metering) Power
    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave
    Bacnet X10 EnOcean Insteon Without patents 228000 9790 5770 6700 1840 1520 720
    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave
    and Insteon. Empty Cell ZigBee Z-Wave Insteon Media wireless (radio) wireless

    2.4 GHz Gaussian, frequency-shift keying (GFSK) manchester channel encoding Frequency-shift
    keying (FSK) The price is another aspect that can be considered when choosing
    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities
    of IoT parts for smart home management system. Empty Cell Network topology Communication

    LTE/optical fiber/Wi-Fi very high very high Third party not applicable LTE/optical
    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability
    features of Insteon, X10, Z-Wave and ZigBee. Empty Cell Insteon X10 Z-Wave ZigBee
    ZigBee invisible to each other No No No Z-Wave invisible to each other No Yes
    X10 Yes Yes Insteon Yes 4.5. Security and privacy One of the most important issues
    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    are presented. • Widely used sensors in agricultural deployments are surveyed.
    • The potential of interoperable software use and adoption of IoT is discussed.
    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular
    IoT wireless technologies. Wireless technology Wireless standard Network type

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    Abstract: 6G and beyond will fulfill the requirements of a fully connected world
    and provide ubiquitous wireless connectivity for all. Transformative solutions
    are expected to drive the surge for accommodating a rapidly growing number of
    intelligent devices and services. Major technological breakthroughs to achieve
    connectivity goals within 6G include: (i) a network operating at the THz band
    with much wider spectrum resources, (ii) intelligent communication environments
    that enable a wireless propagation environment with active signal transmission
    and reception, (iii) pervasive artificial intelligence, (iv) large-scale network
    automation, (v) an all-spectrum reconfigurable front-end for dynamic spectrum
    access, (vi) ambient backscatter communications for energy savings, (vii) the
    Internet of Space Things enabled by CubeSats and UAVs, and (viii) cell-free massive
    MIMO communication networks. In this roadmap paper, use cases for these enabling
    techniques as well as recent advancements on related topics are highlighted, and
    open problems with possible solutions are discussed, followed by a development
    timeline outlining the worldwide efforts in the realization of 6G. Going beyond
    6G, promising early-stage technologies such as the Internet of NanoThings, the
    Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications, which are expected to have
    a far-reaching impact on wireless communications, have also been discussed at
    length in this paper. The envisioned key enabling technologies for 6G and beyond

    I. Introduction Wireless communication systems have experienced substantial revolutionary
    progress over the past few years. Various stakeholders, including commercial solutions
    providers, academic research groups, standards bodies, and end-users, have all
    greatly benefited from the radical changes led by the most recent 5G developments,
    which include paradigm-defining techniques such as network softwarization and
    virtualization, massive MIMO, ultra-densification, and the introduction of new
    frequency bands. Numerous burgeoning applications and verticals, including virtual
    and augmented reality (VAR), e-commerce, contactless payment, machine-to-machine
    communications, and enhanced mobile broadband, among others, have demonstrated
    the vast potential of 5G, which continues to evolve and adapt to a wide variety
    of emerging use cases. However, as societal needs continue to evolve, there has
    been a marked rise in a plethora of emerging use cases that cannot be served satisfactorily
    with 5G. For example, the next generation of VAR, i.e., holographic teleportation,
    requires Tbps-level data rates and microsecond-level latency, which cannot be
    achieved with even the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands within 5G. Further,
    increasing industrial automation and the move from Industry 4.0 to the upcoming
    Industry X.0 paradigm will push connectivity density well beyond the 10 6 k m
    2 metric that 5G is designed for, in addition to requiring an overhaul of existing
    network management practices. Further, an increase in the connection density will
    also result in demands for improved energy efficiency, which 5G is not designed
    for. Consequently, the research community has gravitated towards addressing the
    aforementioned major challenges, and we posit that ongoing research in the domains
    of terahertz band communications, intelligent surfaces and environments, and network
    automation, for example, may very well hold the key to the future of wireless.
    To this end, an amalgamation of societal needs and technological breakthroughs
    that serve to enable those needs are the key drivers for a generational leap beyond
    existing wireless systems. Together, these factors make a strong case for a focused
    discourse on the next frontier in wireless communications, i.e., 6G systems. We
    envision that 6G will not only enable a pervasively intelligent, reliable, scalable,
    and secure terrestrial wireless network, but will also incorporate space communications
    to form an omnipresent wireless network, in keeping with the need for true wireless
    ubiquity. This paper details our vision for the future of wireless communications,
    highlighting emerging use cases and detailing the key enabling technologies that
    are essential to the realization of 6G. We begin our discussion on 6G by formally
    introducing the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are expected to guide the
    design of 6G systems. While the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
    is working on a set of official recommendations for the KPI metrics, the tentative
    values have appeared in the public domain recently [1]. Table 1 presents these
    values and contrasts them against the metrics associated with 5G. These KPIs serve
    as the fundamental metrics to evaluate system performance. In particular, from
    the table, we note the following classes of KPIs: System Capacity: This class
    of KPIs primarily deals with metrics that are associated with system throughput.
    These include peak data rate, experienced data rate, peak spectral efficiency,
    experienced spectral efficiency, maximum channel bandwidth, area traffic capacity,
    and connection density. Within this context, the experienced data rate and spectral
    efficiency metrics refer to the values that should be guaranteed to 95% of all
    user locations [1]. System Latency: This class of KPIs includes the end-to-end
    latency metric, along with delay jitter. We note that jitter is a new KPI for
    6G that quantifies the latency variations in the system, and is absent from 5G.
    System Management: This class of KPIs primarily deals with metrics related to
    the management and orchestration of networks such as energy efficiency, reliability,
    and mobility. Here too we note that while 5G does not specify a target KPI for
    the energy efficiency metric, 6G introduces a target energy efficiency of 1 Tb/J.
    Achieving the KPIs highlighted in Table 1 will require revolutionary breakthroughs
    across all domains of wireless communications. In particular, we identify the
    following major thrusts: New Spectrum Usage and Radio Design Paradigms: While
    5G ensured the mainstream adoption of mmWave spectrum, the need for higher data
    rates and consequently larger channel bandwidths will necessitate the incorporation
    of terahertz (THz) and sub-THz spectrum within 6G. At the same time, the opening
    up of new spectrum bands will also require novel radio designs that can simultaneously
    sense and communicate over the entire EM spectrum. Novel Network Architectures:
    The classical cell-based architecture of wireless networks cannot scale to meet
    the area traffic capacity and connection density requirements put forth by 6G.
    Instead, 6G will need to incorporate communications infrastructure into the very
    fabric of the environment. Increasing Intelligence and Automation: The strict
    spectral efficiency, reliability, and latency requirements associated with 6G
    imply that manual configuration of the network will no longer be possible. Rather,
    network intelligence and automation will occupy centre stage, helping build an
    increasingly autonomous network. Enhancing Network Coverage Beyond the Terrestrial
    Domain: In order to achieve true wireless ubiquity, 6G will need to expand beyond
    terrestrial networks, incorporating both near-Earth as well as deep-space connectivity.
    TABLE 1 The Evolution From 5G to 6G Wireless Systems [1] Towards the fulfillment
    of this grand vision, we note that several enabling solutions have been conceived
    and are being actively studied. As shown in Figure 1, these technologies include:
    (i) a network operating at the THz band with abundant spectrum resources, (ii)
    intelligent communication environments that enable a wireless propagation environment
    with active signal transmission and reception, (iii) pervasive artificial intelligence,
    (iv) large-scale network automation, (v) an all-spectrum reconfigurable front-end
    for dynamic spectrum access, (vi) ambient backscatter communications for energy
    savings, (vii) the Internet of Space Things enabled by CubeSats and UAVs, and
    (viii) cell-free massive MIMO communication networks. We also make note of three
    very promising technologies that are expected to shape the future of communications,
    yet will not be sufficiently mature for 6G. These include: (i) the Internet of
    NanoThings, (ii) the Internet of BioNanoThings, and (iii) quantum communications.
    Further, in addition to the aforementioned key technologies, holistic security
    solutions will also be vital to the success of 6G. However, these fall outside
    the purview of this paper. FIGURE 1. The envisioned key enabling technologies
    for 6G and beyond wireless communications systems. Show All Further, we posit
    that while prior art concerning 6G wireless systems has been become increasingly
    commonplace over the past year [2]–[7], a majority of the past publications in
    this domain focus on a select few topics, potentially hampering a comprehensive
    overview in terms of key aspects that are expected to shape the future of wireless
    communications. In addition, discussion concerning beyond 6G systems such as the
    Internet of NanoThings, the Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications
    is equally critical but largely absent from existing publications. As research
    on 6G wireless systems continues to evolve and break new ground, this paper is
    intended to equip readers with a targeted insight into the next generation of
    wireless communications. More specifically, through this paper, we aim to deliver
    a holistic roadmap for 6G and beyond wireless systems, replete with a detailed
    discussion surrounding the use cases and key enabling technologies. The larger
    goal here is to encourage the scientific community to work together towards tackling
    the critical research challenges associated with the realization of the 6G systems.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present a wide
    variety of use cases that will be enabled by 6G. Further, Sections III–VI present
    details concerning key technologies that are critical to the success of 6G, along
    with a discussion on the major challenges faced by each. Then, in Section XI,
    we discuss promising enablers for beyond 6G systems, followed by a timeline for
    the evolution of 6G in Section XII. Finally, in Section XIII, we conclude this
    paper. SECTION II. Use Cases The lessons learned from the continued evolution
    of 5G systems will serve as the backdrop for use cases that will be best served
    by 6G. 5G first introduced the targeted use cases of enhanced mobile broadband
    (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine
    type communications (mMTC), intended to serve a wide variety of applications.
    However, as noted in Section I, there exist a plethora of applications for which
    the 5G KPIs are not strict enough. As we come to realize the performance trade-offs
    in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, energy efficiency, and reliability,
    associated with 5G systems, we can better posit the applications that would benefit
    the most from 6G. As shown in Figure 2, in the following, we present a variety
    of critical use cases that will be enabled by 6G. FIGURE 2. Use cases best served
    by 6G systems. Show All A. Multi-Sensory Holographic Teleportation While virtual
    reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have immensely benefited from eMBB and
    URLLC introduced as part of 5G, there are many applications such as advanced healthcare
    including remote diagnosis and surgery, high-resolution sensing for remote exploration,
    and near-real person video conferencing that cannot be adequately served by a
    combination of AR and VR. To this end, holographic teleportation has been recognized
    as the natural successor to AR and VR-based solutions. Unlike existing solutions,
    holographic teleportation operates in a true three-dimensional space and leverages
    all five senses– sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, to provide a truly immersive
    experience. At the same time, we note that holographic teleportation requires
    data rates close to 5 Tbps and an end-to-end latency of less than 1 ms [8], both
    of which are impossible to achieve with 5G systems. Thus, 6G, with its expected
    Tbps-level throughput and sub-millisecond latencies, will play a vital role in
    building upon the groundwork established by eMBB and URLLC. B. Real-Time Remote
    Healthcare The success of remote healthcare solutions primarily depends on both
    the quality as well as the availability of connectivity [9]. Concerning the former,
    we note that through its use of key enabling technologies such as THz band communications
    and network automation solutions, 6G will usher in the highest possible wireless
    communications quality focusing on very-high throughput augmented with ultra-low
    latency. Concerning the latter, the Internet of Space Things will play a vital
    role in providing pervasive connectivity, thus enhancing the availability of rural
    healthcare solutions. Further, we expect that within the domain of healthcare,
    advances in 6G and beyond will not only serve as a connectivity solution, but
    will also play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases as detailed
    in Section XI-B. C. Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems Autonomous vehicles and
    UAVs are some of the most promising cyber-physical systems in existence today
    [10], [11]. The operation of these autonomous systems is characterized by the
    exchange of large amounts of data between the constituent nodes, i.e., both vehicles
    and UAVs, relating to high-resolution real-time mapping of the terrain, route
    optimization, and traffic and safety information. While the resulting large volumes
    of data must be delivered within strict deadlines in an error-free manner, it
    also imperative to note that these nodes typically operate at speeds in excess
    of 100 km/h. Therefore in addition to providing sub-millisecond latency and very
    high reliability, the connectivity solution that enables autonomous cyber-physical
    systems must also offer robust operation at very high speeds, which is not possible
    with existing 5G systems [12]. D. Intelligent Industrial Automation Over the past
    few years, Industry 4.0 [13] has been the driving force behind industrial automation
    based on the concepts of supply chain optimization, autonomous equipment, additive
    manufacturing, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Yet, these concepts
    are treated as silos working in isolation, limiting the true potential of industrial
    automation. On the other hand, the upcoming Industry X.0 paradigm [14] seeks to
    realize synergies between the various nuances of industrial automation through
    its use of artificial intelligence. Vital to this vision are networked factories
    that serve as critical sources of big data that helps inform decision making.
    To this end, the modern industrial floor is expected to require reliable high-throughput
    connectivity across thousands of devices often with sub-millisecond response times,
    making it the perfect use case for the next frontier in wireless communications.
    E. High-Performance Precision Agriculture Within the broader domain of precision
    agriculture, soil moisture measurements have been a mainstay in irrigation decisions
    for decades now. However, real-time measurements and irrigation automation solutions
    still face challenges stemming from a lack of robust wireless coverage. Going
    beyond simple automated irrigation solutions, high-performance precision agriculture
    is largely centered around delivering data-driven insights to address the specific
    needs of customers, farms, crop, and soil. At the same time, scalable and timely
    access to such data is a major challenge owing to gaps in rural connectivity.
    Therefore, we expect that 6G, with its focus on ubiquitous wireless access, will
    play a major role in enhancing the adoption of technology in agricultural production.
    F. Space Connectivity While near-Earth and deep-space connectivity are still nascent
    within 5G, there are a wide variety of use cases ranging from radio astronomy
    and remote sensing to navigation and backhauling that would stand to benefit from
    the pervasive connectivity offered by 6G. More specifically, such applications
    include freight tracking, terrestrial cellular offloading, environmental monitoring,
    and long-range UAV coordination, to name a few. To this end, the Internet of Space
    Things as described in Section IX, will serve as the key enabling technology for
    beyond-Earth connectivity, furthering the reach of 6G systems. G. Smart Infrastructure
    and Environments The use cases discussed thus far primarily deal with the use
    of third-party systems that seek to leverage advanced telecommunications infrastructure.
    Simultaneously, the evolution of such infrastructure itself is an important use
    case. Going beyond network optimization strategies, there is also a need for exercising
    control over the propagation of wireless signals. To this end, we note that in
    5G and its predecessor systems, the wireless communication environment has always
    played a passive role. However, with the ever increasing demand for data, as evidenced
    by the applications presented herein, control over the manner in which electromagnetic
    waves interact with the indoor and outdoor environment will be critical to the
    success of 6G. In this direction, we posit that the intelligent communication
    environments described in Section IV will play a leading role in the ubiquity
    and pervasiveness of the next generation of wireless systems. SECTION III. Terahertz
    Band Communications Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in wireless data
    traffic brought forth by numerous exciting technologies in wireless communications.
    This exponential growth has been accompanied by the demand for higher data rates
    and better coverage [15]. Among emerging research and development trends in wireless
    communications, terahertz band (0.1-10 THz) communications has been envisioned
    as one of the key enabling technologies for the next decade. Buoyed by the availability
    of ultra-wide spectrum resources, the THz band can provide terabits per second
    (Tbps) links for a plethora of applications, ranging from ultra-fast massive data
    transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks
    to high-definition videoconferencing among mobile devices in small cells. Recently,
    the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released the frequency bands above
    95 GHz for research purposes [16]. While a handful of cellular operators have
    adopted low millimeter wave frequencies for their 5G services with the intention
    of achieving a maximum data rate of 100 Gbps, the test results thus far leave
    much to be desired, showing a peak data rate of around 1 Gbps.1 This gap between
    the targeted and practically achievable data rates is influenced by multiple factors,
    including a high complexity in realistic communication channels, imperfections
    in circuitry design, and interference from other systems operating in adjacent
    frequency bands, among others. Nevertheless, even though the THz bands have been
    applied in imaging and object detection, as well as for THz radiation spectroscopy
    in astronomical research, their use cases in wireless communications are still
    under investigation. Lying between the mmWave spectrum and infrared light spectrum,
    as shown in Figure 3, THz bands, with their abundant spectrum resources, have
    been previously deemed as a “no-man’s land”. However, major progress in the domains
    of transceiver and antenna design has seen THz links become a promising option
    for realizing indoor communications networks. More recently, there has been significant
    progress on realizing wireless network on chip (WNoC) using THz bands [17]. FIGURE
    3. The THz band offers hundreds of GHz usable spectrum resources for wireless
    communication links in long, medium, short, indoor, and near-field range. Show
    All A. Use Cases of THz Band Communications Different from wireless networks at
    lower frequencies, THz-band wireless communications has several unconventional
    application scenarios, owing to the distinct electromagnetic and photonics characteristics
    of this tremendously high frequency band. In addition to the promised Tbps-level
    links for cellular systems, THz-band spectrum can also be leveraged for the following
    scenarios: Local Area Networks: Several spectrum windows are feasible for short-range
    links within ten meters, including 625-725 GHz and 780-910 GHz [18]. THz band
    communications is expected to form the THz-optics bridge to enable seamless transition
    between fiber-optics and THz-band links with zero latency. Personal Area Networks:
    THz band communications can provide “fiber-like” data rate without the need of
    wires, between multiple devices at a distance of a few meters. Such communication
    scenarios can be found in indoor offices and multimedia kiosks. Data Center Networks:
    Conventional data centers manage and maintain connectivity in wired networks using
    cables, resulting in high costs in terms of both installation and reconfiguration.
    On the other hand, THz links provide promising prospects for seamless connectivity
    at ultra-high-speeds in fixed networks and adaptability for hardware reconfiguration.
    Wireless Network on Chip: As the trend in transceiver hardware development motivates
    a higher level of integration and miniaturization as well as weight reduction,
    the THz band links can serve as a promising candidate to establish wireless connections
    among different modules within the transceiver chassis, in order to replace the
    wired connections commonly found in existing transceiver hardware products. Nano-networks:
    With its wavelength falling into the nanometer (10−9 m) range, the THz band can
    operate better than any other frequencies in nano-networks. Within this context,
    a nano-network is a set of interconnected nano-devices or nano-machines for information
    exchange, storage, and computation. A more detailed overview can be found in Section
    XI-A. Inter-satellite Communications: Lying largely outside the Earth’s atmosphere,
    inter-satellite links are not constrained by atmospheric attenuation, which makes
    the THz band a favorable candidate for such communication links. Compared to existing
    spectrum resources allocated for inter-satellite links, the THz band has a much
    wider bandwidth which can accommodate more satellites and achieve higher link
    performance. Unlike the widely used optical links, the THz band does not impose
    stringent requirements on beam alignment, which can help maintain a high level
    of link stability as satellites drift out of their orbits. B. Devices in the THz
    Band The need for higher output power, lower phase noise, and better receiving
    sensitivity in THz band transceivers has driven advances in corresponding device
    development. Currently, three main directions are deployed in THz band signal
    generation: photonics-based, electronic-based, and emerging material-based, respectively.
    In the photonics-based approach, many III-V semiconductors, including gallium
    arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP), which provide high electron mobility,
    are excellent candidates especially for high frequency (i.e., above 100 GHz) applications.
    Such photonics-based techniques generate time-domain pulses with lengths of femto-seconds
    (10−15 s) and experimental works have demonstrated 50 Gbps data links in an indoor
    scenario at 300 GHz using the uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) technique
    [19]. The UTC-PDs and modified UTC-PD structures, an effective photomixing solution
    which allows wider spectrum tuning and simpler construction compared to laser
    pulse generators, has pushed the output signal range from 300 GHz to 2.5 THz,
    with output powers of 10 μW at 300 GHz and 1 μW at 1 THz [20]. Additionally, a
    design based on slot-antenna-integrated UTC-PDs has shown superior performance
    in generated THz band signal strengths at 350-850 GHz and 900 GHz-1.6 THz, compared
    to that of the bowtie-antenna integrated UTC-PD [21]. Similar photonics-based
    THz signal generation at above 1 THz can be realized using quantum cascade lasers
    (QCLs) and other solid state lasers [22]. However, the operations of such devices
    are limited at room temperatures, requiring liquid helium cooling, which affects
    their deployment in local area networks with space restrictions. Furthermore,
    photoconductive antennas (PCAs) have been utilized widely for both pulse and continuous-wave
    signal generation at THz band [23], demonstrating a wide spectrum (up to 4.5 THz)
    with a remarkable dynamic range of up to 100 dB [24]. In parallel to the photonics-based
    approach for THz band device design which down-converts the optical frequencies,
    the electronic-based THz band signal generation relies on frequency up-conversion
    using multipliers [25], including frequency doublers and triplers, as well as
    backward wave oscillators [26]. A recent experiment has demonstrated an all-electronics-based
    wireless link at 240 GHz with a throughput of 50 Gbps and a maximum 29% error
    vector magnitude using QPSK modulation [27]. The backward wave oscillator, which
    is a compact design to generate THz band signals based on the mechanism of energy
    transfer from an electron beam to an electromagnetic wave through a vacuum tube,
    has been used to generate signals at 300 GHz with an output power of 1 W in plasma
    diagnostics [26]. Among the two commonly used approaches, the photonics-based
    design benefits from a relatively simpler transceiver architecture based on the
    photomixing technique, while the electronics-based solution relies on cascaded
    frequency up-conversion of RF signals, which sets stringent requirements on linear-range
    operation and potentially limits the terahertz bandwidth. On the other hand, the
    electronics-based approach is less sensitive to environmental conditions, such
    as temperature, humidity, among others, which makes it more favorable for outdoor
    operations, whereas the link reliability from its photonics-based counterpart
    is affected by scattered particles in the channel, making the THz band link less
    robust. Besides these classical approaches for THz band device development, new
    materials, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanoribbons, are
    gaining more attention due to their extremely high electron mobility in the order
    of 8,000−10,000c m 2 /(V⋅s) at room temperature, as compared to 1,400 c m 2 /(V⋅s)
    of silicon, and 8,500 c m 2 /(V⋅s) of GaAs, which means that the link throughput
    can be potentially up to ten times higher than is currently achievable with most
    semiconductors [28]. The graphene-based devices, offering outstanding mechanical,
    electrical, and optical properties, have been utilized in the development of power
    detectors at 600 GHz [29] and 200 GHz [30], as well as plasmonic antenna arrays
    and transceivers [31], [32]. Graphene-based devices have the potential to break
    new ground in reaching the desired level of performance at much higher frequencies
    above 1 THz. C. Physical Layer Modeling at the THz Band The realization of wireless
    communications at THz frequencies requires the development of accurate channel
    models to capture the impact of both channel peculiarities including the high
    atmospheric attenuation and molecular absorption rates at various transmission
    windows, as well as the propagation effects including reflection, scattering,
    and diffraction, with respect to different materials. Current research has reported
    several efforts to provide fundamental understanding of such channels. For example,
    an early work in [33] demonstrates the remarkable capacity the THz band channel
    can support for short transmission distances. The model provides a detail analysis
    on the effect of attenuation caused by the molecular absorption and spreading
    loss, on which the performance of channel throughput is heavily dependent. One
    step further, in order to extend the transmission distance at THz bands, an idea
    dubbed as the ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM MIMO) communications,
    enabled by an element array size of 1024×1024 with plasmonic nano-antennas, can
    drastically boost the signal strength by steering and focusing the transmitted
    beams in both space and frequency [34]. Correspondingly, a UM MIMO channel model
    has been developed in [35] which takes into account the role of such arrays. Additionally,
    a stochastic channel model for indoor THz band communications at 300 GHz has been
    reported in [36] which characterizes both spatial and temporal domain channel
    information. More recently, based on the aforementioned applicable scenarios in
    the THz band, a stochastic channel model for kiosk applications has been reported
    in [37] which ranges from 200-340 GHz. The main takeaway from current models validated
    using either measurements or the ray-tracing technique is that the direct path
    between the transmitter and the receiver and the single-bounce reflected paths
    dominate the received power, while other channel effects, including diffraction
    and scattering, attenuate power significantly along propagation. On the basis
    of the ultra-wideband channel characterization, THz band communications faces
    a critical and challenging task of synchronization in the receiver design. Existing
    pulse-based modulation schemes permit the use of low-complexity non-coherent analogue
    detectors, e.g., energy detector and auto-correlation receiver, which involve
    the multiplication of the received signal with itself, followed by an integrator.
    However, a more advanced non-coherent receiver architecture in [38] based on a
    continuous time moving average symbol detection scheme demonstrates better performance
    compared to previous detection schemes for pulse-based modulations in terms of
    the symbol error rate. In addition, robust frequency and timing synchronization
    for multi-carrier communication in the THz band is desirable to decode multiple
    incoming signal streams. The work presented in [39] realizes both a low-rate sampling
    scheme for channels with high SNR values and a maximum likelihood-based algorithm
    for low SNR channels with satisfying bit-error-rate performance. More recently,
    a synchronization scheme based on medium access control protocols is reported
    in [40], which shows good performance in both a macro-scale scenario to overcome
    the distance limitation at the THz band and a nano-scale scenario for nano-devices
    for energy harvesting. Similarly, given the peculiar ultra-wideband nature and
    frequency selectivity of THz band communications, equalization solutions pose
    another relevant challenge [15], [41]. In [42], three equalization solutions,
    including the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding, a waveform with interference management
    for time-reversal systems, and an iterative algorithm with adaptive soft feedback,
    are reviewed and compared for an indoor channel. Results show that the iterative
    algorithm with adaptive soft feedback yields the most promising BER performance
    [42]. D. Medium Access Control in THz Band Communications On top of physical layer
    channel models, the medium access control (MAC) schemes in THz band communications
    should adopt certain spatial and spectral features in order to provide solutions
    in resolving issues such as the deafness problem and LoS blockage, among others
    [43], [44]. Different from commonly used MAC solutions in RF systems that utilize
    omnidirectional antennas, such as carrier sense multiple access with collision
    avoidance (CSMA/CA), the MAC protocols designed for THz band rely on handshakes
    between transceivers with highly directional beams. These razor-sharp beams can
    provide higher power radiation gain and prolong the transmission distance, but
    when misalignment happens, the deafness problem arises. As such, the deafness
    avoidance approach is required in MAC scheme design. Existing solutions utilized
    in IEEE 802.15.3c [45] and others employ a beam-training phase to estimate and
    steer beams towards destined devices. Recent works also propose methods based
    on angular division multiplexing [46] and a priori aided channel tracking schemes
    [47]. The results in such proposed solutions suggest that with good beam alignment
    strategies the channel throughput can be improved significantly. Moreover, the
    MAC protocols can also resolve the issue of LoS blockage where the received power
    of a user device may undergo deep fading due to the device being held in a manner
    that blocks the LoS path. Studies have shown that such attenuation by the human
    body can be as high as 20 dB at 60 GHz and up [49], [50]. To mitigate the blockage
    problem, researchers have proposed a multi-hop scheme at the mmWave and THz bands
    to form alternative routes [51], [52]. A careful link-level scheduling and neighbor
    discovery process is necessary to achieve high throughput while maintaining low
    interference. E. Open Problems in THz Band Communications Currently, the fabrication
    and testing of THz band antenna arrays remains a relevant challenge. Some techniques
    based on photolithography, electro-beam lithography, among others, are able to
    produce the front-end with hundreds of plasmonic antenna elements. The utilization
    of large antenna arrays can extend the signal coverage by forming array radiation
    patterns with main lobes of high directivity, thus focusing energy towards desired
    directions. However, such highly directional beams limit coverage in the angular
    domain, causing low energy efficiency at the transmitter to serve each user. A
    recent solution named “THzPrism” has been proposed to form multiple beams with
    slight frequency shifts towards different directions while maintaining good distance
    coverage [53] in addition to other proposed solutions discussed in Section III-C
    to solve the transmission distance problem. This design employs true time delays
    for RF chains before phase-shifters to obtain a prism-like effect, which spreads
    the original beam into several beams, each with a slight frequency shift with
    respect to the center frequency. In parallel to the quest for more novel solutions
    in antenna design, other remaining challenges reside in the control and signal
    processing schemes associated with transceiver designs in the THz band. On the
    one hand, real-time control algorithms are needed. On the other hand, communication
    protocols for coordination between the transmitter, receiver, and reflectarrays
    are needed. Among others, in [54], researchers reported a smart reflectarray-assisted
    mmWave system compatible with IEEE 802.11ad. Besides the design of the reflectarray
    and a study on deployment strategies, a three-way beam-searching protocol is developed,
    in which the reflectarray coordinates with the transmitter through a 2.4 GHz control
    channel in order to discover the best joint transmit and reflect sectors for which
    the signal at the receiver is maximized. However, this work does not capture the
    extended functionalities of plasmonic reflectarrays. Furthermore, when highly
    directional beams are utilized at mobile transceivers, a relevant challenge arises
    from the limited field-of-view of antenna arrays for each transceiver to locate
    the next hop to forward its data; thus, new routing solutions are necessary for
    THz band communications to efficiently discover and establish links. A study in
    [55] reports a solution in link discovery at THz band using a leaky-wave antenna
    to sense the angular information of a user. SECTION IV. Intelligent Communication
    Environments Along with the rapid growth in the number of wireless devices, services,
    and applications, a corresponding demand for higher speed wireless communications
    has burgeoned in recent years. Nevertheless, the major challenge at mmWave and
    THz-band frequencies is the limited communication distance because of the remarkably
    high path loss inherent to small wavelengths and the limited transmission power
    of mmWave and THz-band transceivers [56]. Current solutions primarily focus on
    the advancement of wireless transceiver hardware and software, as well as network
    optimization strategies. However, the wireless propagation medium has been largely
    neglected. The wireless communication environments, for both indoor and outdoor
    scenarios, can be actively utilized in order to become controllable for signal
    propagation. To control signal propagation in environments is essentially to control
    how electromagnetic waves interact with scatterers, which include indoor furniture
    and outdoor buildings as well as other infrastructure. Typically, the controllable
    behaviors of electromagnetic waves include controlled reflection, absorption,
    wave collimation, signal waveguiding, and polarization tuning, as illustrated
    in Figure 4. The notion of “Intelligent Communication Environments” resides in
    the control algorithms where deep learning and reinforcement learning are to be
    exploited to dynamically configure the environments. In the following subsections,
    we elaborate on these controllable wave behaviors, current research efforts, as
    well as corresponding open issues. FIGURE 4. Conceptual design of a plasmonic
    reflectarray able to unconventionally manipulate EM waves [48]. Show All A. Basics
    of Intelligent Communication Environments The intelligent environments can be
    seen as a three-dimensional structure with several layers, each with different
    functionalities. Recent research under the EU Research Project “VisorSurf” has
    demonstrated a structure with five main layers, which are (from top to bottom)
    the EM behavior layer, the actuation and sensing layer, the shielding layer, the
    computing layer, and the communication layer, respectively [57]. Specifically,
    the EM behavior layer is composed of metasurfaces, a two-dimensional representation
    of metamaterials, and has a tunable impedance to control directions of reflection
    of the EM waves. Some other works use reflectarray antennas as the top surface
    [58], [59]. The actuation and sensing layer consists of circuits for phase shifting
    and sensors for impinging signal sensing. Some options for actuation include PIN
    diodes with controllable biasing voltage as switches in reflectarray antennas,
    and complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) transistors as well as micro-electro-mechanical
    (MEMS) switches for metasurfaces. The shielding layer isolates the upper and lower
    parts of the layered structure so as to minimize the possible interference. The
    computing layer serves to control the phase shifts and process sensed impinging
    waves. To this end, another reported solution makes use of field-programmable
    gated arrays (FPGAs) to fulfill such functions on metasurfaces [60]. Finally,
    the communication layer connects all upper layers and serves as the gateway towards
    the central controller which processes all connection requests, forwards and receives
    signals, and conducts the aforementioned controlled wave functions. Compared to
    existing relays with multiple antennas which are widely deployed in wireless networks,
    Intelligent Communication Environments offer the following advantages: (i) a higher
    spatial diversity due to the wide coverage of the intelligent surface with controllable
    antenna arrays, (ii) a reduced processing time given that the computing and communication
    layers are directly underneath the surface layer, and (iii) a higher flexibility
    in network routing when impinging signals come from different directions and the
    intelligent surfaces are able to collimate waves and reflect them towards desired
    directions. B. Functionalities of Intelligent Environments Bolstered by the layered
    structure, intelligent surfaces can enable controlled EM wave operations. At micro-
    and mmWave frequencies, metasurfaces are considered as a good candidate. While
    at THz bands, graphene-based plasmonic antenna arrays are desirable. In metasurfaces,
    a meta-atom is the smallest unit, which is a conductor with a size smaller than
    half the wavelength of the signal. Metasurfaces can thus control the impinging
    EM waves with a very fine granularity. The meta-atoms are interconnected by a
    set of miniaturized controllers that connect the switches of the metasurfaces
    in the computing layer, while a gateway serves as the connectivity unit in the
    communication layer to provide inter-element and external control. At THz bands,
    when the metasurfaces do not yield optimal performance, the graphene-based plasmonic
    antenna arrays serve as a promising alternative. Compared to metallic antenna
    arrays, the plasmonic antenna arrays can have much denser element layout and go
    beyond the conventional λ/2 sampling of space towards more precise space and frequency
    beamforming, owing to the physics of plasmonics. In our previous work, we have
    demonstrated that, graphene can be used to build nano-transceivers and nano-antennas
    with a maximum dimension of λ/20 at THz frequencies, allowing them to be densely
    integrated in very small footprints (1024 elements in less than 1 mm2), as shown
    in Figure 4 [34]. Therefore, by incorporating the graphene-based plasmonic antenna
    arrays at THz bands and metasurfaces operating at mmWave bands, we can expand
    the operational spectrum of intelligent environments and utilize them in transmission
    and reception in a controllable manner. C. Layered Structure of Intelligent Communication
    Environments Based on the operating principles of the aforementioned Intelligent
    Communication Environments, in this subsection, we anatomize the layered structure
    and detail each layer’s functionality. 1) Metamaterial Plane The metamaterial
    plane is also the surface plane, as shown in Figure 4. In designs based on reflectarrays,
    phase shifts are applied to each element to improve useful signals while canceling
    interference [58], [61]. The metasurface element proposed in [62] with millimeter-scale
    dimensions is connected to a PIN diode with a bias voltage to control operation
    modes, such as altering polarizations. In general, this layer comprises the supported
    EM function of the tile as well as its operation principle. In particular, reflectarray
    employ modifiable phase shifts applied over their surface. In the far field of
    radiation, reflected rays can be considered co-directional, and their superposition–constructive
    or destructive–is controlled by the applied phase shifts [63]. Hence, wave scattering
    or controlled reflecting functions can be attained. Metamaterial tiles, however,
    operate as surfaces with tunable local impedance [64]. Impinging waves create
    inductive surface currents over the tile, which can be routed by tuning the local
    impedance across the tile. Notice that the Huygens Principle dictates that any
    EM wavefront can be traced back to a current distribution over a surface [65].
    As a result, in principle, metamaterials can produce any custom EM function as
    a response to an impinging wave. Common functions include wave steering, focusing,
    collimating (i.e., producing a planar wavefront as a response to an impinging
    wave), polarizing, phase altering, full or partial absorption, frequency selective
    filtering and even modulation [60], [64]. 2) Sensing and Actuation Plane In order
    to control the EM waves per actual channel conditions, the programmable surfaces
    are expected to sense the propagation environment and actuate the upper surface
    plane accordingly. Such layer contains hardware elements that can be controlled
    to achieve a phase shift or impedance distribution across a tile. Commonly, the
    layer comprises arrays of planar antennas–such as copper patches–and multi-state
    switches between them. Reflectarray tiles usually employ PIN diodes with controllable
    biasing voltage as switches [62]. Metamaterials have employed a wider range of
    choices, both in the shape and geometry of the planar antennas and in the nature
    of switches. CMOS transistors, PIN diodes, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Switches (MEMS),
    micro-fluidic switches, magnetic and thermal switches are but a few of the considered
    options in the literature [66]. Notably, some options–such as micro-fluid switches–are
    state-preserving in the sense that they require power only to change state but
    not to maintain it (i.e., contrary to biased PIN diodes). Sensing impinging waves
    are also necessary for exerting efficient control over them. While this information
    can be provided by external systems [67], with dynamic channels and mobile end-users,
    tiles capable of incorporating sensing capabilities can be immune from the channel
    aging problem [68]. The sensing can be direct, employing specialized sensors,
    or indirect, e.g., via deducing some impinging wave attributes from currents or
    voltages between tile elements. 3) Computing Plane The computing functionality
    serves the processing functionality in the controllable surface system. In the
    metasurface designs in [60] and [62], FPGA-based controllers are connected to
    the metasurfaces to implement the computing functions. This layer comprises the
    computing hardware that controls the actuation and sensing elements. Its minimum
    computing duties include the mapping of local phase or impedance values to corresponding
    actuator states. Reflectarray tiles commonly implement this layer using FPGAs
    and shift registers [62]. Metasurfaces, and specifically HyperSurfaces, can alternatively
    employ standard IoT devices for the same purpose. Moreover, they can optionally
    include computing hardware elements (ASICs) distributed over the tile meta-atoms
    [69], [70]. This can enable autonomous and cognitive tiles, where meta-atoms detect
    the presence and state of one another, and take local actuation decisions to meet
    a general functionality objective. Nonetheless, these advanced capabilities are
    not required for programmable wireless environments. 4) Communication Plane The
    communication plane passes the signals from the processing layer to corresponding
    metasurface layer and collects signals from the sensing and actuation plane. In
    complicated programmable surface systems, communication occurs among planes to
    realize various EM wave control functions. The command signals normally operate
    at much lower frequencies compared to the ones emitted from programmable surfaces;
    such signals prove to be more efficient in tuning the bias voltage of the PIN
    diodes [60]. This layer comprises the communication stack and connects actuation
    and sensing layer as well as computing layer with tile-external devices such as
    controllers. In the simplest case, this layer is implemented within the computing
    hardware, acting as a gateway to the external world using any common protocol
    such as the Ethernet. HyperSurface tiles with embedded distributed computing elements
    additionally require inter-tile communication schemes, to handle the information
    exchange between smart meta-atoms. Both wired and wireless intra-tile communication
    is possible [69], [70]. In both cases, the ASIC hardware employs custom and nonstandard
    protocols. D. Use Cases of Intelligent Environments With the utilization of well-coordinated
    tiles in the Intelligent Environments, the wireless system can be greatly improved
    in terms of communication efficacy. 1) On Signal Propagation Enhancements From
    the perspective of multiple users and moving users, the Intelligent Environments
    system is envisioned to serve a large number of users with more realistic user
    patterns, including mobile users and users in a cluster. Additionally, the Intelligent
    Environments system should ensure physical layer security against jamming and
    eavesdropping, an increasingly important problem that remains to be solved. Transmission
    Distance: For users in the NLoS areas relative to the transmitter, the Intelligent
    Environments system is expected to extend the transmission distance and reach
    previously uncovered areas through waveguiding or reflection. Simulation results
    in [67] demonstrate that at 60 GHz the coverage can be extended to an entire NLoS
    area. Interference Mitigation: Due to the scenario with multiple users, there
    is inevitably concern of interference. As in the envisioned scheme, each Intelligent
    Environment unit is dedicated to an individual user, thus the majority of interference
    will reside in the wireless section of the end-to-end link. Reliability: The primary
    efforts in terms of physical layer reliability include using highly directional
    antennas to nullify jamming, forming exclusion areas, assigning secret keys to
    legitimate users, and so on. From the perspective of fundamental propagation channels
    with Intelligent Environments, good reliability is achieved when the eavesdroppers
    do not have the knowledge of the frequencies where packages are transmitted, or
    the eavesdroppers are in the same frequency channel but with much higher noise
    which makes the intercepted data impossible to decode [71]. Therefore, the dedicated
    links in Intelligent Environments are inherently secure. 2) On the Physical Layer
    Security The more frequent data exchange between users and service providers exposes
    a higher risk of personal and private data leakage. The 6G wireless network should
    not only inherit existing network secrecy measures, but also provide enhanced
    physical layer security associated with new enabling techniques. In current 5G
    networks, highly directional beams are used for mmWave communications in spatial
    domain to prevent signals from being intercepted. However, a recent study has
    shown that such pencil-sharp beams are still vulnerable to agile eavesdropping
    [72]. Other physical layer encryption algorithms, including source coding approaches
    such as the low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, are demonstrated with optimal
    performance under specific conditions [73]. Furthermore, existing solutions in
    the reconfigurable intelligence surface apply reflectarrays, which do not have
    the capability to effectively distinguish target users from malicious attackers.
    Hence, a solution based on the Intelligent Environments serves the purpose of
    identifying unintended recipients, creating null areas, and improving link secrecy
    rate. Essentially, the envisioned Intelligent Environments have the capability
    to sense user locations and exchange such information with a system controller
    to verify the user’s authenticity. Only affirmative users shall be served with
    signal streams from the sender. On the other hand, connection requests from unauthorized
    users (i.e., eavesdroppers) will be nullified from attempting to access secure
    information or even trying to establish links with the sender. In practice, the
    Intelligent Environments can be configured to tune the phases of multipath components
    in the channel, such that those arrived at intended users can be coherently combined
    with boosted received signal strengths, whereas those intercepted by eavesdroppers
    will be scrambled or even cancelled due to non-coherent combining [74]. Simulation
    results demonstrate a 6-dB attenuation observed at the received signal strength
    from the eavesdropper, validating the proposed physical layer security solution
    [74]. Hence, the good channel secrecy is achieved when such unintended users do
    not own the knowledge of equalizer to recover the transmitted signals from noise.
    E. Open Problems in Intelligent Environments A number of open problems need to
    be addressed in order to facilitate the Intelligent Environments in becoming a
    market-ready solution. Trade-off Between Dimensions and Energy Consumption: In
    terms of real-world applications, the Intelligent Environments are expected to
    be coated onto surfaces of interior walls and/or ceilings, and building facades,
    which require dimensions that can both fit specific installation areas and satisfy
    link requirements. Meanwhile, with more reflectarray elements and RF chains built
    into the system, the energy consumption will also increase, due to the advanced
    signal processing circuitry. Therefore, how to achieve an economic solution to
    balance the overall dimension and energy consumption while serving users to its
    desired performance is a nontrivial issue. Compatibility With Existing Solutions:
    Current Wi-Fi access points have a mature protocol stack to sense the channel
    and establish links with users. In order for the Intelligent Environments to assist
    with improving indoor signal coverage, it needs to be compatible with the IEEE
    802.11 series standard. For now this is still under research and serves as a worthy
    problem for novel solutions. Standardization: With many candidate approaches being
    investigated in reflectarrays, metasurfaces, frequency selective surfaces, among
    others, there has not been a consensus on how to standardize the device architecture,
    maximum emitted power, and communication protocols. As more ideas evolve, a standardization
    effort within a work group is necessary towards a solidary framework. Inclusion
    of advanced application scenarios: as a promising solution for future generation
    of wireless systems, the Intelligent Communication Environments should be designed
    to fit to more advanced scenarios, for example, in use cases with a very large
    quantity of devices as in the Internet of Things, under high demands of real-time
    video streaming, with devices of high mobility, among others. Smart resource allocation
    solutions: resources in the spatial, temporal, and spectral domains should be
    allocated in an optimal manner to satisfy per-user demand. AI-driven design and
    optimization: in complicated scenarios under which no closed-form solutions can
    be found using conventional optimization approaches, advanced algorithms in artificial
    intelligence can assist in the deployment of Intelligent Communication Environments,
    especially when complex surface layout or structures are in presence. SECTION
    V. Pervasive Artificial Intelligence In the past few years, the field of artificial
    intelligence (AI) has witnessed immense growth, leading to its application in
    a wide variety of fields across both academia and industry. In the realm of communications
    and signal processing, AI can be readily applied to cognitive radios, remote sensing,
    computer vision, and network management. More specifically, in the domain of wireless
    communications, AI and its associated algorithms are also gradually proving their
    utility in various emerging techniques such as massive MIMO communications which
    requires efficient channel estimation and symbol detection. Such tasks often do
    not yield low complexity optimal solutions in complex channels [75], and thus
    parallel processing inherent in machine learning can be favorably leveraged to
    enhance computational capacity. Admittedly, even though current wireless communication
    networks follow a layered structure, in which each layer primarily serves several
    functions, applications of AI and relevant algorithms are gradually bridging the
    gap across layers in a way that can globally optimize the performance in the entire
    wireless network. However, in order to provide a marked trail to navigate through
    a plethora of pervasive AI applications, this section is organized based on the
    existing layers. It is worth noting that AI is a broad concept, under which reside
    several branches covering interleaved research topics, such as robotics, natural
    language processing, machine learning (ML), computer vision, among others. In
    this section, we focus specifically on the ML algorithms and their applications
    in wireless communications under the AI umbrella. These two terms are thus used
    interchangeably in this section. As shown in Figure 5, artificial intelligence
    can be applied to each layer of the wireless network. At the network layer, machine
    learning (ML) algorithms can be used for traffic clustering to further adapt the
    network resources to various scenarios [76]. At the physical and MAC layers, deep
    learning can optimize resource allocation strategies for power distribution, and
    modulation and coding schemes, among others. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms
    can also assist with channel estimation and multi-user detection. FIGURE 5. Applications
    of artificial intelligence at different layers of wireless systems. Show All A.
    AI in the Physical Layer Traditionally, physical layer modeling has been model-oriented—a
    practice in which mathematical models following a certain framework are proposed
    and optimized under constraints to satisfy a series of pre-determined performance
    requirements. For example, in order to conduct channel estimation, a channel model
    is assumed along with other parametric configurations. These model-based solutions
    usually perform well if the derivation of mathematical models is relatively straightforward
    or there exists a closed-form solution. The models can then be validated by field
    measurements or numerical simulations. However, in real-world scenarios, the applicability
    of such model-based solutions falls short in complicated environments, due to
    factors such as non-linearity inside systems and uncontrollable interference,
    among others. On the other hand, another approach, which is based on statistics,
    or data sets, builds the model through learning from the data. This method is
    particularly useful when theoretical analysis is intractable or when a closed-form
    solution is difficult to obtain. For example, in diffusion-based channels commonly
    found in molecular communication, the channel characteristics depend largely on
    the environment, making them challenging to model theoretically [77]. In such
    cases, some data is used for training, which can help establish a model, while
    other data is used for testing in order to validate the model. To date, artificial
    intelligence has demonstrated its usefulness in various physical layer techniques.
    For example, in channel estimation and symbol detection, deep learning approaches
    reported in [78], [79] have shown that the proposed deep learning-based symbol
    detection algorithms can provide robust and accurate results with reduced complexity.
    Furthermore, a deep learning method based on the deep neural network architecture
    also demonstrates an improved channel estimation accuracy under the effects of
    non-linearities of power amplifiers, I/Q imbalance, and quantization errors induced
    by hardware impairments [80]. An autoencoder-based communication system is proposed
    to reconstruct the transmitted signals from channel impairment based on trained
    deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner [81]. Furthermore, self-supervised
    learning is becoming a trend for user localization since it has been demonstrated
    that relevant methods can significantly reduce the size of labeled dataset for
    efficient processing [82] B. AI in Wireless Networks In other essential layers
    of a wireless network, the existence of rich datasets lends itself to the applicability
    of machine learning-based solutions. In routing protocol design for wireless sensor
    networks, researchers have successfully utilized reinforcement learning methods
    to achieve a more energy-efficient routing scheme for underwater sensor networks
    [83]. In the vehicular industry, autonomous driving has already been studied and
    become a reality in some cities in Arizona, US.2 With respect to vehicular communication
    networks, due to the constant movement of vehicles, a predictive model based on
    real-time data has superiority over traditional theoretical models in terms of
    accuracy. Artificial intelligence and its plethora of algorithms can be applied
    in varied ways in such networks: autoencoders for predicting traffic flow [84],
    k -means clustering for traffic congestion control [85], and Q -learning for intelligent
    resource management [86], among others [87]. In the Internet of Space Things,
    with our envisioned multi-band communication capabilities in both inter-satellite
    and ground-to-satellite links, we have proposed a deep neural network-based resource
    allocation strategy to enable a flexible scheme for CubeSats to stay connected
    without human intervention from the ground [88]. Apart from advancements in algorithm
    development, a potential issue dwells on the location of data storage and processing,
    which has largely happened in central data centers in the cloud. For devices distributed
    in a wide geographic range, this undoubtedly adds significant delays in performing
    tasks which require real-time operation. Moreover, a centralized computing manner
    is not desired from perspectives of data security and constraint in processing
    capacity [89]. In order to relieve such challenges, edge AI pushes local devices
    to fulfil operation and management tasks. Admittedly, this could lead to possible
    overburden in local devices, since they are not equipped with as powerful processing
    units as the cloud processing center, however, research efforts in this direction
    are dedicated to: (i) acceleration in boosting the hardware’s processing capability,
    and (ii) leveraging the coordination between local and central processing units
    to optimization task distribution. C. AI in Network Management and Orchestration
    AI, or more specifically ML, has an integral role to play in the management of
    networks [90]–[92]. In fact, Clark et al. introduced the concept of the Knowledge
    Plane [93] back in 2003, describing it as a pervasive ML-based system within the
    network that is geared towards providing services and advice to other elements
    of the network. More recently, with sofware-defined networking (SDN) and network
    function virtualization (NFV) becoming mainstream, large-scale data acquisition
    has become easier than ever before, making a strong case for ML-based management
    and orchestration primitives within 6G, ultimately leading to full network automation
    as discussed in the next section. In particular, the domain of network management
    presents a wide variety of problems that can be broadly categorized into: [91]
    Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is typically applied to problems relating
    to traffic prediction [94] and classification [95], as well as slice resource
    prediction [96]. While the former primarily involves preemptively determining
    the network traffic load, as well as determining the applications, protocols and
    QoS classes the traffic belongs to, for fine-grained traffic engineering, the
    latter involves predicting the resource requirements associated with different
    network slices based on the anticipated traffic load. Reinforcement Learning:
    Reinforcement learning typically finds use in problems associated with resource
    management [97], [98]. For example, the popular virtual network embedding problem
    wherein the network orchestrator performs optimal placement of virtual network
    functions onto the underlying physical substrate, is highly amenable to reinforcement
    learning [99]. Other applications include elastic scaling of network infrastructure
    [100], failure prevention, and configuration rollback [101]. Unsupervised Learning:
    While both supervised learning and reinforcement learning have shown significant
    promise in the network management domain, we note that there exist certain use
    cases such as those relating to optimizing the end-users’ Quality of Experience
    (QoE) [102] and network security [103] where: (i) labeled data for training is
    simply not present and (ii) the real-time nature of the application makes it impractical
    to wait for feedback. In such cases, unsupervised learning can prove to be an
    indispensable tool. For example, intrusion detection systems based on autoencoders
    have been shown to outperform supervised learning-based systems [104]. D. Open
    Problems for Pervasive AI During early years of 5G standardization, researchers
    have discussed potentials of AI in achieving high time and spectrum efficiency
    once incorporated in 5G. Specifically, AI algorithms can help facilitate the following
    tasks which would yield low efficiency with conventional solutions: identify network
    anomalies, allocate network resources, perform network management, among others
    [106]. However, so far these solutions have not been officially adopted in 5G
    standards worldwide. In June 2020, the ITU has initiated an AI/ML in 5G challenge
    to motivate researchers to identify and solve real-world problems using AI/ML
    solutions in relevant 5G directions.3 As such, it is envisioned that such efforts
    would be factored in later 5G development but will be materialized in a more concrete
    and pervasive manner in 6G. While pervasive artificial intelligence in wireless
    communication networks will undoubtedly bring a paradigm shift towards data-oriented
    approaches, there are still open problems to be resolved. First, thus far no agreement
    has ever been reached on which algorithms work the best to solve a generalized
    problem in wireless networks, such as modulation and coding scheme design, channel
    estimation, and resource allocation, among others. Almost all published works
    claim significant accuracy or reduced complexity with either analytical theories
    or practical data sets [107]. Additionally, we note the absence of an effective
    method to draw a fair comparison among all proposed solutions, due to variations
    in selected data sets, assumptions, evaluation criteria, and so on. However, when
    it comes to realistic deployments, a careful gleaning process should be performed
    in order to identify algorithms without loss of general applicability. Second,
    the limited availability of quality datasets is detrimental to the testing and
    validation of proposed classification or regression algorithms. SECTION VI. Network
    Automation SDN and NFV have been widely recognized as the major paradigm shifts
    that occurred with the advent of 5G [108]. In particular, SDN has paved the way
    for the separation of the data and control planes, while NFV has been instrumental
    in decoupling the software from the hardware. Consequently, both wired and wireless
    networks have witnessed significant benefits from the adoption of SDN and NFV,
    including but not limited to simplified network management and service deployment,
    availability of advanced traffic engineering solutions and fine-grained network
    slicing techniques, and reduced CAPEX and OPEX. A major contribution of network
    softwarization has also been the commoditization of key network components such
    as switches [109] and base stations [110], [111], allowing for their implementation
    on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. In addition, the large open-source
    community supporting these projects has played a pivotal role in engaging a wider
    set of stakeholders than was previously possible. As networks evolve further,
    the traditional network operations routine, rooted in manual configuration and
    static script-based primitives, cannot keep up with the increasing complexity.
    Instead, we posit that automation will serve as the major driving force behind
    building upon the improvements brought forth by SDN and NFV. More specifically,
    network automation is defined as the process of automating the configuration,
    management, testing, deployment, and operations of physical and virtual devices
    within a network [112]. Network automation is intended to speed up the delivery
    of network services while adhering to dynamic and robust service-level agreements
    (SLAs), and reducing the potential for errors through minimization of manual intervention.
    Standardization efforts in this domain have led to the introduction of the Network
    Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in the control plane and the Management Data Analytics
    Service (MDAS) in the management plane, for enhanced data collection and analytics
    functionalities within 3GPP Releases 15 and 16 [113], [114]. Both these functions
    form a critical segment of the Service-Based Architecture (SBA) within 5G, highlighting
    the growing importance of network automation. To this end, we explore three key
    tenets of network automation in this section– software-defined programmable data
    planes, automated service decomposition and orchestration, and self-driving networks.
    While the first two are primarily concerned with automating specific aspects of
    the network, i.e., the data plane and the network slicing procedure, self-driving
    networks are the holy grail of network automation, requiring absolutely no manual
    intervention. A. Software-Defined Programmable Data Planes Being the most popular
    Southbound API, OpenFlow [115] is synonymous with SDN and has been featured widely
    in 5G networks. Yet, the stateless match-action abstraction implemented by OpenFlow
    precludes true data plane programmability since it relies largely on static header
    field matching. Within the context of this paper, we define data plane programmability
    as a feature that allows data plane devices, such as switches, to expose their
    packet-processing logic to the control plane in order for it be completely reconfigured
    if required. For example, the controller should be seamlessly able to modify the
    packet parsing and processing pipeline as required, add support for new protocols,
    and modify existing ones. To this end, P4 [116] is being increasingly recognized
    as “the programming language for the data plane”. P4 supports a wide variety of
    hardware ranging from ASICs to commodity CPUs, and allows the controller to specify:
    (i) a packet parser for extracting header fields, and (ii) a collection of match-action
    tables that process these headers. Further, we note that the operation of many
    applications depends upon the real-time state of the system, and relying on the
    controller to update the forwarding state each time introduces a significant latency
    burden. Consequently, there has been a growing body of research that seeks to
    develop stateful data planes, wherein some of the stateful packet processing and
    control tasks are offloaded to the data plane switches [117]–[119]. For example,
    a stateful data plane device may store some form of packet metadata, using it
    to process new packets belonging to the same flow. The general packet forwarding
    rules are still set by the controller, however, the presence of state information
    provides context for rule selection at the switch level. Programmable stateful
    data planes present a variety of inter-related research challenges. First, there
    is a need for a generic broad-based definition of state, along with abstractions
    that expose this state. Second, since packet-level state maintenance will be done
    by distributed switching devices, there is a need for a state consistency mechanism.
    A mechanism of this kind could potentially be enforced through the controller,
    to prevent conflicting forwarding actions. Third, security considerations present
    another important challenge. If the data plane switches are going to perform actions
    based on packet metadata, a malicious actor could easily use malformed packets
    to trigger state transitions for example. In this case, ultra-lightweight mechanisms
    will be needed to verify packet integrity. B. Automated Service Decomposition
    and Orchestration Network slicing allows for the provisioning of differentiated
    services over the same physical infrastructure [120], and has been a major research
    focus in the cellular domain [121]–[124]. However, the slice instantiation and
    deployment process is largely template-driven and requires manual configuration.
    For example, current 3GPP network slicing specification [120] is primarily based
    on the concept of network slice templates (NSTs). An NST explicitly defines the
    virtual network functions (VNFs) and associated service function chain that comprise
    a network service. Consequently, such network slicing primitives allow for the
    deployment of a limited set of network services, i.e., only those services for
    which a template has already been defined. Clearly, an approach of this kind is
    not scalable because: (i) it does not provide a mechanism to deal with new kinds
    of network services, and (ii) as network services increase in complexity, the
    effort required to create and maintain templates will become an operational burden.
    Going beyond the traditional template-driven model, we propose the concept of
    automated service decomposition and orchestration for network slice automation,
    as shown in Figure 6. To this end, and in line with 3GPP terminology, we identify
    three major stakeholders– the communication service customers (CSCs), the communication
    service providers (CSPs), and the virtual infrastructure service providers (VISPs).
    The CSCs request communications services from CSPs, who instantiate network slices
    and deploy them over infrastructure owned by VISPs to deliver the requested services.
    As part of the slice automation workflow, the CSCs provide high-level requirements
    such as those relating to latency, throughput, reliability, etc., along the lines
    of the emerging intent-based networking paradigm [125]. Next, the CSC automatically
    decomposes the request into a constituent VNF-forwarding graph (VNF-FG). It is
    important to note here that the service to VNF-FG mapping is not a based on a
    template, but instead makes use of deep learning models to extract service requirements
    and construct the corresponding VNF-FG. The resulting service-specific VNF-FG
    also contains the resource requirements for the constituent VNFs, allowing for
    seamless deployment onto the underlying infrastructure. Once the service has been
    deployed, continuous monitoring and real-time telemetry are used to ensure operational
    optimality. FIGURE 6. Automated network slicing framework. Show All C. Self-Driving
    Networks For decades, the network operator has served as the centerpiece of network
    operations. However, the increasing complexity of communications networks coupled
    with the constant state of flux brought forth by an ever-increasing number of
    connected devices has made the task of real-time network management nearly impossible
    for human operators. Therefore, there is a strong case for transitioning from
    operator-driven networks to self-driving networks. More specifically, self-driving
    networks are expected to allow for elastic utilization of resources, error-free
    operation, prompt and targeted responses to security incidents, and proactive
    rather than reactive service handling [126, §2]. Seeking complete automation of
    network management, a self-driving network is defined as a network where: (i)
    network measurements are task-driven and tightly integrated with the control of
    the network, and (ii) large-scale data analytics and machine learning models are
    used for network control, as opposed to closed-form models of individual protocols
    [127]. In a nutshell, self-driving networks should be capable of measuring, analyzing,
    and controlling themselves in an automated manner [128]. At the outset, a self-driving
    network should take a high-level goal or intent as input. Expanding upon the concept
    of intents, we note that there are broadly two types of intents– imperative and
    declarative. While the former describes in explicit detail how a particular procedure
    should be carried out, the latter just describes the end-goal without specifying
    how the stated goal should be achieved. For example, “reduce network congestion
    by shifting incoming traffic originating at ingress node 1 from load balancer
    2 to load balancer 3” is an imperative intent since it explicitly defines the
    steps that network must undertake in order to relieve congestion. On the other
    hand, “optimize network operations” is a declarative intent. However, a truly
    declarative intent of the kind described here would be extremely difficult to
    implement in the near future. Instead, semi-declarative intents that define more
    concrete goals would be far more helpful. “Minimize network congestion”, is one
    example of such an intent since it tasks the network with optimizing its operation
    by focusing on a specific objective, i.e., minimizing congestion. Based on the
    intent, the network is expected to determine: (i) the measurements that need to
    be performed, (ii) the corresponding inferences and learning that is required,
    and (iii) the actions that must be undertaken in response to the input intent.
    While a formal representation for self-driving networks is yet to be realized,
    a high-level architecture has been presented in Figure 7, highlighting the importance
    of large-scale data acquisition, real-time analytics and inference, and programmable
    data planes. FIGURE 7. High-level architecture for self-driving networks. Show
    All However, the realization of self-driving networks brings forth several research
    challenges as described next. Accurate Intent Definitions: As discussed previously,
    good intent definitions must toe the line between imperative and declarative.
    If the intent is primarily imperative, it defeats the point of automation. On
    the other hand, if the intent is purely declarative, the automation procedure
    becomes unnecessarily complex. Therefore, there is a pressing need for formal
    guidelines that put forward a clear framework for intent definitions. For example,
    a framework of this kind could take into account customer expectations in terms
    of throughput and latency, network-wide resource optimization goals, along with
    other application-specific functions and services that are required from the network.
    Automated Real-time Inference: Machine learning is vital to the automated decision
    making process in self-driving networks. However, previous work in this domain
    has largely focused on applying pre-existing learning techniques for network control,
    which are not well-suited for network data, given its high-volume, distributed
    nature, and rapid evolution. The major challenge here is the native integration
    of inference and control algorithms with the network’s decision and control fabric.
    In addition, network design needs to evolve to improve the quality of data that
    is input to the designed control algorithms [127]. Within the domain of self-driving
    networks, it is widely accepted that quality of data (QoD) is a pre-requisite
    for quality of service (QoS) [127]. In-band Telemetry: Research into in-band telemetry
    (INT) has been largely driven by the need for high quality network monitoring
    data, without introducing additional overhead. The INT approach makes use of programmable
    data planes to encapsulate additional metadata within the data packets themselves
    [129]. Examples of such metadata include switch processing times, buffer occupancy
    levels, and even specific policy rules. As packets traverses the network, they
    keep accumulating additional metadata, which can be extracted as desired, thus
    providing highly-detailed accurate sets of network data. To this end, there is
    a need to quantify the impact of INT on network performance [130]. In particular,
    metrics such as the relationship between the amount of metadata and packet size,
    the additional processing burden introduced, and the accuracy of the measurements
    obtained are all important parameters that merit careful consideration. SECTION
    VII. 6G Radio: Reconfigurable Transceiver Front-Ends The massive increase in the
    number of wirelessly interconnected devices, combined with the ever-growing demand
    for higher wireless data rates, is leading to an overcrowded electromagnetic (EM)
    spectrum. To overcome the spectrum scarcity problem and increase the capacity
    of wireless networks, communication at frequencies beyond RF (i.e., from the mmWave
    to the THz bands) is required. To meet the data-rate, reliability, and scalability
    requirements from RF to THz, transformative solutions are needed which include
    the design, implementation, and optimization of frequency-agile, ultra-broadband
    reconfigurable systems. A system of this kind is able to simultaneously sense
    and communicate over the full EM spectrum (1 GHz to 10 THz), and serves as a major
    contributor towards the infrastructure needed for the next generation of wireless
    communications. To realize this vision, pioneering contributions are required
    in terms of: (i) new devices that surpass the limits of CMOS technology by leveraging
    the state-of-the-art in materials science and nanoscale physics, (ii) heterogeneous
    integration of such devices which is compatible with the electrical, thermal,
    and EMI requirements for reconfigurability and manufacturing scalability, and
    (iii) novel all-spectrum dynamic sensing and communication algorithms, which maximize
    the achievable network capacity. The primary goal for 6G radio is to establish
    dynamic all-spectrum sensing and communication from RF to THz bands, therefore,
    transforming the way in which wireless devices sense, access, and share the EM
    spectrum. To achieve such a goal, key steps include: (i) intelligent all-spectrum
    sensing solutions, (ii) transceiver hardware design and implementation, and (iii)
    spectral and energy efficiency optimization as well as resource management. It
    is worth noting that currently reported works are fulfilling part of this grand
    goal by achieving dynamic spectrum sensing or multi-band communications over several
    frequency bands. It is our hope to motivate advanced solutions to realize all-spectrum
    communications through this section. A. Dynamic All-Spectrum Sensing and Access
    In recent times, a concentrated research effort at the physical and link layers
    has driven exciting progress at RF frequencies for individual cognitive radios
    (CRs). For example, a recently awarded research project by the Research and Innovation
    Program in the United Kingdom named “6G Mitola Radio” aims to establish self-regulating
    societies for wireless communications with fairness and high efficiency.4 This
    research will facilitate seamless convergence across heterogeneous wireless networks
    with intelligent decisions made by radios to maximize the quality of experience
    for end-users. One step further, a major challenge is to develop innovative spectrum
    sensing and sensing-informed communication and network optimization techniques
    for dynamic access to all-spectral resources. Within this context, the targeted
    breakthrough would be the development of wireless network-aware state inference
    using all-spectrum cartography for cognition over the swath of frequencies from
    RF to the THz bands, along with cartography-constrained algorithms for the physical
    and cross-layer control protocols. Artificial intelligence and associated learning
    algorithms should be investigated for dynamic spectrum sharing with a minimum
    cost in interference. The techniques developed should wholly exploit the capabilities
    of the hybrid front-ends, which include a multi-band transceiver design and solutions
    for resource management. B. Multi-Band Transceiver Design The optimal selection
    of materials and devices needed to enable all-spectrum communications is vital
    to the success of any multi-band transceiver design. Existing solutions mostly
    rely on CMOS for multi-band operations, but such an approach only works well in
    narrowbands. Moreover, solutions based on software-defined radios (SDRs) have
    high energy consumption and carbon footprint, consuming several Watts in operation
    [131], [132]. Instead, novel approaches based on metamaterials, MEMS switches,
    and even nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) switches should be sought to implement
    hybrid front-ends (Figure 8), which are able to simultaneously sense the EM spectrum,
    identify the best available band, and communicate over it, at frequencies anywhere
    from 1 GHz to 10 THz. Furthermore, fast-evolving deep learning algorithms serve
    as an efficient solution for identifying available spectrum, tuning channels,
    and adjusting RF power levels. FIGURE 8. Conceptual design of a hybrid front-end
    for dynamic all-spectrum sensing and communication in 6G. Show All To realize
    this vision, new techniques in materials and devices, integration and packaging,
    and spectrum sensing and communication are necessary. At the RF and microwave
    frequency bands, a combination of low-risk mature CMOS technology, with less-mature,
    potentially transformative technologies, including quantum cascade lasers (QCLs)
    and new plasmonic technologies based on graphene and other 2D materials will be
    able to provide optimal tunabilities as well as a high quality factor (i.e., the
    Q-factor). The heterogeneous integration of discrete devices into a fully functional
    front-end will require innovation to satisfy material compatibility, EMI shielding,
    thermal dissipation, and scalability requirements. On the other hand, metamaterial
    and nano-materials will be deployed at sub-THz and THz bands, based on recent
    advances in nano-tubes and graphene, as well as other single-atom-thin semiconductors.
    Space-time-frequency coding in metasurfaces will also allow programmable and fine-tunable
    radio access at mmWaves. Optimal control of the front-ends requires innovative
    all-spectrum sensing, utilization and sharing techniques, new waveform and hierarchical
    modulation designs to maximize the capacity and distance in ultra-broadband systems,
    and scalable networking solutions which are able to support the envisioned node
    density in future cyber-physical systems. The combination of several cutting-edge
    techniques can help maximize: (i) spectrum utilization (toward all-spectrum utilization),
    (ii) data-rates (toward terabit-per-second links) and, (iii) network user capacity
    (billions of interconnected wireless devices). The proposed technology will enable
    a plethora of applications in the consumer, military, industrial and medical fields,
    including transformative networking architectures designed to meet the scalability
    demands in future cyber-physical systems. C. Reconfigurable Front-End Scheme Accompanying
    the dynamic all-spectrum sensing and multi-band operation, agile front-ends should
    also be equipped with reconfigurability. In terms of hardware design, the plasmonic
    reflectarrays can be deployed in the 3D environment, with a size ranging from
    1 mm2 to 100 mm2 depending on the operating frequency (mmWave/THz-band). Owing
    to the sub-wavelength size of their elements, the plasmonic reflectarrays are
    able to reflect signals in non-conventional ways, which include controlled reflections
    in non-specular directions as well as reflections with polarization conversion
    [133]. In order to adapt to dynamic frequency operation, achieve various levels
    of directivity, and allocate multiple beams, the aperture of plasmonic reflectarray
    antenna can be controlled mechanically through folding, splitting, or combining
    in a 3D space. Existing prior art using origami antennas works well in systems
    using a single metal antenna, as reported in [134], [135]. However, to achieve
    reconfigurable continuous aperture antenna arrays, plasmonic reflectarrays offer
    a higher degree of freedom with the compactness of unit element distribution.
    On the other hand, electronically-controlled reconfigurable antenna arrays are
    envisioned by leveraging the tunability of plasmonic antennas. In particular,
    one of the relevant properties of graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas is the
    possibility to change their resonant frequency by utilizing a small voltage to
    modify their Fermi energy [136]. The possibility to tune an antenna (or group
    of antennas) at different frequencies without any mechanical modification (as
    opposed to other multi-band antenna arrays that utilize MEMS or NEMS to create
    origami type structures [137]) enables beamforming not only across space but also
    across frequencies. D. Open Problems The biggest hurdle to be overcome lies in
    the implementation of an integrated ultra-broadband hybrid front-end that is capable
    of sensing and communication from the RF to the THz bands, over a target distance
    of a few hundred meters. Meeting this multidisciplinary challenge requires us
    to: (i) close the THz gap by developing new device technologies, (ii) design and
    integrate re-programmable circuitry, interconnects and antennas that can support
    all-spectrum operation, (iii) develop new material integration and packaging techniques
    to satisfy the electrical, thermal and EMI requirements of disparate bands, and,
    (iv) develop scalable all-spectrum communication using the front-ends. SECTION
    VIII. Ambient Backscatter Communications In the realm of IoT, sensors are expected
    to function in various environments with long-lasting battery life. Solutions
    such as radio frequency identification (RFID) utilize the backscatter technique
    to modulate and reflect RF signals instead of generating them, which can achieve
    a significant degree of energy saving. However, existing modulated backscatter
    solutions have stringent requirements in terms of the proximity between the backscatter
    transmitter and the RF source, due to the attenuation of the signal over long
    distances. Besides, the modulated backscatter transmitters are passive, which
    means that they cannot transmit data without requests initiated by backscatter
    receivers [138]. Furthermore, the issue of self-interference may arise when the
    backscatter receiver and RF sources are co-located. Hence, in order to achieve
    better energy efficiency with a higher degree of flexibility and scalability,
    new solutions are required in the 6G IoT network. Currently, with more small cells
    being deployed in outdoor and more access points in indoor environments, the RF
    signals are covering a wide range of surroundings, and can be considered as a
    resource to be utilized by secondary radio links without requiring extra power.
    The system that employs such a technique is called an “ambient backscatter communication
    system”. In an ambient backscatter communication system, transmitters can harvest
    the surrounding and continuous electromagnetic waves radiated by TV towers, base
    stations, as well as access points, use simple circuits for modulation, and reflect
    them towards receivers. There is no need for dedicated spectrum bands for such
    ambient backscatter transceivers to operate, nor complex electronic components
    (e.g., analog-to-digital converters) to process signals. A. Operation Principles
    of Backscatter Communications In general, as the name suggests, backscatter communication
    systems reflect signals impinged on a backscatter transmitter in the direction
    of the signals’ origin, and since it is not a perfect specular reflection, the
    signals are scattered within a certain angular range of the environment. A backscatter
    communication receiver within the range can thus pick up the signals. In particular,
    backscatter communications have three variations in terms of architecture, which
    are monostatic, bistatic, and ambient backscatter communications, respectively.
    Here we briefly explain the first two types and then focus on the last one. As
    the most commonly adopted backscatter communication approach with widely-used
    RFID applications, monostatic backscatter communication systems have the simplest
    setup, which consists of a backscatter transmitter and a reader. The reader has
    both an RF signal source and a backscatter receiver embedded with a switch to
    change the operation mode. Once the receiver sends out a request, the RF source
    activates the backscatter transmitter, which then modulates and reflects the EM
    waves impinged on it back to the receiver, as shown in Figure 9. Such a design
    is mainly used for short-range RFID applications [138]. Nonetheless, two drawbacks
    of the monostatic backscatter communication architecture are (i) the reader cannot
    perform full duplex communication due to the switch mechanism, and (ii) the signals
    experience round-trip path loss being sent from the reader to the transmitter
    and then reflected back to the reader. FIGURE 9. Illustration of backscatter communication
    systems. Show All On the contrary, in the bistatic backscatter communication architecture,
    the RF source and receiver are separated, as shown in Figure 9, which provides
    higher flexibility in the spatial domain. With multiple RF sources and backscatter
    transmitters well placed, the serving range can be remarkably extended compared
    to the monostatic backscatter scenario. Despite this improvement, it is more costly
    for bistatic backscatter communication systems to operate in real networks, since
    they require RF sources and transmitters to be well-placed so as to achieve desired
    performance, and most of the times this condition can be difficult to satisfy,
    especially in a sophisticated network environment, such as an indoor office or
    dense urban scenarios. B. Mechanism of Ambient Backscatter Communications Different
    from the monostatic backscatter device where the transmitting and receiving components
    are separately located and the RF source is co-located with the receiver, devices
    of ambient backscatter communication systems consist of both the transmitter and
    receiver. Additionally, distinct from bistatic backscatter communications, ambient
    backscatter communications do not require dedicated RF sources to provide exclusive
    services, which can reduce infrastructure and maintenance expenditure significantly.
    Therefore, the ambient backscatter communications provide the most energy-efficient
    solution for sensors in the IoT network in 6G. Specifically, in one proof-of-concept
    study for utilizing the always-on radio signals for ambient backscatter communications
    reported in [139], TV signals serve as the RF source, which can be amplitude and
    sometimes frequency-division modulated. In the ambient backscatter transmitter
    design, a simple switch consisting of a transistor and connected to the antenna
    can be used to modulate the impedance of the antenna: a mismatch of impedance
    indicates a reflection mode of the impinging signals, whereas a matched impedance
    allows for the signal being absorbed by the antenna [139]. The power consumption
    of such 1-bit modulation of signals is minimal. At the receiver side, by demodulating
    the received sequence of “1” and “0”, signals can be successfully recovered. However,
    it is worth noting that since the reflected signals from the ambient environment
    already contain encoded information from the RF source system (e.g., cellular
    or TV networks), the receiver design should take into consideration how to extract
    the backscattered signals from the mixture. Besides the simplicity in transceiver
    implementation, ambient backscatter communications are not restricted to a single-band
    operation. In fact, the ambient backscatter transceivers can operate in the wide
    range of super high frequency (SHF) bands, covering Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other
    bands [138]. C. Open Problems in Ambient Backscatter Communications Spectral and
    Energy Efficiency: Currently, the research and development of ambient backscatter
    communications is still in its infancy. As mentioned before, careful planning
    of backscatter devices is crucial for achieving good performance. Due to the randomness
    in IoT device deployment, current solutions fall behind in terms of the targeted
    spectral efficiency. Specifically, the randomly-located IoT devices should utilize
    ambient backscatter links to achieve a satisfying throughput while maintaining
    an extended transmission distance. Additionally, even though individual backscatter
    communication devices demonstrate good energy performance, an IoT network comprising
    hundreds or even thousands of such devices might still require optimization of
    energy efficiency on a system level. Protocol Design: Existing ambient backscatter
    communication systems are mostly used for dedicated application-specific purposes,
    and thus lack good compatibility with other wireless communication systems. Standardization
    and protocol design are necessary to formalize the key operation and management
    aspects of ambient backscatter communications, such as packet size, routing protocols,
    among others. SECTION IX. Internet of Space Things With CubeSats and UAVs The
    Internet of Space Things (IoST) is a spatial expansion of the Internet of Things
    which primarily focuses on terrestrial use cases. For future communication networks,
    this expansion is necessary for the following reasons: (i) the IoT relies heavily
    on existing infrastructure and hence lacks flexibility as well as scalability,
    (ii) global coverage is impossible using traditional IoT solutions, especially
    in remote areas including the North and South Poles, due to the imbalance of construction
    expenditure and service revenue, and (iii) limited heterogeneity and spectrum
    resources in the IoT network. To this end, IoST is envisioned as a ubiquitous
    cyber-physical system spanning ground, air, and space, with applications in monitoring
    and reconnaissance, in-space backhauling, and holistic data integration [140].
    More specifically, as shown in Figure 10, IoST consists of the ground station,
    customer premises, and on-Earth sensing devices which form the ground segment,
    and the CubeSats, UAVs, and near-Earth sensing devices that form the space segment.
    The ground-to-satellite links (GSLs) connect the IoST Hubs with CubeSats to exchange
    requests and data, and the inter-satellite links (ISLs) relay information to neighboring
    CubeSats, in both the same orbit as well as adjacent orbits. Further, the UAVs
    establish links with each other, as well as sensors and CubeSats to form a localized
    data aggregation layer. To this end, we note that UAVs are expected to feature
    heavily in the upcoming 3GPP Releases 16 and 17 [142]. Further, since the space
    segment forms a vital component of the system, research relating to the development
    of small satellites, or CubeSats [143], for use within IoST is of critical importance
    [140]. FIGURE 10. Illustration of the IoST [140]. Show All CubeSats are a set
    of miniaturized satellites with sizes ranging from 1U to 6U (a “U” is 10×10×10c
    m 3 ). Currently, CubeSats are being deployed for a variety of applications including
    Earth sensing [144], positioning, and IoT and machine-to-machine communications.
    Compared to traditional LEO satellites, CubeSats present a number of advantages
    relating to (i) lower costs and shorter development cycles and (ii) higher flexibility
    and scalability [141]. Normally the development cycles range from three to seven
    years for traditional LEO and GEO satellites and the costs are extremely high.
    Also, since the payloads are pre-determined in the LEO and GEO satellites from
    the period of development until deployment, it is difficult to reconfigure any
    component in the middle of the process. However, CubeSats’ development can be
    done in a remarkably shorter time using COTS components with much lower costs.
    This also guarantees that CubeSats are easily reconfigurable. To this end, we
    have recently proposed a new next-generation CubeSat hardware concept as shown
    in Figure 11 [141]. The proposed CubeSat design includes an all-new communications
    subsystem for seamless operation in a wide variety of frequency bands. More specifically,
    the novelty of our design concept is characterized by the presence of multi-band
    transceivers and antennas that are able to support wireless communications at
    microwave, mmWave, and THz frequencies as detailed in the following section. Through
    this unique CubeSat design, we can potentially achieve data rates in excess of
    100 Gbps [141]. FIGURE 11. Conceptual design of a next-generation CubeSat [141].
    Show All A. Multi-Band Communications Subsystem The primary motivation for a multi-band
    communications subsystem comes from the fact that existing CubeSats have limited
    communications capabilities, largely relying on spectrum ranging from the L- (1–2
    GHz) till the Ka- (26.5–40 GHz) band. There are two major drawbacks associated
    with this approach. First, the traditional frequency bands are becoming increasingly
    prone to congestion [145]. Second, the Tbps-level throughput required by IoST
    cannot be achieved with existing frequency bands. To overcome the spectrum scarcity
    and capacity limitations in current satellite networks, we have proposed the use
    of multiple frequency bands from RF to THz spectrum, in IoST [141]. The use of
    such frequencies has been made possible by advances in high-frequency device development
    [26], [146]. More specifically, as part of the multi-band communications subsystem,
    we have developed both multi-frequency transceivers as well as antenna systems,
    as described next. As shown in Figure 12, in our proposed multi-band transceiver,
    we use two complementary approaches, namely, an electronic frequency up-converting
    chain and an optical frequency down-converting chain, to generate signals at different
    frequencies. With regard to the electronics-based approach, the primary idea is
    to use frequency splitters in order to extract the intermediate frequencies for
    outputs. For example, as shown in Figure 12, the signal at frequency f 1 is considered
    as the intermediate output when producing signals at a higher frequency f 2 .
    FIGURE 12. The proposed all-spectrum signal front-end designs [141]. Show All
    On the other hand, the photonics-based approach involves the down-conversion of
    optical signals. As shown in Figure 12, multi-band signals are generated by heterodyning
    two input signals with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. The resulting RF signal has a
    frequency equal to the difference between the two inputs. The generated signal,
    along with the two input signals, serves as the final output. Distinct from the
    commonly used up-conversion and down-conversion techniques where intermediate
    frequency products are abandoned, our approach harvests them and utilizes them
    as part of the multi-band communication system. These multi-band frequencies can
    be assigned to the GSLs and ISLs dynamically to accommodate various service requirements.
    To this end, within IoST, the GSLs make use of the more robust microwave and mmWave
    frequencies, while high-capacity THz links form the ISLs. In addition to multi-band
    transceivers, CubeSats in the IoST are also equipped with multi-frequency antenna
    systems. In particular, as discussed in Section III, the use of THz links allows
    for very large antenna arrays that serve as the basis for massive MIMO and UM
    MIMO communication schemes. More specifically, we note that there exist multiple
    options when it comes to the design of multi-band antenna arrays. The first approach
    involves the use of NEMS, MEMS, and origami structures to create physically re-configurable
    antennas, wherein the size of the radiating elements can be changed physically
    with a view to adjust their resonant frequency. On the other hand, the second
    approach proposes the use of materials such as graphene to create electronically
    tunable nano-antenna arrays [147], [148]. In this case, the resonant frequency
    can be controlled by modulating the graphene Fermi energy or chemical potential.
    This allows for tuning of the antenna to resonate at different frequencies without
    physically changing its size, in contrast to the MEMS-based approach. B. System
    Constellation Design Within the context of IoST, an ideal constellation design
    is crucial to achieve true global coverage and satisfactory link performance.
    However, conventional LEO constellations are typically characterized by the presence
    of fewer than a hundred satellites, for example, the CubeSat-based IoT system,
    Astrocast, has a maximum of 64 satellites [149]. At the outset, the coverage and
    connectivity offered by such systems leaves much to be desired. Motivated by the
    need for improved coverage, reliable connectivity, and increased redundancy, mega-constellations
    of several hundred satellites have gained significant traction over the past year
    [150]. Mega-constellations provide several advantages over traditional constellations
    including but not limited to increased coverage density, improved connectivity,
    and higher redundancy. More specifically, constellation design typically involves
    solving for several inter-related parameters such as: (i) the apogee and perigee
    radii, (ii) the orbital eccentricity, (iii) the number of CubeSats per orbital
    plane, (iv) the number of orbital planes, and (v) the initial longitude of the
    ascending node, argument of perigee, and true anomaly of the CubeSats. While a
    fairly challenging problem in itself, the presence of an extremely large number
    of satellites further serves to complicate the system design. Consequently, the
    existing state-of-the-art constellation design frameworks are largely geared towards
    the design of systems with a few dozen satellites at best. To this end, we have
    proposed a highly-scalable and customizable constellation design framework that
    takes into consideration both coverage and connectivity parameters [151]. Through
    the use of novel metrics such as spherical Voronoi tessellation based coverage
    characterization and ISL feasibility-based connectivity parameters, we are able
    to demonstrate that the resulting IoST constellation achieves a performance level
    that is similar to existing state-of-the-art mega-constellations such as Starlink,
    while requiring only a quarter, i.e., less than 500, of the satellites [151].
    C. Network Management IoST encompasses a vast infrastructure spanning both the
    Earth as well as space. A complex network of this kind has much to benefit from
    fine-grained real-time control that is well suited for tackling the peculiarities
    of the space environment, namely temporal topological variation and long delays.
    Going beyond the traditional bent pipe nature of satellite communications systems,
    IoST makes extensive use of SDN and NFV to significantly improve network resource
    utilization, simplify network management, and reduce operating costs [140]. In
    a manner similar to the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) paradigm, IoST intends
    to deliver CubeSats-as-a-service, with promising results as shown in [140]. In
    particular, we have demonstrated that through the use of SDN, it is possible to
    achieve sub-second end-to-end latencies. More specifically with the domain of
    network management, IoST introduces the novel concepts of virtual CSI (vCSI) for
    joint optimal physical-link layer resource allocation, and stateful segment routing
    (SSR) for overcoming challenges associated with the high latency space segment.
    In particular, concerning the latter, IoST extends the traditional SDN paradigm
    by including support for state-based packet forwarding that takes into account
    the topological configuration of the network at any given instance of time, while
    the use of segment routing helps in the minimization of control traffic, in addition
    to a higher level of demand satisfaction and load balancing as demonstrated in
    [152]. Further, IoST also employs predictive algorithms to preemptively detect
    GSL outage events, which when coupled with gateway diversity result in the realization
    of proactive handovers that minimize handover interruption time. In addition,
    IoST proposes the use of containzeration [153] in CubeSats for achieving lightweight
    hardware virtualization without significant overhead. Going forward, we note that
    the aforementioned techniques will play a vital role in the realization of pervasive
    cyber-physical systems of this kind. SECTION X. Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications
    In 5G wireless networks, massive MIMO communications have been tested and deployed
    at base stations (BSs) which are equipped with more than one hundred antenna elements
    to increase the antenna array gain and take advantage of the diversity gain. A
    related concept is network MIMO, which, instead of packing more than one hundred
    antenna elements at a single BS, forms a coordinated framework consisting of multiple
    BSs, each with multiple antennas. A coordination scheme of this kind can achieve
    spatial diversity by allowing a single user to be served by more than one BS at
    the same time, overcoming the disadvantage of bad channel conditions if only one
    BS is connected to the user, and eliminates inter-cell interference [154]. However,
    a detailed comparative study has shown that massive MIMO communication schemes
    outperform network MIMO with respect to end-user received signal strength and
    overall costs in configuration [155]. Going one step further, in order to effectively
    eliminate inter-cell interference caused by users located at cell boundaries,
    based on the ideas of distributed MIMO communications and coordinated multi-point
    (CoMP) communications, researchers have proposed the concept of cell-free massive
    MIMO communication. In a scheme of this kind, the originally densely-packed antenna
    array set with a few hundred elements at the BS is distributed in a fairly large
    area in the form of smaller sets with fewer than 10 antenna elements, while still
    serving a similar number of users in the same area [156]. As shown in Figure 13,
    the main difference between cell-free and classic massive MIMO communication systems
    is that instead of associating each user terminal to a cell with a BS equipped
    with a large number of antenna elements, it relaxes the restriction of cell boundaries,
    which can significantly reduce or even eliminate the inter-cell interference.
    Without cell boundaries, all BSs, or a subset of BSs, can serve users simultaneously
    in a coordinated manner. In coordination, the cell-free massive MIMO BSs can share
    with each other the data to be sent to users through fronthaul links. FIGURE 13.
    Cell-free massive MIMO in comparison with classic massive MIMO. Show All It has
    been shown that the BSs can use their local channel state information (CSI) to
    achieve satisfactory performance and avoid the excessive computation complexity
    associated with sharing global channel conditions with all BSs [157]. The local
    CSI can be estimated in the uplink channel in a time division duplex (TDD) mode.
    Then, precoding is performed based on the obtained channel information at the
    BSs, before data transmission in the downlink channel. The transmit power and
    precoding vector can be determined based on the geographic proximity of users
    to the BSs. Compared to the small-cell architecture in 5G, which consists of non-cooperative
    base stations that can serve up to 100 users per cell with a smaller area (e.g.,
    up to a 200-meter cell radius) and reduced power in signal transmission (e.g.,
    up to 10 Watts), a cell-free massive MIMO communication system achieves significantly
    better performance, since each user can be served by a dedicated access point.
    A reported study in [158] has demonstrated that the cell-free massive MIMO scheme
    improves 95%-likely per-user throughput by five times and by ten times under correlated
    shadow fading, with respect to the small-cell solution. More specifically, the
    same study has reported that when considering realistic channel conditions, including
    pilot contamination and imperfect CSI, cell-free massive MIMO systems demonstrate
    much higher throughput compared to small cells and, more importantly, are more
    robust to impacts such as shadow fading, non-coherence interference, as well as
    noise [158]. However, we also note the following challenges: (i) due to the issue
    of aliasing, channel estimation for signals received by different antenna elements
    is more complicated compared to that of ordinary massive MIMO communications,
    (ii) with the significantly increased synthesized aperture size, the range of
    near-field propagation grows larger, hence requiring a different channel model
    for characterizing the large- and small-scale channel parameters. A. Channel Characteristics
    of Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communication Systems It has been theoretically proven
    that as the number of antenna elements approaches infinity, adversarial channel
    effects, including inter-cell interference, small-scale fading, and others, will
    disappear [159]. In cell-free massive MIMO communications, such effects will also
    have a negligible impact on propagation channels. Specifically, channels under
    a coordinated scheme of this kind will satisfy the conditions of favorable propagation
    [160]. Favorable propagation conditions imply that the channel vectors between
    the BSs and UEs are orthogonal, so that the sum-rate can be maximized. This characteristic
    is most prominent in classic massive MIMO communications [161]. In cell-free massive
    MIMO systems, it has been shown that favorable propagation conditions can be achieved
    given that the number of APs is fairly large (with an approximate density of 1000/km2).
    B. Open Problems in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications As the domain of cell-free
    massive MIMO communications is relatively new, there are several open problems
    that merit further investigation. Among them, we posit that coordination and optimization
    challenges will critically affect the entire system performance and future deployments.
    User Scheduling: Extensive studies have been conducted on channel characterization
    and capacity analysis. However, the prior art does not take into consideration
    scenarios involving networks with a large number of users to serve. In such cases,
    there might be an upper bound for the number of APs to serve a user in order to
    maintain an acceptable-level of average throughput. Current works assume that
    all users will be served simultaneously under the same frequency resource block.
    However, when the number of users grows to a threshold where they can no longer
    be served at the same time, a scheduling scheme that achieves fairness should
    be considered. Location Optimization of APs: Existing works in cellular networks
    draw heavily upon stochastic geometry where cell structures follow 2D Voronoi
    tessellation and geographically separated BSs that serve cell-edge users under
    the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) scheme to improve overall system efficiency
    and overcome inter-cell interference through scheduling [162], [163]. It is therefore
    crucial to optimize the placement of BSs under practical link-level constraints
    such as signal-to-interference ratio as well as success probability for individual
    links to enhance network fairness [164]. In cell-free massive MIMO, since no cell
    boundaries are assumed, system-level performance pertaining to locations of APs,
    random scatterers, as well as users should be thoroughly investigated and optimized.
    SECTION XI. Technologies for Beyond 6G Thus far, we have presented in great detail
    the key drivers that are expected to play an integral role in the next-generation
    of wireless networks. However, in addition to these, we also note the presence
    of several promising early-stage technologies that are tipped to revolutionize
    how we perceive data communications in the near future. To this end, in this section,
    we discuss three such promising paradigms, namely, the Internet of NanoThings,
    Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications. A. Internet of NanoThings
    In addition to the need for more spectrum resources to accommodate a plethora
    of wireless devices and services, a variety of transformative wireless communications
    scenarios are also envisioned to become a reality in the near future. In particular,
    with the advent of wireless ubiquity, we note the existence of situations where
    electromagnetic waves do not yield acceptable performance or lack reachability
    due to hardware limitations, such as in high-salinity water or intravascular channels
    where the transmission range can be extremely short. In the aforementioned application
    scenarios for THz band communications, as the frequencies of operation increase,
    the wavelengths of signals fall into the nanometer range (i.e., 10−9 to 10−7 meter
    in size), thereby motivating studies on nano-network communications [165], [166].
    Different from those operating at lower frequencies in the microwave range, the
    devices and transceivers used in the Internet of NanoThings (IoNT) are in the
    scale of nanometers, and thus behave differently from classical wireless communication
    systems. Given the much smaller size, each nano-thing consumes much less energy
    and is envisioned to be self-powered (e.g., via vibrational energy harvesting
    using piezoelectric nano-generators [167]). Besides conducting signal transmission
    tasks, the nano-things can also perform basic processing and data storage, as
    well as enabling new nano-sensing capabilities with higher sensitivity. Current
    advancements in nanotechnologies provide several promising candidate materials
    with various dimensions for creating such nano-machines, including a thin strip
    of graphene named graphene nanoribbons, graphene in form of a three-dimensional
    (3D) roll named carbon nanotubes, and graphene spheres. Communications in the
    paradigm of nano-networks mainly falls under two categories, which are (i) encoded
    signal bits being carried with molecules, which follows a diffusion-based mechanism
    elaborated in Section XI-B1 and (ii) plasmonic radiation on metamaterial-based
    antennas including graphene and carbon nano-tubes operating in the THz band. These
    plasmonic antennas [136], [168]–[170] leverage the physics of Surface Plasmon
    Polariton (SPP) waves, i.e., confined EM waves resulting from the global oscillations
    of electrons at the interface of a conductor material and a dielectric material,
    to efficiently radiate at the target resonant frequency while being much smaller
    than the corresponding wavelength. This property allows them to be integrated
    in very dense arrays, beyond traditional antenna arrays. The ratio between the
    free-space wavelength λ and the SPP wavelength λ SPP is known as the plasmonic
    confinement factor, and depends on the plasmonic material properties and the operation
    frequency. The higher the confinement factor, the smaller the antennas and the
    higher the density in which they can be integrated. 1) Essential Components in
    the IoNT Similar to traditional communication networks, several key components
    are seen in IoNT [171]: Nano-nodes are the basic functional units in the nano-network,
    and have sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers, and can form a cluster to forward
    and receive signals. A typical nano-node with full transceiving capability contains
    the following elements: a nano-antenna and a plasmonic nano-tranceiver based on
    graphene advancements to propagate SPP waves, a nano-processer with operating
    frequency close to 1 THz, nano-actuators, nano-sensors which can sense external
    force, gas molecules, and biological objects such as antigens and antibodies,
    a nano-memory which allows storage of a bit signal in a single atom, a nano-battery,
    and an energy nano-harvester which transfers energy to power other elements [172].
    Limited by the computation capabilities and battery life, the signals are mostly
    pulse-based for the easiness of detection and transmission. Nano-routers control
    the behavioral patterns of the nano-nodes, aggregate information, and determine
    the optimal paths for signals to be forwarded. The nano-routers are equipped with
    higher energy and computational resources. When a specific query is created from
    the command center, nano-routers need to select the optimal routes that can reach
    the nano-nodes to collect their data and report back. Due to the limited transmission
    range, a pulse-based signaling is preferred to assess the reachable range of nano-nodes
    in order to minimize outage probability and establish the desired routes. Gateways
    serve as the remote controller of the IoNT and connect over the internet to service
    providers. The gateways can be common smart devices such as smartphones and tablets,
    among others. In order to achieve a manageable network with hundred or even thousands
    of nano-nodes dissipated in sophisticated communication environments, gateways
    should devise a holistic approach in disseminating commands and queries, coordinating
    between possible collisions, and processing noisy data, which requires a drastically
    different network framework than the conventional network architecture. Based
    on the arbitrary pattern of the nano-nodes, potential solutions can be found with
    the assistance of artificial intelligence, which does not require pre-established
    model for prediction. It is worth noting that major device technology in the IoNT
    is still under design and development. Although a few types of individual components,
    such as nano-sensors, have been made available, it is estimated that a major paradigm
    shift for the IoNT is expected to occur in the second half of the 2020s. 2) Applications
    of the IoNT In the realm of IoNT, applications can be primarily found in body
    area networks and short-distance local environments. Three typical application
    scenarios are described as follows (also illustrated in Figure 14): Nano-Cameras:
    The nano-cameras are based on nano-photosensing and nanotechnology to sense, combine,
    and process light signals before transforming them into electric signals. This
    system includes nano-photodectors, nano-lens, nano-batteries, and nano-memories
    in order to achieve fine-resolution imaging and signal processing. The nano-cameras
    can be applied to a wide range of scenarios including but not limited to intravascular
    imaging and fracture detection in oil pipelines [171]. On-Chip Networks: With
    microchips getting more compact in dimension while the complexity of functionality
    grows, on-chip signal transmission has become significantly more challenging.
    Currently, issues relating to CPU scalability and efficient memory synchronization
    have driven research trends towards wireless network-on-chip (WNoC) solutions,
    which can replace wired connections on conventional chips and take advantage of
    short-range communication in the nano-network at THz-band frequencies [173]. Nano-robots
    for IoNT: The nano-robots in nano-networks can be deployed in environments such
    as nuclear power plants and oil pipelines which might be hazardous for humans
    to perform tasks but require high precision and do not allow massive drilling
    or digging over existing infrastructure. Under these circumstances, nano-robots
    can be dissipated to sense and collect data relating to chemical concentration,
    and fluid speed, among others. By forming ad-hoc networks, the nano-robots can
    aggregate and forward data packets to gateways in the IoNT. Nano-robots are also
    being widely researched in biomedical engineering fields. To this end, Section
    XI-B will delve into nano-robots for healthcare applications. FIGURE 14. Application
    scenarios of molecular communications in IoNT and IoBNT. Show All 3) Open Problems
    in the IoNT The significant size shrinkage brings three major challenges. The
    first one is power efficiency optimization. Even though nano-devices consume power
    at the level of microwatts when transmitting femtosecond long pulses, in order
    to cover an area of a few square meters such as an office or a meeting room, the
    energy consumption factors in as a major constraint in maintaining a satisfying
    overall network performance. New designs on duty cycles for nano-transceivers
    should be proposed and evaluated, as well as new clustering algorithms in order
    to group nano-transceivers in close proximity for adaptive operations. The second
    open issue is interference control, which has been extensively studied in classic
    wireless network scenarios. However, the conventional approaches cannot be directly
    applied to the IoNT realm, due to the higher density of nano-transceivers in space
    and pulse-based signal transmission schemes. Self-interference becomes the most
    prominent issue for nano-transceivers when full duplex mode is deployed and hence
    requires novel scheduling algorithms to mitigate this adversarial effect. Additionally,
    new modulation and coding schemes should be developed to fit the need of nano-devices
    on spectral and power efficiency while maintaining a low probability of crosstalk
    among links. The third challenge resides in the network protocols. Since the IoNT
    will foreseeably function in a manner that is drastically different from the IoT
    due to differences in channel conditions, limited scale of operation, as well
    as miniaturized devices, the protocol stack design still remains an open field
    for exploration. B. Internet of BioNanoThings for Health Applications Highly relevant
    to IoNT, with its unique characteristics and applications, is the concept of the
    Internet of BioNanoThings (IoBNT). First introduced in 2015, the IoBNT has garnered
    significant traction in its efforts to synergistically combine telecommunications
    with healthcare solutions [174]. The IoBNT is a network of molecules which can
    communicate with each other. The types of molecular communications include artificial
    cells which act as gateways to translate between different molecule types, or
    a bio-cyber interface which can convert molecular signals to electrical ones and
    transmit to external devices for further processing [175]. In applications relating
    to human healthcare, the IoBNT harbors many unique challenges and opportunities.
    First, the interdisciplinary research on both communications and data analytics
    can greatly facilitate the modeling of biological processes, including cancer
    cell formations and Alzheimer’s disease, and further design effective control
    measures for such diseases. Second, even though expressions of genetic codes at
    the cell- and organ-level can vary remarkably, in a manner analogous to various
    types of data applications in wireless networks, communication models can be developed
    and exploited to conceive a generally applicable health information framework.
    Third, the holistic network architecture envisioned in the IoBNT will integrate
    components at heterogeneous levels including within cells and among tissues, organs,
    as well as systems, before eventually connecting to the outside Internet for physicians
    to perform metric evaluations and propose treatment plans accordingly. However,
    healthcare solutions that are to be realized in such complicated biological and
    molecular environments should be built upon a solid understanding of the physics
    behind molecular communication and advanced statistical analysis tools in order
    to unveil the principles behind the seemingly random molecular movement. 1) Essential
    Communication Models in IoBNT Different from classic wireless communication channels
    based on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, molecular communication (MC)
    channels rely on the mechanism of molecular movement to transmit information.
    The main difference between an MC channel and the classical wireless channel is
    that the transmission medium presents different forms, such as fluids of several
    chemical compositions in blood vessels, plasma membranes of neurons, and so on.
    Based on the motion of molecules in such diverse mediums, end-to-end channel models
    have been developed to characterize the capacity, noise, and interference in various
    communication scenarios [176]–[178]. Particularly, in the diffusion-based MC model,
    information is encoded in various forms, for example, based on different concentration
    intensities and distinct release times of molecules. The nano-device acting as
    a transmitter emits such encoded molecules to the wireless molecular channel.
    At the receiver side, another nano-device decodes the signals based on the quantified
    received intensities or times of arrival, given that the channel remains stationary
    for the duration of transmission. In such transmissions, some molecules will get
    dispersed in the channel and will not be received by the target nano-devices,
    they are hence treated as noise, and channels with such residual molecules are
    characterized as channels with memory. For such channels, the theories of Fick’s
    diffusion and particle location displacement are used to characterize the channel
    capacity as a function of a collection of parameters, including the diffusion
    coefficient of the channel, the temperature, the distance between end-transceivers,
    and the bandwidth of the transmitted signal [178]. 2) IoBNT in Public Health Applications
    Late 2019 and 2020 have seen the novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19 spread
    worldwide, causing high fatalities and a plethora of other public health issues.
    More generally, such outbreaks, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome
    (SARS) in 2002, the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, the Ebola
    virus disease in 2014, and the seasonal influenza, raise questions about the manner
    in which public health systems should react to such epidemics and pandemics. The
    widespread havoc caused by pandemics calls for effective means to identify new
    viruses, understand their mechanisms of viral infection, and devise efficient
    tools for treatment and vaccination. In order to facilitate the development of
    antiviral and preventive solutions, researchers have looked into creating biosensors
    that can monitor the cleavage of proteases within infected cells [179]. Proteases
    are generated as a result of the cell being infected by the genome of coronavirus,
    which is a type of RNA virus. Other byproducts include synthesized polyproteins
    which can replicate and transcript to generate more RNAs, and structural proteins
    that can construct new virions [180]. Two types of proteases found in the coronaviruses
    that cause SARS and MERS (i.e., SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov) are papain-like protease
    and 3C-like protease. The biosensor, which is based on luciferase, is used to
    identify potential broad-spectrum coronavirus papain-like or 3C-like protease
    inhibitors. The SARS-CoV-2 virions that cause the COVID-19 disease have a diameter
    of 50–200 nanometers approximately [181], and infect the human respiratory system
    via human-to-human spread, in the form of droplets discharged when an infected
    person coughs or sneezes [182]. COVID-19 has thus far posed unprecedented challenges
    worldwide in testing, treatment, and vaccine development. The IoBNT is envisioned
    to have immense potential in the molecular diagnosis of emerging viruses of this
    kind. The nanosensors, which can be firefly luciferase-based or other reporter
    genes, can be used to examine the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
    in collected samples. Other tests include using bio-nano-sensors to identify antibodies
    from blood samples to examine if the person is infected. In terms of treatment,
    although no antiviral drugs are available for COVID-19 yet, studies on influenza
    treatment can shed light on how the IoBNT could assist in future solution development.
    A critical step for treatment is the antiviral intervention, which blocks the
    intracellular signaling pathways to prevent influenza viruses from replication.
    A reported solution preventing the virus from replication is to use engineered
    bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) to trap the Ebola virus [183]. In the reported
    work, the blood of a patient with the Ebola virus infection is transmitted to
    a microfluidic chamber tube outside the body which contains the engineered bacteria.
    The scattered bacteria can then achieve protein binding with the Ebola virus using
    chemical bind force and synthetic protein binding receptors [183]. More importantly,
    the IoBNT serves a unique role as a holistic solution to not only monitor limited
    types of cells (e.g., squamous epithelial cells from nasopharyngeal swabs for
    COVID-19 tests), but also across different tissues and systems. It is found that
    such coronaviruses can also cause damage to digestive and neurological systems
    [181], [184]. Hence, a series of connected bio-nano-things consisting of various
    types of engineered bacteria can operate simultaneously to improve test reliability
    and treatment efficiency. 3) Artificial Intelligence in IoBNT for Health Applications
    In the IoBNT network, different systems demonstrate a wide variation in characteristics,
    thereby requiring varied analytical approaches. For example, in cardiovascular
    systems, the speed of molecular transmission is determined by the speed of blood
    flow and heart rate, among other factors, which may vary per person; whereas in
    the nervous system, the time required to propagate information-carrying electro-chemical
    stimuli through neurons depends on the connectivity of synapses. In order to estimate
    the error rate and capacity, the existing diffusion-based MC model normally requires
    several channel parameters to formulate the model for computation. The generic
    modeling approach provides initial insights into the behavior of molecular signal
    transmission, however, recent advances in statistical learning, that utilize artificial
    intelligence, provide increasingly refined solutions for modeling sophisticated
    molecular information exchange processes. For example, in [77], a signal detection
    algorithm based on neural networks has been shown to achieve good performance
    without prior knowledge of the molecular channel, thus lending support to the
    use of statistical inference for characterizing molecular communication channels.
    Furthermore, a neural network-based nano-receiver design has been proposed in
    [185] which shows good bit error rate performance under the effect of inter-symbol
    interference. 4) Open Problems for IoBNT Currently, IoBNT primarily focuses on
    studies in the domains of physical layer channel modeling, capacity analysis,
    modulation and coding schemes, and nano-transceiver design. However, research
    gaps relating to the following aspects need to be overcome: Experimental Validation:
    The theoretical models of molecular communications should be validated under realistic
    channel environments, which include experimental testing. Traditionally, these
    experimental tests have posed high requirements on lab equipment and the nurturing
    process of cells and bacteria. While the procedures for such experiments should
    be strictly followed and executed, at times the cost for testing can be remarkably
    high. In such situations, simulations based on realistic assumptions serve as
    an alternative means, which have been commonly adopted in research. The convergence
    between analytical and experimental approaches should be a joint effors by researchers
    across fields in telecommunications, biomedical engineering, and signal processing.
    Data Storage and Management: The large data sets obtained from experiments or
    simulations can have many control variables which require efforts to manage and
    update. Open databases have become a popular trend for sharing raw data to benefit
    the entire research community for collaboration, and can be a foreseeable direction
    for research in the IoBNT. C. Quantum Communications As networks continue to evolve
    beyond 6G, they are expected to incorporate more spectrum, a larger variety of
    transceiver front-ends, higher complexity in processed signals, and stricter requirement
    on reliability, and therefore, it is expected that the computational requirements
    of wireless systems will also increase [186]. To this end, quantum computing has
    been widely recognized as a key enabling technology for realizing computationally
    complex systems [187]. Quantum systems are particularly useful for solving complex
    optimization problems. For example, in the optimal routing problem with multiple
    objectives, traditional methods, including the geographic routing algorithm, demonstrate
    significant complexities to yield optimal solutions, and less complex ones often
    sacrifice optimality [188]. It has been demonstrated that using quantum computing
    for such problems can efficiently reduce complexity while achieving optimality
    [189]. However, such computationally intensive tasks often require several hundreds
    of thousands or millions of interconnected quantum bits, and therefore cannot
    be performed on a single quantum chip. The need for interconnecting several chips
    of this kind has given rise to the concept of quantum communications. Quantum
    communications is thus indispensable for operating quantum systems at scale [190].
    More specifically, quantum communications is defined as the exchange of information
    that adheres to the laws of quantum mechanics, and offers several key advantages:
    (i) the capability of large-scale parallel computation, (ii) the ability to transfer
    data in a tamper-proof manner, and (iii) the potential to encode and transmit
    a large number of multiple data streams simultaneously. We begin our discussion
    of quantum communications by describing the following four postulates or rules
    that govern the operation of such systems [191]: Postulate 1 - The Quantum Bit:
    Within the context of classical communications, a binary value of either 0 or
    1 per bit is used to represent data. On the other hand, in quantum communications,
    the quantum bit, or qubit, contains the superposition of both logical values at
    the same time, of the form |Φ⟩= a 0 |0⟩+ a 1 |1⟩, (1) View Source where |Φ⟩ represents
    a two-dimensional vector, with the coefficients a 0 and a 1 being complex numbers,
    and 0 and 1 being the two logical values. Postulate 2 - The Quantum Register:
    Just like computing registers that are used to store multiple bits, quantum registers
    are used for storing qubits. However, unlike classical registers that are deterministic,
    the output of a quantum register is probabilistic, i.e., when reading or measuring
    the quantum register, a different value may be returned each time, thus presenting
    a major challenge in the implementation of quantum information exchange systems.
    Postulate 3 - Exponential Speed-up: Exponential speed-up is a key property of
    quantum information processing systems. We know that classical systems employ
    parallelization wherein multiple computing units process parallel streams of data
    simultaneously. On the other hand, in quantum systems, the entire input information
    is placed in a single quantum register, and a single quantum computing unit can
    process multiple register states simultaneously, thus achieving a significant
    reduction in the time required for computation. Postulate 4 - The Q/C Conversion:
    Since it is far easier to perceive information in terms of 0s and 1s, i.e., classical
    information, it becomes imperative to interpret the results of any quantum operation
    in the classical domain. To this end, the classical interpretation of (1) implies
    that, if we were to measure such a qubit, we would receive value 0 with probability
    p 0 =| a 0 | 2 and value 1 with p 1 =| a 1 | 2 . Closely related to the four postulates
    is the concept of entanglement [191]. Entanglement is a phenomenon in which the
    quantum states of two or more particles are described with reference to each other.
    Within this context, these particles exist in a shared state, and are referred
    to as entangled pairs. Any action on a particle within the entangled pair immediately
    affects all other particles within that pair, irrespective of the physical separation
    between them. For example, if a photon traveling through an optical fiber is entangled
    with another photon outside the fiber, the photon inside the fiber will experience
    the same effects as those experienced by the photon on the outside. In this case,
    entanglement serves as a source of noise in the quantum channel. Continuing our
    discussion of quantum channels, we note that classical information theory does
    not apply to these channels. Unlike traditional wireless communication channels
    where the large- and small-scale parameters are deterministic or can be stochastically
    characterized, the capacity of qubit carrying quantum channels is defined as the
    rate at which classical or quantum information increases with each use of the
    quantum channel [192]. Moreover, there exist several different types of capacities
    for quantum channels, including but not limited to the classical capacity, the
    quantum capacity, the private capacity, the entanglement assisted capacity, and
    the zero-error capacity. The classical and quantum capacities are the two most
    commonly used definitions. In particular, while the classical capacity measures
    classical information transmission over a noisy quantum channel, the quantum capacity
    represents the amount of quantum information, i.e., qubits, that can be transmitted
    through a noisy quantum channel. We refer the interested reader to [192] for additional
    insight into each of these channel capacity types. In the following, we discuss
    the different types of channels, data routing, and open problems within the domain
    of quantum communications. 1) Types of Channels Within the broader domain of quantum
    communications, we take into consideration the following types of channel, the
    dephasing channel and the depolarizing channel [193], [194]. The Dephasing Channel:
    The dephasing channel, also known as the phase damping or phase flip channel,
    applies a bit flip in the conjugate basis. The impact of the dephasing channel
    can be best described as equivalent to measuring the qubit in the computational
    basis and then forgetting the result of the measurement. A more detailed treatment
    of the nuances of the dephasing channel can be found in [193, §4]. The Depolarizing
    Channel: The depolarizing channel is often referred to the “worst-case scenario”
    and describes the fact that the qubit may be left unchanged with a probability
    1−p , with p ∈[0,1] , or that an error may occur with probability p . In this
    case, the error could be one of three types, with each being equally likely– the
    bit flip error, the phase flip error, or both. In the event of an error, it is
    assumed that the channel replaces the lost qubit with a maximally mixed state
    [194, §2], i.e, all states become equally likely. For example, the maximally mixed
    state with reference to (1) implies that a 0 = a 1 . 2) Quantum Communications
    Networks Quantum networks are key to the success of distributed quantum computing,
    and in turn rely on the ability to share quantum states between different quantum
    devices. However, unlike conventional networks that are based on the store-and-forward
    paradigm, quantum networks must adhere to the no-cloning theorem which prohibits
    making copies of an arbitrary quantum state [195]. In order to overcome this restriction,
    quantum networks rely on the concept of entanglement [196] described earlier,
    along with quantum teleportation. The process of quantum teleportation [197] leverages
    entanglement to transmit unknown quantum states between remote quantum devices,
    through remote entanglement distribution [198]. Further, as shown in Figure 15,
    we note the following physical entities that constitute quantum networks [190]:
    Quantum Nodes: These are the quantum devices that are interconnected to each other.
    Communication Links: These include both classical as well quantum links that interconnect
    the quantum nodes in the network. Entanglement Generator: This device is responsible
    for generating the entangled pairs that are distributed between the quantum nodes.
    Quantum Memories: These are primarily used for storing quantum states for the
    purpose of communication. Quantum Measurement Devices: Their primary function
    is the assessment of the generated entangled states. FIGURE 15. Physical entities
    associated with quantum networks [190]. Show All While the aforementioned entities
    play a vital role in enabling quantum networks, the process of quantum teleportation
    is affected by the exponential decay of communication rate with distance, which
    in turn is offset by the use of quantum repeaters. The routing problem then involves
    the selection of the optimal path from the source to the destination traversing
    one or more quantum repeaters resulting in a high-quality entanglement distribution.
    Further, the routing framework must also take cognizance of the fact that the
    physical mechanisms underlying quantum entanglement are stochastic, and that the
    passage of time leads to loss of entanglement between the entangled pair [198].
    Expanding upon this, in the following section, we delve into some of the major
    challenges faced by quantum networks today. 3) Open Problems and Major Challenges
    Given the vast differences between the classical and quantum domains, there are
    several fundamental research challenges, that are vital to the success of quantum
    networks, as detailed next. Quantum Error Correction: There are three major challenges
    faced by error correction techniques for qubits [199]. First, while classical
    error correction codes assume that data can be duplicated freely, the no-cloning
    theorem precludes the arbitrary duplication of quantum states. Second, since qubits
    are susceptible to both bit-flip and phase-flip errors, quantum error correction
    techniques need to be able to detect both error types simultaneously, unlike classical
    techniques that take only bit-flips into consideration. Third, there exists the
    possibility of wavefunction collapse [200] due to measurements on the qubits performed
    as part of the error correction procedure. Entanglement Distribution: Long distance
    entanglement distribution is a key challenge in the realization of quantum networks,
    impacting the physical, link, and network layers [196]. More specifically, at
    the physical layer, there is a need for quantum error correction techniques, while
    the no-cloning theorem necessitates a re-design of the link layer. At the network
    layer, novel quantum routing metrics are required to ensure optimal path selection.
    Deployment Challenges: Quantum computing devices require highly specialized data
    centers equipped with ultra-high vacuum systems and ultra-low temperature cryostats.
    Further, while quantum teleportation has been proposed as a means to realize quantum
    networks, it requires the integration of classical and quantum communication resources,
    which is a fairly complex problem in itself. SECTION XII. Tentative Timeline for
    6G Thus far, we have described the manner in which the evolution of societal needs
    will guide the transition from 5G to 6G, along with a plethora of new and upcoming
    use cases that will be best served by 6G. We have also discussed the tentative
    KPIs associated with 6G and the key enabling technologies that will play a vital
    role in achieving these next-generation KPIs, as summarized in Table 2. As shown
    in Figure 16, the increasing technological readiness and worldwide deployments
    of 5G systems have set the stage for a thoughtful discussion on the future of
    wireless communications. TABLE 2 A Brief Summary of the KPI Impacts and Open Problems
    Associated With Each Key Enabling Technology for 6G and Beyond FIGURE 16. Projected
    timeline for 6G and beyond systems. Show All While 3GPP standards over the next
    few years, up to and including Release 18 in 2024, are expected to primarily deal
    with 5G, the ITU has recently convened the Focus Group on Technologies for Network
    2030 (FG NET-2030) [201], to study the capabilities of networks for the year 2030
    and beyond. More generally, as we have seen in the preceding sections, each of
    the presented key technologies has witnessed significant traction in terms of
    research and development, laying the groundwork for the next generation of wireless
    communications. Both the National Science Foundation (NSF) through its Platforms
    for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) initiative [202] and the European Commission
    [203] are expected to play a major role in the development of 6G. At the same
    time, going beyond academia, we expect a significant rise in industry involvement
    in the development of these technologies over the next few years, culminating
    in key hardware and software technology demos by 2025, followed by full-scale
    6G testbeds in 2026 and beyond. We envision that these testbeds will serve as
    the perfect backdrop for showcasing the potential of 6G and demonstrating its
    suitability for use cases such as multi-sensory holographic teleportation, real-time
    remote healthcare, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure and environments,
    to name a few. SECTION XIII. Conclusion This paper surveys the key enabling techniques
    for the next generation of wireless communication networks, outlines their essential
    use cases, and provides a perspective on current as well as future research and
    development efforts. We envision that 6G and beyond wireless systems will be largely
    driven by a focus on wireless ubiquity, i.e., the unrestricted availability of
    high quality wireless access. To this end, we have highlighted the key enabling
    technologies that are vital to the success of 6G and beyond systems. By detailing
    both the operational nuances and open challenges associated with each, we not
    only hope to provide a detailed insight into the next frontier in wireless communications,
    but also encourage readers to play their part in the realization of the envisioned
    ubiquitous wireless future. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank B.

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Digital twin can be defined as a virtual representation
    of a physical asset enabled through data and simulators for real-time prediction,
    optimization, monitoring, controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances
    in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big
    data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital
    twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an
    important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational
    megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype,
    there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only
    in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how
    we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental
    barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this
    work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the
    construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to
    provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies
    along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders. A working

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Despite the perception people may have regarding
    the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s agriculture industry is
    data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost every industry including “smart agriculture”
    which moved the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary
    changes are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities
    along a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced
    when integrating this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices
    and communication techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture
    applications are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture
    application, like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection
    are listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages,
    from sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore,
    the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable
    applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    I. Introduction To improve the agricultural yield with fewer resources and labor
    efforts, substantial innovations have been made throughout human history. Nevertheless,
    the high population rate never let the demand and supply match during all these
    times. According to the forecasted figures, in 2050, the world population is expected
    to touch 9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 25% from the current figure
    [1]. Almost the entire mentioned rise of population is forecasted to occur among
    the developing countries [2]. On the other side, the trend of urbanization is
    forecasted to continue at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world’s population
    predicted to be urban until 2050 (currently 49%) [3]. Furthermore, income levels
    will be multiples of what they are now, which will drive the food demand further,
    especially in developing countries. As a result, these nations will be more careful
    about their diet and food quality; hence, consumer preferences can move from wheat
    and grains to legumes and, later, to meat. In order to feed this larger, more
    urban, and richer population, food production should double by 2050 [4], [5].
    Particularly, the current figure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production
    should touch approximately 3 billion tons, and the annual meat production should
    increase by more than 200 million tons to fulfill the demand of 470 million tons
    [6], [7]. Not only for food, but crop production is becoming equally critical
    for industry; indeed crops like cotton, rubber, and gum are playing important
    roles in the economies of many nations. Furthermore, the food-crops-based bioenergy
    market started to increase recently. Even before a decade, only the production
    of ethanol utilized 110 million tons of coarse grains (approximately 10% of the
    world production) [7], [8]. Due to the rising utilization of food crops for bio-fuel
    production, bio-energy, and other industrial usages, food security is at stake.
    These demands are resulting in a further increase of the pressure on already scarce
    agricultural resources. Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the earth’s surface
    is suitable for agriculture uses due to various limitations, like temperature,
    climate, topography, and soil quality, and even most of the suitable areas are
    not homogenous. When zooming the versatilities of landscapes and plant types,
    many new differences start to emerge that can be difficult to quantify. Moreover,
    the available agricultural land is further shaped by political and economic factors,
    like land and climate patterns and population density, while rapid urbanization
    is constantly posing threats to the availability of arable land. Over the past
    decades, the total agriculture land utilized for food production has experienced
    a decline [9]. In 1991, the total arable area for food production was 19.5 million
    square miles (39.47% of the world’s land area), which was reduced to approximately
    18.6 million square miles (37.73% of the world’s land area) in 2013 [10]. As such,
    the gap between demand and supply of food is becoming more significant and alarming
    with the passage of time. Further examination showed that every crop field has
    different characteristics that can be measured separately in terms of both quality
    and quantity. Critical characteristics, like soil type, nutrient presence, flow
    of irrigation, pest resistance, etc., define its suitability and capability for
    a specific crop. In most of situations, the differentiations of characteristics
    can exist within a single crop field, even if the same crop is being cultivated
    in entire farm; hence, site-specific analyses are required for optimal yield production.
    Further, adding the dimension of time, specific crops in the same field rotate
    season-to-season and biologically reach different stages of their cycle within
    a year in areas where locational and temporal differences result in specific growth
    requirements to optimize the crop production. To respond to these demands with
    a range of issues, farmers need new technology-based methods to produce more from
    less land and with fewer hands. Considering the standard farming procedures, farmers
    need to visit the agriculture sites frequently throughout the crop life to have
    a better idea about the crop conditions. For this, the need of smart agriculture
    arises, as 70% of farming time is spent monitoring and understanding the crop
    states instead of doing actual field work [11]. Considering the vastness of the
    agriculture industry, it incredibly demands for technological and precise solutions
    with the aim of sustainability while leaving minimum environmental impact. Recent
    sensing and communication technologies provide a true remote “eye in the field”
    ability in which farmers can observe happenings in the field without being in
    the field. Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation. Timely reporting using a range of sensors makes the entire operation
    not only smart but also cost effective due to its precise monitoring capabilities.
    Variety of autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and satellites
    currently complement agriculture equipment. Sensors can be installed and start
    collecting data in a short time, which is then available online for further analyses
    nearly immediately. Sensor technology offers crop and site-specific agriculture,
    as it supports precise data collection of every site. Recently, the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is beginning to impact a wide array of sectors and industries, ranging from
    manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agriculture industry,
    in order to reduce inefficiencies and improve the performance across all markets
    [12]–[16]. If looking closely, one feels that the current applications are only
    scratching the surface and that the real impact of IoT and its uses are not yet
    witnessed. Still, considering this progress, especially in the near past, we can
    predict that IoT technologies are going to play a key role in various applications
    of the agriculture sector. This is because of the capabilities offered by IoT,
    including the basic communication infrastructure (used to connect the smart objects—from
    sensors, vehicles, to user mobile devices—using the Internet) and range of services,
    such as local or remote data acquisition, cloud-based intelligent information
    analysis and decision making, user interfacing, and agriculture operation automation.
    Such capabilities can revolutionize the agriculture industry which probably one
    of most inefficient sectors of our economic value chain today. To summarize this
    discussion, figure 1 provides the main drivers of technology, while figure 2 highlights
    the major hurdles of technology implementation in smart agriculture. FIGURE 1.
    Key drivers of technology in agriculture industry. Show All FIGURE 2. Major hurdle’s
    in technology implementation for smart agriculture. Show All Researchers and engineers
    around the globe are proposing different methods and architectures and based on
    that suggesting a variety of equipment to monitor and fetch the information regarding
    crop status during different stages, considering numerous crop and field types.
    Focusing on the market demand, many leading manufactures are providing a range
    of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, communication devices, and
    other heavy machinery to deliver the sensed data. In addition, various commissions,
    food and agriculture organizations, and government bodies are developing polices
    and guidelines to observe and regulate the use of these technologies in order
    to maintain food and environment safety [17]–[20]. There are reasonable efforts
    that highlight the role of the IoT in the agriculture industry, but most of the
    published work focuses only on applications [10], [21], [22]. Most of the existing
    articles either provide no insight or show limited focus on the various IoT-based
    architectures, prototypes, advanced methods, the use of IoT for food quality,
    and other future issues considering the latest facts and figures. This manuscript
    examines the trends in IoT-based agriculture research and reveals numerous key
    issues that must be addressed in order to transform the agriculture industry by
    utilizing the recent IoT developments. The major contribution of this article
    is to provide real insight regarding: Expectations of the world from the agriculture
    industry Very recent developments in IoT, both scholarly and in industry are highlighted
    and how these developments are helping to provide solutions to the agriculture
    industry. Limitations, the agriculture industry is facing. Role of IoT to cope
    these limitations and other issues like resources shortage and their precise use,
    food spoilage, climate changes, environmental pollution, and urbanization. Strategies
    and policies that need to be considered when implementing IoT-based technologies
    Critical issues that are left to solve and possible solutions that are further
    required, while suggestions are provided considering these challenges. This article
    is a compendium of knowledge that can help the researchers and agriculture engineers
    implementing the IoT-based technologies to achieve the desired smart agriculture.
    The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section II provides a deep
    overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture and what we can achieve by
    utilizing these technologies. Section III gives insight regarding the role of
    IoT in advanced agriculture practices, like vertical farming (VF), hydroponics,
    and phenotyping, to manage the issues of increased urban population. Section IV
    highlights various technologies and equipment, like sensors, robots, tractors,
    and communication devices, being used to implement IoT in this industry. Accepting
    the worth of UAVs in precision agriculture, Section V caters application achievements
    that are not possible even using other latest technologies. Food safety and transportation
    are other critical areas requiring focus to overcome the hunger issues which did
    not get the attention of researchers as it deserves. Section VI supplies the role
    of the IoT to ensure food quality for longer periods and to deliver to remote
    areas. Section VII identifies current and future trends of this technology in
    the crop industry by highlighting potential research challenges. Finally, Section
    VIII concludes this article. SECTION II. Major Applications By implementing the
    latest sensing and IoT technologies in agriculture practices, every aspect of
    traditional farming methods can be fundamentally changed. Currently, seamless
    integration of wireless sensors and the IoT in smart agriculture can raise agriculture
    to levels which were previously unimaginable. By following the practices of smart
    agriculture, IoT can help to improve the solutions of many traditional farming
    issues, like drought response, yield optimization, land suitability, irrigation,
    and pest control. Figure 3 lists a hierarchy of major applications, services and
    wireless sensors being used for smart agriculture applications. While, major instances
    in which the advanced technologies are helping at various stages to enhance overall
    efficiency are discussed below. FIGURE 3. General hierarchy of possible applications,
    services and sensors for smart agriculture. Show All A. Soil Sampling and Mapping
    Soil is the “stomach” of plants, and its sampling is the first step of examination
    to obtain field-specific information, which is then further used to make various
    critical decisions at different stages. The main objective of soil analysis is
    to determine the nutrient status of a field so that measures can be taken accordingly
    when nutrient deficiencies are found. Comprehensive soil tests are recommended
    on an annual basis, ideally in Spring; however, based on soil conditions and weather
    consents, it may be done in in Fall or Winter [23]. The factors that are critical
    to analyze the soil nutrient levels include soil type, cropping history, fertilizer
    application, irrigation level, topography, etc. These factors give insight regarding
    the chemical, physical, and biological statuses of a soil to identify the limiting
    factors such that the crops can be dealt accordingly. Soil mapping opens the door
    to sowing different crop varieties in a specific field to better match soil properties
    accordingly, like seed suitability, time to sow, and even the planting depth,
    as some are deep-rooted and others less. Furthermore, growing multiple crops together
    could also lead to smarter use of agriculture, simply making the best use of resources.
    Currently, manufacturers are providing a wide range of toolkits and sensors that
    can assist farmers to track the soil quality and, based on this data, recommend
    remedies to avoid its degradation. These systems allow for the monitoring of soil
    properties, such as texture, water-holding capacity, and absorption rate, which
    ultimately help to minimize erosion, densification, salinization, acidification,
    and pollution (by avoiding excessive use of fertilizer). Lab-in-a-Box, a soil
    testing tool kit developed by AgroCares, is considered a complete laboratory in
    itself based on its offered services [24]. By using this, any farmer, without
    having any lab experience, can analyze up to 100 samples per day (overall, more
    than 22,000 nutrient samples a year) without visiting any lab. Drought is a major
    concern which limits the productivity of crop yield. Most of the regions around
    the globe face this issue with various intensities. To deal with this issue, especially
    in very rural areas, remote sensing is being used to obtain frequent soil moisture
    data which helps to analyze the agricultural drought in far regions. For this
    purpose, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched in
    2009 which provides global soil moisture maps every, one to two days. Authors
    in [25] used SMOS L2 to calculate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) in Spain
    in 2014. In this effort, they followed different approaches to obtain the soil
    water parameters in order to compare with the SWDI acquired from in situ data.
    In [26], authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    sensor to map various soil functional properties to estimate the land degradation
    risk for sub-Saharan Africa. The soil maps and field survey data, which covered
    all major climate zones on the continent, were used to develop the prediction
    models. Sensors and vision based technologies are helpful to decide the distance
    and depth for sowing the seed efficiently. Like in [27], sensor and vision based
    autonomous robot called Agribot is developed for sowing seeds. The robot can perform
    on any agricultural lands on which the self-awareness of the robot’s placement
    is ascertained through the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning
    System (GPS) while the on-board vision system is paired with a personal computer.
    Advancing further, various non-contact sensing methods are proposed to determine
    the seed flow rate as in [28] where the sensors are equipped with LEDs; consist
    of infrared, visible light and laser-LED as well as an element as a radiation
    receiver. The output voltage varies based on the movement of the seeds through
    the sensor and band of light rays, and falling of shades on the elements of receiver.
    The signal information, linked to the passing seeds, is used to measure the seed
    flow rate. B. Irrigation About 97% of Earth’s water is salt-water held by oceans
    and seas, and only the remaining 3% is fresh water—more than two-third of which
    is frozen in the forms of glaciers and polar ice caps [29], [30]. Only 0.5% of
    the unfrozen fresh water is above the ground or in the air, as the rest lies underground
    [31]. In short, humanity relies on this 0.5% to fulfill all its requirements and
    to maintain the ecosystem, as enough fresh water must be kept in rivers, lakes,
    and other similar reservoirs to sustain it. It is worth mentioning that solely
    the agriculture industry uses approximately 70% of this accessible fresh water
    [32], [33]. In many countries, situation rises to 75% e.g. Brazil, further in
    some underdeveloped countries, even it exceeds 80% [34]. The main reason for this
    high water consumption is the monitoring procedure as even in 2013, crops visual
    inspection for irrigation decision-making was very common, as nearly 80% of farms
    in United States were observed by this [10], [35]. According to the UN Convention
    to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates in 2013 show that there were 168 countries
    affected by desertification and by 2030, almost half of the world population will
    be living in areas with high water shortages [36]. Considering the figures of
    water crises around the globe, same time its increasing demands in agriculture
    and many other industries, it should be provided to places only where it is needed,
    most importantly, in required quantities. For this purpose, increased awareness
    has been implemented to conserve the existing under-stress water resources by
    employing more efficient irrigation systems. Various controlled irrigation methods,
    like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, are being promoted to tackle the
    water wastage issues, which were also found in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation and furrow irrigation. Both the crop quality and quantity are badly
    affected when facing water shortage, as irregular irrigation, even excess, leads
    to reduced soil nutrients and provokes different microbial infections. It is not
    a simple task to accurately estimate the water demand of crops, where factors
    like crop type, irrigation method, soil type, precipitation, crop needs, and soil
    moisture retention are involved. Considering this fact, a precise soil and air
    moisture control system using the wireless sensors not only makes an optimal use
    of water but also leads to better crop health. The current situation of irrigation
    methods is expected to be changed by adopting the emerging IoT technologies. A
    significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the use of IoT based
    techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation management
    [10], [35]. For this, attaining crop canopy at different periods and air temperature
    are needed for the calculation of CWSI. A wireless sensors based monitoring system
    where all the field sensors are connected to collect the mentioned measurements,
    further transmit to processing center where corresponding intelligent software
    applications are used to analyze the farm data. Not only this but information
    from other sources including weather data and satellite imaging is applied to
    CWSI models for water need assessment, and finally specific irrigation index value
    is produced for each site. A prominent example is VRI (Variable Rate Irrigation)
    optimization by CropMetrics [37], which works according to topography or soil
    variability, ultimately improves the water use efficiency. C. Fertilizer A fertilizer
    is a natural or chemical substance that can provide important nutrients for the
    growth and fertility of plants. Plants mainly need three key macronutrients: nitrogen
    (N) for leaf growth; phosphorus (P) for root, flowers, and fruit development;
    potassium (K) for stem growth and water movement [38]. Any sort of nutrients deficiency
    or applying them improperly can be seriously harmful for the plant health. More
    importantly, excessive use of fertilizer not only results in financial losses
    but also creates harmful impacts to the soil and environment by depleting the
    soil quality, poisoning ground water, and contributing to global climate changes.
    Overall, crops absorb less than half the nitrogen applied as fertilizer, while
    remaining either emitted to the atmosphere or lost as run off. Unbalanced use
    of fertilizer leads to an imbalance in both soil nutrient levels and global climate
    as, reportedly, around 80% of the world’s deforestation has occurred due to agricultural
    practices alone [39]. Fertilization under smart agriculture helps to precisely
    estimate the required dose of nutrients, ultimately minimize their negative effects
    on the environment. Fertilization requires site-specific soil nutrient level measurements
    based on various factors, such as crop type, soil type, soil absorption capability,
    product yield, fertility type and utilization rate, weather condition, etc. The
    reason is that the measurement of soil nutrient level is not only expensive but
    also time consuming, as, typically, investigations of soil samples at each location
    are required. To better depict this discussion, figure 4, summarizes the major
    inputs, processes and resultant outputs of smart agriculture. FIGURE 4. Some key
    inputs, processes involved and possible outputs of smart farming. Show All New
    IoT-based fertilizing approaches help to estimate the spatial patterns of nutrients
    requirements with a higher accuracy and minimum labor requirements [40], [41].
    For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses aerial/satellite
    images to monitor crop nutrient status [42], [43]. Basically, NDVI is based on
    the reflection of visible and near-infrared light from vegetation and is used
    to estimate the crop health, vegetation vigor, and density, further contributing
    to assess the soil nutrient level. Such precise implementation can significantly
    improve the fertilizer efficiency, simultaneously reducing the side effects to
    the environment. Many recent enabling technologies, like GPS accuracy [44], geo
    mapping [45], Variable Rate Technology (VRT) [46], [47], and autonomous vehicles
    [48], are strongly contributing to IoT-based smart fertilization. Other than precision
    fertilization, fertigation [49] and chemigation [50], [51] are other benefits
    of IoT. In these methods, water-soluble matters, such as fertilizers, soil amendments,
    and pesticides, can be applied through the irrigation system. Although, these
    methods are not new to agriculture and have been applied over last three decades,
    their precise use with real results has been witnessed only with IoT integration
    [52], [53]. Based on recent outcomes, fertigation is considered as the best management
    practice to improve the effectiveness of many agriculture matters; most importantly,
    it can be integrated with IoT-based smart farming infrastructure seamlessly. D.
    Crop Disease and Pest Management The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato
    Famine, in which approximately one million Irish people died around 1950, resulted
    due to crop failure and yield reduction caused by “potato blight” disease [54].
    Even today, corn growers in the US and southern Canada are facing an economic
    loss of approximately one billion USD due to “southern corn leaf blight” disease
    [55]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 20–40% of global
    crop yields are lost annually due to pests and diseases [56]. To control such
    vast production losses, pesticides and other agrochemicals became an important
    component of the agriculture industry during the last century. It is estimated
    that, in each year, around half a million tons of pesticide are used in the US
    alone, while more than two-million tons are used globally [57]. Most of these
    pesticides are harmful to human and animal health, leaving severe, even irreversible,
    impact to the environment, ultimately causing significant contamination to entire
    ecosystems [58], [59]. Recent IoT based intelligent devices, such as wireless
    sensors, robots and drones are allowing the growers to slash pesticide uses significantly
    by precisely spotting crop enemies. Compared to traditional calendar or prescription
    based pest control procedures, modern IoT-based pest management provides real-time
    monitoring, modeling, disease forecasting, hence proving more effective [60],
    [61]. Generally, the reliability of crop disease monitoring and pest management
    depends on three aspects: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. The advanced disease
    and pest recognition approaches are based on image processing in which raw images
    are acquired throughout the crop area using field sensors, UAVs, or remote sensing
    satellites. Usually, remote sensing imagery covers large areas and, hence, offers
    higher efficiency with lower cost. On the other hand, field sensors are capable
    to support more functions in collecting data, like environment sampling, plant
    health, and pest situations, in every corner throughout the crop cycle. For example,
    IoT-based automated traps [62], [63] can capture, count, and even characterize
    insect types, further uploading data to the Cloud for detailed analysis, which
    is not possible through remote sensing. Approaches like vehicle precise spray
    and automatic VRT chemigation [64], commonly used under smart fertilization, can
    also be utilized for disease treatment and other pesticide applications. Moreover,
    the advancement of robotic technology offers new solutions. When equipping an
    agricultural robot with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    it can locate and deal with pest problems more precisely under the manipulation
    of a remote IoT disease management system. This IoT-based pest management system
    has many advantages, as it can reduce the overall expenditures while, at the same
    time, support the restoration of the natural climate. For example, recently, it
    has been found that yields of many crop types are facing severe threat due to
    the lack of pollination [65], [66]. In fact, the pollination is being affected
    due to bee colony collapse disorder resulting from the uncontrolled pesticides.
    E. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting Yield monitoring is the mechanism
    used to analyze various aspects corresponding to agricultural yield, like grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity. It helps to accurately
    assess by recording the crop yield and moisture level to estimate, how well the
    crop performed and what to do next. Yield monitoring is considered an essential
    part of precision farming not only at the time of harvest but even before that,
    as monitoring the yield quality plays a crucial role. Yield quality depends on
    many factors, e.g. sufficient pollination with good quality pollen especially
    when predicting seed yields under changing environmental conditions [67]–[69].
    Currently, when we are dealing with more open markets, buyers around the world
    become more particular about fruit quality; hence, effective production depends
    on the right fruit size to the right market at the right time [13]. Crop forecasting
    is an art to predict the yield and production (tons/ha) before the harvest takes
    place. This forecasting helps the farmer for near-future planning and decision
    making. Furthermore, analyzing the yield quality and its maturity is another critical
    factor which enables the determination of the right time for harvesting. This
    monitoring covers various development stages and uses fruit conditions like its
    color, size, etc., for this purpose. Predicting the right harvesting time not
    only helps to maximize the crop quality and production but also provides an opportunity
    to adjust the management strategy. Although, harvesting is the last stage of this
    process, proper scheduling can make a clear difference. To obtain the real benefits
    from crops, farmers need to know when these crops are actually ready to harvest.
    Figure 5 represents a snapshot of a farm area network (FAN) that can portrait
    the whole farm to the farmer in real time. FIGURE 5. An IoT based farm area network
    (FAN). Show All A yield monitor, developed in [70], can be installed on any harvester
    combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX, which displays live harvest data
    and uploads it automatically to the manufacturer’s web-based platform. This app
    has the ability to generate high-quality yield maps and share these maps with
    an agronomist, and the farmer also has the option to export to other farm management
    software to analyze them. To estimate the production and quality of yield precisely,
    the measurement of fruit growth can be highly beneficial. This idea is used in
    [71], where authors considered the fruit growth as the most basic and relevant
    parameter to estimate that how well the crop is progressing. Satellite images
    can be a good option to monitor the yield of crops with vast areas. This method
    is utilized in [72], where authors used Sentinel-1A Interferometric images to
    map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar. As we mentioned earlier in this
    section, fruit size always plays a critical role to estimate its maturation, making
    decisions regarding harvesting, and targeting the right market, for this purpose,
    color (RGB) depth images are used in [73] to track the different fruit conditions
    in mango farms. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used in [74] to monitor
    the shrinking of papayas, especially during drying conditions. SECTION III. Advanced
    Agricultural Practices Adopting the novel methods to enhance the quality and quantity
    of food is not something new, as humans have been doing this for centuries. Initially,
    we tried to enhance the crop production by focusing on seed variety, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. Soon it was realized that these conventional ways were not adequate
    enough to fit this demand gap; hence, agriculture scientists have begun thinking
    of other alternatives, like bioengineered (BE) foods. BE foods, also known as
    genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) foods, are foods produced
    by introducing changes into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.
    However, several studies highlight their serious effects on human health, including
    infertility, disruption in immune system, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulations,
    etc. [75], [76]. All these and many other similar technologies did not receive
    much popularity and acceptance in society because people prefer bio and organic
    food. In this regards, massive research has been conducted for decades in which
    sensors and IoT-based technologies are helping to improve conventional agriculture
    processes to enhance yield production without, or with minimum, effect on its
    originality. For this purpose, new sophisticated and more controlled environments
    are projected to tackle the above-mentioned issues. The importance and involvement
    of new technologies is more critical, as we are moving toward more cultured and
    urban farming. In fact, it would not be incorrect for one to say that the success
    of these advanced practices is in doubt without using sensor-based technologies.
    A. Greenhouse Farming Greenhouse farming is considered the oldest method of smart
    farming. Although, the idea of growing plants in controlled environment is not
    new as found since Roman times but it gained popularity in 19th century where
    largest greenhouses were built in France, Netherlands and Italy. Further, the
    practice was accelerated in the mid-20th century and highly promoted in countries
    that facing harsh weather conditions [77]. Crops grown indoors are very less affected
    by environment; most importantly, they are not limited to receiving light only
    during the daytime. As a result, the crops that traditionally could only be grown
    under suitable conditions or in certain parts of the world are now being growing
    anytime and anywhere. This was the actual time in which sensors and communication
    devices started to support various agriculture applications genuinely. The success
    and production of various crops under such controlled environment depend on many
    factors, like accuracy of monitoring parameters, structure of shed, covering material
    to control wind effects, ventilation system, decision support system, etc. A detailed
    analysis is provided in [78], where all these factors, their impacts, and how
    wireless sensors can help for all this are considered. Precise monitoring of environment
    parameters is the most critical task in modern greenhouses, where several measurement
    points of various parameters are required to control and ensure the local climate.
    In [79], an IoT-based prototype is proposed to monitor the greenhouses where MicaZ
    nodes are used to measure the inside parameters like humidity, temperature, light,
    and pressure. B. Vertical Farming The world needs more farmable lands to fulfill
    increased food demands, but reality is that one-third arable land was lost during
    the last four decades due to erosion and pollution [80], [81]. Unfortunately,
    current agricultural practices based on industrial farming are damaging the soil
    quality far faster than nature can rebuild it. Overall, it is estimated that erosion
    rates from cultivated fields is 10 to 40 times greater than the soil formation
    rates [82]. Considering the reduction of arable land issues, it could be a disaster
    for food production in the near future with current agriculture practices. Further,
    as we mentioned, 70% of fresh water is only used for agriculture purpose, which
    can increase the burden on existing limited water reservoirs. Vertical Farming
    (VF) is an answer to meet the challenges of land and water shortages. VF in the
    form of urban agriculture offers an opportunity to stack the plants in a more
    controlled environment resulting in, most importantly, significant reduction in
    resource consumption. By following this method, we can increase the production
    multiple times, as only a fraction of ground surface is required (depending on
    the number of stacks) as compared to traditional agriculture practices. Not only
    for ground surface, this system is highly efficient in terms of other resources,
    as well. For example, according to Mirai, a Japan based indoor farm developer
    presented the figures regarding a Japanese farm comprised of 25,000 square meters.
    The figures are highly encouraging, as it is producing 10,000 heads of lettuce
    per day (double the production when compared with traditional methods) and is,
    most importantly, consuming 40% less energy and up to 99% reduced water consumption
    compared to outdoor fields [83]. Aerofarms, a leader in VF, growing agricultural
    products with upto 390 times higher yields while utilizing 95% less water at Newark
    [84]. Under this farming method, many parameters are important, but CO2 measurements
    are most critical; hence, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors play a critical
    role to track and control the conditions in vertical farms. Boxed Gascard, developed
    by Edinburgh Sensors [85], is especially designed by considering such an environment,
    which employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR measurement system to enhance the stability
    and reduced optical complexity. Human hands are not required to touch the crops
    at any stage when following the IoT-connected vertical farm; this is the claim
    made by Mint Controls [86] developers who offer a wide range of solutions, like
    waste containers and sensors and their integration for various VF applications.
    C. Hydroponic In order to enhance the benefits of greenhouse farming, agriculture
    experts moved forward another step and provided the idea of hydroponic, a subset
    of hydroculture in which plants are grown without soil. Hydroponic is based on
    an irrigation system in which balanced nutrients are dissolved in water and crop
    roots stay in that solution; in some cases, roots can be supported by medium like
    perlite or gravel. When combining hydroponics with VF, a farm of 100 sq. meters
    can produce the crop equivalent to 1 acre of traditional farm, most importantly
    upto 95% less water and fertilizers utilization and without pesticides/herbicides
    [87]. Currently, available systems and sensors e.g. [88], [89] are not only used
    to monitor a range of parameters and take readings at predefined intervals but,
    also, the measurements are stored so that can be used to analyze and diagnostic
    purpose later on. Under this application, the precision of nutrient measurements
    is crucial, as such, a highly reliable wireless control system for tomato hydroponics
    is proposed in [90] in which they focused on various communication standards that
    are least effected by plants’ presence and their growth. The monitoring of solution
    contents and their precision is most critical under this method; for this purpose,
    many systems are offered to check the presence of contents considering the plant
    demands. In [91] a wireless-sensor-based prototype is proposed to deliver a turn-key
    solution for the hydroponic cultivation which offers real-time measurements for
    soilless indoor growing. Further, a compact sensor module is presented in [92],
    which uses oscillator circuits to measure the presence and concentrations of various
    nutrients and water levels. D. Phenotyping The previously discussed smart methods
    look more promising for the future of agriculture, as they are already being used
    to produce different crop products under precise environments. Other than these,
    a few advanced techniques are under experiment to further enhance the crop capabilities
    by controlling their limitations with the help of advanced sensing and communication
    technologies. Among these methods, the more prominent is phenotyping, which is
    based on emerging crop engineering, which links plant genomics with its ecophysiology
    and agronomy, as shows in Figure 6. The progress in molecular and genetic tools
    for various crop breeding was significant in the last decade. However, a quantitative
    analysis of the crop behavior, e.g. grain weight, pathogen resistance, etc., was
    limited due to the lack of efficient techniques and technologies that we can now
    enjoy. FIGURE 6. The process of phenotyping [96]. Show All Research investigations,
    completed in [93], conclude that plant phenotyping can be highly beneficial to
    investigate the quantitative characteristics, such as those are responsible for
    its growth, yield quality and quantity, and resistance capabilities to handle
    various stresses. Similarly, the role of sensing technologies and image-based
    phenotyping are highlighted in [94] and describes how these solutions can help
    to boost the progress not only for screening numerous biostimulants but also their
    role in understanding the mode of actions. Furthermore, an IoT-based phenotyping
    platform, CropQuant, is designed to monitor the crop and relevant trait measurements
    that can provide facility for crop breeding and digital agriculture [95]. Here,
    an automatic in-field control system was developed to process the data generated
    by platform. The provided trait analyses algorithms and machine-learning modeling
    help to explore the relation among the genotypes, phenotypes, and environment
    where it grows. SECTION IV. Major Equipment and Technologies Different from ancient
    farming, most of the tasks in modern, large-scale agriculture are being done by
    heavy and urbane equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and other robots which
    are fully or partially supported by remote sensing and other communication technologies.
    In precision agriculture, when tasks like sowing, fertilizing, irrigation, and
    harvesting are being performed, the operating vehicles are equipped with GPS and
    GIS facilities so that they can work precisely, site-specifically, and autonomously.
    In fact, the idea of site-specific crop management is not possible without involving
    the recent advanced technologies. The success of precision agriculture is based
    on the accuracy of collected data, which is usually done in two ways [10]. The
    first entails the usage of multifunctional imaginary devices equipped with remote
    sensing platforms, such as satellites, agriculture airplanes, balloons, and UAVs;
    the second is from various types of sensors—those that are mostly deployed for
    specific purpose across various sites of our interest. The gathered data is identified
    with the precise location information by using GPS devices so that the site-specific
    treatment can be provided afterwards. Agriculture has transformed during the last
    few decades from small/medium farming operations to highly industrialized and
    commercial farming. This transition allows the leading corporations to treat agriculture
    like other industries, e.g., manufacturing where the measurements, data, and control
    are very important to provide a balance between costs and production in order
    to boost the profits. Accordingly, every aspect of agriculture that can be automated,
    digitally planned, and managed will benefit from IoT technologies and solutions.
    Based on this fact, efforts are being focused to offer more sophisticated tools
    such as agricultural robots to perform a range of activities, like planting, watering,
    weeding, picking, thinning, fertilizing, spraying, packing and transporting. This
    revolution is being driven not only due to the advancement of technology, but
    is also a result of factors like fear of losing the low-cost labor, most importantly
    need for better and cheaper food. Based on these facts, during the period of 2017
    to 2022, the global smart farming market is predicted to rise at a growth rate
    of 19.3% per year to touch $23.14 billion in 2022 [97]. Here it is worth mentioning
    that UAV/drones are generating and further expected to generate the highest revenue
    amongst all agricultural robots utilized in smart farming (UAVs are discussed
    in Section V). Evergreen demand for higher crop yield, increased incorporation
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in farming and the rapid global
    climatic changes are some of the major drivers resulting to such high market growth.
    Manufacturers in the market offer a variety of products and solutions, mostly
    based on sensors and efficient communication for a range of applications; a few
    are shown in figure 7. The key technologies and equipment’s that are currently
    available for this purpose are discussed in following. FIGURE 7. Selected IoT
    based products and prototypes for smart agriculture. Show All A. Wireless Sensors
    Among all the equipment for smart farming currently available in the market, wireless
    sensors are the most crucial and play a key role when it comes to collecting the
    crop conditions and other information. Wireless sensors are being used standalone
    wherever required, further integrated with almost every portion of advanced agricultural
    tools and heavy machinery, depending on application requirements. In the following,
    major sensor types are discussed according to their working procedure and purpose
    and the benefits they offer. 1) Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors offer a miscellaneous
    appliance in farm management, including soil cultivation, weeding, fruit harvesting,
    etc.; the main benefit of this technology is its low-cost solutions with fast
    response, especially when considering portable equipment. It functions by measuring
    the change in the noise level as the tool interacts with other materials, e.g.,
    soil particles [98]. Acoustic sensors are commonly used for pest monitoring and
    detection [99] and classifying the seed varieties according to their sound absorption
    spectra [100]. 2) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Sensors FPGA based
    sensors are starting to be used in agriculture recently due to their flexibility
    of reconfiguration. The major options where these can be employed include measuring
    real-time plant transpiration, irrigation, and humidity [101], [102]. However,
    their utilization in agriculture is in the early stages due to their limitations,
    such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors require more power; hence,
    they are not suitable for continuous monitoring, further high in cost even compromising
    on performance [103]. By overcoming these issues, FPGA-based sensors can offer
    satisfactory solutions according to specific application requirements. 3) Optical
    Sensors These sensors use light reflectance phenomena and help to measure soil
    organic substances, soil moisture and color, presence of minerals and their composition,
    clay content, etc. [104], [105]. These sensors test the soil’s ability to reflect
    light based on different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The changes occurred
    in wave reflections help to indicate the changes in soil density and other parameters.
    Fluorescence-based optical sensors are used for basic plant assessment, especially
    to supervise the fruit maturation [106]. Further, when integrating optical sensors
    with microwave scattering, it can be used for characterizing grove canopies, like
    olives and other similar crops [107]. 4) Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors Sensors of
    this category are considered a good choice being low cost, potential to operate
    in a variety of applications, and ease of use and adjustability, such as the sampling
    rate. Common uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (e.g., boom
    height and width control in order to perform uniform spray coverage, object detection,
    and collision avoidance), and monitoring crop canopy [108], [109]. When combined
    with a camera, these sensors can then be used for the weed detection [110], where
    the heights of plants are identified using the ultrasonic sensors and the camera
    determines the weed and crop coverage. 5) Optoelectronic Sensors Optoelectronic
    sensors can differentiate plant type; hence, they help to detect weeds, herbicides,
    and other unwanted plants, especially in wide-row crops [111]. When combining,
    an optoelectronic sensor and location information, it can map the weed distribution
    and resolution [112]. Optoelectronic sensors are also capable of differentiating
    between vegetation and soil from their reflection spectra. 6) Airflow Sensors
    These sensors are capable of measuring soil air permeability and percentage of
    moisture and identifying soil structure to distinguish different types of soils.
    Measurements can be made at singular locations or dynamically while in motion,
    e.g., can be used on a fixed position or in mobile mode. The desired output is
    the pressure required to push a predetermined amount of air into the ground at
    a prescribed depth. It follows the procedure of various soil properties, including
    compaction, structure, and moisture levels, producing unique identifying signatures
    [113]. 7) Electrochemical Sensors These are mostly used to assess the significant
    soil characteristics to analyze the soil nutrient levels, such as pH [114]. The
    standard chemical soil analysis, which are mostly expensive and time consuming,
    can be easily substituted with these sensors. To be more precise, the macro and
    micro nutrients in the soil, salinity and pH [115], are measured using sensors
    of this nature. 8) Electromagnetic Sensors Electromagnetic sensors are used to
    record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response, identify
    electrical response, and adjust variable rate applications in the actual situation.
    Sensors based on this technology use electric circuits to measure the capability
    of soil particles to conduct or accumulate electrical charge, which is mostly
    done by the following two methods: contact or non-contact [116]. Residual nitrates
    and organic matter in the soil can also be measured using the electromagnetic
    sensors, as done in [117]. 9) Mechanical Sensors Mechanical sensors assess the
    soil mechanical resistance (compaction) to indicate the variable level of compaction.
    The mechanical sensors enter or cut through the soil and record the force assessed
    by strain gauges or load cells [118]. A pressure unit is used to measure the soil’s
    mechanical resistance, which is actually the ratio of the force needed to go into
    the soil medium using the frontal part of the tool, actually engaged with the
    soil. 10) Mass Flow Sensors Category of this sensors are used for yield monitoring,
    as it provides the yield information by measuring the amount of grain flow, e.g.,
    when passing through the combine harvester. Sensing the mass flow of grain to
    determine the crop yield is not new, as it has been performed the last two decades
    [119]. The mass flow sensor is the most critical component, but, overall, the
    yield monitoring system consists of several other modules, like the grain moisture
    sensor, data storage device, and an internal software to analyze the data, which
    are within the interface provided in the John Deere tractors [120]. 11) Eddy Covariance-Based
    Sensors This type of sensors can be used for quantifying exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, methane or other gases, and energy between the surface of the earth
    and the atmosphere. This method offers an accurate way to measure surface-atmosphere
    fluxes of energy and trace gas fluxes over a variety of ecosystems for, most importantly,
    agricultural applications [121]. Currently, the sensors based on this technology
    are preferred over other similar options, like the close chamber, due to high
    precision and its ability to measuring continuous flux over large areas [122].
    12) Soft Water Level-Based (SWLB) Sensors SWLB sensors are being utilized in agriculture
    catchments to characterize hydrological behaviors, such as water level and flow,
    at adjustable time-step acquisitions. This is done by measuring rainfalls, stream
    flows, and other water presence options [11], [123]. 13) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) This technology is widely used in a range of agriculture applications,
    such as land mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, farm 3D modelling,
    monitoring erosion and soil loss, and yield forecasting [124]–[126]. LiDAR is
    also commonly used to obtain dynamic measurement information regarding fruit-tree
    leaf area, and, when combined with GPS, it can produce a 3D map [127]. Moreover,
    this technology is often used when estimating the biomass of various crops and
    trees [128]. 14) Telematics Sensors Telematics sensors support telecommunication
    between two places—more precisely, among two vehicles when considering the agriculture-based
    applications. Telemetry sensors are used to collect data from remote locations
    (especially inaccessible points), operations of machines that report on how the
    components are working, and record location and travel routes to avoid visiting
    the same patch [129]. These services enable farm managers to record and store
    all information related to farm operations automatically, which maximizes the
    utilization of environmental benefits, further can minimize threats like farm
    equipment theft as utilized in [130], [131]. 15) Remote Sensing Sensors belong
    to this category are used to capture and store the geographic information, further
    analyze, manipulate, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data.
    Similar to LiDAR, these sensors also found significant use in agriculture applications
    including crop assessment, forecasting yield dates, yield modelling and forecasting,
    identification of plants and pests, land cover and degradation mapping etc [132]–[134].
    Argos sensor is one of leading example, a satellite-based sensor system used to
    collect, process and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide [135]. Moreover, automatic packet reporting system (APRS) is being integrated
    to report telemetry data through satellite communication [136]. Table 1 lists
    a few sensors to provide the idea about their possible uses and the environment
    where they can be placed. TABLE 1 Some Selected Sensors and Their Possible Uses
    in IoT Based Agriculture B. IoT Based Tractors As rural labor resources have started
    to come under stress due to the expansion of the crop industry, tractors and other
    automatic heavy machinery started to enter the agriculture sector. Where available,
    an average size tractor can work 40 times faster with significantly less expenses
    than traditional farm labor [157]. To fulfill the continuously increasing demands,
    agricultural-based equipment manufacturers, like John Deere, Hello Tractors, Case
    IH and CNH (New Holland), have started to provide better solutions focusing on
    the grower’s requirements. With the advancement of technology, most of these manufacturers
    are offering tractors with automatic-driven and even Cloud-computing capabilities.
    This technology is not new, as self-driving tractors have been in the market even
    before semi-autonomous cars. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors
    is their ability to avoid revisiting the same area or row by reducing the overlap
    even less than an inch. In addition, they can make very precise turns without
    a driver’s physical presence. This facility offers better precision with reduced
    errors, especially when spraying insecticide or targeting weeds; those are mostly
    unavoidable when a human controls the machinery. Although, at the moment, no fully
    autonomous tractor is available in market, many researchers and manufactures are
    hardly working to mature the technology. Based on current progress and future
    demands of high-tech tractors, it is predicated that around 700,000 tractors equipped
    with facilities like autosteer or tractor guidance will be sold in 2028 [158],
    while the same study expects that around 40,000 unmanned, fully-autonomous (level
    5) tractors will be sold in 2038 [159]. When talking about such cultured machines,
    most farmers can’t afford to own them while most of the tractor service providers
    and manufacturers operate well below their potential. Considering the challenge,
    Hello Tractor has developed a solution to sort these issues. The company has developed
    a low-cost monitoring device that can be placed on any tractor, provides powerful
    software and analytics tools [160]. The benefits of this device are twofold- on
    one side it ensures that overall cost of tractor remains affordable for the most
    of growers while at the same time it monitors the condition of the tractor and
    reports if any problems occur. The software connects tractor’s owner to farmers
    in need of tractor services, just like Uber for tractors. Another major example
    is Case IH’s Magnum series [161] tractor which uses on board video cameras and
    LiDAR sensors for object detection and collision avoidance. Recently, Case IH
    used this tractor to plant soybeans by following the concept of autonomous tractors.
    In another development made by standards group ETSI where world’s first tractor
    connected to a car in France, using IoT [162] to control the accidents due to
    farm vehicles. After collecting all the important crop data, the next step is
    pushing computing from the Cloud to the edge, as John Deere [163] wants. In their
    proposed system, an analytics engine works locally on the farmer’s tractor rather
    than in the Cloud in order to adjust the local inputs. For this purpose, they
    considered all the existing analytics and recommendations to modify the current
    data in real time depending on the field conditions. Based on this phenomenon,
    the manufacturer is bringing their tractors to next level by connecting their
    machine to the Internet and creating a method to display the information wherever
    farmer wants to see it. C. Harvesting Robots Harvesting is the most critical stage
    during the production process, as this last phase dictates the crop’s output and,
    ultimately, its success. In some crops, this is done a single time while, in some
    others, performed several times, even on a daily basis, as crop reaches a certain
    stage. Harvesting the crop at the right time is very critical, as doing so either
    early or late can affect the production significantly. When talking about the
    labor, it is estimated that the US faces a $3.1 billion decline in crop production
    on a yearly basis due to labor shortage [164]. Not only this, but, according to
    a study conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, overall 14 %
    of farm costs go to wages and labor costs, while it can be upto 39% in some labor
    intensive farms [165]. Considering the worth of this stage and labor issues, farm
    experts expect that involvement of agriculture robotics may not only ease the
    labor pressure but also provide the flexibility to harvest whenever needed. In
    order to automate the harvesting process and make it more precise, the role of
    robots has been increasing over the recent decades. Considering the robot services,
    many researchers have done intensive research in order to mature the sensitivity
    of fruit detection, its shape, size, color, and localization [166]–[169]. Automatic
    harvesting of fruits requires deep investigation of sophisticated sensors that
    are capable of collecting precise and unambiguous information of that particular
    crop and fruit. The task of detecting the right target in natural scenes is not
    simple since most of the fruits are occluded partially—sometimes even fully—under
    the leaves and branches or are overlapped with other fruits [170]. Here, most
    of the prominent studies found in regard to this purpose are deeply based on computer
    vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques. This process needs
    very specialized and sophisticated tools to differentiate the fruit conditions,
    as there are more than sixty shapes, sizes, and colors for a pepper alone when
    it is ready to harvest. Considering such complexity, many robots are being developed
    for specific crops. Some of the leading robots being used for crop harvesting
    include SW 6010 [171] and Octinion [172] for strawberries, SWEEPER robot [173]
    for peppers, and FFRobot [174] for tree-based fruits like apples which can pick
    up to 10,000 fruits per hour. Strawberries are one of the most consumed fruits,
    available mostly throughout the year while labor is the major contributor to the
    high cost of this fruit, especially during harvesting and packaging stages [175].
    As the strawberry farms are grown mostly under greenhouse systems hence the harvesting
    robots are designed to move on defined paths like rails where the translational
    motion is restricted and robots can move backward and forward only. Robots developed
    by Agrobot are able to collect strawberries along the side of strawberry plant
    rows in the field, further packed by human operators [176]. For example, SW6010
    by Agrobot is a specialized and semi-automatic robot towards the specific task
    of strawberry harvesting [177]. Tektu T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable strawberry
    harvester run silently with zero emission inside the poly-tunnels [178]. The installed
    pickers are able to position over the crop rows and gather the fruit quickly and
    efficiently, directly into punnets. D. Communication in Agriculture Communication
    and reporting the information on a timely basis are considered the backbone of
    precision agriculture. The real purpose cannot be achieved unless a firm, reliable,
    and secure connection among various participating objects is provided. To achieve
    communication reliability, telecom operators can play a crucial role in the agricultural
    sector. If we truly want to implement IoT on a large scale in the agriculture
    industry, we have to provide a suitably large architecture. Here, the factors
    like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability are critical and have
    to be considered before choosing the mean of communication. Low-energy networks
    can provide connectivity only on one site and mostly do not offer services in
    remote areas where sensed data need to be transmitted to the farm management system
    (FMS). Depending on availability, scalability and application requirements, various
    communication modes and technologies are being used for this purpose, most common
    are discussed here, 1) Cellular Communication Cellular communication modes from
    2G to 4G can be suitable, depending on the purpose and bandwidth requirement;
    however, the reliability, and even availability, of a cellular network in rural
    areas is a major concern. To tackle this, data transmission via satellite is another
    option, but, here, the cost of this communication mode is very high, which makes
    it not suitable for small- and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication
    mode also depends on application requirements, such as some farms required sensors
    that can operate with low data rate but need to work for long periods hence demand
    long battery life. For such scenarios, a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is considered a better solution for cellular connectivity, not only in
    terms of long battery life but also a larger connectivity range with affordable
    rates (2 to 15 USD per year) [179]. Currently, crop and pasture management are
    two of the main applications where LPWAN networks are highly suitable, and, further
    considering its success, it can be utilized in many other farming-related uses.
    Besides WAN connectivity option, many short range and medium level communications
    are being used in mesh networks [180]. For example, a mesh-network of sensor nodes
    collects data and transmits it to the gateway which is located somewhere in the
    same area. The gateway further sends this data to the farm management system using
    the WAN network. The communication technologies used within the mesh networks
    vary e.g. Bluetooth and Zigbee can be used to provide connectivity for peer-to-peer
    wireless communications. From here, the sensed data forwarded to the FMS, which
    gathers and analyses the information about all the activities happening at different
    parts even the historical data regarding the weather and climate updates, economic,
    products being used and their specifications etc, in short making it decision
    farming. It is important to mention that, the communication technology has its
    own worth but the FMS also plays a critical role which must be custom designed
    considering the specific application requirements. Generally, based on communication
    data rates and power consumption, wireless sensors for agriculture applications
    are divided in three broad categories as shown in table 2. TABLE 2 Data and Power
    Specifications of Wireless Sensors Commonly Used for Agriculture Applications
    2) Zigbee Zigbee is primarily designed for a wide range of applications especially
    to replace existing non-standard technologies. Depending on the application requirements,
    the devices based on this protocol can be one of three types including Coordinator,
    Router and End User. Further, three different topologies are supported by Zigbee
    networks named, Start, Cluster Tree and Mesh [34]. Based on these characteristics,
    and further considering the agriculture application requirements, Zigbee can play
    vital role especially targeting the greenhouse environment where usually short
    range communications are required. During monitoring the various parameters, the
    real time data from the sensor node is transferred through Zigbee to end server.
    For the applications like, irrigation and fertilization, Zigbee modules are networked
    for communication, e.g. in drip irrigation used to monitor soil contents like
    moisture. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field data
    where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the shorter
    distances. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that connects
    small-head devices together over shorter distances usually cooperating in a close
    proximity. Due to its advantages of low power requirements, easy to use and low
    cost, this technology is being utilized in many smart farming applications. Further,
    Bluetooth making advancements in many IoT systems with the release of Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) or commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. The study conducted in
    [181] which tests Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller) with ICS (integrated
    control strategy), timer control and soil moisture control approach for smart
    irrigation. The target of this study is to find an optimum utilization of water
    and energy consumption for various greenhouse or field applications. A moisture
    and temperature sensor based on BLE is developed in [182] especially focusing
    on the agriculture environments and weather conditions of crop fields. Here the
    reason of choosing BLE for communication purpose is due to its inherent support
    for smart phone accessibility. Further, a similar effort is done in [183] where
    a new sensor node is designed to monitor ambient light and temperature employing
    BLE communication protocol preferable for IoT based agriculture applications.
    Other than short range, WiFi is utilized whenever LAN communications are required
    in smart agriculture. Along short range connectivity, WiFi is utilized whenever
    LAN communications are required in smart agriculture. Study presented in [184]
    investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the sensor nodes were
    based on WSN802G modules. The deployed nodes communicate wirelessly with a central
    server, which is responsible to collect and store the monitored data and further
    allow displaying the information after required analysis. 4) LoRa LoRa wireless
    technology is a long-range, low-power platform used extensively in IoT applications.
    Being low in power consumption, it offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless
    sensors and the Cloud. It has proved itself much more effective and reliable than
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. especially in restaurants or kitchen environments. Sensors
    based on LoRa can be installed in smaller devices for reliable monitoring. Most
    importantly, LoRa signals can penetrate thick and insulated objects, even buildings,
    and can, hence, cover a larger network area. Overall, LoRa-based networks perform
    higher in terms of lifespan and, at the same time, pose reduced maintenance and
    upkeep burden [185]. Considering the advantages, many researchers tested this
    communication method in kitchens, storage rooms, and transport systems. In [186],
    a test was conducted in a warehouse with a capacity to store 40 tons of apples,
    and results show that it provided full coverage, where the temperature and airflow
    readings transferred successfully with a packet rate of more the 96%. Similarly,
    [187] presents a system to achieve information traceability in the grain transport
    system to ensure the food quality by monitoring the temperature and humidity levels.
    5) Sigfox Sigfox is also used to provide network connectivity services to low-powered
    objects as “things” required. It is based on narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology;
    hence, it takes very narrow chunks of spectrum and changes the phase of the carrier
    radio wave to encode the data. Based on these characteristics, it offers high
    level performance, even if 100 sensors need to transmit data at the same time,
    as experiments done in [188]. Figure 8 gives an idea that how end-to-end communication
    possibilities can be divided in various layers to interact with each other in
    order to provide the services for smart agriculture. FIGURE 8. End to end communication
    for smart farming. Show All E. Smartphones Despite its availability concerns for
    remote fields, cellular communication is the major technology in rural areas;
    mobile phones are a very common source and primary mode of communication whenever
    the need arises to contact or update most of the farming community. Recent advancements
    in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp price decreases, making this
    industry more attractive, especially to the smallholder growers in remote areas.
    The rapid spread of cellular networks in developing countries offers the opportunity
    to reach remote and dispersed farms with improved services. Mobile-phone-based
    agriculture services (m-services) are far from their assumed potential; according
    to an analysis done by GSM Association, only at 8 per cent [189]. However, the
    flexibility and functionality, such as the camera, GPS, microphone accelerometer,
    proximity, and gyroscope, attract the IT experts, and they are developing more
    appealing mobile apps that consider the farmer’s various needs [190], [191]. The
    conclusion of FAO’s 10-year investigations states that “solid information is needed
    regarding the impact of previous initiatives, including lessons learned, in order
    to inform the design and approach of future efforts” [192]. Interestingly, the
    smartphone is the first device that comes to mind when planning how to achieve
    this goal, especially considering the often dispersed and poorly serviced areas.
    Recent years have seen rapid expansion of research, with researchers conducting
    a growing number of studies and developing various models to highlight the scope
    of smartphone crop applications. These researchers mostly belong to developing
    nations, as proposed systems are based primarily in countries like Kenya [193],
    [194], Ghana [195], [196], Nigeria [197], [198], Mali [199], Uganda [200], and
    Zimbabwe [201], [202]. Although, the scope of smartphone utilization in agriculture
    has been more commonly observed in Africa, experiments in countries like Cameroon
    [203], China [204], [205], Turkey [206], [207], and India [208], [209] are also
    increasing. Analysing the success of m-services depends on many factors. One of
    the most comprehensive studies regarding the use of mobile phones for various
    agriculture applications was conducted to review all the important factors [210].
    This study concludes that the service will be of no effect if the developer of
    the application does not truly understand the farmer needs. Obviously, the most
    important factor for such applications is that the farmer should access and use
    them. In other words, an easy-to-use, free or low-cost app that supports various
    languages could attract the farmer’s attention. In addition, developers should
    study and consider the relevant factors before making their suggestions. For example,
    market prices are of great interest to farmers, but would be of no use in cases
    of bad roads and unavailability of proper transport vehicles. The developers should
    target the problems of the wider community instead of focusing only on farmers,
    considering the transporters, brokers, and other agriculture experts as well.
    Unfortunately, most of the applications are developed on growers’ perceptions,
    instead of using independent and verified market data. For this purpose, the developer
    should not only focus on the data retrieved by independent investigators but also
    assess it under various usage patterns covering longer durations. Table 3 lists
    smartphone based sensors that are attracting the researchers to utilize them for
    various agriculture purposes. While, last column provide some of the references
    where these sensors have been used. Further, Table 4 includes some of the important
    mobile apps developed for various agriculture applications along their features
    and achievements. TABLE 3 Smartphone Based Sensors That Being Used in Various
    Agriculture Applications TABLE 4 Selected Important Smartphone Applications for
    Various Agriculture Applications F. Cloud Computing Precision agriculture is showing
    its potential and benefits by improving agricultural operations through better
    data-driven decision making. However, to continue this success, precision agriculture
    not only requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently but
    also at a reasonable cost such that the received data can be used to make field
    decisions efficiently. For this purpose, farmers can use Cloud services to access
    information from predictive analysis institutes so that they can choose the right
    product available according to their specific requirements. Cloud computing offers
    an edge to farmers to use knowledge-based repositories that contain a treasure
    of information and experiences related to farming practices as well as on equipment
    options available in the market with the necessary details. In most cases, all
    this comes along with expert advice from a wide range of sources (for example,
    on farming and the processing of agricultural products). To make it more effective,
    the scenario can be extended further to include access to consumer databases,
    supply chains, and billing systems. Surely, moving towards Cloud-based services
    offer opportunities to explore advancements, but it comes with new challenges,
    as well. First, a vast range of sensors are being developed and used in precision
    agriculture, each of which has its own data format and semantics. Secondly, most
    of the decision-support systems are application-specific while, on the other hand,
    a farmer can be in the need of accessing various systems for a specific application,
    e.g., soil monitoring. Considering both of these cases, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system not only needs to handle the diversity of data and their formats but also
    must be able to configure these formats for different applications. An open Cloud-based
    system has been established by AgJunction [243] which gathers and disseminates
    the data on a form from different precise agriculture controllers, leading to
    a decrease in costs and environmental impacts. Furthermore, “Akisai” Cloud [244],
    proposed by Fujitsu, focuses on food and agricultural industries and incorporates
    information communication technology for increasing the food supply in the coming
    years. Similarly, SourceTrace developed and offering Cloud-based mobile applications
    to provide visibility and relations between farms and markets, further tracking
    the value chain at the source, e.g., ’eService Everywhere’ [245]. An important
    note about their applications is that, during the development, they considered
    the farms’ remoteness and low bandwidth environments. Figure 9 presents possible
    infrastructure and relationship scenario of fluid computing including Edge, Mist
    and Fog for smart agriculture. FIGURE 9. Fluid computing infrastructure for smart
    farming. Show All SECTION V. UAVs in Agriculture Recently, the IoT has made remarkable
    progress in many industries, including farming sectors like poultry, fishing,
    etc. but when we talk about agriculture, the communication facilities like base
    stations or Wi-Fi are very limited, which prevents the growth of the IoT in this
    sector. Such communication infrastructure and related facilities are even worst
    in developing counties and rural areas, which is one of the major hurdles when
    introducing the IoT in the agriculture industry. The data acquired through the
    wireless sensors cannot be transmitted in the absence of reliable communication
    infrastructure. In such a scenario, UAVs offer an alternative, as they visit and
    communicate with the wireless sensors spread over large areas in order to harvest
    data for further processing and analysis. Furthermore, UAVs, better known as drones,
    fitted with high-resolution cameras and precise sensors, can be flown over thousands
    of hectares of farms. The role of surveillance in all agriculture applications
    is highly critical, especially in forestry and crop monitoring due to the need
    to cover large areas [246]. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, real-time, and large-scale
    surveillance supported with an accurate data acquisition and transmission facility
    is crucial for agriculture production. Currently, mostly two options are used
    to obtain aerial images of a field area: satellite and airplanes. Both of them
    are good for a macro view of a landscape, but they face serious issues in terms
    of quality when it comes to micro views. These macro-view images are not good
    in resolution and cannot offer the image quality which is required during the
    analyses and decision making. Secondly, not only the resolution but visiting frequency
    also matters and, through both of these, it is not simple to take and collect
    images frequently (on average, four times a month [247]). Another serous issue
    is that these operate above the cloud level where there is a strong possibility
    that both are obstructed in bad weather. When we talk about UAVs that provide
    an “eye in sky”, we can overcome— or even eliminate— the above mentioned issues
    when we consider the micro views. The quality of images taken through UAVs depends
    on the attached camera’s resolution—normally dozens of times better than satellite
    images—and, most importantly, we can adjust according to application requirements.
    More specifically, UAVs supports faster and better NDVI to assess crop conditions,
    like weed mapping, leaf assessments, etc., and provide immediate feedback so that
    farmers can take timely actions. Similarly, UAVs are better in terms of frequency,
    even if requires multiple times in a single day, and are also the option least
    affected by weather conditions, unless it is raining. Due to the mentioned advantages,
    UAVs are considered the future of precision agriculture, and this is the reason
    they are generating the highest revenue amongst all agricultural robots developed
    for precision agriculture. According to quoted figures by a report published by
    FAO in 2018, it is estimated that the agriculture drone-related market to be worth
    USD 32.4 billion [248]. The current condition of the entire field is one of the
    most valuable pieces of information to obtain in the precision program. With the
    help of this collected data, a farmer can spot problems early and rapidly; hence,
    appropriate interventions can be applied. Agricultural drones represent a new
    way to collect field-level data; the results are on-demand whenever and wherever
    needed, as the drone can be easily and quickly deployed. Most importantly, it
    is not all about their hardware but the convenience, quality, and utility they
    are offering, as the drone-enabled surveillance offers the real facility to have
    an idea of what is happening in the farm fields at that moment. The UAVs, used
    for agricultural applications usually fall into two categories: fixed-wing and
    multi-rotor drones [249] (figure 10). Although both are available in various ranges
    in terms of cost, payload capacity and mostly distinguished based on hardware
    differences. For example, when it is required to cover a large area, fixed-wing
    drones are suggested due to their long-range flight capacity, most importantly
    they are crash tolerant e.g senseFly’s eBee SQ [250] and DATAhawk [251]. On the
    other hand, multi-rotor drones are more common due to their easy and faster set
    up as can take off and land vertically. Multi-rotors actually have many advantages
    over the fixed wings as they are easier to operate, require no advance wind planning
    and have the ability to fly more precisely. Moreover, in scenarios where low altitude
    flight is required in order to capture extremely detailed images, which is more
    common in agriculture applications then the multi-rotor are considered the better
    choice, some major examples belongs to this type are DJI Matrice 200 [252] and
    Introducing Scout by American Robotics [253] which considered a fully autonomous
    drone for daily agriculture scouting. FIGURE 10. Types of agricultural drones.
    Show All Generally, drones collect information through the light reflected by
    the ground it is maneuvering, over, either from soil or plants. For agricultural
    applications, specific cameras and sensors are used, depending on the grower’s
    interest—most commonly mentioned are thermal and hyper-spectral. Thermal sensors
    can help to recognize the water quantity, as leaves of plants with more water
    access appear cooler in an image. The same phenomenon is used in near-infrared
    (NIR) sensors; commonly used to note the difference between the NIR reflectance
    and the visible reflectance, such as NDVI [254]. The resultant NDVI-based images
    help to distinguish the water stress areas, as shown in figure 11. Hyper-spectral
    based sensors or cameras record the wavelengths of both visible and invisible
    lights, are able to identify the specific type of plant by measuring the color
    of reflected light. This reflected light is used to distinguish various plant
    types, ultimately helping to detect the unwanted herbicide and weeds [255]. The
    idea is used in [256], where authors used the multispectral images to classify
    various weeds. FIGURE 11. NDVI based water stress map of 160 acre walnut orchard
    [258]. Show All Due to their nature and flexibility, UAVs are being used in a
    range of agricultural applications, including crop health monitoring, planting,
    plant counting, spraying, agriculture photography, and many other variable rate
    applications. After being equipped with automation and GPS capabilities, they
    are ready to take the agriculture sector to a further-modernized level. With every
    passing day, drones are becoming more inexpensive and reliable, hence, making
    themselves an ideal choice for new farming applications. Focusing on the success
    of this technology, SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products), one of the largest
    vendors of enterprise resource planning, has brought three of its major technologies
    together in order to make the information harvested through UAVs more effective
    [257]. The technologies include the HANA, a Cloud database which supports speedy
    data capture, retrieval, and analytics; the Leonardo IoT suite to connect and
    exchange information over any protocol; and the Connected Agriculture suite to
    provide a GUI-based, graphical-use interface to the farmers. While it depends
    on the situation, in most cases, few hours delays doesn’t leave serious impact
    in most of the agriculture applications but flight time is more important as need
    to cover larger areas due field vastness. Not only vastness, but in some applications
    of pesticide and fertilizer, UAVs need to carry heavy payloads. In such situations,
    optimum battery utilization becomes crucial to extend the flight time. For this
    purpose, many factors can be considered to increase the drone efficiency. Firstly,
    when flying, choose right conditions e.g. weather or air direction. Next, try
    to include optimum payload and place it appropriately. For this situation, it
    can be helpful to attach the payload near the field, better in smaller quantities
    and the refilling again instead of putting heavy quantities. Further, depending
    on area size and visiting frequency, optimum path selection plays a critical role.
    For this purpose, many routing schemes like [259], [260] are proposed especially
    for the UAVs so choosing and implementing the right scheme can provide clear difference.
    Considering the application of pesticide and UAV based irrigation where drone
    need to fly with heavy payloads then new procedures like tethering system can
    be helpful. In UAV tethering, a connection that provide power through the long
    cable, is provided so that it can fly as long as you have power backup on the
    ground, most importantly it doesn’t require to lift heavy batteries. Currently,
    agriculture is being considered one of the most favorable fields where UAVs can
    offer solutions to resolve many dominant and long-lasting issues. Some of key
    areas in which drones are already playing key roles to assist farmers throughout
    the crop cycle are highlighted below. A. Soil and Field Analysis Drones are able
    to produce precise information to analyze the soil before sowing the crop, which
    helps to determine the most suitable crop for specific land; furthermore, it suggests
    the seed type and its planting patterns. In [261] authors shared their experimental
    results using Sirius I, a fixed-wing aircraft, affixed with a Lumix GF1 digital
    camera by Panasonic to capture images from different sites to monitor the soil
    erosion issues in Morocco. Similarly, authors in [262] targeted the issues of
    soil analyses where they used Lumix DMC-LX 3 to take the images and Pix4UAV for
    mapping the results. B. Planting Millions of acres of land are currently under-utilized
    due to being human inaccessible or lack of suitable workers. Safety concerns of
    rough terrain are main reason not to utilize these areas for forestry or agriculture
    purpose. For this purpose, drone based planting systems are being developed that
    decrease planting costs upto 85 percent [263]. Not only cost, but within shorter
    time as some recently developed drones can plant 100,000 trees in a single day
    [264]. These systems shoot pods which include the seeds and necessary nutrients
    required to grow the plant. This method is found very effective for rough terrain;
    most importantly the success rate is more than 75% [265]. Due to the success and
    flexibility they offer, UAVs are being considered the best candidate for plantation
    all over the world, from NASA engineer [266] to countries like Pakistan [267]
    and India [268]. C. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is one of tough jobs and facing
    low efficiency due to covering large area. Drones are offering the solutions by
    allowing real-time monitoring of far farms, more accurately and cost-effectively
    comparing with previously used satellite imagery. The Microdrones +m [269] is
    an accessory toolkit which provides aerial imaging facility to observe the crop
    nutrients, moisture levels and monitoring of other necessary parameters. A study
    conducted in [270] where authors used UAVs along digital camera to monitor the
    crop conditions. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between
    the crop spectral characteristics and effect of fertilizer availability for plant
    health. Further, [271] presents an innovative procedure to compute and map the
    3-dimensional geometric characteristics of trees and tree-rows. The generated
    maps can be helpful to understand the relation between the trees’ growth and field
    related factors like its geometry and nutrients ultimately help to optimize the
    crop management operations. D. Irrigation Use of drones for irrigation applications
    is, again, two-fold. On one side, equipping UAVs with a variety of sensors and
    cameras can help to identify areas that are under water stress and conclude what
    irrigation changes are required. At the same time, they can be used for sprinkling
    water and pesticides on the crops precisely, especially in emergency cases, which
    would save both time and wastage. In [272], multispectral images of citrus crops
    were acquired using the fixed-wing UAV, where the retrieved data was used to assess
    and detect structural and physiological changes in the targeted crop. Further,
    [273], [274] are similar efforts in which UAVs were used to estimate the crop
    water stress. Furthermore, UAVs are not only used to analyze the irrigation properties
    but also provide solutions by sprinkling water precisely over the water stress
    areas as in [275]. Due to this application of UAVs, they are being considered
    the newest water-saving tool, while their use is helping not only to increase
    watering efficiency but also detect possible pooling or leaks in irrigation. Examples
    like ’JT20L-606’ [276] and ’AGRASMG-1’ [277] are specialized drones that were
    developed and are being used for this purpose. E. Plant Counting and Gap Detection
    Precision agriculture critically needs the spatial data on crop density when making
    decisions during various applications. The quantity and plant numbering not only
    reflects the field emergence but allows better and more precise assessment of
    the yield production, in fact, determining the crop fate. Again, UAVs are offering
    flexible solutions for this purpose. In [278], authors performed digital counting
    of Maize plants with the help of UAVs. Further, in [279], authors proposed a method
    in which they used UAVs to estimate the density of wheat plants at the emergence
    stage while a Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera was used to take the images. F. Spraying
    the Pesticides/Herbicides Similar to irrigation, UAVs can be used to spray herbicides/
    pesticides on crops, but their use for these applications is more critical. Spraying
    application would be highly efficient compared to current procedures; herbicides/pesticides
    are usually sprayed over the entire farm, which is not required in most cases.
    If using an UAV to spray herbicide, it can spray directly on the unwanted weeds
    or can target the affected areas only. Furthermore, as spraying using drones would
    be highly targeted, the drone would figure out and spray as per requirements,
    helping to reduce the overall expenditures. Handling the sudden environment changes
    like wind direction or speed is another issue for an UAV especially when being
    used for spraying applications. For this purpose, [280] proposed a computer based
    system that autonomously adopt the UAV control rules to keep precise pesticide
    deposition. G. Health Assessment Scanning crops with visible and Infrared (IR)
    light sensors fitted on drones can identify which plants may be infected by bacteria
    or fungus. Using UAVs, this can be done frequently and with flexibility. The early
    detection of any such issues helps to prevent the disease being spread to other
    plants or crop areas. Multispectral images can help to detect the disease or sickness
    at early stages even before reaching the level in which it is possible to detect
    with the human eye. Experiments done in [280] present the data collection campaign
    performed over a sorghum crop which was severely damaged by white grubs. Further,
    in [281], UAVs are used to collect data from ground-based sensors, including a
    chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer, and the collected
    information was used to evaluate the plant health and crop condition, ultimately
    reflecting the ground truth. H. Detection/Recognition of Plant Species Recently,
    UAVs are being started to detect and recognize the plant species, especially those
    are considered extinct or remains only few on our Earth. An UAV is a best candidate
    to perform this task as it can go in very remote locations those are almost inaccessible
    to humans. As National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) stated that, Hibiscadelphus
    woodi, a Hawaiian flower, which thought to be extinct in 2009, is discovered on
    a vertical cliff face using the drone [282]. Similarly, using the special cameras
    that can detect the forest biomass and fuel, forest fuel estimation is possible
    through UAVs which is mostly being done from radars and satellites [283], [284].
    SECTION VI. Food Safety and Transportation With the increasing population, we
    have to feed around 25% more mouths until 2050, as compared to 2010, which appears
    to be a monumental task when considering the vast hunger issues that the world
    is currently facing. The numbers are shocking, as more than one-quarter of the
    planet’s population suffers from malnutrition [285] and nearly one billion people
    are chronically hungry [286]. Considering this current hunger scenario, it could
    be big ask to feed the new billions of mouths in the future. In order to handle
    the situation, some believe the solution lies simply in growing more food. This
    has also been reinforced by a latest research, published in the journal Bioscience,
    which concludes that from the present time until 2050, the rise in total food
    production should be in the bracket of 25–70%. [287]. However, what if someone
    tells you that there’s already enough food currently grown on farms to feed 10
    billion people? [288]. Yes, the good news is that we are already producing enough
    food for that many people; however, it is a crucial matter to figure out that
    how to distribute this food while maintaining its quality. Considering this fact,
    one can say that increasing the food production is also important, but transporting
    the existing available food safely and efficiently to more people is the real
    subject of issue of the food industry [289]. A comprehensive report regarding
    the future food requirements published by World Resources Institutes (WRI) in
    2018, highlights that we need sustainable food industry to feed 10 billion people
    by 2050. The report suggests a five-course menu of solutions to tackle the future
    food issues where “reduction in food losses and waste” is declared as the first
    and most important course [290]. Further it conclude that, reducing the food loss
    and waste only by 25% can help to reduce the food gap by 12%, the land gap by
    27% and greenhouse gas mitigation gap by 15%. To have better idea, detailed figures
    about the food loss are highlighted in figure 12 based on various geographical
    locations and considering the stages along food supply chain where these losses
    are occurring. FIGURE 12. Food losses occurring along food supply chain [290].
    Show All Other than WRI, the figures released by United Nations’ FAO are also
    shocking as it is estimated that one-third of all the global food produced for
    human use, valued at $1 trillion, is lost or wasted each year [291]. The US food
    waste alone represents 1.3% of its total GDP [292]. Based on these scary figures,
    it can be concluded that food waste is massive market inefficiency—the kind of
    which does not persist in other industries [293]. Although, the loss of $1 trillion
    has its own worth, but, more crucially, environmental implications of these losses
    are real, such as the water wasted to produce the food that is never eaten being
    equal to the water that can fulfill the needs of all of Africa [285]. Furthermore
    the CO2 emissions that resulted during the growing process of this food are equivalent
    to removing every car off the road across the world [290]. Moreover, according
    to another study conducted by FAO, if you consider food waste as a source of greenhouse
    gas emissions, it would be the third biggest emitter in the world behind only
    China and the United States [294]. In addition, when food waste goes to the landfill,
    where it mostly ends up, it decomposes in the absence of oxygen and produces methane,
    which is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of negative effects.
    In short, every which way you look at it; food waste is a major culprit in destroying
    our planet. Among all perishable food produced in the world today, only 10% is
    preserved properly [295]. When we talk about most of the developed countries,
    a robust food cold chain is maintained where essential quality checks are followed,
    entailing temperature-regulated refrigerated warehouses to refrigerated trucks
    to ensure that food gets from farm to market safely. On the other hand, many developing
    countries lack such proper cold chain infrastructure, simply resulting the majority
    of food spoiling when being transported to the end-user. Considering this fact,
    there is a huge opportunity to cut food waste and improve food distribution by
    simply implementing a controlled-temperature transportation system. Based on the
    facts, one can conclude that increasing food production is not sufficient to achieve
    food security, but, rather, some practical actions are required to find skillful
    ways for efficient distribution of the already available food. There are different
    ways to monitor and control food temperature. The manual method of checking a
    thermometer and recording the temperature has many drawbacks, where someone must
    actually do it and, most importantly, take the readings correctly. On other side,
    implementing an automatic method that uses wireless sensors to electronically
    measure and record temperatures can substantially improve food safety. This method
    allows for a continuous data stream of temperatures simply—24 hours a day, 7 days
    a week. By doing so, temperatures can be recorded consistently and on time, leaving
    little room for interpretation; in short, the entire process is based on facts
    and nothing more. Further, utilizing the recent technologies, the recorded data
    can be stored in the Cloud and accessed via any type of internet-connected device.
    Notifications can be established that will send real-time alerts if the temperature
    strays outside preset limits, allowing for immediate action to remedy the situation.
    Further, IoT offers predictive maintenance and indicate when the monitoring equipment
    itself is going to end its useful life so it can be replaced before it fails and
    compromises product quality. These are only couple of scenarios, now if we consider
    the figures presented in figure 12, IoT has the potential to monitor and keep
    the food quality at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption.
    A research study conducted by Indian School of Business in which students worked
    with a local grower to transport fruits and vegetables in refrigerated trucks
    from Punjab to Bangalore, a distance of more than 2,500 km through rough roads
    under high temperatures. The results were highly encouraging to implement the
    cold chain to transport the agriculture products. The out of conducted study brought
    benefits in three ways: (1) increased food shelf-life from one week to two months;
    (2) an up to 23% higher profit for everyone linked in the supply chain was observed;
    (3) a 76% reduction of food wastage (post-harvest). Besides all this, another
    critical factor is the emission of greenhouse gases was observed to be reduced
    by 16% [296]. To provide the recommended environment, a device with supported
    technology can be installed at the storage site, even in transport trucks. Further,
    it is linked to an online dashboard that can be configured to send alerts in the
    event of abnormal temperature levels to trigger swift remedial action. Some of
    key technologies available for this purpose and their use cases are mentioned
    here. A. Compliancemate Compliance with hazard analysis and critical control points
    (HACCP) offers a food safety and quality monitoring program which collects temperature
    data inside coolers and other kitchen equipment continuously. For example, its
    integration with Touchblock is used to capture temperatures in coolers and prep
    rooms at every minute [297]. B. Laird’s Sentrius A battery-powered and long-range
    integrated sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. It provides LoRaWAN options at 868/915 MHz, based
    on the Semtech SX1272 and Nordic nRF51 silicon. Further, it offers high RF performance
    in a precise temperature and humidity. Two major series, including RS1xx and RG1xx
    (multi-wireless gateways), work together in order to provide Cloud-based services.
    Most importantly, it requires an inexpensive endpoint radio and a more sophisticated
    base station to manage the network. As compared to LoRa, Sigfox communication
    tends to be better if it is headed up from the endpoint to the base station. Although
    it supports the bidirectional functionality, its capacity going from the base
    station back to the endpoint is constrained, as it provides less link width going
    down than going up. C. CCP Smart Tag (RC4) CCP claims to be a complete monitoring
    solution for the food service and food retail industry [298]. It is capable to
    automate the temperature environment which meets the food safety regulations suggested
    for various food items. Further, temperature and other data are interpreted and
    viewed on a service provider Cloud platform via web and mobile applications. D.
    Tempreporter In compliance with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points),
    it is used to monitor temperatures 24/7. Further, it logs the readings automatically.
    Reports are auto-filled by considering HACCP & HPRA (Health Products Regulatory
    Authority) recommendations regarding temperature monitoring. According to Finistere
    Ventures report, as of 2018, around $2 billion has been invested globally in AgTech.
    Several investments are expected to cross these figures in 2019. Considering the
    future needs of IoT in agriculture applications, almost all leading technological
    giants are supporting this progress in their own way. Table 5 provides a list
    of several of the leading global organizations who have proposed and are proposing
    initiatives in AgTech, especially in regard to IoT-based agriculture solutions.
    TABLE 5 Current Status and Future Vision of Major Technological Giants Regarding
    the IoT in Agriculture Industry SECTION VII. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
    According to a plan announced in 2015 under “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
    the UN and international community set a target to end hunger by 2030. However,
    recent figures released by WHO (World Health Organization) do not look encouraging
    enough to support the agenda, as more than 800 million people worldwide are facing
    the food shortage—one out of every nine people [313]. Although these figures are
    quite alarming on their own, what is more shocking is the quality of food. Other
    than availability, the quality of food is becoming another serious issue and even
    more critical. According to a research supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
    published in “The Lancet”, either shortage or poor diets are diverting 11 million
    people to an early grave annually, making it more deadly than smoking [314]. The
    research, which reflects the effect of poor diet on health, was conducted in 195
    countries from 1990 to 2017 and concluded that one out of five deaths per year
    could be prevented by providing better diet. The report summarizes that, globally,
    a diet lower in whole grains was the most common and leading risk factor for deaths.
    Other than the basic food needs, per capita incomes of most of the countries in
    2050 are expected to be a multiple as compared to today’s levels [315]. Such an
    increase in income will result in a more health-conscious population that expects
    quality food that is rich in fiber and other minerals. Trends, like increased
    population where the world needs to feed one third more mouths with increased
    demand of quality food, show that food demands continue to grow rapidly. In response
    to all this, overall crop production needs to increase not only for food but cash-crops
    are also required to grow in order to fulfill the demands of industry, like cotton
    and rubber, and, most importantly, increasing demands for bioenergy like ethanol.
    Figure 13 presents a snapshot of major challenges that future agriculture expected
    to face in 2050. This diagram, basically presents three major issues: how to feed
    around 10 billion people; without using more land and; by reducing the emission
    of greenhouse gasses by more than 60%. However, when we look closely then these
    three challenges lead to many new, including smaller rural labor, continuously
    shrinking arable land, water scarcity, harsh weather conditions, and many more.
    As the world moves toward urbanization, the rural populations are not only shrinking
    but are rapidly aging; hence, fewer and younger growers need to step up to take
    the responsibility. Such population imbalance and generation shift can create
    serious implications, not only for the remaining workforce but also for production
    patterns and land tenure. Furthermore, on one side, arable land is shrinking while,
    among the remaining regions, many are only suitable for specific crops due to
    certain geographic and environmental limitations. Moreover, harsh climate changes
    are starting to affect almost every aspect of crop production. These changes are
    expected to enhance the intensity of many of the existing long-term environmental
    issues, like droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, soil degradation, etc. FIGURE
    13. Major challenges for sustainable future agriculture. Show All During the 20th
    century, in most regions, growers kept following the traditional agricultural
    methods while trying to meet the food demands by greater utilizing fertilizers
    and pesticides. Implementation of such chemicals is facing two issues: these can
    help to increase the production to only a certain level and, at the same time,
    their blind use is creating irreversible implications to the environment. Furthermore,
    implementation of any resource, like water, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    uniformly across an entire field is not going to solve the problem. Rather than
    dealing with every farm and crop in same way, farmers need to use these resources
    according to the requirement of specific areas, even if they have to consider
    the requirement of every plant. Focusing on the above discussion, one can feel
    that the farms and relevant crop operations need to be run differently than the
    past practices. One of the major reasons is the advancements in technology, including
    sensors, communication methods, machines, and even robots. In fact, technology
    has proved this already, as, in most developing countries; more than 50% of the
    population is somehow engaged in the agriculture industry yet are far behind in
    providing both the quantity and quality when compared with the developed countries,
    where less than 2% of the population is performing much better. The difference
    is clear, as countries like Australia, the US, and most of Europe are pioneers
    to employ the advanced tools and methods multiplying the crop yields during the
    last five decades. These comparisons show that recent technologies and advanced
    methods are making the farms not only highly profitable but safe and environmentally
    friendly. Considering this scenario, future agriculture is expected to evolve
    as a high-tech industry where interconnected systems will enjoy the luxury of
    artificial intelligence and Big Data facilities. The resultant systems will converge
    into a single unit where farm machinery and management, starting from seeding
    to production forecasting, are combined. By involving the advanced technologies
    like agricultural robots, Big Data, and cloud-computing artificial intelligence,
    agriculture can create a new era of superfusion. Following are some of the key
    technologies and methods that need to apply; focusing to achieve sustainable future
    agriculture. A. Wireless Sensors and the IoT Wireless sensors placed strategically
    around fields are providing farmers with up-to-date information in real time,
    allowing them to adapt the care that the crops need, which results in higher food
    production with less waste. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are also being used
    to inform farmers about nearly all aspects of their crop growth as well as about
    the readiness state of the farm’s machinery, thus, helping in preventing loss
    of crop as well as enhancing the readiness of the equipment which cultivates it.
    WSNs with GPS capability are helping tractors in compensating for uneven terrain
    and optimizing land preparation for growing crops. Recently, advances in image
    recognition and digital signal processing gave even more capabilities to WSN to
    accurately determine crop quality and health. In order to make agriculture sustainable,
    the use of the IoT will be at the center and forefront in agricultural operations.
    This includes everything from water and power usage, crop transportation, farm
    machinery operation and maintenance alerts, and market price updates. The IoT
    has the capability to make these tasks streamlined and more predictable by recognizing
    the crop’s needs at every stage. It has already proved a breakthrough and is further
    going to change the way we look at various agriculture activities by providing
    the farmer control over their land and assets in an unprecedented way, thus, maximizing
    their effectiveness and efficiency. Further, the future of the IoT can be shaped
    by the phenomenal advances in WSNs and the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile
    communication technologies to provide farmers with real-time data and information
    anytime and everywhere their land is. Based on recent success, it is estimated
    that more than 75 million IoT-based devices will be operating in the agriculture
    industry by 2020. Further, the average farm is expecting to generate 4.1 million
    data points on a daily bases by 2050 [316]. B. Communication Real success of IoT
    in agriculture largely depends on advances in connectivity. From telecom’s perspective,
    providing mainly connectivity and other value-added services has an immense potential
    and can influence the entire chain greatly [317]. Most of the telecom operators
    around the globe offer connectivity services, but such services only represent
    a tiny amount of the entire smart agriculture market. Considering its worth, especially
    in rural areas, the cellular operators have to offer a new range of services targeting
    the growers’ demands. Accepting the fact that most of the community belong to
    this industry are not highly educated and mostly unaware of new technologies,
    hence the operator should provide end-to-end solutions other than just providing
    the connectivity. If so, then it will certainly help to increase the market share
    of mobile and telecom operators. Further, these operators need partnerships with
    the investors to provide end-to-end solutions, which demands higher investment,
    even before advantages can be seen. The results of success when inviting the investors
    depend on the nature of the partnership and the involved bodies, like device manufacturers,
    solution providers, non-cellular connectivity service providers, system integrators,
    etc. On one side, the outcome of this partnership would help operators to enter
    deeper into the industry, ultimately boosting their market share. At the same
    time, this opportunity can create strong relationships among the organizations
    and farmers to help to educate them about the benefits of smart agriculture. The
    success of cellular technology is only possible when service providers leverage
    its real benefits like portability, flexibility and luxury of two way communication
    to offer low cost but customized solutions. They must provide what the farmer
    is in need, at the place they choose. Furthermore, to provide fast penetration
    in agriculture industry, policy changes are required in order to provide access
    of reliable and quality inputs. The research conducted in [172] which considers
    23 studies where mostly belong to developing countries, concludes that the cellular
    services and smartphone technology carry a promising future for smallholder farmers
    being capable to improve their yields. Furthermore, licensed LPWA (low-power wide-area)
    technology is expected to be a game changer for smart agriculture. Due to its
    characteristics and supported services including low power consumption and efficient
    coverage are well suited to the geography and economics of agriculture hence expected
    to play a critical role in future smart farming. Consequently, narrowband IoT
    (NB-IoT) got strong industry support and becoming an effective global standard
    for LPWA connectivity. It has the potential to provide major connectivity changes
    in agriculture industry by changing the perceptions about Internet capabilities.
    Believing in its future success, it is expected that leading cellular operators
    with strong IoT ambitions can generate significant revenues by providing smart
    agriculture services when collaborating with LPWA technology providers. In order
    to achieve long term success of these short, mid and long range communication
    technologies, necessary steps for infrastructure construction are required towards
    attaining the technology-based agriculture. C. UAVs and Other Robots Drones are
    being widely used by farmers for crop growth monitoring and as a means to combat
    hunger and other harmful environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are being used
    to spray water and other pesticides efficiently, considering the tough terrains,
    especially when the crops possess different heights. Drones have proven their
    value, not only in terms of spraying speed but precision, as well, when compared
    with traditional machinery of same purpose. With recent advances in swarm technology
    and mission-based control, groups of drones equipped with heterogeneous sensors,
    including 3D cameras, can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive
    capabilities to manage their land. With the inclusion of UAVs in agriculture,
    farmers are able to put their eye in sky, but many challenges need to be addressed
    in order to enjoy the real advantages of this technology, especially the integration
    of other technologies and how to use them in poor weather conditions. Beside drones,
    robotics within agriculture have improved productivity and resulted in higher
    and faster yields. Such robots, like spraying and weeding robots, are reducing
    agrochemical use. Robots equipped with laser and camera guidance are being used
    for identifying and removing weeds without human intervention. They navigate between
    rows of crops on their own, ultimately increasing the yield with reduced manpower.
    More recently, plant-transplanting and fruit-picking robots are emerging to add
    a new level of efficiency to traditional methods. D. Machine Learning and Analytics
    Machine learning and analytics are used to mine data for trends. In farming, machine
    learning is used, for example, to predict which genes are best suited for crop
    production. This has been giving growers all over the world the best seed varieties,
    those which are highly suitable to respective locations and climate conditions.
    Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, have indicated which products
    are of high demand and which products are currently unavailable in the market.
    Thus, for the farmer, this has given valuable clues for future farming. Recent
    advances in machine learning and analytics will make it possible for farmers to
    accurately classify their products and weed out less desirable crops before they
    arrive to customers. E. Power Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrids, and Smart
    Grids Despite its future opportunities, smart agriculture facing some limitations
    that are holding back the growth of IoT. One of them is power issue as due to
    its nature; smart farming requires wide use of energy. Among the main reasons
    of extensive power consumption some are including, long term sensor deployment,
    use of GPS repeatedly and transmission of sensed data via GPRS. Traditionally,
    farmers in remote areas have bought and utilized renewable energy sources randomly
    and at a hefty price, which has limited their ability to use them in farming to
    a great extent. However to solve the power issues in long term, deep analysis
    of power consumption sources like remote data transmission can help to tackle
    the problem at some extent. Further, smart grids and microgrids, however, lend
    themselves to seamless integration of distributed energy sources (DERs), thus,
    making them appealing for adoption by farmers. The emergence of smart power meters
    has further given the farmers the confidence to invest in DER, especially since
    they have the option to sell the excess power to the grid. Recent advances in
    energy storage devices, integrated electricity and heat systems will make DER
    even more attractive for farmers, as they will be able to store energy and use
    the heat generated by cooling and heating when needed. However, healthy investment
    requirements and public perceptions are two other barriers on the way to making
    these solutions successful. F. Hydroponics and Vertical Farming (VF) Other than
    employing the advanced technologies, new agricultural practices can be very crucial
    to overcome the geographic and resource limitation challenges. On one side, arable
    land is shrinking, and, at the same time, it is estimated that three million people
    around the globe are migrating to cities, resulting in more pressure on the existing
    limited urban resources [318]. Considering this rapid migration, it is estimated
    that by 2030, 60% of the world’s population is going to depend on cities, and
    this number is further expected to rise to 68% until 2050 [319]. Considering both
    of these issues, it could be disaster for food production in the near future with
    current agriculture practices. VF is an answer of these issues, as it meets the
    challenges of land and water shortage and, at the same time, looks highly suitable
    to be adopted near the cities. VF is portrayed as the answer to the looming shortage
    of food and shrinking arable land, at least in some areas of the world. Further,
    hydroponics can play a key role, as this method lowers the requirements of water
    and space to a great extent. Rapid growths in computer power are propelling scientific
    discoveries in plant nutrition and growth that would make VF even more appealing
    to growers. Along VF and hydroponics, new and advanced solutions are required
    to increase the arable land without disturbing the forests and other natural animal
    habitats. For this, we have to focus on the deserts as these cover one third of
    the Earth’s land surface. The solutions are started already as Norwegian and Chinese
    firms/experts are doing efforts in Dubai, Qatar, Jordan and Chinese deserts [320]–[322].
    Agriculture is not just an industry; in fact, it provides the basis of human society,
    as the goal is not just to grow crops, but the target is the perfection of human
    being. A vibrant and prosperous agriculture sector can provide the basis for a
    happy and healthy society, as recent decades witnessed this. The presence of advance
    technologies, especially the involvement of the IoT, matters a great deal in regard
    to reaching this goal. Environmental issues continue to cage the planet, which
    increases the need for safe and clean agriculture. This is the reason humanity
    is witnessing a second green revolution, largely based on the IoT. The use of
    these technologies makes the farming industry highly productive with reduced labor
    and other resource consumption; same time, minimizing the impact on the environment.
    Our planet has the resources, but we have to learn how to utilize them wisely
    and precisely. Sensible use of technology can lead us where we can utilize these
    resources efficiently in order to ensure the food security of the current and
    coming generations. For this purpose, we need collective efforts to build such
    institutions that can shape long-term decisions and polices to eliminate hunger
    effectively. On this route, the experience, tools, and support from those nations
    that have succeeded in overcoming hunger should provide to those regions that
    are fighting to feed its local mouths. Although growth in every industry matters,
    growth in agriculture, particularly among small growers, can be highly effective
    to control the undernourishment issues, as more than 70% of the population of
    developing countries belongs to rural areas and somehow depends on agriculture
    sector. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The focus on smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing methodologies is required in order to meet the growing food demand
    of the increasing world population in the face of the ever-shrinking arable land.
    The development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, one can readily
    see currently: technology-weaned, innovative younger people adopting farming as
    a profession, agriculture as a means for independence from fossil fuels, tracking
    the crop growth, safety and nutrition labeling, partnerships between growers,
    suppliers, and retailers and buyers. This paper considered all these aspects and
    highlighted the role of various technologies, especially IoT, in order to make
    the agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations. For this
    purpose, wireless sensors, UAVs, Cloud-computing, communication technologies are
    discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, a deeper insight on recent research efforts
    is provided. In addition, various IoT-based architectures and platforms are provided
    with respect to agriculture applications. A summary of current challenges facing
    the industry and future expectations are listed to provide guidance to researchers
    and engineers. Based on all this, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production. However, to deal with every inch accordingly,
    the use of sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication technologies is not
    optional—it is necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    \ which objects equipped with sensors, actuators, and processors\ncommunicate\
    \ with each other to serve a meaningful purpose. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art\
    \ methods, protocols, and\napplications in this new emerging area. This survey\
    \ paper proposes a novel taxonomy for IoT technologies, highlights some of\nthe\
    \ most important technologies, and profiles some applications that have the potential\
    \ to make a striking difference in human\nlife, especially for the differently\
    \ abled and the elderly. As compared to similar survey papers in the area, this\
    \ paper is far more\ncomprehensive in its coverage and exhaustively covers most\
    \ major technologies spanning from sensors to applications.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Today the Internet has become ubiquitous, has touched\nalmost every corner of\
    \ the globe, and is affecting human life in\nunimaginable ways. However, the journey\
    \ is far from over. We\nare now entering an era of even more pervasive connectivity\n\
    where a very wide variety of appliances will be connected to\nthe web. We are\
    \ entering an era of the “Internet of Things”\n(abbreviated as IoT). This term\
    \ has been defined by different\nauthors in many different ways. Let us look at\
    \ two of the most\npopular definitions. Vermesan et al. [1] define the Internet\n\
    of Things as simply an interaction between the physical and\ndigital worlds. The\
    \ digital world interacts with the physical\nworld using a plethora of sensors\
    \ and actuators. Another\ndefinition by Pe˜na-L´opez et al. [2] defines the Internet\
    \ of\nThings as a paradigm in which computing and networking\ncapabilities are\
    \ embedded in any kind of conceivable object.\nWe use these capabilities to query\
    \ the state of the object and to\nchange its state if possible. In common parlance,\
    \ the Internet\nof Things refers to a new kind of world where almost all\nthe\
    \ devices and appliances that we use are connected to a\nnetwork. We can use them\
    \ collaboratively to achieve complex\ntasks that require a high degree of intelligence.\n\
    For this intelligence and interconnection, IoT devices are\nequipped with embedded\
    \ sensors, actuators, processors, and\ntransceivers. IoT is not a single technology;\
    \ rather it is an\nagglomeration of various technologies that work together in\n\
    tandem.\nSensors and actuators are devices, which help in interact-\ning with\
    \ the physical environment. The data collected by the\nsensors has to be stored\
    \ and processed intelligently in order to\nderive useful inferences from it. Note\
    \ that we broadly define\nthe term sensor; a mobile phone or even a microwave\
    \ oven\ncan count as a sensor as long as it provides inputs about its\ncurrent\
    \ state (internal state + environment). An actuator is a\ndevice that is used\
    \ to effect a change in the environment such\nas the temperature controller of\
    \ an air conditioner.\nThe storage and processing of data can be done on the\n\
    edge of the network itself or in a remote server. If any prepro-\ncessing of data\
    \ is possible, then it is typically done at either\nthe sensor or some other proximate\
    \ device. The processed\ndata is then typically sent to a remote server. The storage\n\
    and processing capabilities of an IoT object are also restricted\nby the resources\
    \ available, which are often very constrained\ndue to limitations of size, energy,\
    \ power, and computational\ncapability. As a result the main research challenge\
    \ is to\nensure that we get the right kind of data at the desired level\nof accuracy.\
    \ Along with the challenges of data collection,\nand handling, there are challenges\
    \ in communication as\nwell. The communication between IoT devices is mainly\n\
    wireless because they are generally installed at geographically\ndispersed locations.\
    \ The wireless channels often have high\nHindawi\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ reliably\ncommunicating data without too many retransmissions is an\nimportant\
    \ problem and thus communication technologies\nare integral to the study of IoT\
    \ devices.\nNow, after processing the received data, some action\nneeds to be\
    \ taken on the basis of the derived inferences. The\nnature of actions can be\
    \ diverse. We can directly modify the\nphysical world through actuators. Or we\
    \ may do something\nvirtually. For example, we can send some information to other\n\
    smart things.\nThe process of effecting a change in the physical world\nis often\
    \ dependent on its state at that point of time. This\nis called context awareness.\
    \ Each action is taken keeping in\nconsideration the context because an application\
    \ can behave\ndifferently in different contexts. For example, a person may\nnot\
    \ like messages from his office to interrupt him when he is\non vacation.\nSensors,\
    \ actuators, compute servers, and the commu-\nnication network form the core infrastructure\
    \ of an IoT\nframework. However, there are many software aspects that\nneed to\
    \ be considered. First, we need a middleware that can\nbe used to connect and\
    \ manage all of these heterogeneous\ncomponents. We need a lot of standardization\
    \ to connect\nmany different devices. We shall discuss methods to exchange\ninformation\
    \ and prevailing standards in Section 7.\nThe Internet of Things finds various\
    \ applications in health\ncare, fitness, education, entertainment, social life,\
    \ energy\nconservation, environment monitoring, home automation,\nand transport\
    \ systems. We shall focus on these application\nareas in Section 9. We shall find\
    \ that, in all these application\nareas, IoT technologies have significantly been\
    \ able to reduce\nhuman effort and improve the quality of life.\n2. Architecture\
    \ of IoT\nThere is no single consensus on architecture for IoT, which\nis agreed\
    \ universally. Different architectures have been pro-\nposed by different researchers.\n\
    2.1. Three- and Five-Layer Architectures. The most basic\narchitecture is a three-layer\
    \ architecture [3–5] as shown in\nFigure 1. It was introduced in the early stages\
    \ of research in\nthis area. It has three layers, namely, the perception, network,\n\
    and application layers.\n(i) The perception layer is the physical layer, which\
    \ has\nsensors for sensing and gathering information about\nthe environment. It\
    \ senses some physical parameters\nor identifies other smart objects in the environment.\n\
    (ii) The network layer is responsible for connecting to\nother smart things, network\
    \ devices, and servers. Its\nfeatures are also used for transmitting and processing\n\
    sensor data.\n(iii) The application layer is responsible for delivering\napplication\
    \ specific services to the user. It defines\nvarious applications in which the\
    \ Internet of Things\ncan be deployed, for example, smart homes, smart\ncities,\
    \ and smart health.\nThe three-layer architecture defines the main idea of the\n\
    Internet of Things, but it is not sufficient for research on\nIoT because research\
    \ often focuses on finer aspects of the\nInternet of Things. That is why, we have\
    \ many more layered\narchitectures proposed in the literature. One is the five-\n\
    layer architecture, which additionally includes the processing\nand business layers\
    \ [3–6]. The five layers are perception,\ntransport, processing, application,\
    \ and business layers (see\nFigure 1). The role of the perception and application\
    \ layers\nis the same as the architecture with three layers. We outline\nthe function\
    \ of the remaining three layers.\n(i) The transport layer transfers the sensor\
    \ data from\nthe perception layer to the processing layer and vice\nversa through\
    \ networks such as wireless, 3G, LAN,\nBluetooth, RFID, and NFC.\n(ii) The processing\
    \ layer is also known as the middleware\nlayer. It stores, analyzes, and processes\
    \ huge amounts\nof data that comes from the transport layer. It can\nmanage and\
    \ provide a diverse set of services to the\nlower layers. It employs many technologies\
    \ such as\ndatabases, cloud computing, and big data processing\nmodules.\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n3\n(iii) The business layer manages\
    \ the whole IoT system,\nincluding applications, business and profit models,\n\
    and users’ privacy. The business layer is out of the\nscope of this paper. Hence,\
    \ we do not discuss it\nfurther.\nAnother architecture proposed by Ning and Wang\
    \ [7] is\ninspired by the layers of processing in the human brain. It\nis inspired\
    \ by the intelligence and ability of human beings\nto think, feel, remember, make\
    \ decisions, and react to the\nphysical environment. It is constituted of three\
    \ parts. First is\nthe human brain, which is analogous to the processing and\n\
    data management unit or the data center. Second is the spinal\ncord, which is\
    \ analogous to the distributed network of data\nprocessing nodes and smart gateways.\
    \ Third is the network\nof nerves, which corresponds to the networking components\n\
    and sensors.\n2.2. Cloud and Fog Based Architectures. Let us now discuss\ntwo\
    \ kinds of systems architectures: cloud and fog computing\n(see the reference\
    \ architectures in [8]). Note that this classifi-\ncation is different from the\
    \ classification in Section 2.1, which\nwas done on the basis of protocols.\n\
    In particular, we have been slightly vague about the nature\nof data generated\
    \ by IoT devices, and the nature of data\nprocessing. In some system architectures\
    \ the data processing\nis done in a large centralized fashion by cloud computers.\n\
    Such a cloud centric architecture keeps the cloud at the\ncenter, applications\
    \ above it, and the network of smart things\nbelow it [9]. Cloud computing is\
    \ given primacy because it\nprovides great flexibility and scalability. It offers\
    \ services such\nas the core infrastructure, platform, software, and storage.\n\
    Developers can provide their storage tools, software tools,\ndata mining, and\
    \ machine learning tools, and visualization\ntools through the cloud.\nLately,\
    \ there is a move towards another system archi-\ntecture, namely, fog computing\
    \ [10–12], where the sensors\nand network gateways do a part of the data processing\
    \ and\nanalytics. A fog architecture [13] presents a layered approach\nas shown\
    \ in Figure 2, which inserts monitoring, prepro-\ncessing, storage, and security\
    \ layers between the physical\nand transport layers. The monitoring layer monitors\
    \ power,\nresources, responses, and services. The preprocessing layer\nperforms\
    \ filtering, processing, and analytics of sensor data.\nThe temporary storage\
    \ layer provides storage functionalities\nsuch as data replication, distribution,\
    \ and storage. Finally, the\nsecurity layer performs encryption/decryption and\
    \ ensures\ndata integrity and privacy. Monitoring and preprocessing are\ndone\
    \ on the edge of the network before sending data to the\ncloud.\nOften the terms\
    \ “fog computing” and “edge computing”\nare used interchangeably. The latter term\
    \ predates the former\nand is construed to be more generic. Fog computing originally\n\
    termed by Cisco refers to smart gateways and smart sensors,\nwhereas edge computing\
    \ is slightly more penetrative in nature.\nThis paradigm envisions adding smart\
    \ data preprocessing\ncapabilities to physical devices such as motors, pumps,\
    \ or\nlights. The aim is to do as much of preprocessing of data\nas possible in\
    \ these devices, which are termed to be at the\nStorage layer \nPreprocessing\
    \ layer \nMonitoring layer \nPhysical layer\nSecurity layer\nTransport layer\n\
    Figure 2: Fog architecture of a smart IoT gateway.\nedge of the network. In terms\
    \ of the system architecture,\nthe architectural diagram is not appreciably different\
    \ from\nFigure 2. As a result, we do not describe edge computing\nseparately.\n\
    Finally, the distinction between protocol architectures\nand system architectures\
    \ is not very crisp. Often the protocols\nand the system are codesigned. We shall\
    \ use the generic 5-\nlayer IoT protocol stack (architectural diagram presented\
    \ in\nFigure 2) for both the fog and cloud architectures.\n2.3. Social IoT. Let\
    \ us now discuss a new paradigm: social IoT\n(SIoT). Here, we consider social\
    \ relationships between objects\nthe same way as humans form social relationships\
    \ (see [14]).\nHere are the three main facets of an SIoT system:\n(i) The SIoT\
    \ is navigable. We can start with one device\nand navigate through all the devices\
    \ that are con-\nnected to it. It is easy to discover new devices and\nservices\
    \ using such a social network of IoT devices.\n(ii) A need of trustworthiness\
    \ (strength of the relation-\nship) is present between devices (similar to friends\
    \ on\nFacebook).\n(iii) We can use models similar to studying human social\nnetworks\
    \ to also study the social networks of IoT\ndevices.\n2.3.1. Basic Components.\
    \ In a typical social IoT setting, we\ntreat the devices and services as bots\
    \ where they can set up\nrelationships between them and modify them over time.\
    \ This\nwill allow us to seamlessly let the devices cooperate among\neach other\
    \ and achieve a complex task.\nTo make such a model work, we need to have many\n\
    interoperating components. Let us look at some of the major\ncomponents in such\
    \ a system.\n(1) ID: we need a unique method of object identifica-\ntion. An ID\
    \ can be assigned to an object based on\ntraditional parameters such as the MAC\
    \ ID, IPv6\nID, a universal product code, or some other custom\nmethod.\n4\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(2) Metainformation: along with an ID,\
    \ we need some\nmetainformation about the device that describes its\nform and\
    \ operation. This is required to establish\nappropriate relationships with the\
    \ device and also\nappropriately place it in the universe of IoT devices.\n(3)\
    \ Security controls: this is similar to “friend list” set-\ntings on Facebook.\
    \ An owner of a device might place\nrestrictions on the kinds of devices that\
    \ can connect\nto it. These are typically referred to as owner controls.\n(4)\
    \ Service discovery: such kind of a system is like\na service cloud, where we\
    \ need to have dedicated\ndirectories that store details of devices providing\n\
    certain kinds of services. It becomes very important\nto keep these directories\
    \ up to date such that devices\ncan learn about other devices.\n(5) Relationship\
    \ management: this module manages rela-\ntionships with other devices. It also\
    \ stores the types\nof devices that a given device should try to connect\nwith\
    \ based on the type of services provided. For\nexample, it makes sense for a light\
    \ controller to make\na relationship with a light sensor.\n(6) Service composition:\
    \ this module takes the social IoT\nmodel to a new level. The ultimate goal of\
    \ having such\na system is to provide better integrated services to\nusers. For\
    \ example, if a person has a power sensor\nwith her air conditioner and this device\
    \ establishes\na relationship with an analytics engine, then it is\npossible for\
    \ the ensemble to yield a lot of data about\nthe usage patterns of the air conditioner.\
    \ If the social\nmodel is more expansive, and there are many more\ndevices, then\
    \ it is possible to compare the data with\nthe usage patterns of other users and\
    \ come up with\neven more meaningful data. For example, users can\nbe told that\
    \ they are the largest energy consumers in\ntheir community or among their Facebook\
    \ friends.\n2.3.2. Representative Architecture. Most architectures pro-\nposed\
    \ for the SIoT have a server side architecture as well.\nThe server connects to\
    \ all the interconnected components,\naggregates (composes) the services, and\
    \ acts as a single point\nof service for users.\nThe server side architecture\
    \ typically has three layers. The\nfirst is the base layer that contains a database\
    \ that stores details\nof all the devices, their attributes, metainformation,\
    \ and their\nrelationships. The second layer (Component layer) contains\ncode\
    \ to interact with the devices, query their status, and use\na subset of them\
    \ to effect a service. The topmost layer is the\napplication layer, which provides\
    \ services to the users.\nOn the device (object) side, we broadly have two layers.\n\
    The first is the object layer, which allows a device to connect to\nother devices,\
    \ talk to them (via standardized protocols), and\nexchange information. The object\
    \ layer passes information to\nthe social layer. The social layer manages the\
    \ execution of\nusers’ applications, executes queries, and interacts with the\n\
    application layer on the server.\n3. Taxonomy\nLet us now propose taxonomy for\
    \ research in IoT tech-\nnologies (see Figure 3). Our taxonomy is based on the\n\
    architectural elements of IoT as presented in Section 2.\nThe first architectural\
    \ component of IoT is the perception\nlayer. It collects data using sensors, which\
    \ are the most\nimportant drivers of the Internet of Things [15]. There are\n\
    various types of sensors used in diverse IoT applications.\nThe most generic sensor\
    \ available today is the smartphone.\nThe smartphone itself has many types of\
    \ sensors embedded\nin it [16] such as the location sensor (GPS), movement\nsensors\
    \ (accelerometer, gyroscope), camera, light sensor,\nmicrophone, proximity sensor,\
    \ and magnetometer. These are\nbeing heavily used in different IoT applications.\
    \ Many other\ntypes of sensors are beginning to be used such as sensors for\n\
    measuring temperature, pressure, humidity, medical param-\neters of the body,\
    \ chemical and biochemical substances, and\nneural signals. A class of sensors\
    \ that stand out is infrared\nsensors that predate smartphones. They are now being\
    \ used\nwidely in many IoT applications: IR cameras, motion detec-\ntors, measuring\
    \ the distance to nearby objects, presence of\nsmoke and gases, and as moisture\
    \ sensors. We shall discuss\nthe different types of sensors used in IoT applications\
    \ in\nSection 5.\nSubsequently, we shall discuss related work in data pre-\nprocessing.\
    \ Such applications (also known as fog comput-\ning applications) mainly filter\
    \ and summarize data before\nsending it on the network. Such units typically have\
    \ a little\namount of temporary storage, a small processing unit, and\nsome security\
    \ features.\nThe next architectural component that we shall discuss\nis communication.\
    \ We shall discuss related work (in Sec-\ntion 7) on different communication technologies\
    \ used for\nthe Internet of Things. Different entities communicate over\nthe network\
    \ [17–19] using a diverse set of protocols and\nstandards. The most common communication\
    \ technologies\nfor short range low power communication protocols are\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identification) and NFC (Near Field\nCommunication). For the medium\
    \ range, they are Bluetooth,\nZigbee, and WiFi. Communication in the IoT world\
    \ requires\nspecial networking protocols and mechanisms. Therefore,\nnew mechanisms\
    \ and protocols have been proposed and\nimplemented for each layer of the networking\
    \ stack, accord-\ning to the requirements imposed by IoT devices.\nWe shall subsequently\
    \ look at two kinds of software com-\nponents: middleware and applications. The\
    \ middleware cre-\nates an abstraction for the programmer such that the details\n\
    of the hardware can be hidden. This enhances interoperability\nof smart things\
    \ and makes it easy to offer different kinds of\nservices [20]. There are many\
    \ commercial and open source\nofferings for providing middleware services to IoT\
    \ devices.\nSome examples are OpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], Hydra\n[23], FiWare\
    \ [24], and Oracle Fusion Middleware. Finally, we\ndiscuss the applications of\
    \ IoT in Section 9. We primarily\nfocus on home automation, ambient assisted living,\
    \ health\nand fitness, smart vehicular systems, smart cities, smart\nenvironments,\
    \ smart grids, social life, and entertainment.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of research in IoT technologies.\n4. Related Survey Papers\nOur taxonomy describes\
    \ the technologies in the IoT domain\nand is classified on the basis of architectural\
    \ layers. We\nhave tried to cover all subareas and recent technologies in\nour\
    \ taxonomy. There have been many survey papers on the\nInternet of Things in the\
    \ past. Table 1 shows how our survey\nis different from other highly cited surveys\
    \ in the literature.\nLet us first consider our novel contributions. Our paper\n\
    looks at each and every layer in the IoT stack, and as a\nresult the presentation\
    \ is also far more balanced. A novel\naddition in our survey is that we have discussed\
    \ different IoT\narchitectures. This has not been discussed in prior surveys on\n\
    the Internet of Things. The architecture section also considers\nnewer paradigms\
    \ such as fog computing, which have also\nhitherto not been considered. Moreover,\
    \ our survey nicely\ncategorizes technologies based on the architectural layer\n\
    that they belong to. We have also thoroughly categorized\nthe network layer and\
    \ tried to consolidate almost all the\ntechnologies that are used in IoT systems.\
    \ Such kind of a\nthorough categorization and presentation of technologies is\n\
    novel to the best of our knowledge.\nAlong with these novel contributions our\
    \ survey is far\nmore comprehensive, detailed, and exhaustive as compared\nto\
    \ other surveys in the area. Most of the other surveys look\nat only one or two\
    \ types of sensors, whereas we describe\n9 types of sensors with many examples.\
    \ Other surveys\nare also fairly restricted when they discuss communication\n\
    technologies and applications. We have discussed many types\nof middleware technologies\
    \ as well. Prior works have not\ngiven middleware technologies this level of attention.\
    \ We\ncover 10 communication technologies in detail and consider\na large variety\
    \ of applications encompassing smart homes,\nhealth care, logistics, transport,\
    \ agriculture, environment,\nsmart cities, and green energy. No other survey in\
    \ this area\nprofiles so many technologies, applications, and use cases.\n5. Sensors\
    \ and Actuators\nAll IoT applications need to have one or more sensors to\ncollect\
    \ data from the environment. Sensors are essential\ncomponents of smart objects.\
    \ One of the most important\naspects of the Internet of Things is context awareness,\
    \ which\nis not possible without sensor technology. IoT sensors are\nmostly small\
    \ in size, have low cost, and consume less power.\nThey are constrained by factors\
    \ such as battery capacity and\nease of deployment. Schmidt and Van Laerhoven\
    \ [25] provide\nan overview of various types of sensors used for building\nsmart\
    \ applications.\n5.1. Mobile Phone Based Sensors. First of all, let us look at\n\
    the mobile phone, which is ubiquitous and has many types\nof sensors embedded\
    \ in it. In specific, the smartphone is\na very handy and user friendly device\
    \ that has a host of\nbuilt in communication and data processing features. With\n\
    the increasing popularity of smartphones among people,\nresearchers are showing\
    \ interest in building smart IoT solu-\ntions using smartphones because of the\
    \ embedded sensors\n[16, 26]. Some additional sensors can also be used depending\n\

    \ can be built on the\nsmartphone that uses sensor data to produce meaningful\n\
    results. Some of the sensors inside a modern smartphone are\nas follows.\n(1)\
    \ The accelerometer senses the motion and acceleration\nof a mobile phone. It\
    \ typically measures changes in\nvelocity of the smartphone in three dimensions.\
    \ There\nare many types of accelerometers [27].\nIn a mechanical accelerometer,\
    \ we have a seismic\nmass in a housing, which is tied to the housing\nwith a spring.\
    \ The mass takes time to move and is\nleft behind as the housing moves, so the\
    \ force in\nthe spring can be correlated with the acceleration.\nIn a capacitive\
    \ accelerometer, capacitive plates are\nused with the same setup. With a change\
    \ in velocity,\nthe mass pushes the capacitive plates together, thus\nchanging\
    \ the capacitance. The rate of change of\ncapacitance is then converted into acceleration.\
    \ In\na piezoelectric accelerometer, piezoelectric crystals\nare used, which when\
    \ squeezed generate an electric\nvoltage. The changes in voltage can be translated\
    \ into\nacceleration.\nThe data patterns captured by the accelerometer can\nbe\
    \ used to detect physical activities of the user such as\nrunning, walking, and\
    \ bicycling.\n(2) The gyroscope detects the orientation of the phone\nvery precisely.\
    \ Orientation is measured using capac-\nitive changes when a seismic mass moves\
    \ in a partic-\nular direction.\n(3) The camera and microphone are very powerful\
    \ sen-\nsors since they capture visual and audio information,\nwhich can then\
    \ be analyzed and processed to detect\nvarious types of contextual information.\
    \ For example,\nwe can infer a user’s current environment and the\ninteractions\
    \ that she is having. To make sense of the\naudio data, technologies such as voice\
    \ recognition\nand acoustic features can be exploited.\n(4) The magnetometer detects\
    \ magnetic fields. This can\nbe used as a digital compass and in applications\
    \ to\ndetect the presence of metals.\n(5) The GPS (Global Positioning System)\
    \ detects the\nlocation of the phone, which is one of the most\nimportant pieces\
    \ of contextual information for smart\napplications. The location is detected\
    \ using the prin-\nciple of trilateration [28]. The distance is measured\nfrom\
    \ three or more satellites (or mobile phone towers\nin the case of A-GPS) and\
    \ coordinates are computed.\n(6) The light sensor detects the intensity of ambient\
    \ light.\nIt can be used for setting the brightness of the screen\nand other applications\
    \ in which some action is to be\ntaken depending on the intensity of ambient light.\
    \ For\nexample, we can control the lights in a room.\n(7) The proximity sensor\
    \ uses an infrared (IR) LED,\nwhich emits IR rays. These rays bounce back when\n\
    they strike some object. Based on the difference in\ntime, we can calculate the\
    \ distance. In this way, the\ndistance to different objects from the phone can\
    \ be\nmeasured. For example, we can use it to determine\nwhen the phone is close\
    \ to the face while talking. It\ncan also be used in applications in which we\
    \ have\nto trigger some event when an object approaches the\nphone.\n(8) Some\
    \ smartphones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S4 also\nhave a thermometer, barometer,\
    \ and humidity sensor\nto measure the temperature, atmospheric pressure,\nand\
    \ humidity, respectively.\nWe have studied many smart applications that use sensor\n\
    data collected from smartphones. For example, activity detec-\ntion [29] is achieved\
    \ by applying machine learning algorithms\nto the data collected by smartphone\
    \ sensors. It detects activi-\nties such as running, going up and down stairs,\
    \ walking, driv-\ning, and cycling. The application is trained with patterns of\n\
    data using data sets recorded by sensors when these activities\nare being performed.\n\
    Many health and fitness applications are being built to\nkeep track of a person’s\
    \ health continuously using smart-\nphones. They keep track of users’ physical\
    \ activities, diet,\nexercises, and lifestyle to determine the fitness level and\n\
    give suggestions to the user accordingly. Wang et al. [30]\ndescribe a mobile\
    \ application that is based completely on a\nsmartphone. They use it to assess\
    \ the overall mental health\nand performance of a college student. To track the\
    \ location\nand activities in which the student is involved, activity\nrecognition\
    \ (accelerometer) and GPS data are used. To keep\na check on how much the student\
    \ sleeps, the accelerometer\nand light sensors are used. For social life and conversations,\n\
    audio data from a microphone is used. The application also\nconducts quick questionnaires\
    \ with the students to know\nabout their mood. All this data can be used to assess\
    \ the stress\nlevels, social life, behavior, and exercise patterns of a student.\n\
    Another application by McClernon and Choudhury [31]\ndetects when the user is\
    \ going to smoke using context\ninformation such as the presence of other smokers,\
    \ location,\nand associated activities. The sensors provide information\nrelated\
    \ to the user’s movement, location, visual images, and\nsurrounding sounds. To\
    \ summarize smartphone sensors are\nbeing used to study different kinds of human\
    \ behavior (see\n[32]) and to improve the quality of human life.\n5.2. Medical\
    \ Sensors. The Internet of Things can be really\nbeneficial for health care applications.\
    \ We can use sensors,\nwhich can measure and monitor various medical parameters\n\
    in the human body [33]. These applications can aim at\nmonitoring a patient’s\
    \ health when they are not in hospital or\nwhen they are alone. Subsequently,\
    \ they can provide real time\nfeedback to the doctor, relatives, or the patient.\
    \ McGrath and\nScanaill [34] have described in detail the different sensors that\n\
    can be worn on the body for monitoring a person’s health.\nThere are many wearable\
    \ sensing devices available in the\nmarket. They are equipped with medical sensors\
    \ that are\ncapable of measuring different parameters such as the heart\nrate,\
    \ pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration\nrate, and blood glucose\
    \ levels [35]. These wearables include\n8\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nFigure 4: Smart watches and fitness trackers (source:https://www\n\
    .pebble.com/ and http://www.fitbit.com/).\nFigure 5: Embedded skin patches (source:\
    \ MC10 Electronics).\nsmart watches, wristbands, monitoring patches, and smart\n\
    textiles.\nMoreover, smart watches and fitness trackers are becom-\ning fairly\
    \ popular in the market as companies such as Apple,\nSamsung, and Sony are coming\
    \ up with very innovative\nfeatures. For example, a smart watch includes features\
    \ such\nas connectivity with a smartphone, sensors such as an\naccelerometer,\
    \ and a heart rate monitor (see Figure 4).\nAnother novel IoT device, which has\
    \ a lot of promise are\nmonitoring patches that are pasted on the skin. Monitoring\n\
    patches are like tattoos. They are stretchable and disposable\nand are very cheap.\
    \ These patches are supposed to be worn\nby the patient for a few days to monitor\
    \ a vital health\nparameter continuously [15]. All the electronic components\n\
    are embedded in these rubbery structures. They can even\ntransmit the sensed data\
    \ wirelessly. Just like a tattoo, these\npatches can be applied on the skin as\
    \ shown in Figure 5.\nOne of the most common applications of such patches is to\n\
    monitor blood pressure.\nA very important consideration here is the context [34].\n\
    The data collected by the medical sensors must be combined\nwith contextual information\
    \ such as physical activity. For\nexample, the heart rate depends on the context.\
    \ It increases\nwhen we exercise. In that case, we cannot infer abnormal\nheart\
    \ rate. Therefore, we need to combine data from different\nsensors for making\
    \ the correct inference.\nFigure 6: Brain sensing headband with embedded neurosensors\n\
    (source: http://www.choosemuse.com/).\n5.3. Neural Sensors. Today, it is possible\
    \ to understand\nneural signals in the brain, infer the state of the brain, and\n\
    train it for better attention and focus. This is known as\nneurofeedback [36]\
    \ (see Figure 6). The technology used for\nreading brain signals is called EEG\
    \ (Electroencephalography)\nor a brain computer interface. The neurons inside\
    \ the brain\ncommunicate electronically and create an electric field, which\n\
    can be measured from outside in terms of frequencies. Brain\nwaves can be categorized\
    \ into alpha, beta, gamma, theta, and\ndelta waves depending upon the frequency.\n\
    Based on the type of wave, it can be inferred whether\nthe brain is calm or wandering\
    \ in thoughts. This type of\nneurofeedback can be obtained in real time and can\
    \ be used\nto train the brain to focus, pay better attention towards things,\n\
    manage stress, and have better mental well-being.\n5.4. Environmental and Chemical\
    \ Sensors. Environmental\nsensors are used to sense parameters in the physical\
    \ environ-\nment such as temperature, humidity, pressure, water pollu-\ntion,\
    \ and air pollution. Parameters such as the temperature\nand pressure can be measured\
    \ with a thermometer and\nbarometer. Air quality can be measured with sensors,\
    \ which\nsense the presence of gases and other particulate matter in the\nair\
    \ (refer to Sekhar et al. [37] for more details).\nChemical sensors are used to\
    \ detect chemical and bio-\nchemical substances. These sensors consist of a recognition\n\
    element and a transducer. The electronic nose (e-nose) and\nelectronic tongue\
    \ (e-tongue) are technologies that can be\nused to sense chemicals on the basis\
    \ of odor and taste,\nrespectively [38]. The e-nose and e-tongue consist of an\
    \ array\nof chemical sensors coupled with advance pattern recognition\nsoftware.\
    \ The sensors inside the e-nose and e-tongue produce\ncomplex data, which is then\
    \ analyzed through pattern recog-\nnition to identify the stimulus.\nThese sensors\
    \ can be used in monitoring the pollution\nlevel in smart cities [39], keeping\
    \ a check on food quality\nin smart kitchens, testing food, and agricultural products\
    \ in\nsupply chain applications.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\
    9\n5.5. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID is an iden-\ntification technology\
    \ in which an RFID tag (a small chip with\nan antenna) carries data, which is\
    \ read by a RFID reader. The\ntag transmits the data stored in it via radio waves.\
    \ It is similar\nto bar code technology. But unlike a traditional bar code, it\n\
    does not require line of sight communication between the tag\nand the reader and\
    \ can identify itself from a distance even\nwithout a human operator. The range\
    \ of RFID varies with the\nfrequency. It can go up to hundreds of meters.\nRFID\
    \ tags are of two types: active and passive. Active tags\nhave a power source\
    \ and passive tags do not have any power\nsource. Passive tags draw power from\
    \ the electromagnetic\nwaves emitted by the reader and are thus cheap and have\
    \ a\nlong lifetime [40, 41].\nThere are two types of RFID technologies: near and\
    \ far\n[40]. A near RFID reader uses a coil through which we pass\nalternating\
    \ current and generate a magnetic field. The tag has\na smaller coil, which generates\
    \ a potential due to the ambient\nchanges in the magnetic field. This voltage\
    \ is then coupled\nwith a capacitor to accumulate a charge, which then powers\n\
    up the tag chip. The tag can then produce a small magnetic\nfield that encodes\
    \ the signal to be transmitted, and this can\nbe picked up by the reader.\nIn\
    \ far RFID, there is a dipole antenna in the reader, which\npropagates EM waves.\
    \ The tag also has a dipole antenna on\nwhich an alternating potential difference\
    \ appears and it is\npowered up. It can then use this power to transmit messages.\n\
    RFID technology is being used in various applications\nsuch as supply chain management,\
    \ access control, identity\nauthentication, and object tracking. The RFID tag\
    \ is attached\nto the object to be tracked and the reader detects and records\n\
    its presence when the object passes by it. In this manner,\nobject movement can\
    \ be tracked and RFID can serve as a\nsearch engine for smart things.\nFor access\
    \ control, an RFID tag is attached to the\nauthorized object. For example, small\
    \ chips are glued to the\nfront of vehicles. When the car reaches a barricade\
    \ on which\nthere is a reader, it reads the tag data and decides whether it\n\
    is an authorized car. If yes, it opens automatically. RFID cards\nare issued to\
    \ the people, who can then be identified by a RFID\nreader and given access accordingly.\n\
    The low level data collected from the RFID tags can be\ntransformed into higher\
    \ level insights in IoT applications\n[42]. There are many user level tools available,\
    \ in which all the\ndata collected by particular RFID readers and data associated\n\
    with the RFID tags can be managed. The high level data can\nbe used to draw inferences\
    \ and take further action.\n5.6. Actuators. Let us look at some examples of actuators\
    \ that\nare used in the Internet of Things. An actuator is a device,\nwhich can\
    \ effect a change in the environment by converting\nelectrical energy into some\
    \ form of useful energy. Some\nexamples are heating or cooling elements, speakers,\
    \ lights,\ndisplays, and motors.\nThe actuators, which induce motion, can be classified\
    \ into\nthree categories, namely, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic\nactuators\
    \ depending on their operation. Hydraulic actuators\nfacilitate mechanical motion\
    \ using fluid or hydraulic power.\nPneumatic actuators use the pressure of compressed\
    \ air and\nelectrical ones use electrical energy.\nAs an example, we can consider\
    \ a smart home system,\nwhich consists of many sensors and actuators. The actuators\n\
    are used to lock/unlock the doors, switch on/off the lights or\nother electrical\
    \ appliances, alert users of any threats through\nalarms or notifications, and\
    \ control the temperature of a\nhome (via a thermostat).\nA sophisticated example\
    \ of an actuator used in IoT is\na digital finger, which is used to turn on/off\
    \ the switches\n(or anything which requires small motion) and is controlled\n\
    wirelessly.\n6. Preprocessing\nAs smart things collect huge amount of sensor data,\
    \ compute\nand storage resources are required to analyze, store, and\nprocess\
    \ this data. The most common compute and storage\nresources are cloud based because\
    \ the cloud offers massive\ndata handling, scalability, and flexibility. But this\
    \ will not be\nsufficient to meet the requirements of many IoT applications\n\
    because of the following reasons [43].\n(1) Mobility: most of the smart devices\
    \ are mobile. Their\nchanging location makes it difficult to communicate\nwith\
    \ the cloud data center because of changing net-\nwork conditions across different\
    \ locations.\n(2) Reliable and real time actuation: communicating with\nthe cloud\
    \ and getting back responses takes time.\nLatency sensitive applications, which\
    \ need real time\nresponses, may not be feasible with this model. Also,\nthe communication\
    \ may be lossy due to wireless links,\nwhich can lead to unreliable data.\n(3)\
    \ Scalability: more devices means more requests to the\ncloud, thereby increasing\
    \ the latency.\n(4) Power constraints: communication consumes a lot of\npower,\
    \ and IoT devices are battery powered. They\nthus cannot afford to communicate\
    \ all the time.\nTo solve the problem of mobility, researchers have pro-\nposed\
    \ mobile cloud computing (MCC) [44]. But there are\nstill problems associated\
    \ with latency and power. MCC also\nsuffers from mobility problems such as frequently\
    \ changing\nnetwork conditions due to which problems such as signal\nfading and\
    \ service degradation arise.\nAs a solution to these problems, we can bring some\n\
    compute and storage resources to the edge of the network\ninstead of relying on\
    \ the cloud for everything. This concept\nis known as fog computing [11, 45] (also\
    \ see Section 2.2).\nThe fog can be viewed as a cloud, which is close to the\n\
    ground. Data can be stored, processed, filtered, and analyzed\non the edge of\
    \ the network before sending it to the cloud\nthrough expensive communication\
    \ media. The fog and cloud\nparadigms go together. Both of them are required for\
    \ the\noptimal performance of IoT applications. A smart gateway\n[13] can be employed\
    \ between underlying networks and the\ncloud to realize fog computing as shown\
    \ in Figure 7.\nThe features of fog computing [11] are as follows:\n(1) Low latency:\
    \ less time is required to access computing\nand storage resources on fog nodes\
    \ (smart gateways).\n10\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nSmart\

    \ the edge\nof the network, it is aware of the location of the\napplications and\
    \ their context. This is beneficial as\ncontext awareness is an important feature\
    \ of IoT\napplications.\n(3) Distributed nodes: fog nodes are distributed unlike\n\
    centralized cloud nodes. Multiple fog nodes need to\nbe deployed in distributed\
    \ geographical areas in order\nto provide services to mobile devices in those\
    \ areas.\nFor example, in vehicular networks, deploying fog\nnodes at highways\
    \ can provide low latency data/video\nstreaming to vehicles.\n(4) Mobility: the\
    \ fog supports mobility as smart devices\ncan directly communicate with smart\
    \ gateways\npresent in their proximity.\n(5) Real time response: fog nodes can\
    \ give an immediate\nresponse unlike the cloud, which has a much greater\nlatency.\n\
    (6) Interaction with the cloud: fog nodes can further\ninteract with the cloud\
    \ and communicate only that\ndata, which is required to be sent to the cloud.\n\
    The tasks performed by a smart gateway [46] are col-\nlecting sensor data, preprocessing\
    \ and filtering collected\ndata, providing compute, storage and networking services\n\
    to IoT devices, communicating with the cloud and sending\nonly necessary data,\
    \ monitoring power consumption of IoT\ndevices, monitoring activities and services\
    \ of IoT devices, and\nensuring security and privacy of data. Some applications\
    \ of\nfog computing are as follows [10, 11]:\n(1) Smart vehicular networks: smart\
    \ traffic lights are\ndeployed as smart gateways to locally detect pedes-\ntrians\
    \ and vehicles through sensors, calculate their\ndistance and speed, and finally\
    \ infer traffic conditions.\nThis is used to warn oncoming vehicles. These sensors\n\
    also interact with neighboring smart traffic lights\nto perform traffic management\
    \ tasks. For example,\nif sensors detect an approaching ambulance, they\ncan change\
    \ the traffic lights to let the ambulance\npass first and also inform other lights\
    \ to do so. The\ndata collected by these smart traffic lights are locally\nanalyzed\
    \ in real time to serve real time needs of traffic\nmanagement. Further, data\
    \ from multiple gateways\nis combined and sent to the cloud for further global\n\
    analysis of traffic in the city.\n(2) Smart grid: the smart electrical grid facilitates\
    \ load\nbalancing of energy on the basis of usage and avail-\nability. This is\
    \ done in order to switch automatically\nto alternative sources of energy such\
    \ as solar and\nwind power. This balancing can be done at the edge\nof the network\
    \ using smart meters or microgrids\nconnected by smart gateways. These gateways\
    \ can\nanalyze and process data. They can then project future\nenergy demand,\
    \ calculate the availability and price of\npower, and supply power from both conventional\
    \ and\nalternative sources to consumers.\n7. Communication\nAs the Internet of\
    \ Things is growing very rapidly, there are a\nlarge number of heterogeneous smart\
    \ devices connecting to\nthe Internet. IoT devices are battery powered, with minimal\n\
    compute and storage resources. Because of their constrained\nnature, there are\
    \ various communication challenges involved,\nwhich are as follows [19]:\n(1)\
    \ Addressing and identification: since millions of smart\nthings will be connected\
    \ to the Internet, they will\nhave to be identified through a unique address,\
    \ on the\nbasis of which they communicate with each other. For\nthis, we need\
    \ a large addressing space, and a unique\naddress for each smart object.\n(2)\
    \ Low power communication: communication of data\nbetween devices is a power consuming\
    \ task, specially,\nwireless communication. Therefore, we need a solu-\ntion that\
    \ facilitates communication with low power\nconsumption.\n(3) Routing protocols\
    \ with low memory requirement and\nefficient communication patterns.\n(4) High\
    \ speed and nonlossy communication.\n(5) Mobility of smart things.\nIoT devices\
    \ typically connect to the Internet through\nthe IP (Internet Protocol) stack.\
    \ This stack is very complex\nand demands a large amount of power and memory from\n\
    the connecting devices. The IoT devices can also connect\nlocally through non-IP\
    \ networks, which consume less power,\nand connect to the Internet via a smart\
    \ gateway. Non-IP\ncommunication channels such as Bluetooth, RFID, and NFC\nare\
    \ fairly popular but are limited in their range (up to a\nfew meters). Therefore,\
    \ their applications are limited to small\npersonal area networks. Personal area\
    \ networks (PAN) are\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n11\nbeing\
    \ widely used in IoT applications such as wearables\nconnected to smartphones.\
    \ For increasing the range of such\nlocal networks, there was a need to modify\
    \ the IP stack so as to\nfacilitate low power communication using the IP stack.\
    \ One\nof the solutions is 6LoWPAN, which incorporates IPv6 with\nlow power personal\
    \ area networks. The range of a PAN with\n6LoWPAN is similar to local area networks,\
    \ and the power\nconsumption is much lower.\nThe leading communication technologies\
    \ used in the IoT\nworld are IEEE 802.15.4, low power WiFi, 6LoWPAN, RFID,\nNFC,\
    \ Sigfox, LoraWAN, and other proprietary protocols for\nwireless networks.\n7.1.\
    \ Near Field Communication (NFC). Near Field Communi-\ncation [47–49] is a very\
    \ short range wireless communication\ntechnology, through which mobile devices\
    \ can interact with\neach other over a distance of few centimeters only. All types\
    \ of\ndata can be transferred between two NFC enabled devices in\nseconds by bringing\
    \ them close to each other. This technology\nis based on RFID. It uses variations\
    \ in the magnetic field\nto communicate data between two NFC enabled devices.\n\
    NFC operates over a frequency band of 13.56 MHz, which is\nthe same as high frequency\
    \ RFID. There are two modes of\noperation: active and passive. In the active mode,\
    \ both the\ndevices generate magnetic fields, while in the passive mode,\nonly\
    \ one device generates the field and the other uses load\nmodulation to transfer\
    \ the data. The passive mode is useful in\nbattery powered devices to optimize\
    \ energy use. One benefit\nof the requirement of close proximity between devices\
    \ is that\nit is useful for secure transactions such as payments. Finally,\nnote\
    \ that NFC can be used for two-way communication\nunlike RFID. Consequently, almost\
    \ all smartphones in the\nmarket today are NFC enabled.\n7.2. Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSN) Based on IP for Smart\nObjects. Many times, data from a single\
    \ sensor is not useful\nin monitoring large areas and complex activities. Different\n\
    sensor nodes need to interact with each other wirelessly. The\ndisadvantage of\
    \ non-IP technologies such as RFID, NFC,\nand Bluetooth is that their range is\
    \ very small. So, they\ncannot be used in many applications, where a large area\
    \ needs\nto be monitored through many sensor nodes deployed in\ndiverse locations.\
    \ A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists\nof tens to thousands of sensor nodes\
    \ connected using wireless\ntechnologies. They collect data about the environment\
    \ and\ncommunicate it to gateway devices that relay the information\nto the cloud\
    \ over the Internet. The communication between\nnodes in a WSN may be direct or\
    \ multihop. The sensor nodes\nare of a constrained nature, but gateway nodes have\
    \ suffi-\ncient power and processing resources. The popular network\ntopologies\
    \ used in a WSN are a star, a mesh, and a hybrid\nnetwork. Most of the communication\
    \ in WSN is based on the\nIEEE 802.15.4 standard (discussed in Section 7.3). There\
    \ are\nclearly a lot of protocols that can be used in IoT scenarios.\nLet us discuss\
    \ the design of a typical IoT network protocol\nstack with the most popular alternatives.\n\
    7.3. IoT Network Protocol Stack. The Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF) has\
    \ developed alternative protocols for\ncommunication between IoT devices using\
    \ IP because IP is a\nflexible and reliable standard [50, 51]. The Internet Protocol\n\
    for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance has published various\nwhite papers describing\
    \ alternative protocols and standards\nfor the layers of the IP stack and an additional\
    \ adaptation\nlayer, which is used for communication [51–54] between\nsmart objects.\n\
    (1) Physical and MAC Layer (IEEE 802.15.4). The IEEE\n802.15.4 protocol is designed\
    \ for enabling communication\nbetween compact and inexpensive low power embedded\n\
    devices that need a long battery life. It defines standards and\nprotocols for\
    \ the physical and link (MAC) layer of the IP\nstack. It supports low power communication\
    \ along with low\ncost and short range communication. In the case of such\nresource\
    \ constrained environments, we need a small frame\nsize, low bandwidth, and low\
    \ transmit power.\nTransmission requires very little power (maximum one\nmilliwatt),\
    \ which is only one percent of that used in WiFi or\ncellular networks. This limits\
    \ the range of communication.\nBecause of the limited range, the devices have\
    \ to operate\ncooperatively in order to enable multihop routing over\nlonger distances.\
    \ As a result, the packet size is limited to\n127 bytes only, and the rate of\
    \ communication is limited to\n250 kbps. The coding scheme in IEEE 802.15.4 has\
    \ built in\nredundancy, which makes the communication robust, allows\nus to detect\
    \ losses, and enables the retransmission of lost\npackets. The protocol also supports\
    \ short 16-bit link addresses\nto decrease the size of the header, communication\
    \ overheads,\nand memory requirements [55].\nReaders can refer to the survey by\
    \ Vasseur et al. [54]\nfor more information on different physical and link layer\n\
    technologies for communication between smart objects.\n(2) Adaptation Layer. IPv6\
    \ is considered the best protocol for\ncommunication in the IoT domain because\
    \ of its scalability\nand stability. Such bulky IP protocols were initially not\n\
    thought to be suitable for communication in scenarios with\nlow power wireless\
    \ links such as IEEE 802.15.4.\n6LoWPAN, an acronym for IPv6 over low power wireless\n\
    personal area networks, is a very popular standard for\nwireless communication.\
    \ It enables communication using\nIPv6 over the IEEE 802.15.4 [52] protocol. This\
    \ standard\ndefines an adaptation layer between the 802.15.4 link layer\nand the\
    \ transport layer. 6LoWPAN devices can communicate\nwith all other IP based devices\
    \ on the Internet. The choice\nof IPv6 is because of the large addressing space\
    \ available\nin IPv6. 6LoWPAN networks connect to the Internet via a\ngateway\
    \ (WiFi or Ethernet), which also has protocol support\nfor conversion between\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 as today’s deployed\nInternet is mostly IPv4. IPv6 headers are\
    \ not small enough\nto fit within the small 127 byte MTU of the 802.15.4 standard.\n\
    Hence, squeezing and fragmenting the packets to carry\nonly the essential information\
    \ is an optimization that the\nadaptation layer performs.\nSpecifically, the adaptation\
    \ layer performs the following\nthree optimizations in order to reduce communication\
    \ over-\nhead [55]:\n12\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(i) Header\
    \ compression 6loWPAN defines header com-\npression of IPv6 packets for decreasing\
    \ the overhead\nof IPv6. Some of the fields are deleted because they\ncan be derived\
    \ from link level information or can be\nshared across packets.\n(ii) Fragmentation:\
    \ the minimum MTU size (maximum\ntransmission unit) of IPv6 is 1280 bytes. On\
    \ the other\nhand, the maximum size of a frame in IEEE 802.15.4\nis 127 bytes.\
    \ Therefore, we need to fragment the IPv6\npacket. This is done by the adaptation\
    \ layer.\n(iii) Link layer forwarding 6LoWPAN also supports mesh\nunder routing,\
    \ which is done at the link layer using\nlink level short addresses instead of\
    \ in the network\nlayer. This feature can be used to communicate within\na 6LoWPAN\
    \ network.\n(3) Network Layer. The network layer is responsible for\nrouting the\
    \ packets received from the transport layer. The\nIETF Routing over Low Power\
    \ and Lossy Networks (ROLL)\nworking group has developed a routing protocol (RPL)\
    \ for\nLow Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) [53].\nFor such networks, RPL is an\
    \ open routing protocol,\nbased on distance vectors. It describes how a destination\n\
    oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) is built with\nthe nodes after they exchange\
    \ distance vectors. A set of\nconstraints and an objective function is used to\
    \ build the\ngraph with the best path [53]. The objective function and\nconstraints\
    \ may differ with respect to their requirements. For\nexample, constraints can\
    \ be to avoid battery powered nodes\nor to prefer encrypted links. The objective\
    \ function can aim\nto minimize the latency or the expected number of packets\n\
    that need to be sent.\nThe making of this graph starts from the root node. The\n\
    root starts sending messages to neighboring nodes, which\nthen process the message\
    \ and decide whether to join or not\ndepending upon the constraints and the objective\
    \ function.\nSubsequently, they forward the message to their neighbors.\nIn this\
    \ manner, the message travels till the leaf nodes and a\ngraph is formed. Now\
    \ all the nodes in the graph can send\npackets upwards hop by hop to the root.\
    \ We can realize a point\nto point routing algorithm as follows. We send packets\
    \ to a\ncommon ancestor, from which it travels downwards (towards\nleaves) to\
    \ reach the destination.\nTo manage the memory requirements of nodes, nodes are\n\
    classified into storing and nonstoring nodes depending upon\ntheir ability to\
    \ store routing information. When nodes are in a\nnonstoring mode and a downward\
    \ path is being constructed,\nthe route information is attached to the incoming\
    \ message\nand forwarded further till the root. The root receives the\nwhole path\
    \ in the message and sends a data packet along with\nthe path message to the destination\
    \ hop by hop. But there is\na trade-off here because nonstoring nodes need more\
    \ power\nand bandwidth to send additional route information as they\ndo not have\
    \ the memory to store routing tables.\n(4) Transport Layer. TCP is not a good\
    \ option for communi-\ncation in low power environments as it has a large overhead\n\
    owing to the fact that it is a connection oriented protocol.\nTherefore, UDP is\
    \ preferred because it is a connectionless\nprotocol and has low overhead.\n(5)\
    \ Application Layer. The application layer is responsible for\ndata formatting\
    \ and presentation. The application layer in\nthe Internet is typically based\
    \ on HTTP. However, HTTP is\nnot suitable in resource constrained environments\
    \ because\nit is fairly verbose in nature and thus incurs a large parsing\noverhead.\
    \ Many alternate protocols have been developed for\nIoT environments such as CoAP\
    \ (Constrained Application\nProtocol) and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport).\n\
    (a) Constrained Application Protocol: CoAP can be\nthought of as an alternative\
    \ to HTTP. It is used\nin most IoT applications [56, 57]. Unlike HTTP, it\nincorporates\
    \ optimizations for constrained applica-\ntion environments [50]. It uses the\
    \ EXI (Efficient\nXML Interchanges) data format, which is a binary\ndata format\
    \ and is far more efficient in terms of\nspace as compared to plain text HTML/XML.\
    \ Other\nsupported features are built in header compression,\nresource discovery,\
    \ autoconfiguration, asynchronous\nmessage exchange, congestion control, and support\n\
    for multicast messages. There are four types of mes-\nsages in CoAP: nonconfirmable,\
    \ confirmable, reset\n(nack), and acknowledgement. For reliable transmis-\nsion\
    \ over UDP, confirmable messages are used [58].\nThe response can be piggybacked\
    \ in the acknowledge-\nment itself. Furthermore, it uses DTLS (Datagram\nTransport\
    \ Layer Security) for security purposes.\n(b) Message Queue Telemetry Transport:\
    \ MQTT is a\npublish/subscribe protocol that runs over TCP. It was\ndeveloped\
    \ by IBM [59] primarily as a client/server\nprotocol. The clients are publishers/subscribers\
    \ and\nthe server acts as a broker to which clients connect\nthrough TCP. Clients\
    \ can publish or subscribe to a\ntopic. This communication takes place through\
    \ the\nbroker whose job is to coordinate subscriptions and\nalso authenticate\
    \ the client for security. MQTT is\na lightweight protocol, which makes it suitable\
    \ for\nIoT applications. But because of the fact that it runs\nover TCP, it cannot\
    \ be used with all types of IoT\napplications. Moreover, it uses text for topic\
    \ names,\nwhich increases its overhead.\nMQTT-S/MQTT-SN is an extension of MQTT\
    \ [60],\nwhich is designed for low power and low cost devices. It is\nbased on\
    \ MQTT but has some optimizations for WSNs as\nfollows [61]. The topic names are\
    \ replaced by topic IDs, which\nreduce the overheads of transmission. Topics do\
    \ not need\nregistration as they are preregistered. Messages are also split\n\
    so that only the necessary information is sent. Further, for\npower conservation,\
    \ there is an offline procedure for clients\nwho are in a sleep state. Messages\
    \ can be buffered and later\nread by clients when they wake up. Clients connect\
    \ to the\nbroker through a gateway device, which resides within the\nsensor network\
    \ and connects to the broker.\n7.4. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Bluetooth Low\
    \ Energy, also\nknown as “Bluetooth Smart,” was developed by the Bluetooth\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n13\nSpecial Interest Group. It has a\
    \ relatively shorter range and\nconsumes lower energy as compared to competing\
    \ protocols.\nThe BLE protocol stack is similar to the stack used in classic\n\
    Bluetooth technology. It has two parts: controller and host.\nThe physical and\
    \ link layer are implemented in the controller.\nThe controller is typically a\
    \ SOC (System on Chip) with a\nradio. The functionalities of upper layers are\
    \ included in the\nhost [62]. BLE is not compatible with classic Bluetooth. Let\n\
    us look at the differences between classic Bluetooth and BLE\n[63, 64].\nThe main\
    \ difference is that BLE does not support data\nstreaming. Instead, it supports\
    \ quick transfer of small packets\nof data (packet size is small) with a data\
    \ rate of 1 Mbps.\nThere are two types of devices in BLE: master and slave.\n\
    The master acts as a central device that can connect to various\nslaves. Let us\
    \ consider an IoT scenario where a phone or PC\nserve as the master and mobile\
    \ devices such as a thermostat,\nfitness tracker, smart watch, or any monitoring\
    \ device act\nas slaves. In such cases, slaves must be very power efficient.\n\
    Therefore, to save energy, slaves are by default in sleep mode\nand wake up periodically\
    \ to receive packets from the master.\nIn classic Bluetooth, the connection is\
    \ on all the time even\nif no data transfer is going on. Additionally, it supports\
    \ 79\ndata channels (1 MHz channel bandwidth) and a data rate\nof 1 million symbols/s,\
    \ whereas, BLE supports 40 channels\nwith 2 MHz channel bandwidth (double of classic\
    \ Bluetooth)\nand 1 million symbols/s data rate. BLE supports low duty\ncycle\
    \ requirements as its packet size is small and the time\ntaken to transmit the\
    \ smallest packet is as small as 80 \U0001D707s. The\nBLE protocol stack supports\
    \ IP based communication also.\nAn experiment conducted by Siekkinen et al. [65]\
    \ recorded\nthe number of bytes transferred per Joule to show that BLE\nconsumes\
    \ far less energy as compared to competing protocols\nsuch as Zigbee. The energy\
    \ efficiency of BLE is 2.5 times better\nthan Zigbee.\n7.5. Low Power WiFi. The\
    \ WiFi alliance has recently devel-\noped “WiFi HaLow,” which is based on the\
    \ IEEE 802.11ah\nstandard. It consumes lower power than a traditional WiFi\ndevice\
    \ and also has a longer range. This is why this protocol\nis suitable for Internet\
    \ of Things applications. The range of\nWiFi HaLow is nearly twice that of traditional\
    \ WiFi.\nLike other WiFi devices, devices supporting WiFi HaLow\nalso support\
    \ IP connectivity, which is important for IoT\napplications. Let us look at the\
    \ specifications of the IEEE\n802.11ah standard [66, 67]. This standard was developed\
    \ to\ndeal with wireless sensor network scenarios, where devices\nare energy constrained\
    \ and require relatively long range\ncommunication. IEEE 802.11ah operates in\
    \ the sub-gigahertz\nband (900 MHz). Because of the relatively lower frequency,\n\
    the range is longer since higher frequency waves suffer from\nhigher attenuation.\
    \ We can extend the range (currently 1 km)\nby lowering the frequency further;\
    \ however, the data rate\nwill also be lower and thus the tradeoff is not justified.\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah is also designed to support large star shaped\nnetworks, where a\
    \ lot of stations are connected to a single\naccess point.\n7.6. Zigbee. It is\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.15.4 communication\nprotocol standard and is used for\
    \ personal area networks\nor PANs [68]. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has low power\n\
    MAC and physical layers and has already been explained\nin Section 7.3. Zigbee\
    \ was developed by the Zigbee alliance,\nwhich works for reliable, low energy,\
    \ and cheap communi-\ncation solutions. The range of Zigbee device communication\n\
    is very small (10–100 meters). The details of the network and\napplication layers\
    \ are also specified by the Zigbee standard.\nUnlike BLE, the network layer here\
    \ provides for multihop\nrouting.\nThere are three types of devices in a Zigbee\
    \ network:\nFFD (Fully Functional Device), RFD (Reduced Functional\nDevice), and\
    \ one Zigbee coordinator. A FFD node can addi-\ntionally act as a router. Zigbee\
    \ supports star, tree, and mesh\ntopologies. The routing scheme depends on the\
    \ topology.\nOther features of Zigbee are discovery and maintenance of\nroutes,\
    \ support for nodes joining/leaving the network, short\n16-bit addresses, and\
    \ multihop routing.\nThe framework for communication and distributed appli-\n\
    cation development is provided by the application layer.\nThe application layer\
    \ consists of Application Objects (APO),\nApplication Sublayer (APS), and a Zigbee\
    \ Device Object\n(ZDO). APOs are spread over the network nodes. These are\npieces\
    \ of software, which control some underlying device\nhardware (examples: switch\
    \ and transducer). The device and\nnetwork management services are provided by\
    \ the ZDO,\nwhich are then used by the APOs. Data transfer services\nare provided\
    \ by the Application Sublayer to the APOs and\nZDO. It is responsible for secure\
    \ communication between the\nApplication Objects. These features can be used to\
    \ create a\nlarge distributed application.\n7.7. Integration of RFID and WSN.\
    \ RFID and wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) are both important technologies in\
    \ the IoT\ndomain. RFID can only be used for object identification, but\nWSNs\
    \ serve a far greater purpose. The two are very different\nbut merging them has\
    \ many advantages. The following\ncomponents can be added to RFID to enhance its\
    \ usability:\n(a) Sensing capabilities\n(b) Multihop communication\n(c) Intelligence\n\
    RFID is inexpensive and uses very little power. That is\nwhy its integration with\
    \ WSN is very useful. The integration\nis possible in the following ways [69,\
    \ 70]:\n(a) Integration of RFID tags with sensors: RFID tags\nwith sensing capabilities\
    \ are called sensor tags. These\nsensor tags sense data from the environment and\n\
    then the RFID reader can read this sensed data from\nthe tag. In such cases, simple\
    \ RFID protocols are\nused, where there is only single hop communication.\nRFID\
    \ sensing technologies can be further classified\non the basis of the power requirement\
    \ of sensor tags as\nexplained earlier in the section on RFIDs (active and\npassive)\
    \ (see Section 5.5).\n14\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(b)\
    \ Integration of RFID tags with WSN nodes: the com-\nmunication capabilities of\
    \ sensor tags are limited to a\nsingle hop. To extend its capabilities, the sensor\
    \ tag is\nequipped with a wireless transceiver, little bit of Flash\nmemory, and\
    \ computational capabilities such that it\ncan initiate communication with other\
    \ nodes and\nwireless devices. The nodes can in this fashion be used\nto form\
    \ a wireless mesh network. In such networks,\nsensor tags can communicate with\
    \ each other over a\nlarge range (via intermediate hops). With additional\nprocessing\
    \ capabilities at a node, we can reduce the\nnet amount of data communicated and\
    \ thus increase\nthe power efficiency of the WSN.\n(c) Integration of RFID readers\
    \ with WSN nodes: this\ntype of integration is also done to increase the range\n\
    of RFID tag readers. The readers are equipped with\nwireless transceivers and\
    \ microcontrollers so that\nthey can communicate with each other and therefore,\n\
    the tag data can reach a reader, which is not in the\nrange of that tag. It takes\
    \ advantage of multihop\ncommunication of wireless sensor network devices.\nThe\
    \ data from all the RFID readers in the network\nultimately reaches a central\
    \ gateway or base station\nthat processes the data or sends it to a remote server.\n\
    These kinds of integrated solutions have many applica-\ntions in a diverse set\
    \ of domains such as security, healthcare,\nand manufacturing.\n7.8. Low Power\
    \ Wide-Area-Networks (LPWAN). Let us now\ndiscuss a protocol for long range communication\
    \ in power\nconstrained devices. The LPWAN class of protocols is low bit-\nrate\
    \ communication technologies for such IoT scenarios.\nLet us now discuss some\
    \ of the most common technolo-\ngies in this area.\nNarrow band IoT: it is a technology\
    \ made for a large\nnumber of devices that are energy constrained. It is\nthus\
    \ necessary to reduce the bit rate. This protocol\ncan be deployed with both the\
    \ cellular phone GSM\nand LTE spectra. The downlink speeds vary between\n40 kbps\
    \ (LTE M2) and 10 Mbps (LTE category 1).\nSigfox: it is one more protocol that\
    \ uses narrow band\ncommunication (≈10 MHz). It uses free sections of\nthe radio\
    \ spectrum (ISM band) to transmit its data.\nInstead of 4G networks, Sigfox focuses\
    \ on using\nvery long waves. Thus, the range can increase to a\n1000 kms. Because\
    \ of this the energy for transmission\nis significantly lower (<0.1%) than contemporary\
    \ cell\nphones.\nAgain the cost is bandwidth. It can only transmit\n12 bytes per\
    \ message, and a device is limited to 140\nmessages per day. This is reasonable\
    \ for many kinds of\napplications: submarine applications, sending control\n(emergency)\
    \ codes, geolocation, monitoring remote\nlocations, and medical applications.\n\
    Weightless: it uses a differential binary phase shift\nkeying based method to\
    \ transmit narrow band sig-\nnals. To avoid interference, the protocol hops across\n\
    frequency bands (instead of using CSMA). It sup-\nports cryptographic encryption\
    \ and mobility. Along\nwith frequency hopping, two additional mechanisms\nare\
    \ used to reduce collisions. The downlink service\nuses time division multiple\
    \ access (TDMA) and the\nuplink service uses multiple subchannels that are first\n\
    allocated to transmitting nodes by contacting a cen-\ntral server. Some applications\
    \ include smart meters,\nvehicle tracking, health monitoring, and industrial\n\
    machine monitoring.\nNeul: this protocol operates in the sub-1 GHz band.\nIt uses\
    \ small chunks of the TV whitespace spectrum\nto create low cost and low power\
    \ networks with very\nhigh scalability. It has a 10 km range and uses the\nWeightless\
    \ protocol for communication.\nLoRaWAN: this protocol is similar to Sigfox. It\
    \ targets\nwide area network applications and is designed to be\na low power protocol.\
    \ Its data rates can vary from\n0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, and it can be used within\
    \ an\nurban or a suburban environment (2–5 kms range\nin a crowded urban area).\
    \ It was designed to serve\nas a standard for long range IoT protocols. It thus\n\
    has features to support multitenancy, enable multiple\napplications, and include\
    \ several different network\ndomains.\n7.9. Lightweight Application Layer Protocols.\
    \ Along with\nphysical and MAC layer protocols, we also need application\nlayer\
    \ protocols for IoT networks. These lightweight protocols\nneed to be able to\
    \ carry application messages, while simulta-\nneously reducing power as far as\
    \ possible.\nOMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) is one such protocol.\nIt defines the\
    \ communication protocol between a server and\na device. The devices often have\
    \ limited capabilities and are\nthus referred to as constrained devices. The main\
    \ aims of the\nOMA protocol are as follows:\n(1) Remote device management.\n(2)\
    \ Transferring service data/information between differ-\nent nodes in the LWM2M\
    \ network.\nAll the protocols in this class treat all the network\nresources as\
    \ objects. Such resources can be created, deleted,\nand remotely configured. These\
    \ devices have their unique\nlimitations and can use different kinds of protocols\
    \ for\ninternally representing information. The LWM2M protocol\nabstracts all\
    \ of this away and provides a convenient interface\nto send messages between a\
    \ generic LWM2M server and a\ndistributed set of LWM2M clients.\nThis protocol\
    \ is often used along with CoAP (Constrained\nApplication Protocol). It is an\
    \ application layer protocol\nthat allows constrained nodes such as sensor motes\
    \ or small\nembedded devices to communicate across the Internet. CoAP\nseamlessly\
    \ integrates with HTTP, yet it provides additional\nfacilities such as support\
    \ for multicast operations. It is ideally\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\n15\nsuited for small devices because of its low overhead and\n\
    parsing complexity and reliance on UDP rather than TCP.\n8. Middleware\nUbiquitous\
    \ computing is the core of the Internet of Things,\nwhich means incorporating\
    \ computing and connectivity in\nall the things around us. Interoperability of\
    \ such heteroge-\nneous devices needs well-defined standards. But standard-\n\
    ization is difficult because of the varied requirements of\ndifferent applications\
    \ and devices. For such heterogeneous\napplications, the solution is to have a\
    \ middleware platform,\nwhich will abstract the details of the things for applications.\n\
    That is, it will hide the details of the smart things. It\nshould act as a software\
    \ bridge between the things and the\napplications. It needs to provide the required\
    \ services to the\napplication developers [20] so that they can focus more on\n\
    the requirements of applications rather than on interacting\nwith the baseline\
    \ hardware. To summarize, the middleware\nabstracts the hardware and provides\
    \ an Application Program-\nming Interface (API) for communication, data management,\n\
    computation, security, and privacy.\nThe challenges, which are addressed by any\
    \ IoT middle-\nware, are as follows: [20, 71, 72].\n(1) Interoperability and programming\
    \ abstractions: for\nfacilitating collaboration and information exchange\nbetween\
    \ heterogeneous devices, different types of\nthings can interact with each other\
    \ easily with the help\nof middleware services. Interoperability is of three\n\
    types: network, semantic, and syntactic. Network\ninteroperability deals with\
    \ heterogeneous interface\nprotocols for communication between devices. It\ninsulates\
    \ the applications from the intricacies of\ndifferent protocols. Syntactic interoperability\
    \ ensures\nthat applications are oblivious of different formats,\nstructures,\
    \ and encoding of data. Semantic interop-\nerability deals with abstracting the\
    \ meaning of data\nwithin a particular domain. It is loosely inspired by\nthe\
    \ semantic web.\n(2) Device discovery and management: this feature\nenables the\
    \ devices to be aware of all other devices\nin the neighborhood and the services\
    \ provided by\nthem. In the Internet of Things, the infrastructure is\nmostly\
    \ dynamic. The devices have to announce their\npresence and the services they\
    \ provide. The solution\nneeds to be scalable because the devices in an IoT\n\
    network can increase. Most solutions in this domain\nare loosely inspired by semantic\
    \ web technologies.\nThe middleware provides APIs to list the IoT devices,\ntheir\
    \ services, and capabilities. In addition, typically\nAPIs are provided to discover\
    \ devices based on their\ncapabilities. Finally, any IoT middleware needs to\n\
    perform load balancing, manage devices based on\ntheir levels of battery power,\
    \ and report problems in\ndevices to the users.\n(3) Scalability: a large number\
    \ of devices are expected to\ncommunicate in an IoT setup. Moreover, IoT appli-\n\
    cations need to scale due to ever increasing require-\nments. This should be managed\
    \ by the middleware\nby making required changes when the infrastructure\nscales.\n\
    (4) Big data and analytics: IoT sensors typically collect\na huge amount of data.\
    \ It is necessary to analyze\nall of this data in great detail. As a result a\
    \ lot of\nbig data algorithms are used to analyze IoT data.\nMoreover, it is possible\
    \ that due to the flimsy nature\nof the network some of the data collected might\
    \ be\nincomplete. It is necessary to take this into account\nand extrapolate data\
    \ by using sophisticated machine\nlearning algorithms.\n(5) Security and privacy:\
    \ IoT applications are mostly\nrelated to someone’s personal life or an industry.\n\
    Security and privacy issues need to be addressed in\nall such environments. The\
    \ middleware should have\nbuilt in mechanisms to address such issues, along with\n\
    user authentication, and the implementation of access\ncontrol.\n(6) Cloud services:\
    \ the cloud is an important part of an\nIoT deployment. Most of the sensor data\
    \ is analyzed\nand stored in a centralized cloud. It is necessary for\nIoT middleware\
    \ to seamlessly run on different types\nof clouds and to enable users to leverage\
    \ the cloud\nto get better insights from the data collected by the\nsensors.\n\
    (7) Context detection: the data collected from the sensors\nneeds to be used to\
    \ extract the context by applying\nvarious types of algorithms. The context can\
    \ subse-\nquently be used for providing sophisticated services\nto users.\nThere\
    \ are many middleware solutions available for the\nInternet of Things, which address\
    \ one or more of the\naforementioned issues. All of them support interoperabil-\n\
    ity and abstraction, which is the foremost requirement of\nmiddleware. Some examples\
    \ are Oracle’s Fusion Middleware,\nOpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], and Hydra [23].\
    \ Middle-\nwares can be classified as follows on the basis of their design\n[72]:\n\
    (1) Event based: here, all the components interact with\neach other through events.\
    \ Each event has a type and\nsome parameters. Events are generated by producers\n\
    and received by the consumers. This can be viewed\nas a publish/subscribe architecture,\
    \ where entities can\nsubscribe for some event types and get notified for\nthose\
    \ events.\n(2) Service oriented: service oriented middlewares are\nbased on Service\
    \ Oriented Architectures (SOA), in\nwhich we have independent modules that provide\
    \ ser-\nvices through accessible interfaces. A service oriented\nmiddleware views\
    \ resources as service providers.\nIt abstracts the underlying resources through\
    \ a set\nof services that are used by applications. There is\n16\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\na service repository, where services are published\n\
    by providers. The consumers can discover services\nfrom the repository and then\
    \ bind with the provider\nto access the service. Service oriented middleware\n\
    must have runtime support for advertising services\nby providers and support for\
    \ discovering and using\nservices by consumers.\nHYDRA [23] is a service oriented\
    \ middleware. It\nincorporates many software components, which are\nused in handling\
    \ various tasks required for the devel-\nopment of intelligent applications. Hydra\
    \ also pro-\nvides semantic interoperability using semantic web\ntechnologies.\
    \ It supports dynamic reconfiguration\nand self-management.\n(3) Database oriented:\
    \ in this approach, the network\nof IoT devices is considered as a virtual relational\n\
    database system. The database can then be queried\nby the applications using a\
    \ query language. There\nare easy to use interfaces for extracting data from\n\
    the database. This approach has issues with scaling\nbecause of its centralized\
    \ model.\n(4) Semantic: semantic middleware focuses on the inter-\noperation of\
    \ different types of devices, which commu-\nnicate using different formats of\
    \ data. It incorporates\ndevices with different data formats and ontologies and\n\
    ties all of them together in a common framework.\nThe framework is used for exchanging\
    \ data between\ndiverse types of devices. For a common semantic for-\nmat, we\
    \ need to have \U0001D441 adapters for communication\nbetween \U0001D441 devices\
    \ because; for each device, we need\nadapters to map \U0001D441 standards to one\
    \ abstract standard\n[73]. In such a semantic middleware [74], a semantic\nlayer\
    \ is introduced, in which there is a mapping from\neach resource to a software\
    \ layer for that resource.\nThe software layers then communicate with each\nother\
    \ using a mutually intelligible language (based\non the semantic web). This technique\
    \ allows multiple\nphysical resources to communicate even though they\ndo not\
    \ implement or understand the same protocols.\n(5) Application specific: this\
    \ type of middleware is used\nspecifically for an application domain for which\
    \ it\nis developed because the whole architecture of this\nmiddleware software\
    \ is fine-tuned on the basis of\nrequirements of the application. The application\
    \ and\nmiddleware are tightly coupled. These are not general\npurpose solutions.\n\
    8.1. Popular IoT Middleware\n8.1.1. FiWare. FiWare is a very popular IoT middleware\n\
    framework that is promoted by the EU. It has been designed\nkeeping smart cities,\
    \ logistics, and shop floor analytics in\nmind. FiWare contains a large body of\
    \ code, reusable mod-\nules, and APIs that have been contributed by thousands\
    \ of\nFiWare developers. Any application developer can take a\nsubset of these\
    \ components and build his/her IoT application.\nA typical IoT application has\
    \ many producers of data\n(sensors), a set of servers to process the data, and\
    \ a set\nof actuators. FiWare refers to the information collected by\nsensors\
    \ as context information. It defines generic REST APIs\nto capture the context\
    \ from different scenarios. All the context\ninformation is sent to a dedicated\
    \ service called a context\nbroker. FiWare provides APIs to store the context\
    \ and also\nquery it. Moreover, any application can register itself as a\ncontext\
    \ consumer, and it can request the context broker for\ninformation. It also supports\
    \ the publish-subscribe paradigm.\nSubsequently, the context can be supplied to\
    \ systems using\ncontext adapters whose main role is to transform the data (the\n\
    context) based on the requirements of the destination nodes.\nMoreover, FiWare\
    \ defines a set of SNMP APIs via which we\ncan control the behavior of IoT devices\
    \ and also configure\nthem.\nThe target applications are provided APIs to analyze,\n\
    query, and mine the information that is collected from the\ncontext broker. Additionally,\
    \ with advanced visualization\nAPIs, it is possible to create and deploy feature\
    \ rich applica-\ntions very quickly.\n8.1.2. OpenIoT. OpenIoT is another popular\
    \ open source\ninitiative. It has 7 different components. At the lowest level,\n\
    we have a physical plane. It collects data from IoT devices\nand also does some\
    \ preprocessing of data. It has different\nAPIs to interface with different types\
    \ of physical nodes and\nget information from them.\nThe next plane is the virtualized\
    \ plane, which has 3\ncomponents. We first have the scheduler, which manages the\n\
    streams of data generated by devices. It primarily assigns\nthem to resources\
    \ and takes care of their QoS requirements.\nThe data storage component manages\
    \ the storage and archival\nof data streams. Finally, the service delivery component\n\
    processes the streams. It has several roles. It combines\ndata streams, preprocesses\
    \ them, and tracks some statistics\nassociated with these streams such as the\
    \ number of unique\nrequests or the size of each request.\nThe uppermost layer,\
    \ that is, the application layer, also\nhas 3 components: request definition,\
    \ request presentation,\nand configuration. The request definition component helps\n\
    us create requests to be sent to the IoT sensors and storage\nlayers. It can be\
    \ used to fetch and query data. The request\npresentation component creates mashups\
    \ of data by issuing\ndifferent queries to the storage layer, and finally the\
    \ configu-\nration component helps us configure the IoT devices.\n9. Applications\
    \ of IoT\nThere are a diverse set of areas in which intelligent applica-\ntions\
    \ have been developed. All of these applications are not\nyet readily available;\
    \ however, preliminary research indicates\nthe potential of IoT in improving the\
    \ quality of life in our soci-\nety. Some uses of IoT applications are in home\
    \ automation,\nfitness tracking, health monitoring, environment protection,\n\
    smart cities, and industrial settings.\n9.1. Home Automation. Smart homes are\
    \ becoming more\npopular today because of two reasons. First, the sensor\nand\
    \ actuation technologies along with wireless sensor net-\nworks have significantly\
    \ matured. Second, people today trust\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\

    \ diagram of a smart home system.\ntechnology to address their concerns about\
    \ their quality of\nlife and security of their homes (see Figure 8).\nIn smart\
    \ homes, various sensors are deployed, which\nprovide intelligent and automated\
    \ services to the user. They\nhelp in automating daily tasks and help in maintaining\
    \ a\nroutine for individuals who tend to be forgetful. They help\nin energy conservation\
    \ by turning off lights and electronic\ngadgets automatically. We typically use\
    \ motion sensors for\nthis purpose. Motion sensors can be additionally used for\n\
    security also.\nFor example, the project, MavHome [75], provides an\nintelligent\
    \ agent, which uses various prediction algorithms\nfor doing automated tasks in\
    \ response to user triggered events\nand adapts itself to the routines of the\
    \ inhabitants. Predic-\ntion algorithms are used to predict the sequence of events\n\
    [76] in a home. A sequence matching algorithm maintains\nsequences of events in\
    \ a queue and also stores their frequency.\nThen a prediction is made using the\
    \ match length and\nfrequency. Other algorithms used by similar applications use\n\
    compression based prediction and Markov models.\nEnergy conservation in smart\
    \ homes [77] is typically\nachieved through sensors and context awareness. The\
    \ sen-\nsors collect data from the environment (light, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ gas, and fire events). This data from heterogeneous\nsensors is fed to a context\
    \ aggregator, which forwards the\ncollected data to the context aware service\
    \ engine. This engine\nselects services based on the context. For example, an\
    \ appli-\ncation can automatically turn on the AC when the humidity\nrises. Or,\
    \ when there is a gas leak, it can turn all the lights off.\nSmart home applications\
    \ are really beneficial for the\nelderly and differently abled. Their health is\
    \ monitored and\nrelatives are informed immediately in case of emergencies.\n\
    Floors are equipped with pressure sensors, which track the\nmovement of an individual\
    \ across the smart home and also\nhelp in detecting if a person has fallen down.\
    \ In smart homes,\nCCTV cameras can be used to record events of interest. These\n\
    can then be used for feature extraction to find out what is\ngoing on.\nIn specific,\
    \ fall detection applications in smart environ-\nments [78–80] are useful for\
    \ detecting if elderly people have\nfallen down. Yu et al. [80] use computer vision\
    \ based tech-\nniques for analyzing postures of the human body. Sixsmith\net al.\
    \ [79] used low cost infrared sensor array technology,\nwhich can provide information\
    \ such as the location, size,\nand velocity of a target object. It detects dynamics\
    \ of a fall\nby analyzing the motion patterns and also detects inactivity\nand\
    \ compares it with activity in the past. Neural networks\nare employed and sample\
    \ data is provided to the system for\nvarious types of falls. Many smartphone\
    \ based applications\nare also available, which detect a fall on the basis of\
    \ readings\nfrom the accelerometer and gyroscope data.\nThere are many challenges\
    \ and issues with regard to smart\nhome applications [81]. The most important\
    \ is security and\nprivacy [82] since all the data about the events taking place\
    \ in\nthe home is being recorded. If the security and trustworthi-\nness of the\
    \ system are not guaranteed, an intruder may attack\nthe system and may make the\
    \ system behave maliciously.\nSmart home systems are supposed to notify the owners\
    \ in case\nthey detect such abnormalities. This is possible using AI and\nmachine\
    \ learning algorithms, and researchers have already\nstarted working in this direction\
    \ [83]. Reliability is also an\nissue since there is no system administrator to\
    \ monitor the\nsystem.\n9.2. Smart Cities\n9.2.1. Smart Transport. Smart transport\
    \ applications can\nmanage daily traffic in cities using sensors and intelligent\n\
    information processing systems. The main aim of intelligent\ntransport systems\
    \ is to minimize traffic congestion, ensure\n18\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nDatacenter\nGateway\nSend status to cloud\nabout availability\n\
    Search for nearest\navailable parking\nParking space with sensors\nFigure 9: Block\
    \ diagram of a smart parking system.\neasy and hassle-free parking, and avoid\
    \ accidents by prop-\nerly routing traffic and spotting drunk drivers. The sensor\n\
    technologies governing these types of applications are GPS\nsensors for location,\
    \ accelerometers for speed, gyroscopes for\ndirection, RFIDs for vehicle identification,\
    \ infrared sensors\nfor counting passengers and vehicles, and cameras for record-\n\
    ing vehicle movement and traffic. There are many types of\napplications in this\
    \ area (refer to [84]):\n(1) Traffic surveillance and management applications:\n\
    vehicles are connected by a network to each other,\nthe cloud, and to a host of\
    \ IoT devices such as GPS\nsensors, RFID devices, and cameras. These devices\n\
    can estimate traffic conditions in different parts of the\ncity. Custom applications\
    \ can analyze traffic patterns\nso that future traffic conditions can be estimated.\
    \ Yu et\nal. [85] implement a vehicle tracking system for traffic\nsurveillance\
    \ using video sequences captured on the\nroads.\nTraffic congestion detection\
    \ can also be implemented\nusing smartphone sensors such as accelerometers\n[86]\
    \ and GPS sensors. These applications can detect\nmovement patterns of the vehicle\
    \ while the user is\ndriving. Such kind of information is already being\ncollected\
    \ by Google maps and users are using it to\nroute around potentially congested\
    \ areas of the city.\n(2) Applications to ensure safety: smart transport does\n\
    not only imply managing traffic conditions. It also\nincludes safety of people\
    \ travelling in their vehicles,\nwhich up till now was mainly in the hands of\
    \ drivers.\nThere are many IoT applications developed to help\ndrivers become\
    \ safer drivers. Such applications mon-\nitor driving behavior of drivers and\
    \ help them drive\nsafely by detecting when they are feeling drowsy or\ntired\
    \ and helping them to cope with it or suggesting\nrest [87, 88]. Technologies\
    \ used in such applications\nare face detection, eye movement detection, and\n\
    pressure detection on the steering (to measure the\ngrip of the driver’s hands\
    \ on the steering).\nA smartphone application, which estimates the\ndriver’s driving\
    \ behavior using smartphone sensors\nsuch as the accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS,\
    \ and cam-\nera, has been proposed by Eren et al. [89]. It can\ndecide whether\
    \ the driving is safe or rash by analyzing\nthe sensor data.\n(3) Intelligent\
    \ parking management (see Figure 9): in a\nsmart transportation system, parking\
    \ is completely\nhassle free as one can easily check on the Internet to\nfind\
    \ out which parking lot has free spaces. Such lots\nuse sensors to detect if the\
    \ slots are free or occupied by\nvehicles. This data is then uploaded to a central\
    \ server.\n(4) Smart traffic lights: traffic lights equipped with sens-\ning,\
    \ processing, and communication capabilities are\ncalled smart traffic lights.\
    \ These lights sense the\ntraffic congestion at the intersection and the amount\n\
    of traffic going each way. This information can be\nanalyzed and then sent to\
    \ neighboring traffic lights\nor a central controller. It is possible to use this\n\
    information creatively. For example, in an emergency\nsituation the traffic lights\
    \ can preferentially give way\nto an ambulance. When the smart traffic light senses\n\
    an ambulance coming, it clears the path for it and\nalso informs neighboring lights\
    \ about it. Technologies\nused in these lights are cameras, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, and data analysis modules. Such systems\nhave already been deployed\
    \ in Rio De Janeiro.\n(5) Accident detection applications: a smartphone appli-\n\
    cation designed by White et al. [90] detects the occur-\nrence of an accident\
    \ with the help of an accelerometer\nand acoustic data. It immediately sends this\
    \ informa-\ntion along with the location to the nearest hospital.\nJournal of\
    \ Electrical and Computer Engineering\n19\nSome additional situational information\
    \ such as on-\nsite photographs is also sent so that the first respon-\nders know\
    \ about the whole scenario and the degree of\nmedical help that is required.\n\
    9.2.2. Smart Water Systems. Given the prevailing amount of\nwater scarcity in\
    \ most parts of the world, it is very important\nto manage our water resources\
    \ efficiently. As a result most\ncities are opting for smart solutions that place\
    \ a lot of meters\non water supply lines and storm drains. A good reference\n\
    in this area is the paper by Hauber-Davidson and Idris [91].\nThey describe various\
    \ designs for smart water meters. These\nmeters can be used to measure the degree\
    \ of water inflow and\noutflow and to identify possible leaks. Smart water metering\n\
    systems are also used in conjunction with data from weather\nsatellites and river\
    \ water sensors. They can also help us predict\nflooding.\n9.2.3. Examples of\
    \ Smart Cities. Barcelona and Stockholm\nstand out in the list of smart cities.\
    \ Barcelona has a CityOS\nproject, where it aims to create a single virtualized\
    \ OS for\nall the smart devices and services offered within the city.\nBarcelona\
    \ has mainly focused on smart transportation (as\ndiscussed in Section 9.2.1)\
    \ and smart water. Smart transporta-\ntion is implemented using a network of sensors,\
    \ centralized\nanalysis, and smart traffic lights. On similar lines Barcelona\n\
    has sensors on most of its storm drains, water storage tanks,\nand water supply\
    \ lines. This information is integrated with\nweather and usage information. The\
    \ result of all of this is\na centralized water planning strategy. The city is\
    \ able to\nestimate the water requirements in terms of domestic usage\nand industrial\
    \ usage and for activities such as landscaping and\ngardening.\nStockholm started\
    \ way back in 1994, and its first step in\nthis direction was to install an extensive\
    \ fiber optic system.\nSubsequently, the city added thousands of sensors for smart\n\
    traffic and smart water management applications. Stockholm\nwas one of the first\
    \ cities to implement congestion charging.\nUsers were charged money, when they\
    \ drove into congested\nareas. This was enabled by smart traffic technologies.\
    \ Since\nthe city has a solid network backbone, it is very easy to\ndeploy sensors\
    \ and applications. For example, recently the\ncity created a smart parking system,\
    \ where it is possible to\neasily locate parking spots nearby. Parking lots have\
    \ sensors,\nwhich let a server know about their usage. Once a driver\nqueries\
    \ the server with her/his GPS location, she/he is guided\nto the nearest parking\
    \ lot with free slots. Similar innovations\nhave taken place in the city’s smart\
    \ buildings, snow clearance,\nand political announcement systems.\n9.3. Social\
    \ Life and Entertainment. Social life and entertain-\nment play an important role\
    \ in an individual’s life. Many\napplications have been developed, which keep\
    \ track of such\nhuman activities. The term “opportunistic IoT” [92] refers\n\
    to information sharing among opportunistic devices (devices\nthat seek to make\
    \ contact with other devices) based on\nmovement and availability of contacts\
    \ in the vicinity. Personal\ndevices such as tablets, wearables, and mobile phones\
    \ have\nsensing and short range communication capabilities. People\ncan find and\
    \ interact with each other when there is a common\npurpose.\nCircle Sense [93]\
    \ is an application, which detects social\nactivities of a person with the help\
    \ of various types of sensor\ndata. It identifies the social circle of a person\
    \ by analyzing\nthe patterns of social activities and the people present in\n\
    those activities. Various types of social activities and the set\nof people participating\
    \ in those activities are identified. It\nuses location sensors to find out where\
    \ the person is and\nuses Bluetooth for searching people around her. The system\n\
    has built in machine learning algorithms, and it gradually\nimproves its behavior\
    \ with learning.\nAffective computing [94] is a technology, which recog-\nnizes,\
    \ understands, stimulates, and responds to the emotions\nof human beings. There\
    \ are many parameters, which are\nconsidered while dealing with human affects\
    \ such as facial\nexpressions, speech, body gestures, hand movements, and\nsleep\
    \ patterns. These are analyzed to figure out how a person\nis feeling. The utterance\
    \ of emotional keywords is identified\nby voice recognition and the quality of\
    \ voice by looking at\nacoustic features of speech.\nOne of the applications of\
    \ affective computing is Camy,\nan artificial pet dog [95], which is designed\
    \ to interact with\nhuman beings and show affection and emotions. Many sen-\n\
    sors and actuators are embedded in it. It provides emotional\nsupport to the owner,\
    \ encourages playful and active behavior,\nrecognizes its owner, and shows love\
    \ for her and increases\nthe owner’s communication with other people. Based on\
    \ the\nowner’s mood, Camy interacts with the owner and gives her\nsuggestions.\n\
    Logmusic [96] is an entertainment application, which\nrecommends music on the\
    \ basis of the context, such as the\nweather, temperature, time, and location.\n\
    9.4. Health and Fitness. IoT appliances have proven really\nbeneficial in the\
    \ health and wellness domains. Many wearable\ndevices are being developed, which\
    \ monitor a person’s health\ncondition (see Figure 10).\nHealth applications make\
    \ independent living possible for\nthe elderly and patients with serious health\
    \ conditions. Cur-\nrently, IoT sensors are being used to continuously monitor\n\
    and record their health conditions and transmit warnings in\ncase any abnormal\
    \ indicators are found. If there is a minor\nproblem, the IoT application itself\
    \ may suggest a prescription\nto the patient.\nIoT applications can be used in\
    \ creating an Electronic\nHealth Record (EHR), which is a record of all the medical\n\
    details of a person. It is maintained by the health system. An\nEHR can be used\
    \ to record allergies, surges in blood sugar\nand blood pressure.\nStress recognition\
    \ applications are also fairly popular\n[97]. They can be realized using smartphone\
    \ sensors. Wang\net al. describe an application [30], which measures the stress\n\
    level of a college student and is installed on the student’s\nsmartphone. It senses\
    \ the locations the student visits during\nthe whole day, the amount of physical\
    \ activity, amount of\nsleep and rest, and her/his interaction and relationships\
    \ with\nother people (audio data and calls). In addition, it also\nconducts surveys\
    \ with the student by randomly popping up\n20\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of a smart healthcare system.\na question in the smartphone. Using all of this\
    \ data and\nanalyzing it intelligently, the level of stress and academic\nperformance\
    \ can be measured.\nIn the fitness sector, we have applications that monitor\n\
    how fit we are based on our daily activity level. Smartphone\naccelerometer data\
    \ can be used for activity detection by\napplying complex algorithms. For example,\
    \ we can measure\nthe number of steps taken and the amount of exercise done\n\
    by using fitness trackers. Fitness trackers are available in the\nmarket as wearables\
    \ to monitor the fitness level of an indi-\nvidual. In addition, gym apparatus\
    \ can be fitted with sensors\nto count the number of times an exercise is performed.\
    \ For\nexample, a smart mat [98] can count the number of exercise\nsteps performed\
    \ on it. This is implemented using pressure\nsensors on the mat and then by analyzing\
    \ the patterns of\npressure, and the shape of the contact area.\n9.5. Smart Environment\
    \ and Agriculture. Environmental\nparameters such as temperature and humidity\
    \ are important\nfor agricultural production. Sensors are used by farmers in\n\
    the field to measure such parameters and this data can be\nused for efficient\
    \ production. One application is automated\nirrigation according to weather conditions.\n\
    Production using greenhouses [99] is one of the main\napplications of IoT in agriculture.\
    \ Environmental parameters\nmeasured in terms of temperature, soil information,\
    \ and\nhumidity are measured in real time and sent to a server for\nanalysis.\
    \ The results are then used to improve crop quality and\nyield.\nPesticide residues\
    \ in crop production are detected using\nan Acetylcholinesterase biosensor [100].\
    \ This data is saved\nand analyzed for extracting useful information such as the\n\
    sample size, time, location, and amount of residues. We can\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\n21\nthus maintain the quality of the crop. Moreover,\
    \ a QR code\ncan be used to uniquely identify a carton of farm produce.\nConsumers\
    \ can scan the QR code and check the amount\nof pesticides in it (via a centralized\
    \ database) online before\nbuying.\nAir pollution is an important concern today\
    \ because it is\nchanging the climate of the earth and degrading air quality.\n\
    Vehicles cause a lot of air pollution. An IoT application\nproposed by Manna et\
    \ al. [39] monitors air pollution on the\nroads. It also tracks vehicles that\
    \ cause an undue amount of\npollution. Electrochemical toxic gas sensors can also\
    \ be used\nto measure air pollution. Vehicles are identified by RFID tags.\nRFID\
    \ readers are placed on both sides of the road along with\nthe gas sensors. With\
    \ this approach it is possible to identify\nand take action against polluting\
    \ vehicles.\n9.6. Supply Chain and Logistics. IoT tries to simplify real\nworld\
    \ processes in business and information systems [101].\nThe goods in the supply\
    \ chain can be tracked easily from\nthe place of manufacture to the final places\
    \ of distribution\nusing sensor technologies such as RFID and NFC. Real\ntime\
    \ information is recorded and analyzed for tracking.\nInformation about the quality\
    \ and usability of the product can\nalso be saved in RFID tags attached with the\
    \ shipments.\nBo and Guangwen [102] explain an information transmis-\nsion system\
    \ for supply chain management, which is based\non the Internet of Things. RFID\
    \ tags uniquely identify a\nproduct automatically and a product information network\n\
    is created to transmit this information in real time along\nwith location information.\
    \ This system helps in automatic\ncollection and analysis of all the information\
    \ related to supply\nchain management, which may help examine past demand\nand\
    \ come up with a forecast of future demand. Supply chain\ncomponents can get access\
    \ to real time data and all of this\ninformation can be analyzed to get useful\
    \ insights. This will\nin the long run improve the performance of supply chain\n\
    systems.\n9.7. Energy Conservation. The smart grid is information and\ncommunication\
    \ technology enabled modern electricity gen-\neration, transmission, distribution,\
    \ and consumption system\n[103].\nTo make electric power generation, transmission,\
    \ and\ndistribution smart, the concept of smart grids adds intel-\nligence at\
    \ each step and also allows the two-way flow of\npower (back from the consumer\
    \ to the supplier). This can\nsave a lot of energy and help consumers better understand\n\
    the flow of power and dynamic pricing. In a smart grid,\npower generation is distributed.\
    \ There are sensors deployed\nthroughout the system to monitor everything. It\
    \ is actually a\ndistributed network of microgrids [104]. Microgrids generate\n\
    power to meet demands of local sites and transmit back\nthe surplus energy to\
    \ the central grid. Microgrids can also\ndemand energy from the central grid in\
    \ case of a shortfall.\nTwo-way flow of power also benefits consumers, who are\n\
    also using their own generated energy occasionally (say, solar,\nor wind power);\
    \ the surplus power can be transmitted back so\nthat it is not wasted. The user\
    \ will also get paid for that power.\nSome of the IoT applications in a smart\
    \ grid are online\nmonitoring of transmission lines for disaster prevention and\n\
    efficient use of power in smart homes by having a smart meter\nfor monitoring\
    \ energy consumption [105].\nSmart meters read and analyze consumption patterns\
    \ of\npower at regular and peak load times. This information is\nthen sent to\
    \ the server and also made available to the user. The\ngeneration is then set\
    \ according to the consumption patterns.\nIn addition, the user can adjust her/his\
    \ use so as to reduce\ncosts. Smart power appliances can leverage this information\n\
    and operate when the prices are low.\n10. Design Considerations in an IoT System\n\
    Now, that we have profiled most of the IoT technologies, let\nus look at some\
    \ of the design considerations for designing a\npractical IoT network.\nThe first\
    \ consideration is the design of the sensors. Even\nthough there might not be\
    \ much of a choice regarding\nthe sensors, there is definitely a lot of choice\
    \ regarding\nthe processing and networking capabilities that are bundled\nalong\
    \ with the sensors. Our choices range from small sub-\nmW boards meant for sensor\
    \ motes to Arduino or Atom\nboards that consume 300–500 mW of power. This choice\n\
    depends on the degree of analytics and data preprocessing\nthat we want to perform\
    \ at the sensor itself. Secondly, there\nis an issue of logistics also. To create\
    \ a sub-mW board, we\nneed board design expertise, and this might not be readily\n\
    available. Hence, it might be advisable to bundle a sensor with\ncommercially\
    \ available embedded processor kits.\nThe next important consideration is communication.\
    \ In\nIoT nodes, power is the most dominant issue. The power\nrequired to transmit\
    \ and receive messages is a major fraction\nof the overall power, and as a result\
    \ a choice of the networking\ntechnology is vital. The important factors that\
    \ we need\nto consider are the distance between the sender and the\nreceiver,\
    \ the nature of obstacles, signal distortion, ambient\nnoise, and governmental\
    \ regulations. Based on these key\nfactors, we need to choose a given wireless\
    \ networking\nprotocol. For example, if we just need to communicate\ninside a\
    \ small building, we can use Zigbee, whereas if we\nneed communication in a smart\
    \ city, we should choose\nSigfox or LoraWAN. In addition, often there are significant\n\
    constraints on the frequency and the power that can be spent\nin transmission.\
    \ These limitations are mainly imposed by\ngovernment agencies. An apt decision\
    \ needs to be made by\ntaking all of these factors into account.\nLet us then\
    \ come to the middleware. The first choice that\nneeds to be made is to choose\
    \ between an open source mid-\ndleware such as FiWare or a proprietary solution.\
    \ There are\npros and cons of both. It is true that open source middleware\nis\
    \ in theory more flexible; however, they may have limited\nsupport for IoT devices.\
    \ We ideally want a middleware\nsolution to interoperate with all kinds of communication\n\
    protocols and devices; however, that might not be the case.\nHence, if we need\
    \ strict compatibility with certain devices and\nprotocols, a proprietary solution\
    \ is better. Nevertheless, open\nsource offerings have cost advantages and are\
    \ sometimes\neasier to deploy. We also need to choose the communication\n22\n\
    Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nprotocol and ensure that it is\
    \ compatible with the firewalls\nin the organizations involved. In general choosing\
    \ a protocol\nbased on HTTP is the best from this point of view. We also\nneed\
    \ to choose between TCP and UDP. UDP is always better\nfrom the point of view\
    \ of power consumption. Along with\nthese considerations, we also need to look\
    \ at options to store\nsensor data streams, querying languages, and support for\n\
    generating dynamic alerts.\nFinally, let us consider the application layer. Most\
    \ IoT\nframeworks provide significant amount of support for cre-\nating the application\
    \ layer. This includes data mining, data\nprocessing, and visualization APIs.\
    \ Creating mashups and\ndashboards of data is nowadays very easy to do given the\n\
    extensive support provided by IoT frameworks. Nevertheless,\nhere the tradeoff\
    \ is between the features provided and the\nresources that are required. We do\
    \ not need a very heavy\nframework if we do not desire a lot of features. This\
    \ call needs\nto be taken by the application developers.\n11. Conclusion\nIn this\
    \ survey paper we presented a survey of the current\ntechnologies used in the\
    \ IoT domain as of 2016. Currently,\nthis field is in a very nascent stage. The\
    \ technologies in\nthe core infrastructure layers are showing signs of maturity.\n\
    However, a lot more needs to happen in the areas of IoT\napplications and communication\
    \ technologies. These fields\nwill definitely mature and impact human life in\
    \ inconceivable\nways over the next decade.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors\

    Highlights • Reviews over than two hundred papers, that provide a contribution
    to knowledge by establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies
    and Agri-Food Supply Chain Challenges. • A compressive state of the art of Agri-Food
    4.0 related technologies is covered. • Reviews and contributes on the digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food. • Links to the agri-food
    supply chain challenges. • Presents new trends and models in agri-food supply
    chains. Abstract The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry
    4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial
    revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later
    the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies
    generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0
    concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest
    developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process
    across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms
    behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex
    networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies,
    especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements.
    In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses
    some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery
    incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing
    their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones,
    support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather,
    geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire
    farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing
    agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of
    Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours
    and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture
    4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to
    save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains
    open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies
    and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand
    the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. Previous article in issue Next article

    to support rural employment and to make a considerable contribution to territorial
    development. Even though they have always been considered a cornerstone of agricultural
    activity in the European Union (EU), this sector most often suffers from very
    low efficiency and effectiveness, sensitivity to weather, market disruptions and
    other external factors, such as poor agriculture supply chain stakeholders’ linkages
    and communication, especially at the food processing level. In fact, and as stablished
    by the FAO,1 under an approach from “field to fork” the agriculture supply chain
    structures can also be named Agri-Food supply chains, where main events coming
    from the agricultural production of food to the food processing events, including
    trading, are linked. Across this Agri-Food Supply Chain, in most of the cases,
    the transferred agriculture knowledge, from generation to generation, is paramount
    from a cultural point of view, but most of the time, it does not answer to the
    needs nor the requirements of the Agri-Food Supply Chains. Furthermore, such delineation
    does not exist also between farms as economic units and farmers who are producing
    food, mostly, for their own consumption. However, no formal delineation to what
    is a “small” and/or a “large” farm formally exists that is holistically accepted,
    it depends on several factors, such as countries, regions, politics, strategies,
    market shares amongst many others. Nonetheless, there are two criteria to classify
    farm size: standard output (in economic terms) and utilised agricultural area
    (UAA), as alternative measure2 . In this same line, Eurostat3 predicts that, by
    2026, an increment of 4%–6% in agriculture cost savings, as well as an increment
    of 3 % in market value, will be regarded to the use and development of smart agriculture.
    Hence, “Agriculture 4.0″ emerges to provide advanced technologies to the famers
    in order to meet agri-food production challenges, hence, to achieve more affordable
    prices for open market and the minimum cost for farmers. Thus, the expectation
    for the further coming years, is that Agri-Food 4.0 should help meeting sustainable
    challenges by increasing the agri-food supply chain stakeholders revenues as well
    as decreasing their pressure for handling complex and external factors they cannot
    control, such as weather, market behaviours and policies, but also to react on
    time by visualising current trends in needs. This paper focus principally on the
    factory farm model issued from the European and north American style. In those
    typologies of farms the Industry 4.0 elements can be introduced and merged with
    the agricultural domain to create the Agri-Food 4.0. The focus is more specialised
    on the industrial farming although the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted
    also to the organic and silvo-pasture paradigms. Thus, this paper, considering
    a review over than two hundred papers, provides a contribution to knowledge by
    establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies and Agri-Food
    Supply Chain Challenges, which opens the 4.0 research field for a multidisciplinary
    work. The choice of the literature review methodology focused firstly on key words
    related to the Agri-food technology, then the second approach was to focus on
    selected journals and at the end we looked for the data-based repository and the
    linked publications. To accomplish this, the structure in this paper is as follows:
    in the first place, a compressive state of the art of Agri-Food 4.0 related technologies
    is covered. In the second place, a review and contribution coming from digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food shows linkages with
    next trends and technologies. Next, and linked to the agri-food supply chain challenges,
    the fourth section presents new trends and models in agri-food supply chains,
    especially in the domain of risk management, collaboration, governance, cold chain
    management, globalization, information and communication technologies, Logistics,
    supply chain structures and sustainable agri-food supply chains. Finally, the
    fifth section covers the main conclusions, visions and perspectives for this novel
    research. 2. Agri-food 4.0 and technologies state-of-the-art The agricultural
    sector has been active in digital innovation for decades already. Especially the
    advances in Precision Agriculture, remote sensing, robots, farm management information
    systems, and (agronomic) decision support systems have paved the way for a broad
    digital transformation in farming and food (Pedro and Gonzalez-Andujar, 2019).
    Recent developments, such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain,
    Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, allow for the integration of so far isolated
    lines of development into smart, connected systems of systems. Those technologies
    will let the agriculture to evolve in a data-driven, intelligent, agile and autonomous
    connected system of systems. The operations of each agricultural process will
    be automatically integrated in the food chain through the semantically active
    technologies up to the end consumer. The 4th industrial revolution is now reaching
    agriculture. The digital platform (DP) concept emerged as an integration of heterogeneous
    mainly open software solutions for ecosystem building (Yablonsky, 2018). The EU
    promote the creation of digital platforms for several application domains as manufacturing
    (i.e. FoF 11 – 2016 projects, DT-ICT-07-2018-2019, etc.), construction (BIM + calls),
    etc. As a concentration of technology enablers, research on DP covers several
    issues such as software engineering (Guertin and Van Benthem, 2016; Wang et al.,
    2006), process simulation and development (Zhao and Yao, 2016; Hu et al., 2016),
    features analysis (Wang et al., 2014), resource performance (Mocnej et al., 2018),
    test algorithms (Santiago et al., 2017) or performance control (Sahota et al.,
    2011). The technological platforms allow access to the different stakeholders
    and provide deployment capabilities for IT solutions. These solutions are exposed
    by service providers or developed by software engineers. Agricultural Data management
    and exploitation is the central node between digital transformation capabilities
    and the agriculture concerns. The main research issues concern the consolidation
    of data repositories with open data (Gumaste and Kadam, 2016) (weather, maps,
    etc.), governance data (policies, local regulation, etc.) and domain specific
    data from end users. Data typology is very rich (land, location, energy, climate,
    climate impact, etc.) and data volume is continually increasing by the integration
    of sensors and IoT platforms in agriculture (Amandeep et al., 2017; Biradar and
    Shabadi, 2017). Data engineering effort covers pattern definition (Laube et al.,
    2011; Spekken et al., 2016), classification algorithms (Narvaez et al., 2018;
    Shi et al., 2015; Yalcin and Razavi, 2016), correlation analysis (Nilsson et al.,
    2016; Xavier et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2017), etc. All those technologies provide
    engineering capabilities for agricultural data. The implementation of these techniques
    will handle farmers data, will integrate new data repositories from external providers,
    will transform data to knowledge and feed decision support systems. The data transparency
    enabler with necessary sharing policies will accelerate data ingestion and ejection
    processes. 2.1. Big data technologies Research activities in Big Data provide
    relevant results in several application domains (healthcare, marketing, maritime,
    urban, manufacturing, etc.). The Big Data Value Association (BDVA)4 promote the
    application of bigdata in different domains (Belaud et al., 2019). The Big Data
    Grapes EU project5 provides data semantic, analytics, integration and exploitation
    solutions as well as a software stack for grapes agriculture. As additional ongoing
    research issues, we identified tools and technology development (Devarakonda et
    al., 2014; Hashem and Ranc, 2016), analytic methods and services (Malhotra et
    al., 2017; Deka and Walczak, 2017), clustering methods (Balan et al., 2015), transformation
    algorithms (Penar and Wilczek, 2016; Hashem and Ranc, 2016) performance and data
    processing technics (Wu and Zhao, 2009), data source and storage management (Cha
    et al., 2018; RubyDinakar and Vagdevi, 2017), etc. The integration of Big Data
    technologies in Agri-Food projects plays an important role in: the extension of
    farmers data to create new knowledge; the creation of innovative services and
    processes by IT providers and software developers as well as the extension and
    the adaptation of ICT and Factories of the Future (FoF)6 related Big Data models
    and patterns for agriculture. There are several Big Data Repositories that guarantee,
    nowadays, the access and the exploitation to Agri-Food data. As example: the “National
    Climatic Data Centre” (about 2,9 Go per day); Satellite Imagery and metrological
    information from Google and the NASA Earth Exchange; Soil, water and geospatial
    data from the National Resources Conservation Service (US); the OpenCorporates
    as the world’s largest open repository of companies (165 million companies around
    the word); etc. 2.2. Internet of things technologies The integration of IoT platforms
    in agriculture provides additional data sources describing agricultural features
    (water, soil, humans, animals, etc.) with more data. The recent research issues
    on IoT highlight the multiplication of IoT platforms. This expansion generates
    new implementation frameworks (Lee et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018) answering
    to different requirement models, new networks of heterogeneous components and
    sensors with different monitoring models (Pflanz et al., 2018; Vergara et al.,
    2017; Prathibha et al., 2017), time processing scheme and misbalanced energy consumption
    (Ruano et al., 2018; Jarolimek et al., 2016). The integration of the IoT platforms
    with the agricultural issues could add additional research challenges, specifically
    when the data are stocked or used in the cloud, in terms of interoperability (Panetto,
    2007; Mocnej et al., 2018; Zarko et al., 2017; Hefnawy et al., 2017; Martinez
    et al., 2016; Leal et al., 2019; Panetto et al., 2016) (protocols, security, etc.),
    performance monitoring (Paulraj et al., 2018; Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017), etc.
    In addition, IoT serves Robotics (Murar and Brad, 2015) and Automated Guided Vehicles
    (AGV) (Sanchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). An interesting activity might be the
    benchmarking of all the existing IoT platforms and their proposed functionalities
    and mapping them with Agri-Food stakeholders’ requirements. The integration of
    IoT capabilities will support farmers in the harvesting of new data sources to
    create new valuable services. 2.3. Knowledge model approaches The development
    of valuable knowledge models in agriculture aims to transform shared multi-sources
    data repositories to create profitable services and support the decision making
    for different stakeholders. Recent research topics address precise data collection
    and engineering to serve knowledge creation of new farming models (Abdullah et
    al., 2017; Irmak et al., 2006), technology application in farming (Chen and Jin,
    2011; Gerhards et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2013), resource allocation (Garcia
    et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2017; Musacchio and Grant, 2002), assessment frameworks
    (for risk, policies definition and quality management) (Jacxsens et al., 2016;
    Louwagie et al., 2012) as well as the qualification of decision models (Costanzo
    and Faro, 2012; Dragincic et al., 2015) and the identification of decision parameters
    (region, land, climate, plant, time, process, etc.). 2.4. Artificial intelligence
    techniques Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques propose important contributions
    to knowledge model’s identification, service creation and the decision-making
    processes as support for the different Agri-Food’s applications (Solemane et al.,
    2019). AI offers formal general algorithms for prediction (Bhatt and Buch, 2015;
    Soh et al., 2018), accuracy and performance evaluation (Jeon et al., 2017) as
    well as pattern classification (Ott et al., 2003; Pinho et al., 2011; Starr, 2005)
    that might solve knowledge issues in the agricultural domain such as the pest’s
    identifications and the correct treating methods. In addition, AI supports applications
    in farming technics development: land allocation regarding the targeted activity
    (Pokhrel et al., 2018), irrigation process analysis and control (Ait-Mouheb et
    al., 2018; Mohanraj et al., 2017), robot guidance (Tian et al., 2018; Roshanianfard
    et al., 2018; Sheridan, 2016), etc. 2.5. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture emerges
    as a main concept in Agri-Food 4.0. By integrating new technology enablers propelled
    by the Industry 4.0 paradigm (Annosi et al., 2019), smart agriculture addresses
    important farming objectives as water saving (O’Connor and Mehta, 2016), soil
    conservation (Li et al., 2002), limit carbon emission (Ochoa et al., 2014) and
    productivity increasing (Mayer et al., 2015) by doing more with less. The new
    agricultural age aims to harmonize and share better local European policies and
    rules to scale the best farming practices and applications. Smart agriculture
    offers the opportunity to farmers, technology and service providers, governance
    agencies and other impacted stakeholders (financial organization, investors, traders,
    etc.) to share their experiences and preoccupations in the optimization in the
    farming Supply Chain with the close respect of production sustainability (Swisher
    et al., 2018; Oberholster et al., 2015). 2.6. Precision farming techniques and
    robot development The Precision Farming topic is already covered by other H2020
    calls (SFS-05-2017, SFS-06-2018-2020, SFS-08-2018-2019, etc.). The analysis of
    released projects outcomes and related research issues allows to identify new
    technologies, processes and applications in agriculture. Relevant models are proposed
    for land, grain and arable related activities (Gumma et al., 2016). Relevant listed
    results cover harvesting distribution accuracy (Roshanianfard et al., 2018; Kamata
    et al., 2018; Alzahrani, 2018), cost development (Pomar et al., 2010) and distribution
    optimization (Zhou et al., 2018; Tabatabaie et al., 2013; Ruiz-Garcia et al.,
    2010; Eisele et al., 2001). Within the Agri-Food projects is planned to reuse
    available precision farming technologies and results to improve the quality of
    targeted farmers’ processes and applications. Results in the integration of robots
    in agriculture are well mature and already proposed by Agri-Food stakeholders.
    With precision farming enablers, it will be ensured the performance of impacted
    farming processes. Agriculture Robots are already investigated in the precision
    farming topic. Recent research in this area covers the adaptability of robot design
    to the agriculture sector, the improvement of navigation conditions through additional
    sensing (Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2017; Jhonattan et al., 2019) and localization
    capabilities as well as real-time image processing (Xu et al., 2017; Pilli et
    al., 2015) and camera detection (Dworak et al., 2013) to maximize the operational
    capabilities and behaviour of robots and collaborative robots (cobots). Robots
    can assist humans (Chilcanan et al., 2017; Dondeynaz et al., 2013) for difficult
    tasks or replace them for difficult ones. The cost reduction (Pomar et al., 2010)
    effectiveness is demonstrated and research in decision error reduction (Montecinos
    et al., 2018; Shin and Ko, 2017; Brigido et al., 2015) is intensive to improve
    accuracy by simulation (Xu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Latorre-Biel et al.,
    2018) and by more precise path finding (Spekken et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2017)
    and guidance algorithms (Kviz et al., 2014; Baio, 2012). The new Agri-Food projects
    fund the integration of Agriculture Robots to support the applications since the
    beginning to ensure the maximum results. Building resilient and sustainable farming
    system is the ultimate concept behind Agriculture 4.0. Recent research in this
    topic covers farming processes sustainability analysis (McGuire and Sperling,
    2013; Joly, 2005), farming activity calibration (Suryoputro et al., 2017; Hosseini
    et al., 2014; do Nascimento et al., 2012) (rotation cycles, control of accuracy),
    the development of conservation protocols (Kladivko et al., 2014; Gaspary et al.,
    2002) and the alignment of business development strategies. 3. How the new digital
    technology transforms the agri-food supply chains To achieve robust, resilient
    and sustainable agri-food supply chains is very complex because they face more
    sources of uncertainty and risks in comparison with other supply chains that give
    rise to serious questions and concerns about their economic, environmental and
    social performance. Several studies identify agricultural sources of uncertainty
    (Mundi et al., 2019; Esteso et al., 2017; Esteso et al., 2018) and how to model
    them (Grillo et al., 2019). In Esteso et al. (2018) four types of crop-based uncertainty
    are identified: Product (shelf-life, deterioration rate, lack of homogeneity,
    food quality and food safety), Process (harvesting yield, supply lead time, resource
    needs, production), Market (demand, market prices) and Environment (weather, pests
    & diseases and regulations). Poor management of these sources of uncertainty can
    have a very negative impact on safety, quality, quantity and waste of products
    as well as human, technological and natural resources. Indeed, the agri-food sector
    is one of the economic and political areas worldwide, with key implications in
    sustainability to cover not only the food needs of the population, contribute
    to their employability and economic growth, but also in the impact on the natural
    environment (Iakovou et al., 2014). Therefore, the agri-food supply chains are
    strongly pressured to manage these sources of uncertainty and risks whose precise
    evolution over time is unknown but may jeopardize the future sustainability of
    these type of supply chains. It is necessary to move away from “business as usual”
    developing new solutions and implement innovative technologies (FAO, 2018). Along
    these lines, a digitalized supply chain, allows companies to monitor material
    flows in real time making potential risks visible and develop future plans to
    face them. The main drivers for the digitalization of the processes of SC are
    usually the increase of the flexibility and the speed of reaction of the industrial/logistical
    systems (ten Hompel and Henke, 2017a, ten Hompel and Henke, 2017b) as well as
    the improvement of agri-food supply chain robustness and resilience. In this context,
    data becomes crucial. Data is the lifeblood of any business and the agricultural
    business is not an exception but rather a referent. The new technologies have
    a great impact on the reduction of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise
    data in real time, whose treatment, together with the capacities of autonomous
    and intelligent decision making will help to increase the efficiency, sustainability,
    flexibility, agility, and the resilience along the whole supply chain from the
    farmers to the final customers. In the context of data-driven supply chains, the
    new technologies listed in the previous section, provide different and complementary
    support to the sequence of activities from data chain (Wolfert et al., 2017):
    data capture, storage, transfer, transformation, analytics and marketing. The
    support of each technology to different data chain activities lets envisage that
    the true potential of the data comes from the combination and integration of these
    technologies. Indeed, each one will improve some of the following basic functions
    of agri-food supply chains: sensing, monitoring, control, analysis (descriptive
    capabilities), prediction (predictive capabilities), decision-making (prescriptive
    capabilities) and adaptive learning. Through the sensing, monitoring, control
    and analysis it is possible to the early and accurate detection of problems and
    even predicting them before occurring, making better decisions and learn of them
    improving the sustainability and resilience of agri-food supply chains. In fact,
    the integration of previous technologies allows a more intelligent management
    of the agri-food supply chains, being able to combine multiple models of independent
    data analysis, repositories of historical data and data flows in real time. Real-time
    information and data processing tools provide new opportunities for companies
    to react more quickly to changing conditions in the supply chain. Due to this
    integrated intelligence, the agri-food supply chain management goes from supporting
    decisions to delegating them and, ultimately, to predicting which decisions should
    be taken. From all the above, there is no doubt that these new technologies are
    transforming the way agricultural sector organize and make decisions. In order
    to provide a general overview about how the new digital technology transforms
    the agri-food supply chains, the tables (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) integrate
    and classify the main positive impacts of the most relevant technologies as well
    as the challenges to be faced according to recent studies in the field carried
    by different authors. Table 1. IoT: Impact and Challenges. Internet of Things

    • Cultural adoption: blockchain represents a complete shift to a decentralized
    network which requires the buy-in of its users and operators. Technological Challenges:
    • Blockchain integration with other technologies (BDA, IoT, CPS) • Strategize
    the transition: blockchain applications offer solutions that require significant
    changes to, or complete replacement of, existing systems. • Limited storage capacity
    and scalability • Control, security, and privacy: while solutions exist, including
    private or permissioned blockchains and strong encryption, there are still cyber
    security concerns that need to be addressed before the general public will entrust
    their personal data to a blockchain solution. • Throughput and latency issue:
    in the context of agri-food Supply Chain management, due to the original restriction
    of block size and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current
    processing capacity of blockchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing
    millions of transactions in real-time • Infrastructure and capacity development
    challenges: it can only be applied as long as an internet connection is available,
    which can still be a challenge in some developing countries Table 3. Big Data

    there are multiple actors involved • Big Data trust, privacy and security among
    actors • Big Data Monetization (transfer of rights on data) Social Challenges:
    • Demonstrate value of innovations as compared its costs, to encourage companies

    sources: sensors, Internet of things (IoT), mobile devices, online social networks,
    in structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats) • Velocity (real-time
    data processing) • Veracity (ensure quality and reliability) • Value (provide
    more value and insights from data) • Valence (support of connectivity in data).
    The potential of connectivity between systems is being constrained by a lack of
    common data standards or easy-to-use ontologies. • Combine the three levels of
    analytics: the performance of prescriptive analytics would heavily rely on those
    of descriptive and predictive analytics since providing the value of input parameters
    in the prescriptive model • Combining different data analytic techniques to develop
    more advanced and adaptive BDA models for DSS • Lack of decision support tools
    and willingness to share data • New tools and BDA techniques for distributed SC
    and distributed computation Integration with other technologies • Openness of
    platforms to accelerate solution development and innovation in general but also
    empower farmers in their position in supply chains. Table 4. Artificial Intelligence:

    good decisions, additive effect of knowledge of many domain experts, facilitates
    real-time, low-cost expert-level decisions by the non-expert, enhance the utilization
    of most of the available data • Learning ability Artificial Intelligence, goes
    a step further by not simply applying pre-programmed decisions, but instead exhibiting
    some learning capabilities • Data transformation: ML and AI can help create value

    interpretations of the wide variety of unstructured data increasingly available.
    Technological Impact: • Advancement of ML with machine vision will make agricultural
    technologies accurate, robust and low cost. • AI can be used to identify and clean
    dirty data or use dirty data as a means of establishing context knowledge for
    the data. • AI contributes to the velocity of data, by facilitating rapid computer-based

    in regional languages to be more accessible Challenges Social Challenges: • Replacement
    of human intervention perceived as a threat Technological Challenges: • AI to
    further facilitate additional developments on visualization • AI algorithms designed
    for single-machine environments might have emergent subproblem structures useful
    for parallelization. • Adding speech interface to the system may be proved to
    be more beneficial for the farmers of the remote area • Expert systems will not
    be able to give the creative responses that human experts can give in unusual
    circumstances. • Lack of flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments.
    • Not being able to recognize when no answer is available. • Knowledge acquisition
    remains the major bottleneck in applying expert system technology to new domains.
    • Maintenance and extension of a rule base can be difficult for a relatively large
    rule base • Enhance IoT with machine learning techniques to analyse data captured
    by sensors in real time in agriculture. As it can be seen in the above tables,
    some challenges of these digital technologies appear as strengths of others. This
    allows intuiting the suitability of using them as complements with the others.
    Indeed, in the near future, the full potential of data will rely on the combination
    of the different technologies that enhance data-driven agri-food supply chains
    more informed, efficient, secure, sustainable and resilient. For instance, IoT
    and BDA can benefit from blockchain providing data security, anonymity, trust
    and decentralization. Since blockchain exchange information in a distributed network,
    novel IoT applications will be developed for distributed environments. On the
    other side, the valuable data generated from the IoT could enrich transaction
    details that are registered on the blockchain (Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018).
    In turn, the accurate data provided by blockchain technology can be used as input
    for AI applications and to also record their outputs (Rabah et al., 2018). Besides,
    AI can enhance IoT by developing applications to analyse data captured by sensors
    in real time using machine learning algorithms (Reshma and Pillai, 2018). Machine
    learning and other analytic methods can also improve predictive and prescriptive
    capabilities (decision making) of Big Data Analytics. There is a broad consensus
    on the need to strengthen research and innovation in the Agri-food sector, both
    in terms of practices and technologies, through the creation of new products,
    the improvement of processes, services or processes or the integration of digital
    possibilities. Indeed, one of the persisting challenges to take advantage of the
    full potential of the data is to achieve not only the integration of these technologies
    but also their interoperability. Diversity of stakeholders integrating agri-food
    supply chains with different interests and characteristics make difficult to find
    solutions that fit all those involved, so group decision-making tools should be
    developed (Zaraté et al., 2019). Moreover, when these solutions require significant
    investments and there are stakeholders, such as small farmers with a limited budget.
    For this reason, it will be key to demonstrate the value of innovations as compared
    to their companies and to collect and exchange data. Other challenges reside on
    the needs of data standards. The standardization of the fruition data would provide
    equity for all stakeholders because of the possibility to access to the same information
    that might provide financial gain. The fruition data might provide the training
    for ensuring the availability of the required technical skills and definition
    of regulatory actions by governments. Research may be co-financed with partners
    private (e.g., companies or business groups), government (many departments and
    agencies involved) or institutional (e. g. universities). This approach accentuates
    the effect leverage government support and improve the transfer of innovations
    to businesses. It enables the training of highly qualified personnel and a new
    generation of scientists for companies and centres of research. The stability
    of funding agreements with the centres promote the retention of their qualified
    staff and facilitate partnerships with industry for the realization of structuring
    projects. Access to appropriate funding and research tax credits and development
    (R&D) is also a source of funding structuring for the industry to absorb financial
    risks generated by innovation activities (Tuhin et al., 2019). This type of financing
    is particularly important when innovation takes place directly in the company,
    which is often the case in food processing. 4. The new models of the Agri-Food
    supply chains The competitiveness of food processing companies depends on their
    investment capacity, the increase in their production, the development of new
    products and the implementation of processes to stand out from the competition
    (Guoqing et al., 2020). Over the past 30 years, we have seen a significant reduction
    in biodiversity, FAO estimates that we will have a 70 % reduction in biodiversity
    on our planet by 2050 (FAO, 2018). Human activities seem to be the main cause
    of this loss. The agriculture has many cards in hand to slow this process by implementing
    environmental protection practices and reducing the chemicals that have led to
    the destruction of many animals and insects living on land, in the air and in
    the water; creating green corridors and shelters for animals and insects; the
    cultivation of old species or species with high genetic variability, leaving the
    design of hybrid plants and monocultures that lead to significant genetic depletion;
    the reduction of arable land to make way for the replanting of forests, grasslands
    and hedges. The competitiveness is addressed to a new way of thinking the Agriculture
    that will let to optimize the process and respecting the nature. The labour shortage
    in many regions of Europe requires processing companies to automate and robotize
    their processes. In addition, investment in these new technologies allows them
    to improve their productivity and provide better working conditions necessary
    to the attraction and retention of the workforce. In addition, to meet the quality
    standards requirements of large chains and food retailers, they must use recognised
    quality management and traceability systems. Investment in digital technologies
    also promotes automation of operations, data management and access to a new range
    of management tools (Industry 4.0). The industry is particularly requested, as
    shown in the previous section, for the use of digital technologies, which allows
    it to optimize production and the supply chain while ensuring traceability of
    food from more and more pointed (Panetto et al., 2019). It is not new that, nowadays,
    agricultures supply chain practices, especially regarding to food products, are
    currently under public scrutiny. As established by Van Der Vorst (2006), this
    is because several factors, which considers food contamination issues, the new
    consumer healthy requirements, requirements for more precise information about
    the farming, marketing, and distribution practices used to bring the agricultural
    products into the shelves into supermarket, to name a few. In this same context,
    and regarding to Suprem et al. (2013), agricultural industry has been solely dependent
    on human labour with limited application of mechanical equipment and machines.
    Moreover, the applications of advanced technology such as embedded computing,
    robotics, wireless technology, GPS/GIS (Geographical Positioning System/Geographical
    Information System) and DBMS (Database Management System) software are seen to
    be recent developments, where regulations are vaguely considered. Moreover, the
    increasing gap between farmer''s expectations and the ability of the government
    led extension services has created a big business opportunity for private parties
    (Kumar and Ali, 2007). In this context, the information about the geometric properties
    of crops provided by digital based techniques, such as: ultrasound, digital photographic
    techniques, light sensors, high-resolution radar images, high-resolution X-ray
    computed tomography, stereo vision and LIDAR sensors; has innumerable applications
    in agriculture. Some important agricultural tasks that can benefit from these
    plant-geometry characterization techniques are the application of pesticides,
    irrigation, fertilization and crop training, improving the environmental and economic
    impact. But there is still a need to resolve several technological and commercial
    questions (Rosell et al., 2012). In line to this, agriculture technologies are
    focused on how traceability can be performed, in fact, the food industry had developed
    efficient traceability methods for the management of logistics and warehouses,
    based on the balance of costs and benefits of the traceability system level (Dabbene
    et al., 2013). Because of this, several authors are currently reviewing main agriculture
    supply chain technology based methods, and example of this is provided by Ahumada
    and Villalobos (2008), who identified that the use of integrated planning models
    in the agriculture supply chains is still very limited, with a high potential
    to manage perishable agri-food products, especially to deal with complex environments.
    In addition, (Ali and Kumar, 2011a) study the implication of using ICT in agriculture.
    From the authors’ findings it is highly appreciated that there is still a medium
    level of dissemination of information and knowledge sharing in agricultural developments
    (Boshkoska et al., 2019), as well as there is still a need for empirical evidences
    as to how ICT interventions are enabling the farmers to take informed decisions.
    Complementary to this, S. Araba and M. Fellows (Araba and Fellows, 2009) address
    that the majority of current research have not established a clear link between
    public access to ICTs and socioeconomic change/impacts in agriculture. In fact,
    there is a need for researchers to go beyond anecdotal evidence of downstream
    public access impacts on end‐users. Nevertheless, it is also evidenced that there
    is still limited ability on information to make definitive statements about agriculture
    expected impacts, as well as to identify and attribute specific impacts to specific
    ICT usage. Table 5 presents a summary on well-known methods and approached to
    support this, in special the agriculture supply chain decision-making methods.

    Hence, and as depicted from Table 1, as studied and established by Reardon et
    al. (2019), the food system can be thought of as “dendritic,” linking R&D, finance,
    input, and output supply chains. This means (1) the first and “core” supply chain,
    is the output Supply Chain. The second and upstream “feeder” supply chains are
    the farm input supply chains. The third and downstream ‘feeder’ supply chains
    are those supplying inputs to the post-farmgate segments. The fourth “pan-system
    feeder” supply chain is that supplying finance into every segment of every chain
    in the dendritic system. The fifth ‘feeder’ supply chain is a broad set of public
    assets apart from agricultural research institutions. The sixth set of “feeders”
    is the R&D supply chains, which supply technology and product innovations. Moreover,
    the ICT challenges in Agriculture supply chains are still open. Birkel in Birkel
    and Hartmann (2019), studied most of the recent ICT developments in this field,
    and found that most of the technological challenges in agriculture mainly includes
    security issues, lack of standards and interoperability, as well as hardware and
    software limitations are the focus of current research. Hence, the main challenges
    and risks are also in relation to the methodology, where (Ben-Daya et al., 2017)
    has revealed that the design aspect is primarily identified as a technological
    issue, while neglecting social and political challenges. Food processing companies''
    projects must benefit from financial levers that the government makes available
    to all in the manufacturing sector (Hernández et al., 2020). In order to further
    stimulate the investments, particularly in the SMEs and in innovative sectors,
    from financial tools considering the needs of the processing sector are decisive
    for the development of the implementation of development projects (Hernandez et
    al., 2020). In a business environment characterized by technological innovation,
    the consolidation of industries, deregulation and demand for consumers in constant
    evolution, the approaches of the traditional managers can no longer allow for
    companies to remain profitable. They are therefore forced to find new ways to
    stay competitive in agri-food domain, as it is also the case for all other industrial
    sectors (Boehlje, 1999; Senge, 1997; Senge et al., 2006). In the value chain management
    (VCM) domain, the informed decision making to unite resources to improve the competitiveness,
    is proving to be a powerful strategic approach that allows organizations to adapt
    to an environment of business in full motion. (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011;
    Dunne, 2008; Fearne, 2007; Fernandez et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). The concept
    of a continuous observation results in continuous and significant improvement
    of the design and the system performance, this is only possible when the companies
    are able to establish a degree of coordination and integration with their suppliers
    and customers that do not allow them the usual relationships with the latter based
    on the transactional approach buyer-seller (Sparling, 2007). Closer strategic
    relationships with customers and suppliers allow companies to better learn and
    adapt (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Multiple firms that co-invent and work together
    for the same objectives using integrated processes can increase their performance
    in a much more significant way that if they had gone it alone (Bonney et al.,
    2007; Fearne, 2007). Co-innovation allows companies to improve their own practices
    as well as those of all of them, it is a process that gives companies competitive
    forces that are difficult to match by others (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011).
    Several of the cases mentioned below demonstrate the benefits sustainable and
    competitive products obtained by companies who have chosen to co-innovate with
    other members of their supply chain. 5. Conclusions, vision and perspectives For
    this scientific contribution to knowledge, more than two hundred papers support
    the analysis on scientific work on the smart agriculture technology trends, but,
    more importantly, on how they emerge as a main concept in the agriculture domain
    as Agri-Food 4.0. From this reviews and analysis, it is clearly revealed that
    integration across new technologies allows smart agriculture to address important
    farming objectives as water saving, soil conservation, limit carbon emission and
    productivity increasing by doing more with less. In fact, the new technologies
    have a positive impact and at the same time pose new challenges in the management
    of different domains of human knowledge. Hence, two main conceptual pillars impact
    and challenges, arising from the use of various technologies in the world of the
    new conception of agriculture are the fundamental aspects in Agri-Food 4.0. A
    precision is due. This paper focus principally on the factory farm model issued
    from the “western” style. In those farms, the Agri-Food 4.0 started to be applied
    and validated. The focus is more specialised on the industrial farming although
    the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted also to the organic and silvo-pasture
    paradigms. The paper pays attention particularly to four major technologies, the
    Internet of Things, the Blockchain, the Big data and the Artificial Intelligence.
    For each of those technologies is presented some type of impacts: functional,
    economic, environmental, social, related to the business and technological and
    the challenges that come with their introduction. The literature is segmented
    in relation to the functionality of the specific technology and a panoramic view
    gives the possibility to better understand the paths needed to face the new challenges.
    The future of the Agriculture domain is in the creation of a resilient and sustainable
    farming system. On the four types of crop-based uncertainty that have been identified:
    Product, Process, Market and Environment the core problem is the management. Poor
    management of these sources of uncertainty have a negative impact on safety, quality,
    quantity and waste of products as well as human, technological and natural resources.
    Today, and always more in the future, the data is the lifeblood of any business
    and the agricultural business is not an exception but rather a referent. As aforementioned
    in the discussion section, the new technologies have a great impact on the reduction
    of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise data in real time, and real-time
    information tools provide new opportunities for companies to react more quickly
    to changing conditions in the supply chain. Our interest in the next future is
    to use formal methods to extract knowledge from the interrelation of the difference
    technologies impacts and from the existing solutions to the highlighted challenges
    to increase the efficiency, sustainability, flexibility, agility, and the resilience
    along the whole supply chain from the farmers to the final customers, and the
    analysis and outcomes from this paper, will contribute to support that from the
    main research knowledge findings. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors,

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Voluminous amounts
    of data have been produced, since the past decade as the miniaturization of Internet
    of things (IoT) devices increases. However, such data are not useful without analytic
    power. Numerous big data, IoT, and analytics solutions have enabled people to
    obtain valuable insight into large data generated by IoT devices. However, these
    solutions are still in their infancy, and the domain lacks a comprehensive survey.
    This paper investigates the state-of-the-art research efforts directed toward
    big IoT data analytics. The relationship between big data analytics and IoT is
    explained. Moreover, this paper adds value by proposing a new architecture for
    big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big IoT data analytic types, methods, and
    technologies for big data mining are discussed. Numerous notable use cases are
    also presented. Several opportunities brought by data analytics in IoT paradigm
    are then discussed. Finally, open research challenges, such as privacy, big data
    mining, visualization, and integration, are presented as future research directions.
    Relationship between IoT and big data analytics. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume:
    5) Page(s): 5247 - 5261 Date of Publication: 29 March 2017 Electronic ISSN: 2169-3536
    DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2689040 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The development of big data and the Internet of things (IoT) is rapidly accelerating
    and affecting all areas of technologies and businesses by increasing the benefits
    for organizations and individuals. The growth of data produced via IoT has played
    a major role on the big data landscape. Big data can be categorized according
    to three aspects: (a) volume, (b) variety, and (c) velocity [1]. These categories
    were first introduced byGartner to describe the elements of big data challenges
    [2]. Immense opportunities are presented by the capability to analyze and utilize
    huge amounts of IoT data, including applications in smart cities, smart transport
    and grid systems, energy smart meters, and remote patient healthcare monitoring
    devices. The widespread popularity of IoT has made big data analytics challenging
    because of the processing and collection of data through different sensors in
    the IoT environment. The International Data Corporation (IDC) report indicates
    that the big data market will reach over US$125 billion by 2019 [3]. IoT big data
    analytics can be defined as the steps in which a variety of IoT data are examined
    [4] to reveal trends, unseen patterns, hidden correlations, and new information
    [5]. Companies and individuals can benefit from analyzing large amounts of data
    and managing huge amounts of information that can affect businesses [6]. Therefore,
    IoT big data analytics aims to assist business associations and other organizations
    to achieve improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed
    decisions. Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze huge
    amounts of unstructured data that can be harnessed using traditional tools [5].
    Moreover,big data analytics aims to immediately extract knowledgeable information
    using data mining techniques that help in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and making decisions [7]. Techniques in data
    mining are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized data
    analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    IoT data are different from normal big data collected via systems in terms of
    characteristics because of the various sensors and objects involved during data
    collection, which include heterogeneity, noise, variety, and rapid growth. Statistics
    [8] show that the number of sensors will be increased by 1 trillion in 2030. This
    increase will affect the growth of big data. Introducing data analytics and IoT
    into big data requires huge resources, and IoT has the capability to offer an
    excellent solution. Appropriate resources and intensive applications of the platforms
    are provided by IoT services for effective communication among various deployed
    applications. Such process is suitable for fulfilling the requirements of IoT
    applications, and can reduce some challenges in the future of big data analytics.
    This technological amalgamation increases the possibility of implementing IoT
    toward a better direction. Moreover, implementing IoT and big data integration
    solutions can help address issues on storage, processing, data analytics, and
    visualization tools. It can also assist in improving collaboration and communication
    among various objects in a smart city [9]. Application areas, such as smart ecological
    environments, smart traffic, smart grids, intelligent buildings, and logistic
    intelligent management, can benefit from the aforementioned arrangement. Many
    studies on big data has focused on big data management; in particular, big data
    analytics has been surveyed [10], [11]. However, this survey focused on IoT big
    data in the context of the analytics of a huge amount of data. The contributions
    of this survey are as follows. State-of-the-art research efforts conducted in
    terms of big data analytics are investigated. An architecture for big IoT data
    analytics is proposed. Several unprecedented opportunities brought by data analytics
    in the IoT domain are introduced. Credible use cases are presented. Research challenges
    that remain to be addressed are identified and discussed. These contributions
    are presented from Sections 3 to 6. The conclusion is provided in Section 7. SECTION
    II. Overview of IoT and Big Data An overview of IoT technologies and big data
    is provided before the discussion. A. IoT IoT offers a platform for sensors and
    devices to communicate seamlessly within a smart environment and enables information
    sharing across platforms in a convenient manner. The recent adaptation of different
    wireless technologies places IoT as the next revolutionary technology by benefiting
    from the full opportunities offered by the Internet technology. IoT has witnessed
    its recent adoption in smart cities with interest in developing intelligent systems,
    such as smart office, smart retail, smart agriculture, smart water, smart transportation,
    smart healthcare, and smart energy [12], [13]. IoT has emerged as a new trend
    in the last few years, where mobile devices, transportation facilities, public
    facilities, and home appliances can all be used as data acquisition equipment
    in IoT. All surrounding electronic equipment to facilitate daily life operations,
    such as wristwatches, vending machines, emergency alarms, and garage doors, as
    well as home appliances, such as refrigerators, microwave ovens, air conditioners,
    and water heaters are connected to an IoT network and can be controlled remotely.
    Ciufo [14] stated that these devices “talk” to one another and to central controlling
    devices. Such devices deployed in different areas may collect various kinds of
    data, such as geographical, astronomical, environmental, and logistical data.
    A large number of communication devices in the IoT paradigm are embedded into
    sensor devices in the real world. Data collecting devices sense data and transmit
    these data using embedded communication devices. The continuum of devices and
    objects are interconnected through a variety of communication solutions, such
    as Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee, and GSM. These communication devices transmit data
    and receive commands from remotely controlled devices, which allow direct integration
    with the physical world through computer-based systems to improve living standards.
    Over 50 billion devices ranging from smartphones, laptops, sensors, and game consoles
    are anticipated to be connected to the Internet through several heterogeneous
    access networks enabled by technologies, such as radio frequency identification
    (RFID) and wireless sensor networks. Reference [15] mentioned that IoT could be
    recognized in three paradigms: Internet-oriented, sensors, and knowledge [16].
    The recent adaptation of different wireless technologies places IoT as the next
    revolutionary technology by benefiting from the full opportunities offered by
    Internet technology. B. Big Data The volume of data generated by sensors, devices,
    social media, health care applications, temperature sensors, and various other
    software applications and digital devices that continuously generate large amounts
    of structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data is strongly increasing. This
    massive data generation results in “big data” [17]. Traditional database systems
    are inefficient when storing, processing, and analyzing rapidly growing amount
    of data or big data [18]. The term “big data” has been used in the previous literature
    but is relatively new in business and IT [19]. An example of big data-related
    studies is the next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity; McKinsey
    Global Institute [20] defined big data as the size of data sets that are a better
    database system tool than the usual tools for capturing, storing, processing,
    and analyzing such data [18]. “The Digital Universe” study [21] labels big data
    technologies as a new generation of technologies and architectures that aim to
    take out the value from a massive volume of data with various formats by enabling
    high-velocity capture, discovery, and analysis. This previous study also characterizes
    big data into three aspects: (a) data sources, (b) data analytics, and (c) the
    presentation of the results of the analytics. This definition uses the 3V’s (volume,
    variety, velocity) model proposed by Beyer [2]. The model highlights an e-commerce
    trend in data management that faces challenges to manage volume or size of data,
    variety or different sources of data, and velocity or speed of data creation.
    Some studies declare volume as a main characteristic of big data without providing
    a pure definition [22]. However, other researchers introduced additional characteristics
    for big data, such as veracity, value, variability, and complexity [23], [24].
    The 3V’s model, or its derivations, is the most common descriptions of the term
    “big data.” SECTION III. Big Data Analytics Big data analytics involves the processes
    of searching a database, mining, and analyzing data dedicated to improve company
    performance [25]. Big data analytics is the process of examining large data sets
    that contain a variety of data types [4] to reveal unseen patterns, hidden correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful business information [5].
    The capability to analyze large amounts of data can help an organization deal
    with considerable information that can affect the business [6]. Therefore, the
    main objective of big data analytics is to assist business associations to have
    improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed decisions.
    Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze a large volume
    of data that may not be harnessed using traditional tools [5]. Big data analytics
    require technologies and tools that can transform a large amount of structured,
    unstructured, and semi-structured data into a more understandable data and metadata
    format for analytical processes. The algorithms used in these analytical tools
    must discover patterns, trends, and correlations over a variety of time horizons
    in the data [26]. After analyzing the data, these tools visualize the findings
    in tables, graphs, and spatial charts for efficient decision making. Thus, big
    data analysis is a serious challenge for many applications because of data complexity
    and the scalability of underlying algorithms that support such processes [27].
    Talia (2013) highlighted that obtaining helpful information from big data analysis
    is a critical matter that requires scalable analytical algorithms and techniques
    to return well-timed results, whereas current techniques and algorithms are inefficient
    to handle big data analytics. Therefore, large infrastructure and additional applications
    are necessary to support data parallelism. Moreover, data sources, such as high-speed
    data stream received from different data sources, have different formats, which
    makes integrating multiple sources for analytics solutions critical [28]. Hence,
    the challenge is focused on the performance of current algorithms used in big
    data analysis, which is not rising linearly with the rapid increase in computational
    resources [19]. Big data analytics processes consume considerable time to provide
    feedback and guidelines to users, whereas only a few tools [29] can process huge
    data sets within reasonable amount of processing time. By contrast, most of the
    remaining tools use the complicated trial-and-error method to deal with massive
    amounts of data sets and data heterogeneity [30]. Big data analytics systems exist.
    For example, the Exploratory Data Analysis Environment [31] is a big data visual
    analytics system that is used to analyze complex earth system simulations with
    large numbers of data sets. A. Existing Analytics Systems Different analytic types
    are used according to the requirements of IoT applications [32]. These analytic
    types are discussed in this subsection under real-time, off-line, memory-level,
    business intelligence (BI) level, and massive level analytics categories. Moreover,
    a comparison based on analytics types and their levels is presented in Table 1.
    TABLE 1 Comparison of Different Analytics Types and Their Levels Real-time analytics
    is typically performed on data collected from sensors. In this situation, data
    change constantly, and rapid data analytics techniques are required to obtain
    an analytical result within a short period. Consequently, two existing architectures
    have been proposed for real-time analysis: parallel processing clusters using
    traditional relational databases and memory-based computing platforms [33]. Greenplum
    [34] and Hana [35] are examples of real-time analytics architecture. Off-line
    analytics is used when a quick response is not required [32]. For example, many
    Internet enterprises use Hadoop-based off-line analytics architecture to reduce
    the cost of data format conversion [36]. Such analytics improves data acquisition
    efficiency. SCRIBE [37], Kafka [38], Time-Tunnel [39], and Chukwa [40] are examples
    of architectures that conduct off-line analytics and can satisfy the demands of
    data acquisition. Memory-level analytics is applied when the size of data is smaller
    than the memory of a cluster [32]. To date, the memory of clusters has reached
    terabyte (TB) level [41]. Therefore, several internal database technologies are
    required to improve analytical efficiency. Memory-level analytics is suitable
    for conducting real-time analysis. MongoDB [42] is an example of this architecture.
    BI analytics is adopted when the size of data is larger than the memory level,
    but in this case, data may be imported to the BI analysis environment [43]. BI
    analytic currently supports TB-level data [32]. Moreover, BI can help discover
    strategic business opportunities from the flood of data. In addition, BI analytics
    allows easy interpretation of data volumes. Identifying new opportunities and
    implementing an effective strategy provide competitive market advantage and long-term
    stability. Massive analytics is applied when the size of data is greater than
    the entire capacity of the BI analysis product and traditional databases [44].
    Massive analytics uses the Hadoop distributed file system for data storage and
    map/reduce for data analysis. Massive analytics helps create the business foundation
    and increases market competitiveness by extracting meaningful values from data.
    Moreover, massive analytics obtains accurate data that leverage the risks involved
    in making any business decision. In addition, massive analytics provides services
    effectively. B. Relationship Between IoT and Big Data Analytics Big data analytics
    is rapidly emerging as a key IoT initiative to improve decision making. One of
    the most prominent features of IoT is its analysis of information about “connected
    things.” Big data analytics in IoT requires processing a large amount of data
    on the fly and storing the data in various storage technologies. Given that much
    of the unstructured data are gathered directly from web-enabled “things,” big
    data implementations will necessitate performing lightning-fast analytics with
    large queries to allow organizations to gain rapid insights, make quick decisions,
    and interact with people and other devices. The interconnection of sensing and
    actuating devices provide the capability to share information across platforms
    through a unified architecture and develop a common operating picture for enabling
    innovative applications. The need to adopt big data in IoT applications is compelling.
    These two technologies have already been recognized in the fields of IT and business.
    Although, the development of big data is already lagging, these technologies are
    inter-dependent and should be jointly developed. In general, the deployment of
    IoT increases the amount of data in quantity and category; hence, offering the
    opportunity for the application and development of big data analytics. Moreover,
    the application of big data technologies in IoT accelerates the research advances
    and business models of IoT. The relationship between IoT and big data, which is
    shown in Figure 1, can be divided into three steps to enable the management of
    IoT data. The first step comprises managing IoT data sources, where connected
    sensors devices use applications to interact with one another. For example, the
    interaction of devices such as CCTV cameras, smart traffic lights, and smart home
    devices, generates large amounts of data sources with different formats. This
    data can be stored in low cost commodity storage on the cloud. In the second step,
    the generated data are called “big data,” which are based on their volume, velocity,
    and variety. These huge amounts of data are stored in big data files in shared
    distributed fault-tolerant databases. The last step applies analytics tools such
    as MapReduce, Spark, Splunk, and Skytree that can analyze the stored big IoT data
    sets. The four levels of analytics start from training data, then move on to analytics
    tools, queries, and reports. FIGURE 1. Relationship between IoT and big data analytics.
    Show All C. Big Data Analytics Methods Big data analytics aim to immediately extract
    knowledgeable information that helps in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and ultimately, making decisions [7]. Data
    mining techniques are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized
    data analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    The evolution of big data also changes analytics requirements. Although the requirements
    for efficient mechanisms lie in all aspects of big data management [30], such
    as capturing, storage, preprocessing, and analysis; for our discussion, big data
    analytics requires the same or faster processing speed than traditional data analytics
    with minimum cost for high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data [45].
    Various solutions are available for big data analytics, and advancements in developing
    and improving these solutions are being continuously achieved to make them suitable
    for new big data trends. Data mining plays an important role in analytics, and
    most of the techniques are developed using data mining algorithms according to
    a particular scenario. Knowledge on available big data analytics options is crucial
    when evaluating and choosing an appropriate approach for decision making. In this
    section, we present several methods that can be implemented for several big data
    case studies. Some of these analytics methods are efficient for big IoT data analytics.
    Diverse and tremendous size data sets contribute more in big data insights. However,
    this belief is not always valid because more data may have more ambiguities and
    abnormalities [7]. We present big data analytics methods under classification,
    clustering, association rule mining, and prediction categories. Figure 2 depicts
    and summarizes each of these categories. Each category is a data mining function
    and involves many methods and algorithms to fulfill information extraction and
    analysis requirements. For example, Bayesian network, support vector machine (SVM),
    and k -nearest neighbor (KNN) offer classification methods. Similarly, partitioning,
    hierarchical clustering, and co-occurrence are widespread in clustering. Association
    rule mining and prediction comprise significant methods. FIGURE 2. Overview of
    big data analytics methods. Show All Classification is a supervised learning approach
    that uses prior knowledge as training data to classify data objects into groups
    [46]. A predefined category is assigned to an object, and thus, the objective
    of predicting a group or class for an object is achieved (see Figure 2). Finding
    unknown or hidden patterns is more challenging for big IoT data. Furthermore,
    extracting valuable information from large data sets to improve decision making
    is a critical task. A Bayesian network is a classification method that offers
    model interpretability. Bayesian networks are efficient for analyzing complex
    data structures revealed through big data rather than traditional structured data
    formats. These networks are directed acyclic graphs, where nodes are random variables
    and edges denote conditional dependency [47]. Naïve, selective naïve, semi-naïve
    Bayes, and Bayes multi-nets are the proposed categories for classification [48].
    Analyzing data patterns and creating groups are efficiently performed using SVM,
    which is also classification approach for big data analytics. SVM utilizes statistical
    learning theory to analyze data patterns and create groups. Several applications
    of SVM classification in big data analytics include text classification [49],
    pattern matching [50], health diagnostics [51], and commerce. Similarly, KNN is
    typically designed to provide efficient mechanisms for finding hidden patterns
    from big data sets, such that retrieved objects are similar to the predefined
    category [52]. Using cases further improve the KNN algorithm for application in
    anomaly detection [53], high-dimensional data [54], and scientific experiments
    [55]. Classification has other extensions while adopting a large number of artificial
    intelligence and data mining techniques. Consequently, classification is one of
    the widespread data mining techniques for big data analytics. Clustering is another
    data mining technique used as a big data analytics method. Contrary to classification,
    clustering uses an unsupervised learning approach and creates groups for given
    objects based on their distinctive meaningful features [56]. As we have presented
    in Figure 2 that grouping a large number of objects in the form of clusters makes
    data manipulation simple. The well-known methods used for clustering are hierarchical
    clustering and partitioning. The hierarchical clustering approach keeps combining
    small clusters of data objects to form a hierarchical tree and create agglomerative
    clusters. Divisive clusters are created in the opposite manner by dividing a single
    cluster that contains all data objects into smaller appropriate clusters [57].
    Market analysis and business decision making are the most significant applications
    of big data analytics. The process of association rule mining involves identifying
    interesting relationships among different objects, events, or other entities to
    analyze market trends, consumer buying behavior, and product demand predictions
    (see Figure 2). Association rule mining [58] focuses on identifying and creating
    rules based on the frequency of occurrences for numeric and non-numeric data.
    Data processing is performed in two manners under association rules. First, sequential
    data processing uses priori-based algorithms, such as MSPS [59] and LAPIN-SPAM
    [60], to identify interaction associations. Another significant data processing
    approach under association rule is temporal sequence analysis, which uses algorithms
    to analyze event patterns in continuous data. Predictive analytics use historical
    data, which are known as training data, to determine the results as trends or
    behavior in data. SVM and fuzzy logic algorithms are used to identify relationships
    between independent and dependent variables and to obtain regression curves for
    predictions, such as for natural disasters. Furthermore, customer buying predictions
    and social media trends are analyzed through predictive analytics [61] (see Table
    2). In the case of big data analytics, processing requirements are modified according
    to the nature and volume of data. Fast data access and mining methods for structured
    and unstructured data are major concerns related to big data analytics. Furthermore,
    data representation is a significant requirement in big data analytics. Time series
    analysis reduces high dimensionality associated with big data and offers representation
    for improved decision making. Research related to time series representation includes
    ARMA [62], bitmaps [63], and wavelet functions [64]. TABLE 2 Applications of Big
    Data Mining for IoT The big data analytics methods discussed in this section are
    widely adopted in many application areas of big data, such as disaster management,
    healthcare, business, industry, and e-governance. In Table 2, we present the application
    areas of big data mining functionalities that are elaborated in this section,
    ‘ ✓ ’ is used to show the support for an application whereas ‘-’ denotes that
    it is not obvious whether the method supports to an application or not. In particular,
    Table 2 shows that classification methods are suitable for medical imaging, industry,
    speech recognition, natural language processing, and e-governance. Clustering
    and association rule-based data analytics methods are applicable to industry and
    e-governance and are well adopted in healthcare, e-commerce, and bioinformatics.
    Predictive analytics are useful for disaster and market predictions, whereas time
    series analysis is used in disaster forecasting, medical imaging, speech recognition,
    social network analysis, and e-governance. D. IoT Architecture for Big Data Analytics
    The architectural concept of IoT has several definitions based on IoT domain abstraction
    and identification. It offers a reference model that defines relationships among
    various IoT verticals, such as, smart traffic, smart home, smart transportation,
    and smart health. The architecture for big data analytics offers a design for
    data abstraction. Furthermore, this standard provides a reference architecture
    that builds upon the reference model. Many IoT architectures are found in the
    literature [13], [66], [67]. For example, [13] offered an IoT architecture with
    cloud computing at the center and a model of end-to-end interaction among various
    stakeholders in a cloud-centric IoT framework for better comparison with the proposed
    IoT architecture. This architecture is achieved by seamless ubiquitous sensing,
    data analytics, and information representation with IoT as the unifying architecture.
    However, the current architecture focuses on IoT with regard to communications.
    To our knowledge, our proposed architecture, which integrates IoT and big data
    analytics, has not been studied in the current literature. Figure 3 illustrates
    the IoT architecture and big data analytics. In this figure, the sensor layer
    contains all the sensor devices and the objects, which are connected through a
    wireless network. This wireless network communication can be RFID, WiFi, ultra-wideband,
    ZigBee, and Bluetooth. The IoT gateway allows communication of the Internet and
    various webs. The upper layer concerns big data analytics, where a large amount
    of data received from sensors are stored in the cloud and accessed through big
    data analytics applications. These applications contain API management and a dashboard
    to help in the interaction with the processing engine. FIGURE 3. IoT architecture
    and big data analytics. Show All A novel meta-model-based approach for integrating
    IoT architecture objects is proposed. The concept is semi-automatically federated
    into a holistic digital enterprise architecture environment. The main objective
    is to provide an adequate decision support for complex business, architecture
    management with the development of assessment systems, and IT environment. Thus,
    architectural decisions for IoT are closely connected with code implementation
    to allow users to understand the integration of enterprise architecture management
    with IoT. SECTION IV. Use Cases This section presents a number of use cases for
    big IoT data analytics. Although the use cases are relevant to IoT applications,
    the choices have been guided for the ones that are most commonly used in IoT applications
    and for the amount of data that can be generated for analytics. A. Smart Metering
    Smart metering is one of the IoT application use cases that generates a large
    amount of data from different sources, such as smart grids, tank levels, and water
    flows, and silos stock calculation, in which processing takes a long time even
    on a dedicated and powerful machine [68]. A smart meter is a device that electronically
    records consumption of electric energy data between the meter and the control
    system. Collecting and analyzing smart meter data in IoT environment assist the
    decision maker in predicting electricity consumption. Furthermore, the analytics
    of a smart meter can also be used to forecast demands to prevent crises and satisfy
    strategic objectives through specific pricing plans. Thus, utility companies must
    be capable of high-volume data management and advanced analytics designed to transform
    data into actionable insights. B. Smart Transportation A smart transportation
    system is an IoT-based use case that aims to support the smart city concept. A
    smart transportation system intends to deploy powerful and advanced communication
    technologies for the management of smart cities. Traditional transportation systems,
    which are based on image processing, are affected by weather conditions, such
    as heavy rains and thick fog. Consequently, the captured image may not be clearly
    visible. The design of an e-plate system [69] using RFID technology provides a
    good solution for intelligent monitoring, tracking, and identification of vehicles.
    Moreover, introducing IoT into vehicular technologies will enable traffic congestion
    management to exhibit significantly better performance than the existing infrastructure.
    This technology can improve existing traffic systems in which vehicles can effectively
    communicate with one another in a systematic manner without human intervention.
    Satellite navigation systems and sensors can also be applied in trucks, ships,
    and airplanes in real time. The routing of these vehicles can be optimized by
    using the bulk of available public data, such as traffic jams, road conditions,
    delivery addresses, weather conditions, and locations of refilling stations. For
    example, in case of runtime address change, the updated information (route, cost)
    can be optimized, recalculated, and passed on to drivers in real time. Sensors
    incorporated into these vehicles can also provide real-time information to measure
    engine health, determine whether equipment requires maintenance, and predict errors
    [70]. C. Smart Supply Chains Embedded sensor technologies can communicate bidirectionally
    and provide remote accessibility to over 1 million elevators worldwide [71]. The
    captured data are used by on-and off-site technicians to run diagnostics and repair
    options to make appropriate decisions, which result in increased machine uptime
    and enhanced customer service. Ultimately, big IoT data analytics allows a supply
    chain to execute decisions and control the external environment. IoT-enabled factory
    equipment will be able to communicate within data parameters (i.e., machine utilization,
    temperature) and optimize performance by changing equipment settings or process
    workflow [72]. In-transit visibility is another use case that will play a vital
    role in future supply chains in the presence of IoT infrastructure. Key technologies
    used by in-transit visibility are RFIDs and cloud-based Global Positioning System
    (GPS), which provide location, identity, and other tracking information. These
    data will be the backbone of supply chains supported by IoT technologies. The
    information gathered by equipment will provide detailed visibility of an item
    shipped from a manufacturer to a retailer. Data collected via RFID and GPS technologies
    will allow supply chain managers to enhance automated shipment and accurate delivery
    information by predicting time of arrival. Similarly, managers will be able to
    monitor other information, such as temperature control, which can affect the quality
    of in-transit products. D. Smart Agriculture Smart agriculture is a beneficial
    use case in big IoT data analytics. Sensors are the actors in the smart agriculture
    use case. They are installed in fields to obtain data on moisture level of soil,
    trunk diameter of plants, microclimate condition, and humidity level, as well
    as to forecast weather. Sensors transmit obtained data using network and communication
    devices. These data pass through an IoT gateway and the Internet to reach the
    analytics layer shown in Table 1. The analytics layer processes the data obtained
    from the sensor network to issue commands. Automatic climate control according
    to harvesting requirements, timely and controlled irrigation, and humidity control
    for fungus prevention are examples of actions performed based on big data analytics
    recommendations. E. Smart Grid The smart grid is a new generation of power grid
    in which managing and distributing electricity between suppliers and consumers
    is upgraded using two-way communication technologies and computing capabilities
    to improve reliability, safety, efficiency with real-time control, and monitoring
    [73], [74]. One of the major challenges in a power system is integrating renewable
    and decentralized energy. Electricity systems require a smart grid to manage the
    volatile behavior of distributed energy resources (DERs) [75]. However, most energy
    systems have to follow governmental laws and regulations, as well as consider
    business analysis and potential legal constraints [76]. Grid sensors and devices
    continuously and rapidly generate data related to control loops and protection
    and require real-time processing and analytics along with machine-to-machine (M2M)
    or human-to-machine (HMI) interactions to issue control commands to the system.
    However, the system must fulfill visualization and reporting requirements. F.
    Smart Traffic Light System The smart traffic light system consists of nodes that
    locally interact with IoT sensors and devices to detect the presence of vehicles,
    bikers, and pedestrians. These nodes communicate with neighboring traffic lights
    to measure the speed and distance of approaching transportation means and manage
    green traffic signals [77]. IoT data gathered using the system require real-time
    analytics processing to perform necessary tasks, such as changing the timing cycles
    according to traffic conditions, sending informative signals to neighboring nodes,
    and detecting approaching vehicles that use IoT sensors and devices to prevent
    long queues or accidents. Moreover, smart traffic light systems can send their
    collected IoT data to cloud storage for further analytics. Table 3 presents the
    use cases of IoT big data analytics. TABLE 3 Comparison of IoT Big Data Analytics
    use Cases As shown in Table 3, most use cases are related to M2M communication
    technologies and decrease the role of human interaction. However, the technologies
    use prediction methods and decision-making techniques to improve real-time control,
    monitoring, and performance. Textual data are among the common data types generated
    by IoT devices, which are mostly sensors and cameras. Text-based data are suitable
    for analysis by distributed file systems, such as Hadoop. SECTION V. Opportunities
    IoT is currently considered one of the most profound transitions in technology.
    Current IoT provides several data analytics opportunities for big data analytics.
    Figure 4 shows the examples of use cases and opportunities discussed in Sections
    4 and 5. FIGURE 4. Example of use cases and opportunities for big IoT data analytics
    architecture. Show All A. E-Commerce Big IoT data analytics offers well-designed
    tools to process real-time big data, which produce timely results for decision
    making. Big IoT data exhibit heterogeneity, increasing volume, and real-time data
    processing features. The convergence of big data with IoT brings new challenges
    and opportunities to build a smart environment. Big IoT data analytics has widespread
    applications in nearly every industry. However, the main success areas of analytics
    are in e-commerce, revenue growth, increased customer size, accuracy of sale forecast
    results, product optimization, risk management, and improved customer segmentation.
    B. Smart Cities Big data collected from smart cities offer new opportunities in
    which efficiency gains can be achieved through an appropriate analytics platform/infrastructure
    to analyze big IoT data. Various devices connect to the Internet in a smart environment
    and share information. Moreover, the cost of storing data has been reduced dramatically
    after the invention of cloud computing technology. Analysis capabilities have
    made huge leaps. Thus, the role of big data in a smart city can potentially transform
    every sector of the economy of a nation. Hadoop with YARN resource manager has
    offered recent advancement in big data technology to support and handle numerous
    workloads, real-time processing, and streaming data ingestion. C. Retail and Logistics
    IoT is expected to play a key role as an emerging technology in the area of retail
    and logistics. In logistics, RFID keeps track of containers, pallets, and crates.
    In addition, considerable advancements in IoT technologies can facilitate retailers
    by providing several benefits. However, IoT devices generate large amounts of
    data on a daily basis. Thus, powerful data analytics enables enterprises to gain
    insights from the voluminous amounts of data produced through IoT technologies.
    Applying data analytics to logistic data sets can improve the shipment experience
    of customers. Moreover, retail companies can earn additional profit by analyzing
    customer data, which can predict the trends and demands of goods. By looking into
    customer data, optimizing pricing plans and seasonal promotions can be planned
    efficiently to maximize profit. D. Healthcare Recent years have witnessed tremendous
    growth in smart health monitoring devices. These devices generate enormous amounts
    of data. Thus, applying data analytics to data collected from fetal monitors,
    electrocardiograms, temperature monitors, or blood glucose level monitors can
    help healthcare specialists efficiently assess the physical conditions of patients.
    Moreover, data analytics enables healthcare professionals to diagnose serious
    diseases in their early stages to help save lives. Furthermore, data analytics
    improves the clinical quality of care and ensures the safety of patients. In addition,
    physician profile can be reviewed by looking into the history of treatment of
    patients, which can improve customer satisfaction, acquisition, and retention.
    SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Future Directions IoT and big data analytics have
    been extensively accepted by many organizations. However, these technologies are
    still in their early stages. Several existing research challenges have not yet
    been addressed. This section presents several challenges in the field of big IoT
    data analytics. A. Privacy Privacy issues arise when a system is compromised to
    infer or restore personal information using big data analytics tools, although
    data are generated from anonymous users. With the proliferation of big data analytics
    technologies used in big IoT data, the privacy issue has become a core problem
    in the data mining domain. Consequently, most people are reluctant to rely on
    these systems, which do not provide solid service-level agreement (SLA) conditions
    regarding user personal information theft or misuse. In fact, the sensitive information
    of users has to be secured and protected from external interference. Although
    temporary identification, anonymity, and encryptions provide several ways to enforce
    data privacy, decisions have to be made with regard to ethical factors, such as
    what to use, how to use, and why use generated big IoT data [7]. Another security
    risk associated with IoT data is the heterogeneity of the types of devices used
    and the nature of generated data, such as raw devices, data types, and communication
    protocols. These devices can have different sizes and shapes outside the network
    and are designed to communicate with cooperative applications. Thus, to authenticate
    these devices, an IoT system should assign a non-repudiable identification system
    to each device. Moreover, enterprises should maintain a meta-repository of these
    connected devices for auditing purposes. This heterogeneous IoT architecture is
    new to security professionals, and thus, results in increased security risks.
    Consequently, any attack in this scenario compromises system security and disconnects
    interconnected devices. In the context of big IoT data, security and privacy are
    the key challenges in processing and storing huge amounts of data. Moreover, to
    perform critical operations and host private data, these systems highly rely on
    third party services and infrastructure. Therefore, an exponential growth in data
    rate causes difficulty in securing each and every portion of critical data. As
    previously discussed, existing security solutions (Karim, 2016 #86) are no long
    applicable to providing complete security in big IoT data scenarios. Existing
    algorithms are not designed for the dynamic observation of data, and thus, are
    not effectively applied. Legacy data security solutions are specifically designed
    for static data sets, whereas current data requirements are changing dynamically
    (Lafuente, 2015). Thus, deploying these security solutions is difficult for dynamically
    increasing data. In addition, legislative and regulatory issues should be considered
    while signing SLAs. With regard to data generated through IoT, the following security
    problems can emerge [78]: (a) timely updates - difficulty in keeping systems up
    to date, (b) incident management - identifying suspicious traffic patterns among
    legitimate ones and possible failure to capture unidentifiable incidents, (c)
    interoperability - proprietary and vendor-specific procedures will pose difficulties
    in finding hidden or zero day attacks, (d) and protocol convergence - although
    IPv6 is currently compatible with the latest specifications, this protocol has
    yet to be fully deployed. Therefore, the application of security rules over IPv4
    may not be applicable to protecting IPv6. At present, no answer can address these
    challenges and manage the security and privacy of interconnected devices. However,
    the following guidelines can overcome these adversities. (a) First, a true open
    ecosystem with standard APIs is necessary to avoid interoperability and reliability
    problems. (b) Second, devices must be well protected while communicating with
    peers. (c) Third, devices should be hardcoded with the best security practices
    to protect against common security and privacy threats. B. Data Mining Data mining
    methods provide efficient and best-fitting predictive or descriptive solutions
    for big data that can also be generalized for new data [45]. The evolution of
    big IoT data and cloud computing platforms has brought the challenges of data
    exploration and information extraction [79]. However, for the overall big IoT
    data architecture, Figure 5 presents the primary challenges related to processing
    and data mining. FIGURE 5. Big data mining issues in IoT. Show All Exhaustive
    data reads/writes: The high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety qualities
    of big IoT data challenge exploration, integration, heterogeneous communication,
    and extraction processes. The size and heterogeneity of data impose new data mining
    requirements, and diversity in data sources also poses a challenge [80]–[82].
    Furthermore, compared with small data sets, large data sets comprise more abnormalities
    and ambiguities that require additional preprocessing steps, such as cleansing,
    reduction, and transmission [23], [83]. Another issue lies in the extraction of
    exact and knowledgeable information from the large volumes of diverse data. Consequently,
    obtaining accurate information from complex data requires analyzing data properties
    and finding association among different data points. Researchers have introduced
    parallel and sequential programming models and proposed different algorithms to
    minimize query response time while dealing with big data. Moreover, researchers
    have selected existing data mining algorithms in different manners to (a) improve
    single source knowledge discovery, (b) implement data mining methods for multi-source
    platforms, and (c) study and analyze dynamic data mining methods and stream data
    [84]. Hence, parallel k -means algorithm [85] and parallel association rule mining
    methods [65] are introduced. However, the need to devise algorithms remains to
    provide compatibility with the latest parallel architectures. Moreover, synchronization
    issues may occur in parallel computing, while information is exchanged within
    different data mining methods. This bottleneck of data mining methods has become
    an open issue in big IoT data analytics that should be addressed. C. Visualization
    Visualization is an important entity in big data analytics, particularly when
    dealing with IoT systems where data are generated enormously. Furthermore, conducting
    data visualization is difficult because of the large size and high dimension of
    big data. This situation shows underlying trends and a complete picture of parsed
    data. Therefore, big data analytics and visualization should work seamlessly to
    obtain the best results from IoT applications in big data. However, visualization
    in the case of heterogeneous and diverse data (unstructured, structured, and semi-structured)
    is a challenging task. Designing visualization solution that is compatible with
    advanced big data indexing frameworks is a difficult task. Similarly, response
    time is a desirable factor in big IoT data analytics. Consequently, cloud computing
    architectures supported with rich GUI facilities can be deployed to obtain better
    insights into big IoT data trends [86]. Different dimensionality reduction methods
    have been introduced as a result of complex and high-dimensional big IoT data
    [87], [88]. However, these methods are unsuitable for all types of presented data.
    Similarly, when fine-grained dimensions are visualized effectively, the probability
    to identify observable correlations, patterns, and outliners is high [89]. Moreover,
    data should be kept locally to obtain usable information efficiently because of
    power and bandwidth constraints. In addition, visualization software should run
    with the concept of reference locality to achieve efficient outcome in an IoT
    environment. Given that the amount of big IoT data is increasing rapidly, the
    requirement of enormous parallelization is a challenging task in visualization.
    Thus, to decompose a problem into manageable independent tasks to enforce concurrent
    execution of queries is a challenge for parallel visualization algorithms [90].
    At present, most big data visualization tools used for IoT exhibit poor performance
    results in terms of functionality, scalability, and response time. To provide
    effective uncertainty-aware visualization during the visual analytics process,
    avoiding uncertainty imposes a considerable challenge [32]. Furthermore, several
    important issues are addressed [91], such as (a) visual noise - most data set
    objects are closely related to one another, and thus, users may perceive different
    results of the same type; (b) information loss - applying reduction methods to
    visible data sets can cause information loss; (c) large image observation - data
    visualization tools have inherent problems with respect to aspect ratio, devise
    resolution, and physical perception limits; (d) frequently changing image - users
    will not notice rapid data changes in an output; and (e) high performance requirements
    - high performance requirements are imposed because data are generated dynamically
    in an IoT environment. Moreover, methods supported by advanced analytics enable
    interactive graphics on laptops, desktops, or mobile devices, such as smartphones
    and tablets [92]. Real-time analytics is another consideration highlighted in
    IoT architectures. Several guidelines on visualization in big data are presented
    [93], such as (a) data awareness, i.e., appropriate domain expertise, (b) data
    quality - cleaning data using information management or data governance policies,
    (c) meaningful results - data clustering is used to provide high-level abstraction
    such that the visibility of smaller groups of data is possible, and (d) outliers
    should be removed from the data or treated as a separate entity. Reference [94]
    suggested that visualization should adhere to the following guidelines: (a) the
    system should provide special attention to metadata, (b) visualization software
    should be interactive and should require maximum user involvement, and (c) tools
    should be built based on the dynamic nature of the generated data. D. Integration
    Integration refers to having a uniform view of different formats. Data integration
    provides a single view of the data arriving from different sources and combines
    the view of data [95]. Data integration includes all processes involved in collecting
    data from different sources, as well as in storing and providing data with a unified
    view. For each moment, different forms of data are continuously generated by social
    media, IoT, and other communication and telecommunication approaches. The produced
    data can be categorized into three groups: (a) structured data, such as data stored
    in traditional database systems, including tables with rows and columns; (b) semi-structured,
    such as HTML, XML, and Json files; and (c) unstructured data, such as videos,
    audios, and images. Good data offer good information; however, this relationship
    is only achieved through data integration [96]. Integrating diverse data types
    is a complex task in merging different systems or applications [97]. Overlapping
    the same data, increasing performance and scalability, and enabling real-time
    data access are among the challenges associated with data integration that should
    be addressed in the future. Another challenge is to adjust structures in semi-structured
    and unstructured data before integrating and analyzing these types of data [98].
    Information, such as entities and relationships, can be extracted from textual
    data by using available technologies in the eras of text mining, machine learning,
    natural processing, and information extraction. However, new technologies should
    be developed to extract images, videos, and other information from other non-text
    formats of unstructured data [98]. Text mining is expected to be conducted by
    applying several specialized extractors on the same text. Hence, managing and
    integrating different extraction results from a certain data source require other
    techniques [99]. SECTION VII. Conclusion The growth rate of data production has
    increased drastically over the past years with the proliferation of smart and
    sensor devices. The interaction between IoT and big data is currently at a stage
    where processing, transforming, and analyzing large amounts of data at a high
    frequency are necessary. We conducted this survey in the context of big IoT data
    analytics. First, we explored recent analytics solutions. The relationship between
    big data analytics and IoT was also discussed. Moreover, we proposed an architecture
    for big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big data analytics types, methods, and
    technologies for big data mining were presented. Some credible use cases were
    also provided. In addition, we explored the domain by discussing various opportunities
    brought about by data analytics in the IoT paradigm. Several open research challenges
    were discussed as future research directions. Finally, we concluded that existing
    big IoT data analytics solutions remained in their early stages of development.
    In the future, real-time analytics solution that can provide quick insights will
    be required. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Get rights and content Abstract Since the introduction of the smart grid, accelerated
    deployment of various smart grid technologies and applications have been experienced.
    This allows the traditional power grid to become more reliable, resilient, and
    efficient. Despite such a widespread deployment, it is still not clear which communication
    technology solutions are the best fit to support grid applications. This is because
    different smart grid applications have different network requirements – in terms
    of data payloads, sampling rates, latency and reliability. Based on a variety
    of smart grid use cases and selected standards, this paper compiles information
    about different communication network requirements for different smart grid applications,
    ranging from those used in a Home Area Network (HAN), Neighborhood Area Network
    (NAN) and Wide-Area Network (WAN). Communication technologies used to support
    implementation of selected smart grid projects are also discussed. This paper
    is expected to serve as a comprehensive database of technology requirements and
    best practices for use by communication engineers when designing a smart grid
    network. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Smart grid applicationsCommunication

    Network (WAN) 1. Introduction The existing U.S. electric power grid was built
    over 100 years ago with the aim to deliver electricity from large power stations
    to customers [1]. In the past decade, blackouts and grid failures have become
    a noticeable problem, which can cause great damages and inconvenience to people’s
    daily life [2]. There is thus a need to make the current electricity network more
    reliable, efficient, secure, and environmentally friendly. This can be achieved
    by the next-generation power grid, i.e., the smart grid, which is characterized
    by a two-way flow of electricity and information, creating an automated, widely
    distributed energy delivery network. With an emerging smart grid, various intelligent
    and automated applications can be enabled. These applications are such as home/building
    automation, automated meter reading, distribution automation, outage and restoration
    management and integration of electric vehicles [3]. Today’s electric power grid
    has become a complex network of networks, comprising both power and communication
    infrastructures, and several thousands of intelligent electronic devices (IEDs)
    [4]. Communication networks provide necessary infrastructure allowing a utility
    to manage these devices from a central location. In the smart grid environment,
    heterogeneous communication technologies and architectures are involved. Communication
    networks should meet specific requirements, i.e., reliability, latency, bandwidth
    and security, depending on smart grid applications. The complexity of the smart
    grid may lead to difficulties in choosing appropriate communications networks
    as many parameters and different requirements must be taken into account depending
    on applications and utility expectations. Authors in [5] provide a comprehensive
    tutorial about capability and requirements that the smart grid needs from both
    power and communications perspectives. Authors in [6] summarize application characteristics
    and traffic requirements of the communication infrastructure in the smart grid,
    while authors in [7] present a brief survey of selected transmission grid applications
    in terms of their bandwidth and latency requirements. Although existing wired
    and wireless communication technologies can be applied to the smart grid, establishing
    smart grid standards and protocols is an urgent issue for some devices, i.e.,
    smart meters [8]. In the literature, smart grid technologies and standards are
    discussed to provide an overview of the smart grid paradigm and integration of
    different communication technologies [9], [10]. Some studies focus on a specific
    standard or communication technologies, i.e., smart metering [11], power line
    communication (PLC) [12], and wireless communication [13], [14]. Authors in [15]
    evaluate the network performance for a long-distance distribution line and proposed
    a communication architecture for distribution level applications. Additionally,
    selection of communication technologies for transmission-level applications has
    been addressed in [16]. As data size, latency and reliability requirements for
    different smart grid applications vary widely and are not easily obtainable to
    practitioners, this paper presents a comprehensive compilation of information
    from various use cases and smart grid-related standards on potential smart grid
    applications and their associated communication network requirements. These are
    discussed in terms of typical payload, data sampling requirements, as well as
    latency and reliability requirements for smart grid applications deployed in a
    Home Area Network (HAN), Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) and Wide-Area Network
    (WAN). Additionally, the paper also discusses, based on selected smart grid projects
    around the world, various communication technologies that have been implemented
    to support real-world smart grid applications. It is the objective of this paper
    to provide a comprehensive database of communication technology requirements for
    different smart grid applications implemented at generation, transmission, distribution
    and customer levels. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an
    overview of the smart grid communication network architecture, and compares various
    communication technologies that can be deployed in the smart grid environment.
    Section 3 discusses network requirements to support smart grid applications in
    HAN, NAN and WAN, as well as challenges in smart grid communications. Section
    4 presents communication technologies used to support selected real-world smart
    grid projects. 2. Communication network architecture and various technologies
    for the smart grid The smart grid is an interactive platform, consisting of a
    power system layer, a control layer, a communication layer, a security layer and
    an application layer. See Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1.
    The system multi-layer architecture of smart grid. This architecture represents
    how a smart grid can be implemented. In general, a smart grid comprises: (1) a
    power system layer, which refers to power generation, transmission, distribution
    and customer systems; (2) a power control layer, which enables smart grid monitoring,
    control, and management functions; (3) a communication layer, which allows two-way
    communications in a smart grid environment; (4) a security layer, which provides
    data confidentiality, integrity, authentication and availability; and (5) an application
    layer, which delivers various smart grid applications to customers and utilities
    based on an existing information infrastructure. For example, to enable a smart
    metering application, an electric grid must have the power system layer – which
    is an electric power distribution system that delivers electricity to customers;
    a power control layer – which is a smart meter that enables power consumption
    to be monitored; a communication layer – which is necessary to allow transmitting
    information from a customer to a utility or vise versa; and a security layer –
    which is necessary to address data privacy issues. The communication layer is
    one of the most critical elements that enables smart grid applications. In the
    smart grid environment, a communication network can be represented by a hierarchical
    multi-layer architecture. Classified by data rate and coverage range, this architecture
    comprises: • Customer premises area network, i.e., Home Area Network (HAN)/Building
    Area Network (BAN)/Industrial Area Network (IAN). • Neighborhood Area Networks
    (NAN)/Field Area Network (FAN). • Wide Area Network (WAN). Data rate and communication
    range requirements for these networks are summarized in Fig. 2. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Date rate and communication range requirements for smart
    grid communications hierarchy. HAN/BAN/IAN applications include home automation
    and building automation, which are related to sending/receiving electrical measurement
    data from an appliance to a controller within a customer premises. These applications
    do not require data to be transmitted at high frequency and all applications occur
    inside residential/commercial/industrial buildings. Thus, communication requirements
    for HAN/BAN/IAN applications are low power consumption, low cost, simplicity,
    and secure communication. Communication technologies that provide data rate of
    up to 100 kbps with short coverage distance (up to 100 m) are generally sufficient.
    ZigBee, WiFi, Z-Wave, power line carrier (PLC, or known as HomePlug), Bluetooth,
    and Ethernet are widely used to support HAN/BAN/IAN applications. In NAN/FAN applications,
    such as smart metering, demand response and distribution automation, data are
    required to transmit from a large number of customers/field devices to a data
    concentrator/substation or vise versa. Therefore, these applications require communication
    technologies that support higher data rate (100 kbps–10 Mbps) and larger coverage
    distance (up to 10 km). NAN/FAN applications can be implemented over ZigBee mesh
    networks, WiFi mesh networks, PLC, as well as long distance wired and wireless
    technologies, such as WiMAX, Cellular, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Coaxial
    Cable. For WAN applications, such as wide-area control, monitoring and protection,
    which require transmitting a large number of data points at much higher frequency
    (i.e., in a fraction of seconds) to allow stability control of a power system,
    communication technologies that support much higher data rate (10 Mbps–1 Gbps)
    and provide long coverage distance (up to 100 km) are therefore required. Optical
    communication is commonly used as a communication medium between transmission/distribution
    substations and a utility control center due to its high capacity and low latency.
    Cellular and WiMAX are also used due to their wide coverage range and high data
    throughput. Satellite communications can also be used to provide redundant communications
    at critical transmission/distribution substation sites as backup a communication
    mean in a remote location. A comparison of various communication technologies
    that can support smart grid applications in terms of data rate and coverage distance
    is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of communication technologies for

    provide lower installation cost, more rapid deployment, higher mobility and flexibility
    than its wired counterparts, wireless technologies are recommended in most of
    the smart grid applications. Advantages and disadvantages of each technology have
    already been discussed in our previous study [17] in terms of their data rates
    and coverage ranges, and will not be repeated in this paper. Latency requirements
    for each network are discussed in details in Section 3 by smart grid application.
    3. Smart grid applications, network requirements and challenges in smart grid
    communications Smart grid is a platform consisting of different domains, including
    generation, transmission, distribution, customers, service providers, operations
    and markets, to enable various applications. The generation domain is responsible
    for generating electricity from other forms of energy, e.g., fossil fuels, water,
    wind, solar radiation and geothermal heat. The transmission domain is responsible
    for transferring of electrical power from generation sources to distribution systems
    over long distances through multiple substations. The distribution domain is the
    electrical interconnection between the transmission and the customer domains.
    It distributes electricity from/to customers. The customer domain includes residential,
    commercial, and industrial customers, where electricity is consumed. The service
    provider domain executes services to customers and utilities. The operations domain
    manages the movement of electricity and responsible for the operation of the power
    system. The market domain allows to exchanging price and balancing supply and
    demand within the power system. Each domain can be interactive with the other
    domains through different communications area networks to accomplish requirements
    of different smart grid applications. See Fig. 3. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Smart grid domains, intra/inter-domain interactions via communication
    networks, and smart grid applications in generation, transmission, distribution
    and customer domains. According to the smart grid communication infrastructure
    that can generally be classified into HAN, NAN and WAN based on the data rate
    and coverage range, smart grid applications discussed below are grouped by their
    data rate and coverage range required for their successful deployment. Then, challenges
    in smart grid communications are discussed. 3.1. Premises network applications
    A premises network, i.e., HAN/BAN/IAN, is at the customer end of the network architecture.
    It supports communications among household appliances, electric vehicles, and
    other electric equipment at customer premises. HAN provides communications for
    household appliances and equipment that are capable of sending and receiving signals
    from a smart meter, in-home displays (IHDs) and/or home energy management (HEM)
    systems. These applications include home automation, optimal thermostat set points
    for thermal zones, optimal water tank temperature set-point, controlling and managing
    loads and providing total electricity costs. BAN and IAN are used for commercial
    and industrial customers with focus on building automation, heating, ventilating,
    and air conditioning (HVAC), other industrial energy management applications.
    A premises network is connected to other smart grid actors, e.g., an electric
    utility or a third-party energy service provider, via a smart meter or an Internet
    gateway. This enables an electric utility to perform NAN/FAN applications in residential,
    commercial and industrial premises, e.g., prepaid services, user information messaging,
    real-time pricing and control, load management, and demand response. Table 2 summarizes
    these network requirements in terms of typical payload sizes, data collection
    requirements, reliability and latency, together with feasible communication technologies
    that can support such requirements. Table 2. Networks system requirements for
    HAN/BAN/IAN applications in the smart grid. Application Typical data size (bytes)

    X X X X 3.2. Neighborhood Area Network applications A Neighborhood Area Network
    (NAN) supports information flow between WAN and a premises area network. It enables
    data collection from customers in a neighborhood for transmission to an electric
    utility company. NAN can also be called Field Area Network (FAN) when it connects
    with field devices such as intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). NAN/FAN enables
    a range of smart grid applications, such as smart metering, load management, distribution
    automation, pricing, outage management and restoration or other customer-based
    applications [18]. NAN/FAN includes a metering network, which is a part of AMI,
    enabling services such as remote meter reading, control and detection of unauthorized
    usage. It allows electricity usage information to be transmitted from energy meters
    to a utility or a third-party system, and allows field devices to be controlled
    remotely, e.g., in distribution automation applications. NAN/FAN is connected
    to WAN via a backhaul network, where data from many NAN/FAN are aggregated and
    transported between NAN/FAN and WAN. Smart grid applications in NAN/FAN include
    meter reading, distribution automation (DA), demand response (DR), prepayment,
    electric transportation, firmware updates and program/configuration, outage and
    restoration management, TOU/RTP/CPP pricing, service switch operation, customer
    information and messaging, and premises network administration. For these applications,
    communication technologies that support higher data rate and larger coverage distance
    (up to 10 km) than those applications in a premises area network are required.
    Coverage area and data rate requirements for different NAN applications can vary
    depending on applications [19]. For example, a typical data size requirement for
    scheduled meter interval reading is 1600–2400 bytes, while it is 25–1000 bytes
    for distribution automation applications. Typical NAN/FAN applications are discussed
    below. Their network requirements in terms of typical data sizes, data sampling
    requirements, as well as reliability and latency requirements are summarized in
    Table 3, together with feasible communication technologies supporting smart grid
    applications in NAN/FAN. In this paper, latency requirements imply the acceptable
    window of data/status update delay from a transmitter to a receiver for each smart
    grid application. (1) Meter reading allows a utility to collect data from electric/gas/water
    meters and transfer data to a central database for billing and analysis. With
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), a utility can perform real-time bidirectional
    communications between meters and a centralized management site, thus improving
    meter reading accuracy, and reducing operational costs. With the ability to monitor
    electricity usage in real-time, customers can be informed of their own usage,
    thus allowing better management of their electricity consumption. Network requirements
    for meter reading applications vary depending on service types, e.g., on-demand
    meter reading, scheduled meter interval reading and bulk transfer of meter reading.
    • On-demand meter reading allows readings to be taken when needed, e.g., when
    a utility needs to answer customers’ inquiries about their usage, or to backfill
    missing information. A typical payload is 100 bytes for a data transmission from
    a meter to a utility with a latency requirement of less than 15 s. • Scheduled
    meter interval reading provides the capability to collect usage information from
    a meter to an AMI head end several times a day (e.g., 4–6 times per residential
    meter per day or 12–24 times per commercial/industrial meter per day) with interval
    usage information varying from 15 min to 1 h. Interval readings are normally taken
    and stored automatically at the customer-end equipment, i.e., smart meter, and
    later retrieved by a utility. Acceptable window of data delivery is less than
    2 h for commercial/industrial meter and less than 4 h for residential meters.
    Payload size depends on the number of readings collected from the meter at a given
    time. • Bulk transfer of meter reading allows a utility to collect usage information
    from all meters (via AMI head end or meter data management system, MDMS) within
    a utility enterprise. Payload includes meter reading information from a number
    of meters, of which the payload size depends on the number of meters scheduled
    to be read. (2) Pricing applications involve broadcasting of price information
    to meters and devices, e.g., smart appliances, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
    (PHEVs) and load control devices, at customer premises. These are typically associated
    with time-of-use (TOU), real-time pricing (RTP) and critical peak pricing (CPP)
    programs. • TOU programs allow customers to lower electric bills, as long as customers
    are able to shift their electricity usage to off-peak hours. Customers participating
    in this program typically accept different price schedules for different time
    periods, such as peak, shoulder, and off-peak. • RTP programs offer short-term
    time-varying pricing information, e.g., every 5 min, 30 min or 1 h, to end-use
    customers. Customers can use this information to reduce electricity bills by managing
    their energy consumption. • CPP programs are typically used during times of high
    peak demand. A utility needs to curtail loads and quickly sends CPP messages to
    enrolled customers for a radical load reduction. In these programs, customers
    are charged a higher price during a few hours and given a discounted during remaining
    hours. Table 3. Networks system requirements for NAN applications in the smart

    25 As needed (24 × 7) <20 s >98 A typical data size for such pricing applications
    is 100 bytes, and the data latency requirement is less than 1 min. (3) Electric
    service prepayment allows customers to purchase utility services, i.e., supply
    of electricity, gas or water, in advance. These services are available to customers
    as long as the meter has credits. In traditional applications, a prepaid meter
    measures electrical/gas/water usage and deducts credits according to tariff programmed
    for customers in real time. The meter issues warnings, e.g., audible alarm sounds,
    when the credit reaches a threshold or zero. Then the service is disconnected
    within a predetermined time. Customers need to refill credits inside their prepaid
    meters to gain a service again. With the smart grid and AMI, utilities do not
    require prepaid meters to serve prepaid customers. A smart meter can perform prepaid
    meter functions with the ability to remotely connect or disconnect the service.
    A utility can calculate available credits on a prepayment account and can initiate
    necessary actions, such as sending out warning messages and disconnect or reconnect
    commands. A typical data size for an electric service prepayment application is
    between 50 and 150 bytes, and the data latency requirement is less than 30 s when
    a utility sends information, such as price and available credit, to a customer.
    (4) Demand response (DR) allows a utility to talk to devices at customer premises,
    such as load control devices, smart thermostats, smart appliances, PHEVs, and
    in-home displays, to provide load reduction during peak demand periods in the
    distribution grid. Typical DR applications include direct load control programs
    for central air conditioning systems, heat pumps, electric water heaters and/or
    pool pumps, as well as real-time pricing and time-of-use programs. For direct
    load control applications, selected devices can be turned ON/OFF by a load controller
    installed at a customer premise with commands sent by a utility. These commands
    may be unicast, multicast or broadcast depending on the required load reduction
    amount. A typical data size for DR applications is 100 bytes, and the data latency
    requirement is less than 1 min. (5) Utility service switch operation allows a
    utility to turn an electrical/gas/water service ON/OFF at customer premises. This
    feature enables a utility to switch a service without having to roll a service
    truck. This can be particularly useful for reducing service time and costs for
    establishing or terminating services. These applications include sending a service
    switch operation (service enabling/service cancelling) commands to a meter. For
    these applications, a typical data size is 25 bytes, and the data latency requirement
    is less than 1 min. (6) Distribution automation (DA) provides real-time operation
    information of grid structure, automation control, data communication and information
    management, to monitor and control the distribution grid. DA systems help utilities
    make the most of their distribution assets by allowing control of distribution-level
    devices, such as capacitor bank controllers (CBC), fault detectors, reclosers,
    switches, and voltage regulators (VR). DA applications and their requirements
    may vary from utility to utility. Major DA applications include distribution system
    monitoring and maintenance, Volt/VAR control, distribution system demand response
    (DSDR) and fault detection, clearing, isolation and restoration (FCIR). • Distribution
    system monitoring and maintenance includes self-diagnostics on equipment, polling
    equipment status (open/closed, active/inactive) at scheduled intervals, and retrieving
    sensor data to monitor equipment conditions. Equipment to be monitored may include
    CBCs, fault detectors, reclosers, switches and voltage regulators. • Volt/VAR
    control aims to reduce energy loss, adjust voltage along a distribution circuit,
    and compensate load power factor. For a distribution system, Volt/VAR management
    includes both monitoring of feeder line devices, and their control. • DSDR applications
    aims to reduce distribution grid voltage to help manage system load during peak
    periods. It involves control of capacitor banks, automated feeder switches and
    voltage regulators. • FCIR applications manage the detection, isolation, and restoration
    of a power grid after the occurrence of a fault on a section of the grid to minimize
    the effect of service interruptions to customers. The DA system consists of intelligent
    communications and automation devices and low-latency network communications backbone.
    It is generally built on open standard systems and protocols such as IP-based
    communications and SCADA interfaces. A typical data size for DA applications ranges
    from 25 bytes to 1000 bytes, and the data latency requirement is less than 4–5
    s while the reliability requirement is high, i.e., more than 99.5%. (7) Outage
    and Restoration Management (ORM) allows an electric utility to detect an outage
    as soon as the power is lost via devices, such as smart meters and outage detection
    units. These devices can also report over and under voltage situations. Typically,
    an additional interface module is added to a smart meter to enable the outage
    detection function. A utility usually places more than one outage detection units
    on every branch of a distribution network to avoid false alarms. The ORM application
    allows an electric meter to send a message to a utility’s Outage Management System
    (OMS) when the meter loses its mains power, and when the meter detects that the
    mains power has been restored. For this application, a typical payload is 25 bytes,
    and the data latency requirement is less than 20 s. (8) Distribution customer
    storage applications arise as a technological solution that can address operational
    challenges by providing power, energy and fast response time to a distribution
    network allowing an efficient integration of renewable sources. These storage
    applications include the use of storage devices installed along distribution feeder
    circuits or laterals for peak load shaving, voltage support, power quality, demand
    control, and interruption protection. A typical data size is 25 bytes for a charge/discharge
    command from a Distribution Application Controller (DAC) to a distribution customer
    storage, and the data latency requirement is less than 5 s for distribution customer
    storage applications. (9) Electric transportation applications involve both electricity
    flow from vehicles to the power grid (vehicle-to-grid, V2G) and electricity flow
    from the power grid to vehicles (grid-to-vehicle, G2V). These applications allow
    various electric vehicle technologies (based on battery, hybrid, plug-in hybrid,
    fuel cell, and plug-in fuel cell) to become mobile distributed generation resources.
    Electric transportation applications may include a utility sending inquiries to
    acquire knowledge of vehicle battery state-of-charge, informing vehicles about
    electricity prices; as well as an electric vehicle sending messages back to a
    utility in response to received commands. A typical payload is 100–255 bytes for
    electric transportation applications, and the data latency requirement is less
    than 15 s. (10) Firmware updates and program/configuration changes allow utilities
    to upgrade firmware and change program/configuration on their devices to incorporate
    new functionalities and settings. Specifically, firmware updates aim to fix bugs
    or enhance features of a background program that runs in devices. Utilities usually
    perform firmware upgrades to accommodate changing application requirements and
    strengthen device security. Program/configuration updates aim to change current
    program/configuration settings in devices. These devices may include Data Aggregation
    Points (DAP), NAN/FAN gateways, and DA devices, e.g., regulators, capacitor banks,
    sensors, switches, reclosers and relays. A typical data size is 400k–2000k bytes,
    and the data latency requirement can be up to 7 days for firmware update applications;
    while the typical data size is 25–50 Kbytes, and the data latency requirement
    can be up to 3 days for program/configuration update applications. (11) Customer
    information and messaging applications allow a customer an access to their account
    information, historical electricity consumption data and outage information. This
    information is sent to an appropriate operational data warehouse (ODW) and web
    portal via the Internet or an extranet gateway, which is connected to a utility’s
    internal network. These applications are provided by a utility or a third-party
    service provider. A typical payload is 50 bytes for a customer request of account
    information from a utility; and is 200 bytes for a response from a utility to
    a customer. The data latency requirement is less than 15 s for these applications.
    (12) Premises network administration applications allow customers to connect/remove
    premises area network devices (e.g., smart meters, PHEV, smart appliances and
    load control devices) to/from a network. These can be accomplished using an interactive
    voice response (IVR) or a web portal, etc. A typical data size is 25 bytes, and
    the data latency requirement is less than 20 s for these applications. 3.3. Wide
    Area Network applications Wide Area Network (WAN) supports real-time monitoring,
    control and protection applications, which can help prevent cascading outages
    with real-time information related to the state of the power grid. It also provides
    communication links for smart grid backbones; and covers long-haul distances from
    NAN/FAN to a control center. WAN applications, including wide-area monitoring,
    wide-area control and wide-area protection, have been identified as the next-generation
    solution to improve power system planning, operation and protection in the smart
    grid. These applications involve the use of system-wide information and selected
    local information to counteract the propagation of large disturbances [20]. Wide-area
    monitoring, control and protection applications offer higher data resolution and
    shorter response time than classical supervisory control and data acquisition
    (SCADA) and energy management (EMS) systems. While SCADA/EMS provides a measurement
    update interval of several seconds or even minutes, wide-area monitoring, control
    and protection applications provide high-resolution data, i.e., 60 samples per
    second. Three domains of WAN applications are explained in further details below.
    (1) Wide-area protection provides a fully automatic protection to protect power
    systems against widespread blackouts, transmission congestion and stressed conditions,
    or unexpected events. Wide-area protection applications generally involve load
    shedding and adaptive islanding. Wide-area protection systems are useful to deal
    with unpredicted contingencies that need very short reaction time to prevent widespread
    failures or blackouts. (2) Wide-area control provides automatic self-healing capabilities
    that exceed functionalities delivered by local control and responds faster than
    manual control by a control center. It provides a flexible platform for rapid
    implementation of generator tripping and reactive power compensation switching
    for transient stability and voltage support of a large power system [21]. It serves
    as an additional layer to prevent possible blackouts and facilitates electrical
    commerce by providing a real-time instability control. Wide-area control applications
    involve control of fast controllable equipment, e.g., high-voltage direct current
    (HVDC) and flexible-AC transmission system (FACTS) devices. Additionally, these
    applications also include wide-area damping control with respect to oscillations
    in large-scale electrical transmission systems [22], voltage stability control
    to sustain active and reactive power flows for transmission corridors [23], and
    frequency stability control to prevent possible damage to generation and load
    side equipment [24]. While wide-area protection and control applications offer
    more advanced protection/control systems as compared with traditional power systems,
    more stringent performance and availability requirements are needed. For example,
    the required response time for wide-area protection and control applications should
    be in the range of milliseconds to minutes (e.g., <0.1 s–<2 min), and the communication
    system reliability requirement should be very high (e.g., >99.9%). Their typical
    message size can vary depending upon communication protocols implemented. Typical
    protocols used for these applications include MIRRORED BITS, IEC 61850 Generic
    Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE), and ETHERCAT communications [25]. For
    the MIRRORED BITS communication protocol, the message size is 4 bytes in length
    due to its simple design. For the GOOSE message, roughly 157 bytes of data are
    required. On the other hand, a message size of 64 bytes is required for the EtherCAT
    communications. (3) Wide-area monitoring aims at providing system data in real-time
    from a group of intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) and PMUs. IEDs transmit
    snapshots of device status and measurement data to SCADA/EMS over a WAN. PMUs,
    on the other hand, enable time-synchronized snapshots of a power network including
    voltage and current phase angles, i.e., wide-area measurements. Availability of
    wide-area measurements enables enhanced stability assessment with respect to state
    estimation, system parameter estimation and post-fault analysis. Examples of wide-area
    monitoring applications include monitoring of power frequency oscillation and
    system voltage stability. Thus, wide-area monitoring provides the power grid opportunities
    to improve voltage stability and detect frequency oscillations/instability [26].
    For wide-area monitoring applications, a minimum message size containing measurements
    made by a PMU is 52 bytes. This information can be obtained from the IEEE Standard
    for Synchrophasors for Power Systems (IEEE Std. C37.118), which defines measurement
    and data transmission formats for real-time data reporting in electric power systems
    [27]. Similar to those for wide-area protection and control applications, the
    required response time for wide-area monitoring applications is also in the range
    of milliseconds to minutes, and communication system reliability requirement is
    very high. Table 4 that summarizes primary requirements by these applications
    in terms of their typical data sizes, sampling rates, as well as reliability and
    latency requirements, together with communication technologies that can support
    these applications [28]. Table 4. Network requirements for wide-area protection,
    control and monitoring applications. Application Typical data size (bytes) Typical

    exist that are associated with upgrading communication infrastructures to enable
    a wide range of smart grid applications. In general, key challenges of smart grid
    communications are: Firstly, it is the lack of necessary interoperability standards
    that can hamper effective deployment of communication networks in the smart grid
    environment. This is because the use of proprietary networking solutions and protocols
    are preferred by utility/customer systems in today’s environment. Integrating
    these networks with future versions of software and hardware is the key challenge,
    which may lead many utilities to consider the adoption of IP-based networking
    to address the interoperability issue [29]. For example, interoperability and
    integration with the utility system are major challenges to full-scale deployment
    of HAN applications. The interoperability is outside the control of the utility
    and can be solved by designing a system using common protocols, e.g., Smart Energy
    Profile (SEP) and software/firmware updates. To solve the integration issue, utilities
    prefer to connect the customer premises via a HAN gateway device, e.g., smart
    meter or Internet gateway. Secondly, communications networks deployed in an existing
    electric power grid are based on decade-old technologies that were designed without
    considering the need to collect information from and support a large number of
    customers or devices. This is closely related to challenges in realizing NAN/FAN
    applications, which will involve the upgrade of existing communication technologies
    that can serve a large number of customers and field devices and span a large
    coverage area of different terrain characteristics. For example, to transmit electrical
    usage information from a number of smart meters to an electric utility, a data
    from a smart meter needs to be routed to a data concentrator in a neighborhood.
    The uplink from homes to a data concentrator in an urban area is typically realized
    using a private network solution consisting of RF mesh and cellular technologies.
    To enable a utility to perform direct load control on a number of end-use equipment
    (downlink), a popular technology for deployment can be based on RF mesh networks
    in unlicensed 900 MHz bands. Thirdly, latency requirements can become the most
    important issue in the data collection and transmission, specifically for wide
    area control and protection applications. This is because WAN applications are
    associated with the need for the most stringent communication network requirements
    in terms of bandwidth, latency, and reliability. The data are required to be transmitted
    to a control center, and control commands are required to be issued and implemented
    within a few milliseconds to prevent cascading outages in real-time. To meet such
    high requirements for WAN applications, utilities generally prefer to use private
    networks consisting of the fiber optic communication because of its ability to
    deliver high data rates for long-distance communications. Data compression is
    another solution to improve the efficiency of data flow and hence reducing latency.
    Congestion management can also be used to reduce latency under the condition of
    heavy traffic as it allows data classification and prioritization of communication
    channels for emergency situations [30]. Lastly, with integration of information
    and communication technology (ICT) to the power grid and emerging smart grid applications,
    e.g., smart metering, pricing, demand response, wide-area measurement, many concerns
    arise related to cyber security and data privacy. The most comprehensive smart
    grid security discussions are provided in NIST Guidelines for Smart Grid Cyber
    Security (NISTIR 7628) [31]. In the NIST report, smart grid cyber security topics
    are presented in three main categories: Vol. 1 – Smart grid cyber strategy, architecture,
    and high-level requirements; Vol 2. – Privacy and the smart grid; and Vol. 3 –
    Supportive analyses and references. Selected other publications [32], [33] also
    discuss cyber security and privacy issues in the smart grid, such as power and
    control system security, accountability, integrity, confidentiality and data sharing.
    Authors in [34] develop a framework to detect malicious activities by proposing
    an algorithm to place grid sensors to enhance detection performance and provide
    network observability. In addition, as the electric power grid has become a more
    complex network comprising a large number of customers/field devices, the trend
    is to design a smart grid communication infrastructure to support and allow implementation
    of autonomous distributed network operation as discussed in [35]. This can be
    deemed as another possible challenge in designing and implementing smart grid
    communications. 4. Smart grid projects for major smart grid applications It is
    understood that a successful smart grid project starts with a well-designed communications
    network and systems architecture. Selecting the right communication technologies
    is the fundamental component of this success. In various real-world smart grid
    implementations to be discussed below, many different communication technologies
    are deployed. In practice, an electric utility chooses to implement communication
    technologies that best fit its requirements after having evaluated current system
    infrastructures, technology standards, application requirements, and future scaling
    requirements. In the past several years, many countries including the U.S., several
    European countries and China have launched many smart grid projects [36], [37].
    Selected smart grid projects are discussed below with the emphasis on their communication
    aspects. This information is summarized in Table 5. Table 5. Various types of

    Cellular (2G and 3G) Large-scale AMR project, monitor end-users’ electricity usage
    in real-time, to both prepare accurate bills and estimate ongoing demand In the
    U.S., the Austin Energy’s AMI project is one of the first fully operational smart
    grid projects. As of 2012, approximately 500,000 devices are deployed, including
    86,000 smart thermostats, 410,000 smart meters, 2500 sensors and 3000 computers
    and network elements [38]. Austin Energy uses a combination of Cellnet + Hunt’s
    Radio Frequency (RF) mesh network and optical fiber to allow a variety of smart
    grid functions, including AMI, distribution automation, SCADA and multi-service
    utility meter operation. The network also supports time-of-use pricing, distribution
    automation, load management, and outage management applications. Data transmission
    is based on a robust, peer-to-peer mesh network utilizing a 902–928 MHz unlicensed
    frequency band. The City of Glendale Water and Power Utility initiated its AMI
    project in 2010, focusing on installation of advanced meters, use of customer
    systems and in-home displays, installation of distribution automation equipment,
    and management of distributed energy storage was started in 2010. Its AMI system
    includes deployment of 86,526 smart meters, 80,000 HANs and 30,000 in-home displays.
    A meter data management system (MDMS) is deployed to provide customers access
    to data about their electricity usage and enable dynamic rate programs [39]. In
    this case, a combination of Ethernet/Internet protocol backhaul and a local wireless
    mesh radio frequency network is used to support two-way communication between
    meters and utility data systems and allows for monitoring and control of select
    distribution automation equipment. The company uses Tropos WiFi mesh into Ethernet/Fiber
    network for backhaul communications, and 900 MHz mesh to Itron cell relay collectors
    for its meter communication network. Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BG&E)
    initiated its smart grid project in 2010, including Advanced Metering Infrastructure
    (AMI), implementation of a customer web portal and home energy management, and
    installation of a new customer care and billing system. The project includes enhancement
    of its communication infrastructure, as well as deployment of about 1.3 million
    smart meters, and 400,000 Direct Load Control (DLC) devices to cycle air conditioning
    units and electric hot water heaters during peak periods as part of a new load
    management plan [40]. BG&E’s communication infrastructure to support its NAN/FAN
    applications includes a two-way mesh radio frequency network consisting of approximately
    1200 access points and relays designed to remotely connect smart meters to back-office
    systems. The company selects Verizon for its backhaul communications. A V2G demonstration
    project initiated by AC Propulsion, Inc. was launched in California, USA. In this
    project, VW Beetle electric vehicles are equipped with a wireless modem to allow
    remote dispatch of V2G functions over the Internet. Control commands can be sent
    wirelessly to the vehicle based on current power need and knowledge of the vehicle
    battery current state-of-charge (SOC). Commands received by the vehicle over a
    wireless modem are interpreted to control AC line current to/from the system.
    The vehicle automatically maintains the battery SOC to comply with the driver
    usage requirement. The wireless link between the aggregator server and the vehicle
    is an always-on TCP/IP connection. The wireless data service is based on the CDPD
    (cellular digital packet data) system and is provided by AT&T Wireless [41]. A
    PMU deployment and communication system modernization project was started by Duke
    Energy Carolinas, LLC in North Carolina and South Carolina in 2010. This project
    includes the installation of 102 PMUs and 2 phasor data concentrators (PDC), and
    the upgrade of existing serial-based communications infrastructure. The PMU deployment
    provides high-resolution monitoring that improves grid operators’ ability to visualize
    and manage the transmission system, improving reliability and grid operations.
    The company upgrades the existing synchronous optical networking (SONET) WAN backbone
    to a redundant 6 node optical carrier (OC)-3 ring and existing serial communications
    systems to IP-based communications at substations to deliver PMU data to PDC [42].
    In Europe, a pilot project was initiated by Eandis and Infrax for an Advanced
    Metering Management (AMM) system in the region of Flanders, Belgium in 2011. Automated
    two-way communication between central systems and electricity/gas meters are enabled
    using approximately 36,000 communication gateways. A combination of PLC, DSL/LAN
    networks and mobile networks (General Packet Radio Service, GPRS) are utilized
    to set up communications between customers and an electric utility [43]. One of
    the European largest smart metering projects had been completed by Acea Distribuzione
    – the largest municipal utility in Italy. The implementation of the integrated
    AMM system began in 2004 to improve energy efficiency in Italy’s capital, serving
    roughly 1.5 million households. The system includes high accuracy bi-directional
    meters and smart grid applications such as network operation control, and the
    ability to monitor low and medium voltage line status automatically. The system
    has also been designed to be extended to gas and water meters [44]. The company
    uses the Oracle Utilities MDMS system to support its AMM project, as well as uses
    PLC and GPRS to support its metering communication network. A large-scale pilot
    project was initiated by Amperion Greece for the Public Power Corporation (PPC)
    to provide remote monitoring and control of irrigation pumps. The objective of
    the project is to reduce electricity consumption during peak hours and to detect
    power outages and electrical network availability in Larissa, a rural area in
    central Greece. The project provides a broadband access to the area encompassing
    a 107-km medium voltage power grid where broad power line (BPL) units installed.
    The BPL units were organized into cells to allow network scalability. A hybrid
    wireless-broadband over power lines (W-BPL) solution, combining the power distribution
    grid with Wi-Fi technology, is deployed in the project; and the Wi-Fi interface
    enables point-to-point connections to neighboring BPL cells. The W-BPL network
    is connected to the Network Operating Center (NOC) installed inside substations.
    The NOC provides the connection to the utility’s remote operating center via a
    virtual private network (VPN) [45]. In China, an Advanced Metering Infrastructure
    (AMI) system was initiated to collect electricity usage information from all meters
    across its vast infrastructure of Huawei, Hongdian and China Mobile for China
    Southern Power Grid. The system allows to monitor end-use electricity usage in
    real-time for accurate billings and estimation of electrical demand. Additionally,
    the system can also detect faults on the meter and control them remotely and monitor
    its electricity network, i.e., substations, power lines and primary nodes. Embedded
    subscriber identification modules (SIMs), which can be connected to a single data
    collection and communication terminal, were used to remotely collect data across
    meters and the power grid via cellular 2G and 3G networks. The SIM information
    is embedded directly into the communication module’s software to avoid end users
    from removing the SIM card and taking the meter out-of-service [46], [47]. Overall,
    communication technologies selected can vary from country to country and from
    utility to utility in order to meet specific reliability, performance, security,
    coverage, scalability, manageability and cost requirements for a particular smart
    grid application. It is worth noting that wireless communications technologies,
    specifically RF mesh, are preferred for NAN/FAN applications in the U.S., while
    PLC is the dominant technology for NAN/FAN applications in Europe. This is because
    of the difference in electric power distribution infrastructures and wiring topologies
    in the U.S. and European countries. An electric power distribution system in the
    U.S. relies on a number of small secondary transformers – each of which serves
    a small number of houses, i.e., 2–7 houses. On the other hand, an electric power
    distribution system in European countries utilizes large secondary transformers
    – each of which commonly serves 100 houses or more. As a heavy attenuation can
    occur with PLC when communication signals on a medium-voltage line passes through
    a secondary transformer onto a low-voltage line, this makes it more difficult
    for electric utilities in the U.S. to employ PLC to serve their smart grid applications.
    For WAN applications, fiber optic has always been the commonly chosen technology.
    This is due to its ability to provide reliable and high-performance communications.
    5. Conclusion This paper compiles network requirements for major smart grid applications,
    ranging from home/building automation, smart metering, distribution automation,
    to wide-area monitoring, control and protection from a variety of smart grid use
    cases and selected standards. With respect to network requirements, communication
    technologies with low cost and power consumption are required for customer premises
    area network applications; those with high reliability and low latency are required
    for NAN/FAN applications; and those with very high reliability/security and extremely
    low latency are required for WAN applications. The paper also discusses real-world
    examples of smart grid applications and associated communication technologies.
    It is expected that this paper can provide an insight into communication network
    requirements for a variety of smart grid applications. This can be particularly
    useful for utility engineers when designing their smart grid networks and associated
    applications. Acknowledgement This work was supported in part by the U.S. National

    Get rights and content Highlights • Systematic literature review of IoT applications
    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    selected by application subdomain. 4.2. Answer to the second research question
    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:
    web, mobile and local, in four subdomains: monitoring, control, prediction, and
    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

    Get rights and content Abstract The increasing penetration of renewable energy
    sources (RES) in power systems intensifies the need of enhancing the flexibility
    in grid operations in order to accommodate the uncertain power output of the leading
    RES such as wind and solar generation. Utilities have been recently showing increasing
    interest in developing Demand Response (DR) programs in order to match generation
    and demand in a more efficient way. Incentive- and price-based DR programs aim
    at enabling the demand side in order to achieve a range of operational and economic
    advantages, towards developing a more sustainable power system structure. The
    contribution of the presented study is twofold. First, a complete and up-to-date
    overview of DR enabling technologies, programs and consumer response types is
    presented. Furthermore, the benefits and the drivers that have motivated the adoption
    of DR programs, as well as the barriers that may hinder their further development,
    are thoroughly discussed. Second, the international DR status quo is identified
    by extensively reviewing existing programs in different regions. Previous article

    and barriersEnabling technologiesPractical evidence 1. Introduction One of the
    main concerns of Independent System Operators (ISOs) has been the fact that electric
    power demand may significantly vary during the day, season and year and the production
    facilities should be suitably dispatched in all time periods in order to satisfy
    it. The demand side has been traditionally considered relatively inelastic and
    therefore, the generation side should be adapted in order to fully supply it.
    However, a series of drivers such as the Climate Change, the increasing penetration
    of renewable energy sources (RES) and the consequent increased need for enhancing
    the flexibility in system operations, the target of improving energy efficiency
    and the need to defer costly investments have motivated efforts aiming at enabling
    the active participation of the demand side in power system operational procedures.
    The activities through which the activation of the demand side is attempted are
    commonly referred to as demand side management (DSM). The Electric Power Research
    Institute (EPRI) has defined DSM as follows [1]: “DSM is the planning, implementation
    and monitoring of those utility activities designed to influence customer use
    of electricity in ways that will produce desired changes in the utility''s load
    shape, i.e. time pattern and magnitude of a utility''s load. Utility programs
    falling under the umbrella of DSM include load management, new uses, strategic
    conservation, electrification, customer generation and adjustments in market share”.
    The concept of DSM can be considered mature (especially for industrial consumers)
    with many efforts to reduce or shift the consumption of end-users in order to
    reduce the stress on power system assets, especially in critical peak demand periods.
    Demand side management comprises four actions: energy efficiency, savings, self-production
    and load management [2]. Among the DSM solutions, load management techniques and
    especially demand response (DR) strategies are gaining more attention in power
    system operations recently, driven by the increasing interest in implementing
    the smart grid concept. DR is defined as “changes in electric usage by end-use
    customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the
    price of electricity over time, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower
    electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability
    is jeopardized” by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and comprises incentive-based
    and price-based programs [3]. Facilitated by the advancement in smart grid enabling
    technologies such as the implementation of Information and Communications Technology
    (ICT) in the power system, the growing numbers of intelligent energy management
    systems (EMSs) in end-user premises, smart grid compatible advanced metering infrastructure
    (AMI), etc., DR strategies have been adopted by ISOs in leading countries around
    the world. Apart from technical studies, there is a broad literature of DSM and
    DR reviews considering different aspects, which can be classified in three main
    categories: i) a general DSM/DR overview followed by recommendations for future
    developments, ii) an overview of DSM/DR status focusing on a particular part of
    the world (i.e., a specific country or region), iii) an overview of DSM/DR for
    a specific implementation (e.g., specific consumer type). In the first category,
    Albadi and El-Saadany presented a concise review of the DR benefits from the participant,
    market and reliability perspectives and analysed a DR scheme based on market simulations
    [4]. Babar et al. [5] provided an overview of the applicability of the agility
    concept in DR programs, aiming at increasing customers’ satisfaction and promote
    market responsiveness. O’Connell et al. analysed the benefits (from the operation,
    planning and economic points of view) and challenges (from the perspective of
    market regulation, end-user acceptability and business schemes) related to DR,
    including a broad literature review on DR modelling assumptions without emphasizing
    on real world examples [6]. Li et al. [7] provided a review study on the potential
    of different demand side resources, such as controllable loads and electric vehicles,
    to be engaged in DR activities. Bossmann and Eser [8] focused on the review of
    studies concerning model-based assessment of DR measures. Siano performed a general
    survey on smart grids and DR; however, without giving specific importance to neither
    benefits/barriers nor real-world examples of DR programs [9]. Another general
    review on DSM considering DR, intelligent energy systems and smart loads was performed
    by Palensky and Dietrich [10]. Kotskova et al. performed a review on load management
    including DR strategies, providing also a small number of real examples [11].
    Aghaei and Alizadeh conducted a general analysis of DR strategies, emphasizing
    on the application of DR in accommodating the varying nature of RES, presenting
    also a limited number of DR implementation examples [12]. Gelazanskas and Gamage
    briefly analysed the benefits and the drivers of DSM and proposed a demand control
    strategy without a further overview of other DSM and DR relevant topics [13].
    Wang et al. presented an overview of real-time markets around the world (especially
    in North America, Australia and Europe), focusing on the technical analysis of
    DR integration [14]. Hu et al. analysed the existing dynamic pricing programs
    in the U.S. and Europe, presenting also real examples, program targets, enabling
    technologies and policy issues; yet, incentive-based programs and the analysis
    of the benefits and challenges were not considered [15]. Shen et al. reviewed
    the role of regulatory reforms, market structure changes and technological developments
    in rendering DR more viable in the electric power system [16]. In a detailed review
    study, Varkadas et al. examined DR types, requirements and enabling technologies,
    presenting also some real examples from around the world, as well as optimization
    methods for DR applications with a broad review of relevant literature studies
    [17]. However, [17] did not discuss the drivers that promote DR, available DR
    programs in different regions, as well as the reasons for which DR is not currently
    evenly developed around the world. In the second category, Strbac reviewed the
    benefits and challenges of DSM, specifically for the UK electric power system
    [18]. Similar to [18], Bradley et al. performed a review-based analysis for the
    UK in order to evaluate the possible benefits and required costs for wider penetration
    of DR [19]. Warren considered the UK case from the policy point of view for DSM
    applications [20]. Ming et al. [21] and Harish and Kumar [22] examined the cases
    of China and India, respectively, in terms of historical evolution of DSM applications
    together with future expectations. Dong et al. [23] focused also on the potential
    of DR in China, analysing regulatory issues and providing information about relevant
    pilot projects. In the third category, Gyamfi et al. examined a specific DR application
    area concerning residential end-users by reviewing the impacts of behavioural
    changes of different residential end-user profiles on the success of DR strategies
    [24]. Soares et al. also analysed the residential end-user behaviour focusing
    particularly on DR using domestic appliances [25]. Muratori et al. considered
    residential DR from the electricity market point of view [26]. Khan et al. analysed
    the correlation between the success of DR and the technological advancement in
    Home EMSs (HEMSs) [27]. Esther and Kumar [28] surveyed architectures, approaches
    and optimization models for residential DR. Haider et al. [29] also discussed
    the current status of residential DR and the relevant strategies, as well as the
    ICT requirements. Merkert et al. examined the challenges and opportunities of
    applying DSM solutions in industrial end-users supported by a set of real industrial
    case studies [30]. Finally, Zehir et al. [31] analysed the impacts of volatility
    related to distributed generation and considered different DR approaches to accommodate
    it. The objectives of this study, which also define its main contributions with
    respect to existing studies, are as follows: • To constitute a reference point
    regarding a) the DR enabling control, metering and communication technology, b)
    different DR and consumer response types, c) the potential benefits of DR, d)
    the current status of DR development globally, and e) the barriers to the development
    of DR, by reviewing these aspects in a comprehensive manner. • To present a remarkable
    number of real-life application examples covering several countries and regions
    in order to thoroughly evaluate the global DR status quo and to examine in-depth
    the key-elements that affect the integration of different kinds of DR solutions
    in regions with different economic, environmental and political conditions. The
    remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview
    of DR enabling technologies and DR strategies related to end-user types. Section
    3 discusses the benefits and drivers of adopting DR strategies in electric power
    systems. Section 4 presents a broad analysis of practical evidence related to
    DR across the world with numerous real examples. Section 5 performs a detailed
    analysis of the barriers to DR development from different perspectives. The study
    is concluded with final remarks in Section 6. 2. General overview of DR 2.1. Overview
    of enabling technologies DSM and DR programs have been practically enabled because
    of the evolution of the technology required to physically implement them. In this
    section a discussion on the required metering, control and communication infrastructure
    is provided. 2.1.1. Metering and control infrastructure Among the different components
    of the enabling infrastructure, smart meters and AMI are the vital for implementing
    DR strategies. Smart meters are new generation electronic meters that have the
    capability of bi-directional communication between the end-user and the load serving
    entity (LSE). For DR activities, smart meters can receive signals from the LSE,
    such as the maximum allowed level of power procurement in a certain period (e.g.,
    to reduce the loading of a local transformer) or price signals determined in a
    dynamic way. Besides, AMI is a network of millions of smart meters [32]. Smart
    meter and AMI penetration across the world is increasing rapidly and many pilot
    projects were implemented in the last decade. A mapping of Smart Metering Projects
    across the world can be found in [33]. In order to provide automated control for
    a more effective participation in a DR program, whether it is price- or incentive-based,
    EMS structures in end-user areas (residential, commercial or industrial buildings,
    etc.) are also critical components. A common EMS structure receives information
    signals from the controllable/non-controllable loads of the end-user, including
    the state of the appliance, its power consumption, etc. Also, the EMS may receive
    information regarding the available production from RES or conventional self-production
    units. Besides, all the signals of the LSE including instructions during DR events,
    pricing data, etc., are transferred to the EMS through the AMI. By considering
    all the input information, the EMS decides the optimal operating strategy for
    the end-user, aiming at satisfying both the requirements of the LSE that calls
    for DR and the end-user, in terms of not compromising the fulfilment of the service
    the electricity is used for. As regards the current state of EMS adoption around
    the world, major regional differences can be noticed. The U.S. is a leader in
    the adoption of EMS, and especially in the HEMS market. European utilities are
    also supporting relevant pilot projects [34]. Nevertheless, one may argue that
    since benefits for both the consumers and the utilities have been broadly recognized
    and due to the fact that numerous major companies (including Siemens, Intel, etc.)
    have already rendered commercially available EMS products [35], their penetration
    in the short-term future is likely to increase in residential, commercial and
    industrial areas. 2.1.2. Communication infrastructure A pivotal requirement for
    an effective DR implementation is the capability of handling a significant amount
    of data transfer. A low-latency, moderate bandwidth communication path between
    the parties involved (LSEs, end-user EMS, loads to be controlled, etc.) in a DR
    action is an essential prerequisite to achieve this. Here, latency corresponds
    to the delay between the time that a request is sent by the procuring party and
    the time at which the responding party receives the request and therefore, can
    act accordingly. Moreover, bandwidth corresponds to the data-transfer rate of
    each enabling device in the communication path [36]. The aforementioned low-latency
    and moderate bandwidth specifications are significantly important for the effective
    transfer of DR commands and the rapid implementation of relevant responses to
    ensure an improved performance of a DR strategy. Three domains of data communications
    are considered in the implementation of a DR program: the smart meter domain,
    the Internet domain and the home area network (HAN). Note that the HAN domain
    is a general term that may also refer to residential, industrial and commercial
    end-user premises. The smart meter domain is the AMI structure previously discussed
    and it consists of a network of a large number of smart meters. The Internet domain
    (the cloud) that is used as the computing and information management platform
    by the IT industry is the general public Internet accessed through service providers.
    The HAN is the gateway to the Internet and smart meter domains for controllable
    loads, appliances and their interactions with the EMSs within the end-user premises
    [32,37]. The EMS receives signals from the LSE through the smart meter domain
    and implements actions through the HAN. The Internet is the interface through
    which multiple systems having Internet Protocol (IP) can meet to communicate in
    order to provide a desired task, e.g., direct load control (DLC) over suitable
    loads in the end-user premises. There are also some other definitions for communication
    domains, such as Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN)
    that represent the range of the communication area for the DR enabling communication
    infrastructure [38]. Many communication mechanisms are suitable in terms of being
    able to meet the latency and bandwidth criteria in different data communication
    domains. In general, the aforementioned communication technologies can be categorized
    as wireless and wired technologies. Wireless communication technologies have the
    advantage of lower investment costs due to avoiding additional wiring costs. Besides,
    the flexibility of the end-points is increased because wireless signals can reach
    areas where physical connection is problematic. However, these technologies are
    more prone to signal losses during propagation, a fact that limits their effective
    range. Furthermore, significantly stronger security mechanisms are necessary for
    wireless technologies in order to avoid unauthorized access. ZigBee, Z-wave, Wi-Fi,
    Wi-MAX, cognitive radio and recent cellular technologies can be presented as major
    wireless communication technologies suitable for many communication areas of a
    DR enabling smart grid operation [39]. Wired communication technologies can use
    the existing power lines or an external wiring for signal transmission. Existing
    wired technologies include power line communication (PLC), Fiber-optics, Ethernet,
    etc. Whether wired or wireless technologies are employed, the scalability and
    replicability, availability, reliability and security of the considered solutions
    should be further analysed for the specific application area in order to ensure
    a successful DR implementation [40]. A deeper analysis of communication infrastructure
    technologies and relevant requirements can be found in [38,[41], [42], [43]. 2.1.3.
    Protocols and standards There are many efforts to standardise DR related smart
    grid operational aspects across the world. The U.S. National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) is forming a regulatory framework in order to create common
    smart grid interoperability standards by involving stakeholders and partners from
    the industry, the government, and the academia. In the short-term, the smart grid
    standard version 1.0 is planned to be announced with the aim to be augmented in
    versions 2.0, 3.0, and beyond [44]. IEEE has also numerous standards relevant
    to the smart grid operations available, including a significant number of standards
    having strong relationship to the DR implementation, especially from the communications
    point of view [45]. Apart from the NIST and the IEEE driven standardization approaches
    for DR related smart grid operations, there are also different standardization
    studies taking place. For example, OpenADR is a DoE approved standard developed
    by the “DR Research Center” focusing on the communications data model for sending
    and receiving DR signals from a LSE or an ISO to the customers, and vice-versa
    [46]. Australia and New Zealand have a common AS/NZS 4755.3.2 standard bearing
    the title “DR capabilities supporting technologies for electrical products” [47].
    There are also many other standardization studies regarding DR, especially in
    North America [48] and followed by Australia and Europe, including also the evaluation
    of DR as a business scheme, a fact which indicates that in the near future more
    standards will be available. 2.2. Classification of DR DR programs may be classified
    either by their type (motivation method and trigger criteria) or according to
    the way in which the enrolled consumers respond according to the characterization
    of their load. 2.2.1. Types of DR programs Based on their type, DR programs may
    be categorized as incentive-based or price-based DR programs [4]. The main difference
    between the programs that fall under each of these categories is that in incentive-based
    programs the customers are offered payments in order to deliver a specific amount
    of load reduction over a given time period, while in price-based DR programs consumers
    voluntarily provide load reductions by responding to economic signals. 2.2.1.1.
    Incentive-based DR 2.2.1.1.1. Direct load control The target of DLC programs is
    to engage a large number of small consumers (e.g. residential). Through such programs
    the utility may directly control a specific type of appliances in the end-user
    premises. Typical examples are air conditioners (ACs), lighting, water heating,
    pool pumps, etc. [49]. These programs typically define the number and the duration
    of interruptions in order not to compromise the end-users’ comfort level. The
    participation of the end-user is compensated through discounts or benefits in
    the electricity bill and potentially by extra payments for being called. These
    programs are managed by the utility and as a result the end-user is not pre-notified
    for an interruption. DLC events may be triggered by economic or reliability events.
    2.2.1.1.2. Curtailable load Curtailable load programs are addressed to medium
    and large consumers. Participants in these programs receive incentives in order
    to turn off specific loads or even to interrupt their energy usage, responding
    to calls emitted by the utility. Like in the case of DLC programs, contracts should
    specify the maximum number and the duration of calls. These programs are mandatory,
    i.e. customers may face penalties in case they fail to respond to a DR event.
    Utilities may call the consumer to respond to reliability events; however, load
    curtailments may also be traded in the market [49], [50]. 2.2.1.1.3. Demand side
    bidding, capacity and ancillary services The option of demand side bidding provides
    the opportunity to consumers to actively participate in the electricity market
    by submitting load reduction offers. Large customers may participate in the market
    directly and usually employ sophisticated load management tools and strategies,
    while relatively small consumers can participate indirectly through third-party
    aggregators or LSEs [51]. The demand side may also participate in capacity and
    ancillary services markets, providing a variety of system services in different
    time scales (regulation, spinning reserve etc.) [52]. A demand side bid may have
    the form presented in Fig. 1. Similar to the bids that are submitted by generators,
    the bids from the demand may be single or duplex, simple or complex. A single
    bid pertains the participation only in one market structure, while a duplex bid
    refers to a bid that pertains the coupled participation in two different markets
    (e.g. energy and reserve) [53]. Moreover, the bid may consist of only price-quantity
    pairs, i.e. simple bid, or it may be a complex bid incorporating technical conditions
    such as minimum energy consumption ( ), maximum energy consumption ( ), total
    energy over the considered horizon (e.g. daily), load pickup and drop rates, etc.
    [54]. The only difference between generation side and demand side bids is that
    the latter are downward. In Fig. 1 the negative slope, assuming without loss of
    generality a linear relationship between price and consumption, indicates that
    the demand would accept to consume energy ( ) as long as its bid is less or equal
    to the market clearing price ( ). In case the demand side is eligible to submit
    a duplex bid, then quantity-price offers for upward ( ) and downward ( , ) reserve
    should be also provided. It should also be noted that voluntarily providing reserves
    during emergency situations is also referred to as emergency DR [10]. Download

    Example of demand side bidding. 2.2.1.2. Price-based DR 2.2.1.2.1. Time-of-use
    tariffs Electricity end-users that are charged with flat prices are not aware
    of the varying cost of electricity. Flat rates depict average electricity supplying
    costs and may remain constant for years. The basic idea behind time-of-use (TOU)
    pricing is to better reflect the variations of the electricity provision cost
    with time, in different periods within a day or a season [50]. TOU pricing is
    a stepped rate structure which intends to reflect prices under average market
    conditions with respect to the time of the day during which electricity is consumed
    and does not capture the day-to-day volatility of supply costs. A typical TOU
    structure includes a peak rate, an off-peak rate and potentially a shoulder-peak
    rate [49], for time periods defined by the utility. 2.2.1.2.2. Critical peak pricing
    Time-of-use tariffs reflect the longer term electricity supply costs associated
    with using electricity during a specific period of the day. In order to capture
    the short-term costs of periods which are considered critical for the power system,
    critical peak pricing (CPP) may be employed. The CPP tariff stands for the superimposition
    of a time-independent high rate on TOU or flat rates, triggered by system criteria
    (e.g. unavailability of reserves, extreme weather conditions that cause unexpected
    variations in demand, etc.). The relevant contracts specify the maximum number
    of days per year that may be considered critical and the number of periods for
    which the CPP rate applies. However, the utility communicates a CPP event in a
    very short notice, from several minutes up to several hours before the CPP rate
    applies. There are also two variants of CPP, namely the Extreme Day pricing (EDP)
    and the Extreme Day CPP. EDP charges higher prices for electricity but, unlike
    CPP, once EDP rates are called they remain active for all the 24 h of the “Extreme
    Day”. Extreme day CPP programs use peak and off-peak rates like CPP programs,
    but only on extreme days. For the other days a flat rate applies [4], [49], [55].
    2.2.1.2.3. Real-time pricing Real-time pricing (RTP) is a pricing scheme in which
    the energy price is updated at a very short notice, typically hourly. Through
    RTP customers are directly exposed to the variability of the cost in the wholesale
    power market or to the changes in locational or zonal marginal prices. Currently,
    there are two noticeable RTP programs engaging residential end-users in the U.S.,
    one by PJM [56] and one by the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) [57]. Both communicate
    the day-ahead market prices one day before the actual power delivery; however,
    the way in which they price the consumers differs. In the first program, end-users
    are priced according to the real-time prices that are settled in the end of an
    hour in the actual dispatch day and are the averaged 5-min prices of that hour,
    while in the second program consumers are directly priced according to the day-ahead
    prices. 2.2.2. Customer response 2.2.2.1. Industrial customers The energy consumption
    by industrial customers represents a major portion of the total electric energy
    produced. It has been reported that for many utilities 2–10% of the industrial
    consumers are responsible for at least 80% of the electricity usage [58]. Paulus
    and Borggrefe [59] have investigated the potential of DSM in energy-intensive
    industrial customers in Germany, arguing that the highest economic potential can
    be found in large-scale processes that rely on a single source to satisfy their
    energy demand. In Germany the annual electricity demand of the 250 different branches
    of the industrial sector is 252.6 TW h, while the technical potential of the investigated
    industrial processes for DR (tertiary positive reserves) is 2660 MW. Similarly,
    the Swedish Government has provided the energy-intensive companies the opportunity
    to benefit from reduced taxation on electricity use on the condition that they
    take energy efficiency measures [60]. The aforementioned facts demonstrate that
    the industrial sector is suitable for developing DR programs. However, adopting
    DR programs may be challenging for the industrial firms. For commercial and residential
    customers, DR entails potential temporary loss of comfort (e.g. by controlling
    ACs). On the other hand, industrial customers may reduce their demand by on-site
    generation, energy storage, consumption shifting, non-critical load curtailment
    and temporary shut-down of several processes. Temporarily interrupting one or
    more processes may result in significant load reductions. Nevertheless, several
    constraints such as the criticality of a process, the number of available production
    lines, the required production target, inventory restrictions, etc., may have
    longer term impacts on the process line, rendering DR economically inefficient
    [58]. Due to their technical requirements several processes such as steel production
    using electric arc furnaces, cement milling and aluminium electrolysis are only
    suitable for load shedding, while others such as chloralkali electrolysis and
    mechanical refining of wood pulp can be shifted [59]. To efficiently provide DR
    services, industrial consumers must be equipped with an automated decision system
    that considers the technical constraints of the processes and the alternative
    energy sources available. In [61], Ding et al. have proposed such a system that
    performs optimal scheduling of the industrial load considering constraints posed
    by the processes while considering the possibility of self-generation and energy
    storage. Furthermore, Paterakis et al. [62] have proposed a stochastic optimization
    model through which large industrial consumers can provide energy and reserve
    services in the day-ahead market in order to balance the uncertain wind production.
    2.2.2.2. Commercial and other non-residential customers Commercial and other types
    of non-residential premises can also provide DR for load reduction or ancillary
    services. AC is the most significant load that can be controlled. In [63] the
    capability of providing spinning reserve from a hotel was demonstrated. The preliminary
    tests indicated that apart from the quick response, the load could be curtailed
    up to 37% depending on the outdoors temperature. Furthermore, large commercial
    heating-ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems provide easier access
    to a single, significantly larger demand side resource than aggregating large
    numbers of smaller residential loads, while automation equipment that is already
    present in most large commercial buildings may be exploited in order reduce the
    infrastructure costs associated with the implementation of DR programs [64]. Moreover,
    due to the large space that commercial buildings occupy, they present higher thermal
    inertia, allowing for longer interruptions. Also, HVAC systems employ variable
    frequency drives (VFD), the speed and power of which can be quickly and continuously
    adjusted, following the regulation signal provided by the system operator in order
    to provide regulation reserve [65]. Recently, the idea of energy intelligent buildings
    that monitor their energy consumption and manage locally available resources as
    well as the energy procurement from the grid has been introduced [66]. In [67]
    a control and scheduling architecture for offices was proposed in order to take
    advantage of RTP DR by controlling a range of loads (e.g. lighting). 2.2.2.3.
    Residential customers Residential customers are suitable for DLC and price-based
    DR programs. Apart from shifting load manually in response to price signals, residential
    customers may invest on an automated system, namely a HEMS, which monitors and
    controls the consumption of several appliances [68]. Typical appliances that can
    be found in most households and are suitable for being scheduled by the HEMS in
    response to time-varying prices or to be rendered available for direct control
    by the utility are: electric water heaters, ACs, refrigerators, washing machines,
    clothes dryers and dishwashers. The first three loads are thermostatically controllable
    while the other three when equipped with communication modules are called smart
    appliances. There is an abundant literature suggesting models and identifying
    the potential of the residential sector to participate in DR programs in order
    to provide various system services such as regulation and spinning reserves. For
    example, [69] investigates the potential of a household equipped with a HEMS to
    provide frequency response, [70] examines the potential of load flexibility provided
    by smart appliances in order to participate in reserve services, [71] employs
    a model of ACs in order to provide reserves by DLC through an aggregator and,
    finally, [72] performs a similar analysis for electric water heaters. 2.2.2.4.
    Electric vehicles Currently, the market share of electric vehicles (EVs) is relatively
    low, limited to a few hundreds of registered cars in most industrialized countries.
    As a result, the impacts of the EVs on the power system, namely the increase in
    energy consumption, are not currently evident [73]; however, as the electrification
    of the transport sector is expected to be intensified in the future, significant
    challenges to the integration of large EV fleets may occur [74], [75]. In order
    to facilitate the integration of EVs in the future, two technical measures that
    belong to the category of DR have been proposed: 1) controlled unidirectional
    charging, 2) controlled bi-directional charging, more commonly known as vehicle-to-grid
    (V2G). The foreseen benefits of implementing such techniques are threefold. First,
    a fleet of EVs may be employed in order to perform peak shaving and valley filling,
    improving the economic efficiency of the power system [76]. Second, EVs could
    increase the price elasticity of residential end-users since the EV charging load
    would render electricity procurement an important cost for the households [73].
    Third, fleets of EVs could be used in order to provide balancing services to facilitate
    the integration of RES [77]. 2.2.2.5. Data centers Data centers are an emerging
    type of consumer that in the recent years has known significant growth both in
    size and energy consumption. For this reason, a 2007 report from the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency has suggested that data centers should adopt DR strategies in
    order to reduce the strain on the power system [78]. Irwin et al. [79] have identified
    three main reasons for which data centers are eligible candidate customer types
    for DR. First, data centers are major energy consumers and therefore have a significant
    impact on the power system conditions. Second, their task is tolerant of delays
    and performance degradations, a fact that makes data centers highly price responsive.
    Third, servers are already equipped with power management mechanisms that are
    remotely programmable and therefore, the power may be accurately adjusted according
    to the provided signals. Masanet et al. [80] found that during 2008 the annual
    energy consumption of the data centers could have been reduced by 80%, while several
    other studies address the feasibility of DR provision from data centers [81].
    Data centers are also considered capable of providing a range of ancillary services
    [82]. Regulation services are constantly active and data centers could adjust
    their consumption according to the signals sent by the grid operator every few
    seconds. Furthermore, by transitioning a number of active servers to the sleep
    state, data centers may provide short-term operating reserves or emergency DR.
    After the event, servers are transitioned from sleep mode back to a normal operating
    state. Data centers typically possess two further assets that increase the value
    and the flexibility of the provided reserves: backup generators and uninterruptible
    power sources (UPS). The former may be used in order to provide ancillary services
    to the grid without interrupting the workload, while the UPS could be used in
    order to permit longer time response. 3. DR benefits and drivers DR has the potential
    to offer a diverse range of benefits depending on the design and the aim of the
    specific DR implementation. In this section the benefits of DR are presented and
    discussed, especially focusing on the possible contribution of DR to the integration
    of high amounts of intermittent renewable generation into the power system. The
    benefits for the ISOs, the electricity market and its participants are also identified.
    3.1. The role of DR in facilitating the integration of intermittent generation
    Large scale integration of RES in power systems plays a central role in ambitious
    programs initiated by leading countries around the world, such as the regional
    greenhouse gas emission control schemes in the U.S. and the 20/20/20 targets in
    the European Union (EU) [83]. Among the different RES, wind and solar capacity
    is expected to increase significantly in the future [84], [85]. In the U.S. wind
    is expected to grow from 31 TW h in 2008 to 1160 TW h by 2030, which stands for
    a target of 20% of the total supply, while solar capacity is anticipated to reach
    16 GW by 2020 [86]. Similar tendency is noticed in the EU as well. For example,
    the target for the electricity generation share of the wind in Ireland is set
    to 40% by 2020 [87]. Despite the potential environmental benefits that arise from
    the widespread adoption of wind and solar power generation, their highly uncertain
    nature may jeopardize the security of the power system and pose new technical
    and economic challenges to ISOs. These challenges primarily stem from the fact
    that these resources are highly varying with time, their predictability is limited
    and they are not controllable, i.e. they cannot be modified by instruction in
    order to economically match the load [87]. For example, in Fig. 2 the total hourly
    production of wind and solar parks in the island of Crete, Greece, for three consecutive
    days in April 2012 is presented [88]. As it can be noticed, the wind production
    ranges between 10 and 125 MW in a time span of less than 24 h, while it presents
    significant fluctuations in shorter time frames. On the other hand, despite the
    fact that the solar production is available only during the day-time, it presents
    a more stable hourly pattern in this case; however, its intra-hourly behaviour
    may be significantly variable. Download : Download high-res image (189KB) Download

    island of Crete (10–12/04/2012) [88]. The majority of existing power systems has
    been designed considering the fluctuations of the demand. Nevertheless, it is
    questionable whether the grid can serve both varying loads and high amounts of
    variable generation such as wind and solar. In order to accommodate the additional
    uncertainty, an increased amount of reserves should be maintained. Especially
    regulation and load-following needs, both in terms of capacity and ramping capability,
    are likely to be augmented with the increasing penetration of wind and solar generation.
    Generators providing regulation and load-following reserves incur significant
    costs such as efficiency loss because of ramping, environmental costs due to increased
    emissions, increased wear and tear and, therefore, increased operating and maintenance
    costs. Furthermore, in order to provide reserve services, a generator must operate
    partly-loaded, a fact that entails lost opportunity costs in the energy market
    [89]. As the share of RES increases, peaking and intermediate (cycling) units
    are likely to be displaced. In addition to that, several base load plants may
    need to be operated in a cycling manner, a function for which they are not designed
    because their operation is subject to long start-up, minimum up, down and decommissioning
    times. These issues can be resolved by the participation of the demand side in
    the load following reserves through appropriately designed DR programs. Certain
    types of loads such as ACs and electric space heaters have the ability to adjust
    their power to changes in demand instantaneously [90], while the ramp rates of
    conventional generators are limited. Moreover, it is argued that the ancillary
    services provided by the demand side may prove more reliable since the reliability
    of the response of an aggregation of a significant number of loads is greater
    than the one of a small number of large generators [91]. Another important issue
    that is primarily linked to the wind generation and can be tackled with the utilization
    of DR activities is the wind “over-generation” [92]. This problem appears when
    high wind generation is available during off-peak periods, during the night or
    early in the day. For example, in Fig. 2 one may notice high wind generation in
    the night between April 10 and April 11, 2012. In such cases, due to the fact
    that most markets consider the wind power generators as must-run, either the output
    of the conventional generation must be reduced in order to accommodate the wind
    generation, or the excessive wind energy should be curtailed, an option that may
    bear high penalties, in order to maintain the balance of the system. The situation
    escalates when the system comprises relatively inflexible base load generators
    that are committed to operate near their technical minimum power outputs during
    such periods. In general, operating generating units at lower output or cycling
    base load units may compromise the environmental benefits of integrating wind
    power in the system. Typically, the consumption of fuel and the emissions of generators
    increase when they operate at a low capacity. Evidently, one solution that DR
    can offer is the increase in the demand in periods in which there is excessive
    wind power generation. Loads that can be shifted in such a way that allows the
    otherwise spilled wind energy to be absorbed include water pumping, irrigation,
    municipal treatment facilities, and thermal storage in large buildings, industrial
    electrolysis, aluminium smelting, etc. [93]. O’Connel et al. [6] highlight another
    consequence of increased RES penetration which the coordinated planning and operation
    of generation and DR could ease, contributing to substantial welfare gains. Power
    systems with increased wind penetration tend to depend on the interconnections
    in order to balance the grid. However, the deployment of DR may enable the economically
    efficient use of interconnections, since the spatial characteristics of wind may
    adversely affect the prices of the energy exchange depending on the scarcity of
    wind power generation, because nearby regions are likely to experience high or
    low wind power generation simultaneously. Finally, environmental targets will
    intensify the electrification of the transportation sector in the future in order
    to displace the use of petroleum, a fact that presents a significant opportunity
    for DR activities in favour of a better integration of renewable energy in the
    power system. Fleets of EVs could act as aggregations of distributed energy storage,
    while their charging could be controlled. Through the V2G option they could act
    as an energy buffer to improve the grid regulation and other ancillary services.
    These issues are thoroughly discussed in [94]. 3.2. Benefits for the system DR
    is recognized to have potential system-wide benefits. Many utilities, especially
    in the U.S., are obliged by regulatory or legislative requirements to consider
    DR in their resource planning [95], while the Energy Efficiency Directive [96]
    of the EU states that the planning process should consider the peak shaving effect
    of DR. The traditional approach to network upgrading considers that the demand
    grows gradually and as a result a portion of the added grid capacity will eventually
    remain unexploited since the longer term forecasting of the load growth is uncertain
    and, therefore, network reinforcement tends to be economically inefficient in
    order to be on the safe-side. In general, the network expansion is planned considering
    a long technical life-span (several decades), e.g. more than 50 years for Norwegian
    Transmission System Operators (TSOs) [97]. Typically, new investments are triggered
    because of an anticipated increase in the load. DR can contribute to a reduced
    forecasted peak demand, since long-term DR programs will be implicitly taken into
    account in the peak demand forecasts [98]. Thus, network investments may be postponed.
    Furthermore, the uncertainty in the load evolution can affect the efficiency of
    a system reinforcement investment. More specifically, it is possible that the
    demand for electricity may decline, increasing the idle capacity of the system
    and, therefore, the operating cost of the network per unit of output [99]. On
    the other hand, DR programs may preventively contribute to confront an upward
    deviation of demand [100]. DR programs that aim to enhance the distribution system
    operation can also bring a series of benefits. Problems related to the voltage
    magnitude, distribution substation congestion and losses can be mitigated by DR
    activities at the distribution level. Electrical equipment is designed for optimum
    operation at the nominal voltage. Any deviation from this can result in decreased
    efficiency, damage or severely reduced life of the infrastructure [101]. Furthermore,
    congestion management can reduce the active power losses and improve the overall
    system reliability [102]. The distributed nature and the spatial diversity of
    demand can be exploited in order to eliminate congestions and, therefore, reduced
    loading of transformers and lines can defer or render redundant the need for costly
    upgrades and allow an increased penetration of distributed generation [6]. Also,
    a demonstration on the village of Hartley Bay, British Columbia, Canada, rendered
    evident how DR can be used in order to enhance the economic and supply efficiency
    of a remote community [103]. Currently, the total capacity of installed generation
    must be larger than the system maximum demand in order to guarantee the security
    of supply under contingencies or severe demand variations. Strbac has demonstrated
    that the frequency of large energy deficits is very rare [18]. DR can be a preferable
    choice in order to contemplate relatively small energy deficits. A striking example
    is the crisis in California in June 2000 in which a shortage of 300 MW (around
    0.6% of the total system capacity) caused rolling blackouts [101]. As a result,
    DR may serve as an alternative to the investment in new power plants that would
    be underutilized in order to provide capacity reserves [50]. DR has another important
    side advantage to offer to the system, aiding the ISOs to render the power system
    more environmentally sustainable. Apart from facilitating a better integration
    of renewable generation in the system, as it was previously discussed, DR may
    improve the overall energy efficiency and mitigate the reliance on fossil fuels.
    A recent fact sheet regarding the DR implementation in the MISO [104] has demonstrated
    that DR programs which cycle residential appliances such as ACs can actually decrease
    the overall electricity consumption, promoting energy efficiency. Furthermore,
    the reduced utilization of peaking power plants that are less efficient in order
    to cover high demand may contribute to the reduction of the carbon footprint of
    the system. It is characteristically reported that in California the carbon intensity
    of the power system can be up to 33% higher in peak times in comparison with off-peak
    times. Finally, considering DR as an equal option when it comes to the system
    planning, the construction of more conventional power plants may be avoided. 3.3.
    Benefits for the market and its participants It is widely argued that the active
    participation of demand side resources could improve the performance of electricity
    markets and bring significant benefits to the consumers. Regarding the positive
    effects of DR on electricity markets, three key elements may be identified: •
    Lower and more stable electricity prices. • Control of market power. • Economic
    benefits for the consumers. In order to demonstrate the two first points, without
    loss of generality the simplified example that is presented in Fig. 3 can be employed,
    which corresponds to markets in which the uniform spot price of electricity is
    defined by the intersection of the aggregated supply and demand curves, e.g. Nordpool
    [105]. The market operator collects the generation and demand side bids and sorts
    them with respect to their prices. The aggregated supply curve is upward while
    the aggregated demand curve is downward. Close to the maximum capacity of the
    system the bids tend to increase exponentially [4]. The fact that the supply curve
    becomes steeper as the energy quantity increases may be the consequence of the
    profit maximizing behaviour of the generators or can be attributed to the higher
    operating costs of peaking units. In such cases, a small reduction in the demand
    may induce a significant reduction in the market price [98]. The effect of price
    responsive demand on the market clearing prices was investigated in [106]. A similar
    analysis is carried out for markets that adopt Locational Marginal Prices (LMP)
    in [107]. Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that several crises in electricity
    markets have been linked to the absence of DR programs [108]. For example, it
    has been reported that a small decrease in the demand of the scale of 5% could
    have yielded a reduction of 50% in electricity price during the California electricity
    crisis in 2000 [4]. One of the reasons that lead to the electricity crisis of
    California is related to the structure of deregulated markets and the fact that
    generators do not behave as purely competitive firms. As a result, this market
    design is prone to market manipulation by large generators. Market monitoring
    is a way to address this issue; however, the economic and technical deficiencies
    of this approach have led to the enforcement of price caps, which in turn limits
    the potential of peaking units to recover their investment costs [109]. DR may
    prove beneficial in reducing both supplier and locational market power, limiting
    the ability of large producers to manipulate the price of electricity. The market
    clearing price is the value at which the marginal revenue of the supply equals
    the marginal benefit of the demand, thus constituting an equilibrium point (E1).
    If the demand curve is steep (DC1), i.e. the demand is not price-responsive, then
    the generation side may attempt to manipulate electricity prices by submitting
    more costly bids. This implies shifting the initial supply curve (SC1) upwards
    (SC2) and the new corresponding equilibrium point (E2) corresponds to an increased
    price . However, in case the demand side is price-responsive, then the market
    leverage is limited, achieving a different equilibrium point (E3) that corresponds
    to a lower price . In addition to this, Siano [9] reports several other relevant
    benefits: the increase in the number of suppliers in the market through the improvement
    in the market competition, reduced concentration and restriction of collusion.
    Appropriate price-based DR programs and a sufficient amount of responsive demand
    may alleviate the need for price caps and stringent market monitoring. Download

    An illustration of the effect of responsive demand in electricity markets. Allowing
    consumers to respond to dynamic electricity prices has two anticipated effects
    that are also commonly referred to as “flattening” of the system load profile:
    peak shaving during high price periods and load shifting to relatively low price
    periods. In this way, the magnitude of the wholesale and the retail prices can
    be reduced while the price spikes and the volatility of the spot market can be
    mitigated [110]. As a result, in the long-run, benefits can also emerge for the
    consumers that do not participate in DR programs, since the lower wholesale market
    prices due to sustained DR programs are likely to cause a decrease in the flat
    retail rates as well [101]. Furthermore, the transition from flat tariffs to time
    varying prices is thought to increase the consumer and societal welfare [6]. Regarding
    small customers (e.g. residential), Allcott [111] indicates that the increase
    in consumer welfare is not significant since the electricity costs represent only
    a small portion of their overall expenses; however, it results in an increase
    in the overall social welfare. On the other hand, responding to time varying pricing
    definitely contributes to the increase in the welfare of larger commercial and
    industrial consumers [112]. Besides, a study concerning the DR economic welfare
    analysis in the PJM market has demonstrated a net benefit for the system that
    exceeds the total annual subsidy payments [113]. 4. Practical evidence 4.1. North
    America As it was reported by the Transparency Market Research, North America
    was the leading region in the DR capacity market in 2013, accounting for more
    than 80% of the global market share, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific [114].
    Thus, the analysis of DR examples in North America is significantly useful in
    order to observe the trends in this leading part of the global smart grid sector.
    4.1.1. United States 4.1.1.1. Major States of the U.S 4.1.1.1.1. California California
    is the state with the greatest population in the U.S. reaching nearly 40 million
    people [115] and therefore, offers a considerable potential for the development
    of DR programs. Pacific Gas&Electric Company (PG&E) offers the so-called “SmartAC”
    program to its commercial and residential customers, targeting at controlling
    ACs by cycling aggregated AC load during occasional summer peaks caused mainly
    due to the simultaneous operation of hundreds of thousands of ACs. For commercial
    customers PG&E ensures that the temperature in the working area will not exceed
    the nominal temperature setting by more than four degrees, while in case that
    the AC cycling event happens in an inconvenient time the customer can refuse to
    respond without facing a penalty. From a technical perspective, PG&E realizes
    this program by installing thermostats with communication capability that allows
    remotely raising the temperature setting of the enrolled ACs up to four degrees
    when necessary. A similar program offered to residential end-users provides 50$
    for a 6-month participation period and the SmartAC remotely controllable device
    that directs the AC to run at a lower capacity during energy shortages for free.
    The AC settings can also be manually restored if the response to a DR event is
    inconvenient for the end-user. For larger customers, PG&E offers a range of DR
    programs such as peak day pricing, base interruptible program, demand bidding
    program, scheduled load reduction program, optional binding mandatory curtailment
    plan as business programs, aggregator managed portfolio and capacity bidding program
    as aggregator programs and automated DR incentive and permanent load shift as
    incentive-based programs. In the Peak Day Pricing Program (PDPD), a discount on
    regular summer electricity prices is offered in exchange for higher prices during
    the 9–15 Peak Pricing Event Days per year that normally occur during the hottest
    days of the summer, encouraging energy conservation during these days with higher
    demand. A surcharge is added to the regular time-of-use rate during the event
    and a pre-alert is sent to the end-user the day before in order to plan the energy
    conservation or shifting. A risk-free option is also proposed for the first 12
    months providing a credit for the difference, if more is paid during the first
    year on PDPD. The Base Interruptible Program (BIP) offers an incentive to the
    end-user to reduce the load demand to or below a pre-selected level (firm service
    level – FIL). By giving an advanced notification of 30 min, an incentive of 8–9$/kW
    per month is provided while a monthly incentive payment is also given if no DR
    events occur. However, a charge of 6$/kW is imposed for the extra demand over
    the pre-selected level if the end-user fails to reduce its load to or below its
    FIL during an event. The limit of BIP is 10 events per month or 120 h per year.
    The Demand Bidding Program (DBP) is a day-ahead program that allows submitting
    load reduction bids on an hourly basis without imposing financial penalties if
    the customer fails to meet its committed reduction. DBP ensures a day-ahead notice
    by 12:00 p.m. and offers an incentive payment of 0.50$/kWh of load reduction,
    having the minimum requirement of load reduction bids of 10 kW for two consecutive
    hours. As the PG&E is not obliged to call a DBP event, there is not an incentive
    given if the end-user enrolled in the DBP is not called within the monthly period
    and there is no penalty if the end-user fails to reduce the energy during the
    event periods. The Scheduled Load Reduction Program (SLRP) offers a payment for
    a load reduction during pre-selected time periods for customers with a minimum
    average monthly demand of 100 kW by selecting one to three four-hour time periods
    between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on one or more weekdays with a committed load reduction
    of at least 15% of the average monthly demand. The load reductions are measured
    considering a baseline that is calculated by averaging the load demand of the
    selected time periods in the 10 previous normal operating days. The SLRP offers
    a payment of 0.10$/kWh per month for the actual energy reductions. The Optional
    Binding Mandatory Curtailment (OBMC) Plan of PG&E concerns customers that can
    reduce their electric load within 15 min after a call by achieving 15% load reduction
    below their established baseline that is calculated as in the SLRP. The benefit
    of the customer is not financial. PG&E requests rotating outages from all its
    customers in tight demand periods, while by enrolling in OBMC the customer is
    excluded from these rotating outages. The customers are notified via e-mail or
    text messaging for the load reduction ratio (5–15%) and the beginning and ending
    times of the event, including both holidays and weekends. If the customer fails
    to reduce the load to the specified level in a call, a 6$/kWh penalty for each
    kWh above the power reduction commitment is imposed, while failing to respond
    to a second call entails the interruption of the participation in the OBMC Plan
    for five years. Notably, the Automated DR Program (ADRP) provides incentives for
    customers investing in automatic energy management technologies coupled with DR
    programs (PDPD, BIP, etc.). Customers participating in the ADRP receive signals
    from PG&E and are granted with an incentive of 200–400$/kW of dispatchable load,
    and therefore can recover their initial investment in the required infrastructure
    by a pre-payment of 60% of the total project cost initially and 40% after the
    verification of customer performance in an up-to 12 months period of DR performance
    evaluation session [116]. San Diego Gas&Electric Company (SDGE) offers a BIP based
    on monthly bill credits of 12$/kW or 2$/kW during certain periods of the year
    for customers with a minimum reduction of 100 kW or 15% of their monthly average
    peak demand after a notification lead time of 30 min, granting also a flat credit
    per month even if no DR event is activated. There is a penalty of 7.8$/kWh or
    1.2$/kWh (related to the period of the year) in the BIP offered by SDGE for excess
    energy use above the FIL of the customer. SDGE also offers Capacity Bidding, CPP,
    Permanent Load Shifting and Summer Saver Programs as well as Technology Incentives
    [117]. Southern California Edison (SCE) Company offers a more targeted program
    named “Agricultural and Pumping Interruptible Program” to temporarily suspend
    electricity from pumping equipment of the agricultural sector end-users during
    critical demand periods. A control device is installed to the pumping equipment
    or the meter of the end-user that enables SCE to interrupt the electricity supply
    temporarily, until the critical demand period ends. Eligible customers should
    have a measured demand of at least 37 kW or an agricultural load of minimum 50
    horsepower. The interruption event is limited to 6 h per event, while there is
    a maximum of 25 events or 150 h of interruption per year. The customer is awarded
    with 0.01102$/kWh as a base in the monthly electricity bill in terms of credit
    if enrolled in the program even if no event is called. The customer is also rewarded
    with additional credits up to 16.27$/kWh (in summer average on-peak period) during
    interruption events. SCE also offers ADRP, Permanent Load Shifting, TOU Base Interruptible
    Program, Capacity Bidding Program, DBP, Aggregator Managed Portfolio Program,
    CPP, OBMP, RTP, SLRP, Pumping and Agricultural RTP, as well as a Summer Discount
    Plan [118]. 4.1.1.1.2. Texas With a population of nearly 27 million [115], Texas
    is the second most populated State. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas
    (ERCOT) which is managing the flow of electric power for more than 90% of Texas
    area, enables the direct engagement of end-users to provide offers into ERCOT
    markets or to rationally reduce their energy usage by responding to wholesale
    market prices [119]. Currently, Controllable Load Resources are allowed to participate
    in the Non-Spinning Reserve Service Market after an assessment which qualifies
    them to be dispatched by the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch. Moreover,
    a recent pilot project named “Fast-Responding Regulation Service” allows specific
    fast-acting demand side resources to participate in the Regulation Service Market.
    Moreover, the Four Coincident Peak (4CP) Load Reduction Program that targets the
    four 15-min settlement intervals corresponding to the highest load in each of
    the four summer months (June, July, August and September) is available for Non-Opt-In
    Entities in the ERCOT jurisdiction area. For demand side resources, Emergency
    Response Service program that provides a valuable emergency service during grid
    stress conditions, such as rolling blackouts caused by several reasons including
    severe weather conditions, is also available. Transmission and Distribution Service
    Providers (TDSPs) in the region also provide different load management programs.
    Finally, Price Responsive DR Products including Block&Index, CPP/Rebates, RTP,
    TOU Pricing, Other Load Control and Other Voluntary DR Product are employed in
    the service area of ERCOT [120]. Apart from the DR schemes designed mainly for
    industrial and commercial end-users, ERCOT is also recommended to provide DR schemes
    specifically aiming at involving the residential end-users responsible for more
    than half of the energy usage in ERCOT area during peak summer periods due to
    AC load [121]. As a TDSP in the State of Texas, CPS Energy operates a voluntary
    load curtailment program designed for commercial and industrial customers by incentivizing
    them to shed their loads during extreme system conditions, especially during peak
    summer days. The program focuses especially on weekdays between 3 and 6 p.m. with
    a two-hour advanced notification. Customers willing to participate should demonstrate
    at least 50 kW of curtailable electric load in order to be qualified to enrol
    in the program [122]. CPS Energy has also a Smart Thermostat program for commercial
    and residential end-users, in which the control equipment is installed free of
    cost, while CPS Energy maintains the right to cycle off AC compressors for short
    periods of time by sending a radio signal to the smart thermostats during peak
    demand periods. CPS Energy does not provide the end-users with incentives but
    ensures a reduction in heating/cooling related costs of at least 10% because of
    the deployment of Smart Thermostats [123]. American Electric Power (AEP) Texas
    offers an Irrigation Load Management Program in collaboration with EnerNOC for
    the agricultural end-users with electric irrigation pumps of 50 hp or greater,
    willing to allow their irrigation pumps to be remotely shut down during peak demand
    periods in return for a financial incentive. This Program covers the time span
    from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays with a required duration of 1–4 h per event,
    following an advanced notification interval of 60 min. A maximum of 4 events are
    allowed per month in this program [124]. AEP Texas also provides Load Management
    Standard Offer Programs (SOPs) for customers with an installed power of 500 kW
    or higher, supplying them with incentives for load interruptions on short notice
    during peak demand periods. There are 5 different options in this program regarding
    the maximum number and duration of interruptions [125]. Austin Energy Company
    introduced a “Rush Hour Rewards” pilot program in the summer of 2013, having enrolled
    approximately two thousand customers in Austin, Texas. The aforementioned program
    in collaboration with Nest Company, supplied the participating end-users with
    the purchase amount of smart thermostats together with additional incentives to
    avoid operating their ACs during “Rush Hours” of energy usage in summer periods.
    This was realized with remote control of the installed thermostats by increasing
    the temperature set point [126]. Reliant Energy Company has also a similar DR
    program [127]. Moreover, Austin Energy is currently running a program called the
    “Load Cooperative Program” in which the end-users are offered a payment of 1.25$/kWh
    for their curtailed load with a 60-min notification interval during summer peak
    periods [128]. CenterPoint Energy Company offers a Commercial Load Management
    Program to commercial end-users for mandatory load curtailments in summer periods
    between June 1 and September 30 of each year from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays.
    Participating customer groups are required to provide an aggregated peak demand
    of 750 kW. Furthermore, each of the enrolled group members should have at least
    a normal peak demand of 250 kW plus the capability of curtailing at least 100
    kW for a maximum of 5 curtailments per year. The enrolled customers are paid up
    to 35$/kW for the verified curtailed load. This means the supply of at least the
    amount of curtailment agreed in the beginning of the contract year [129]. El Paso
    Electric Company has a Load Management Program for non-residential customers with
    a minimum of 100 kW of curtailable power capability upon notice between June 1
    and September 30 of each year. The curtailment can last up to 5 consecutive hours
    per event. Nine forced curtailments or a maximum of 50 h of interruption per year
    together with scheduled curtailments are requested by the terms of participation
    in the program. The customers may gain up to 60$/kW for curtailed power during
    events in the mentioned program [128], [130]. Furthermore, Oncor Company has a
    similar program called “Commercial Load Management Program” for commercial end-users
    who can render 100 kW of load available for curtailment [131]. There are also
    other load management programs for non-residential end-users offered by different
    service providers [128]. Another interesting example of DR applications in Texas
    is the “Free Nights or Weekends” program provided by TXU Energy. This program
    offers customers willing to participate, totally free electricity at night or
    during the weekends on the condition that they accept significantly higher daytime
    or weekday rates, which aims to shift more load to off-peak hours. The aforementioned
    program has engaged more than 100,000 participants [127]. 4.1.1.1.3. Florida With
    a population of nearly 20 million [115], Florida is also one of the major States.
    DR programs in Florida are similar to the ones in California and Texas. For instance,
    Florida Power&Light (FPL) Company has a Commercial Demand Reduction Program which
    aims to seize direct control of large scale end-users’ total load demand by an
    installed load control device that sheds the pre-determined loads under a pre-notice
    by the FPL. For each kW of curtailment during events, FPL provides credits to
    the end-user together with a flat monthly payment for being enrolled in the program
    [132]. FPL has also an “On Call Program” for business areas that enables FPL to
    temporarily turn off ACs (15–17.5 min per 30-min period for a maximum 6-h time
    period) remotely in critical periods. FPL pays a flat monthly credit even if no
    DR event is called [133]. Tampa Electric Company (TECO) offers a load management
    program to control the selected equipment (ACs or any specialized equipment) in
    the end-user premises. TECO installs a remotely controllable device to shut down
    the equipment selected by the end-user during critical peak power periods in order
    to operate cyclic or continuous load management programs. As far as cyclic operation
    is concerned, the end-user earns 3$/kW, while for continuous operation of the
    curtailment the end-user earns 3.5$/kW for the curtailed load during an event
    [134]. TECO and Progress Energy Company are also offering on-site generation option
    based programs under two different names: “Standby Generator Program” and “Backup
    Generator Program”, respectively. Both programs aim at enabling the control of
    an available on-site generator by a service provider in order to cover a portion
    of the end-user''s load demand by this generator in order to lower the demand
    from the grid in peak power periods. Progress Energy also offers a DLC program
    that enables the service provider to control selected equipment of the customer
    during critical periods, similar to the program offered by TECO [135]. 4.1.1.1.4.
    New York New York occupies a smaller geographical area compared to California,
    Texas and Florida. However, New York accommodates a population of 20 million and
    therefore is also a major State in terms of population [115]. New York Independent
    System Operator (NYISO) offers four different DR programs named “Emergency DR
    Program (EDRP)”, “Special Case Resources (SCR)”, “Day-Ahead DR Program (DADRP)”
    and “Demand Side Ancillary Services Program (DSASP)”. EDRP and SCR programs offer
    incentives to industrial and commercial end-users in order to reduce their power
    in critical periods. DADRP enables end-users to bid their load reductions in the
    day-ahead market which in turn allows NYISO to determine which offers are more
    economical to pay at the market clearing price. Lastly, DSASP allows retail customers
    to bid their load curtailment in day-ahead and/or real-time market in terms of
    operating reserves and regulation service. The market clearing price for reserve
    and/or regulation is paid for the scheduled load curtailment offers [136]. ConEdison
    Company offers also different DR programs. Customers enrolled in a 2-h or less
    pre-notification program named “Distribution Load Relief Program (DLRP)” receive
    6$/kW or 15$/kW (considering their status) monthly and 1$/kWh for the reduced
    load during an event. As another DR program, the 21-h pre-notification program
    “Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP)” offers 10$/kW per month and 1$/kWh for
    the reduced load during event. The customers enrolled in either DLRP or CSRP are
    required to be involved in an one-hour mandatory test every year and they should
    supply the load reduction for at least 4 h during actual events from 6 a.m. to
    12 a.m., any day of the week [137]. 4.1.1.2. Other states and territories of the
    U.S There are also many DR programs with similar structure with the ones in California,
    Texas, Florida and New York, but with different rules and incentives applied in
    smaller States of the U.S.. For further information on these programs, readers
    may refer to [138], [139]. 4.1.2. Canada Apart from the U.S., Canada also demonstrates
    several applied DR programs and strategies. The Independent Electricity System
    Operator (IESO) of Ontario allows aggregators to manage demand side flexibility
    in order to maintain the balance of the grid together with the applied price-based
    grid balancing strategies. The aggregator pre-notifies its facilities to supply
    the required load reduction in order to ensure the request of the IESO in terms
    of total load reduction in critical periods [140]. ENBALA Power Networks Company
    is a leading aggregator that engages hospitals, wastewater treatment centers,
    universities, cold storage facilities, etc., to ensure the required load reduction
    in critical conditions. ENBALA aggregates specific loads of different end-user
    types such as pumps in water/wastewater treatment plants, compressors, evaporators,
    etc., in refrigerated warehouses, HVAC units including air handling and chiller
    equipment in hospitals, universities and colleges and commercial buildings through
    a platform named “GOFlex” [141]. There are many examples of ENBALA applied demand
    side solutions [142]. One of the most remarkable examples is the enrolment of
    the McMaster University Campus in Ontario in DR aggregation activities through
    GOFlex. GOFlex manipulates the temperature settings and therefore, the power usage
    of five chillers with a 16,000 t cooling capacity within the HVAC system of the
    McMaster University Campus. Through a communication panel employed in the end-user
    premises, the Building Management System (BMS) of the campus receives real-time
    requests and signals from ENBALA GOFlex platform and accordingly adjusts the aggregated
    settings of the chillers in order to reduce consumption in critical periods without
    a noticeable deviation from the normal comfort conditions. Many other LSEs across
    Canada offer classical DR programs. Toronto Hydro Corporation as a LSE and Rodan
    Energy Company as a DRP are such examples [143]. 4.1.3. Other North America countries
    Another part of North America that demonstrates demand side participation actions
    is Mexico, especially with the potential smart grid investments (such as Smart
    Metering project [144]) in Mexico City directed by Comisión Federal de Electricidad
    (CFE) of Mexico. Thus, more implementations in terms of DR solutions can be expected
    from this North American country in the near future. 4.2. South America 4.2.1.
    Brazil As the leading country in South America in terms of demand side solutions,
    Brazil is considered to have a good potential in this area. Brazil has demonstrated
    better progress in terms of energy efficiency improvement efforts; however, there
    is also some progress in DR applications that can serve as a basis for more advanced
    implementations. First of all, apart from the energy efficiency solutions, there
    are other pilot applications concerning the improvement of smart metering infrastructure
    in the service regions of different LSEs. For the implementation of DR solutions,
    AES Eletropaulo Company, which is the major LSE in terms of consumption and revenues
    in Latin America, has launched a smart grid pilot implementation plan aiming at
    implementing DR solutions for different end-user types, especially during critical
    peak periods in order to improve the loading factor of distribution system assets
    [145]. Furthermore, the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) has discussed
    changes in the tariff schemes to motivate price-based DR programs in Brazil [146].
    Thus, Brazil could be considered as a good candidate for wider penetration of
    DR activities in the future within the Latin America region [147]. 4.2.2. Other
    South America countries Apart from Brazil, there are some applications at an initial
    stage in Colombia and Chile regarding demand side applications and with additional
    regulations these markets also seem promising grounds for DR solutions [148].
    4.3. Europe The North American DR market is a leader in what regards the development
    and deployment of DR programs. Nevertheless, Europe holds the second place and
    the EU countries have recently demonstrated interest in occupying a wider portion
    of the DR market in the future. 4.3.1. United Kingdom According to an interview
    published in the Reuters [149], “Longer term, UK''s aggressive renewable energy
    goals, fairly large size, and deregulated market structure make it one of the
    best potential regions for DR”, which clearly indicates the potential of the UK
    taking a leading role across Europe in DR applications. KiWi Power Company offers
    a Demand Reduction Strategy (DRS) that presents similarities to existing programs
    in the U.S., aiming to temporarily reduce the consumption of certain end-user
    systems such as HVAC, lighting, etc. through the installation of a remotely controlled
    equipment in peak energy demand periods. KiWi Power offers different control systems
    for different end-user types in order to provide reductions when necessary. For
    example, airport chillers and air handling units (AHUs) in areas such as baggage
    halls and concourse areas are offered to be turned off while generators serving
    runway lights or communal retail areas can be also utilized during DR events.
    Besides, in the case of supermarkets, temporary reductions in the lighting level
    of retail areas or turning off refrigeration plant compressors in freezers are
    candidate strategies. Different solutions are also presented for hospitals, steel
    manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics, etc. [150]. The UK Power Networks
    Company has developed programs to enable the demand side participation in the
    UK. In the “Low Carbon London” project, the UK Power Networks Company works with
    Flexitricity, EDF Energy and EnerNOC companies as aggregator partners to enrol
    industrial and commercial participants for a DR trial in London aiming at inducing
    load reductions at the MW level during estimated high demand periods. Moreover,
    in the “Smarter Network Storage” project, storage systems in the MW/MWh level
    installed in the distribution system will play an active role in residential or
    commercial DR. Storage units will compensate the deficiency in production during
    peak periods in order to cover the demand, while they will absorb excess energy
    when renewable power plants provide high generation (in sunny or windy days) or
    in times in which the demand is low. The Smarter Network Storage units are planned
    to be integrated in the National Grid''s ancillary services market for providing
    Frequency Response and Short-Term Operating Reserve [151]. There are also different
    demonstration trials of DR solutions in the UK, which are expected to play an
    important role in the DR market both in Europe and globally in the future. 4.3.2.
    Belgium Belgium is a country which has also practically involved DR solutions
    in the daily electricity market operations. ELIA, as Belgian electricity TSO,
    accepts DR capacity to compensate mismatches between production and peak power
    demand [152], in which industrial customers are given vital importance as also
    supported by the Federation of Belgian Industrial Energy Consumers (FEBELIEC)
    [153]. DR aggregator companies, such as REstore [154] and Energy Pool [155], provide
    the required capacities to ELIA under stress conditions, to which hundreds of
    MWs have already been contracted in order to add flexibility to ELIA''s operation
    in the Belgian power system. 4.3.3. Other European countries Many other countries
    in the EU are also progressing towards implementing DR actions into their electric
    power system structures. Apart from the UK and Belgium, France, Finland and Norway,
    Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany have also improved their progress in the development
    of DR activities. A recent report on DR in Europe discusses the status of DR in
    such countries thoroughly and thus readers are addressed to [156] for further
    information. 4.4. Oceania 4.4.1. Australia In Australia many efforts take place
    in terms of developing different DR schemes. The LSEs have announced many short-term
    targets regarding the application of DR strategies. Following the announcement
    of new obligations for LSEs to publish “Demand Side Engagement Strategies”, enabling
    the participation of demand side resources in the market by the Australian Energy
    Market Commission (AEMC) in 2012 [157], the number of DR strategies offered by
    several LSEs has significantly increased. These strategies are firstly implemented
    in pilot projects. Several successful strategies are already applied in a larger
    scale while many are still in a trial phase. The Ausgrid Company regularly announces
    the possible DR strategies and the relevant pilot [158]. One of these possible
    DR strategies under trial is “Dynamic Peak Rebate Trial” for non-residential medium
    to large scale customers, which is basically similar to many different existing
    DR programs around the world, incentivizing customers to reduce their consumption
    during peak periods, approximately 20–30 h during the summer (from December to
    February for Australia). In the first trial in the summer of 2013, 5 demand reduction
    events were requested from February to March 2013 resulting in an average reduction
    of 2500 kV A [159]. A similar test was also conducted in the same period by AusNet
    Services Company for commercial and industrial customers in order to acquire insights
    into the effectiveness of different DR strategies, through which the company also
    aims to evaluate and then potentially actualize strategies such as embedded generation,
    mobile generation, energy storage, tariff and incentive-based DR strategies [160],
    [161]. The Demand Side Engagement Strategy Report of a joint program by CitiPower
    Company and Powercor Company considering different DR options was also announced
    in [162]. Among the currently applied strategies, Endeavour Energy presented the
    “Energy Savers Program” for large consumers in Arndell Park and Rooty Hill areas.
    Even more noticeable are the “CoolSaver”, “PeakSaver” and “PoolSaver” DR programs
    for residential end-users. The “CoolSaver” program is based on mounting the AC
    of the residential end-user with a remotely controllable device that will automatically
    adjust its power during summer periods for a maximum of 6 days, between 2 p.m.
    and 7 p.m., when there is a critical grid power peak due to very high temperatures.
    The enrolled customer is promised not to feel discomfort but is not paid per event
    neither per reduction. On the contrary, the customer is paid a flat 60$/year and
    also 100$ worth free AC service as a Sign-Up bonus for the program. “PeakSaver”
    is a DR program in which Endeavour Energy pre-notifies enrolled end-users via
    SMS, e-mail or recorded voice messages for demand reduction events during the
    Australian summer period and by reducing energy consumption through actions such
    as turning off unnecessary lights and appliances and postponing cloth or dish
    washing during the event. This program rewards the end-user with 1.50$/kWh of
    saved energy with respect to the customer''s baseline. Finally, the “PoolSaver”
    program requests from the end-users to allow the company to install a new circuit
    to the power supply of the customer pool pump, which allows it to work in a pre-determined
    mode during specific off-peak hours. There is no payment for energy curtailment
    but the company argues that operating the pool pump in off-peak hours will save
    more than 40% of the pool pump energy consumption cost. Apart from this, the enrolled
    customers are rewarded with a gift card [163]. Energex Company offers a program
    named “PeakSmart AC” to end-users who are willing to replace their old ACs with
    new PeakSmart capable ACs which are remotely controllable via a signal receiver.
    The implementation of the new PeakSmart program enrols ACs and determines the
    rewards according to their cooling capacity. Customers possessing ACs with a cooling
    capacity of less than 4 kW receive 150$, between 4 and 10 kW receive 250$, while
    for more than 10 kW the payment reaches 500$. Furthermore, households and businesses
    can get separate rewards for up to 5 AC unit replacements. The PeakSmart ACs are
    controlled by the LSE in case of critical summer demand during high temperature
    days (a few days per year) by slightly changing the AC setting without affecting
    the end-user comfort significantly. There are also two programs named “Pool Rewards”
    and “Hot Water Rewards”, for end-users that are willing to enrol their pool pumps
    and hot water systems, respectively, to a specific tariff. Furthermore, Energex
    offers rewards for business centers willing to install BMS or to increase the
    efficiency of specific systems [164]. SA Power Networks deploys pilot projects
    on direct AC load control for residential areas (involving around 1,000 volunteering
    households) by switching off AC compressors but not their fans, in order to maintain
    comfort levels [165]. Pre-notification based residential DR programs are also
    employed by the United Energy Distribution Company for 4,500 households in Melbourne
    for a maximum of 4 events per summer and a reward of up to 25$ per 3-h event [166].
    Western Power Company has also performed trials on direct AC load control, named
    as “Air Conditioned Trial (ACT)” through the Perth Solar City Program of Australian
    Government, in which ACT AC compressors were cycled via wireless communication
    while AC fans continued running to maintain a sufficient end-user comfort level
    [167]. Several smaller scale implementations of different DR strategies which
    are not mentioned here have also taken place in Australia. Relevant information
    and annual reports by LSEs in Australia can be found in the official website of
    the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) [168]. 4.4.2. Other Oceanian countries Among
    other countries in the continent, only New Zealand shows a rather remarkable progress
    regarding DR programs. Transpower Company runs a program for commercial buildings
    (office buildings, hospitals, data centers, etc.) with standby generators which
    are requested to be operated in order to reduce the power drawn from the grid
    in critical peak periods. Besides, Transpower is currently launching new DR programs
    for the Agricultural sector [169]. EnerNOC, through the “DemandSMART” program,
    enrols interruptible commercial and industrial end-user loads into the Instantaneous
    Reserves (IR) market. The program limits are 30 min per event for a maximum of
    6 events per year in the North Island, while 2 events per year are allowed in
    the South Island. The targeted loads include refrigeration compressors and fans
    in cold storage/food facilities, pumps with storage and aerators in water treatment
    facilities, refiners, chippers and fans in pulp, paper, boar and wood processing
    facilities, electric furnaces and smelters in manufacturing facilities, and finally
    HVAC systems in data centers and large buildings [170]. There are also different
    solutions presented by LSEs, DRPs and technological companies in New Zealand [171].
    4.5. Asia Asian countries do not generally have an active DR market. However,
    several pilot projects are in preparation or evaluation phase, especially in the
    Asia-Pacific region. 4.5.1. Singapore Singapore is one of the leading countries
    in Asia in terms of DR applications. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) of Singapore
    has already introduced DR programs to enhance the competition in the National
    Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS), in which consumers can participate directly
    or through retailers or DR aggregators. All customers that can offer at least
    0.1 MW of reduction for half an hour can participate. The consumers participating
    in the program share one-third of the savings obtained by the reduction in electricity
    prices as incentive payments, up to 4,500$/MWh that is the cap of wholesale electrical
    prices. The enrolled consumers can provide temporarily the required reduction
    by switching off non-critical equipment, reducing HVAC or pumping system power
    or even using on-site back-up generators for short periods [172]. The Diamond
    Energy Company has been the pioneering actor in DR applications in the Singaporean
    market, having applied load interruption programs to confront abnormal events
    such as unexpected peak demand or forced outages of power generation [173]. The
    CPvT Energy Company is also a retailer registered with EMA and participates in
    the load interruption program [174]. There are also other market participants
    in the DR market of Singapore, which is currently the most promising for future
    developments amongst the Asian countries. 4.5.2. Japan, South Korea and China
    Japan, South Korea and China are also countries that are expected to develop DR
    programs in order to induce more active demand side participation in the future.
    Kyocera, IBM Japan and Tokyu Community have started an Automatic DR Management
    System pilot project in Japan. In the mentioned project the automatic DR system
    is planned to send a power-saving request (DR signal) to consumers under system
    stress conditions, or even to control the end-user EMSs if necessary [175]. Comverge,
    OpenADR Alliance and Fujitsu have also initiated pilot DR projects [176], [177],
    which aim at developing a considerable DR sector in Japan that has suffered from
    intense energy requirements during high emergency conditions, especially after
    the Fukushima nuclear incident. OpenADR (Open Automated DR) Alliance, being a
    non-profit corporation created to foster the development, adoption and compliance
    of the OpenADR smart grid standard, has also taken significant steps towards developing
    DR applications in South Korea in collaboration with local authorities and associations
    [177]. In China, a collaborative pilot project between the Natural Resources Defence
    Council, Shanghai Electric Power, NARI Group, the State Grid Corporation of China
    and Honeywell as an international partner started in Shanghai in 2014 and is the
    first official DR demonstration project in China. The mentioned pilot project
    has contracted 33 commercial and public buildings, 31 steel, chemical and automotive
    industrial premises, which present an aggregated capacity of 100 MW available
    to be curtailed with a considerable payment per unit of curtailed load. The project
    is in place, demonstrating the economic and technical sides of DR strategies for
    different consumer types [178]. 4.5.3. Other Asian countries Some other DR activities
    also take place in the wider Asian continent, being mostly in the pilot stage.
    CLP Power Company in Hong Kong announced an Automatic DR pilot project in which
    existing BMS facilities in commercial and industrial premises will be integrated
    with the Automatic DR concept that will also enable CLP to curtail some loads
    directly during emergency conditions [179]. Noticeably, a small country in the
    Far East Asia, Bangladesh, currently employs demand side actions mostly by advertisements
    rather than incentive-based programs. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)
    that is the major regulatory entity in Bangladesh power system has established
    motivational advertisement based programs to enhance the awareness of the end-users.
    BDBP has started campaigns through electronic and print mass media to request
    end-users to be more rational and economical in electricity use during peak hours;
    for example, by switching off unnecessary loads at residential end-user premises
    or by shifting irrigation load to off-peak hours. It was estimated that with the
    aid of the campaign around 400 MW of irrigation load was shifted to off-peak hours
    in the last years. Besides, industries operating with two shifts are requested
    to interrupt their operation during peak hours. An interesting piece of evidence
    from BDBP is that it monitors the closing time of shops and obliges them to close
    at 8 p.m., an action that contributes to load shifting from peak to off-peak hours
    by 350 MW and reduces the load shedding necessity [180]. There are also some early-stage
    studies on DR implementations in some other countries such as India, which could
    be developed in the future, depending on the policies of the regional governments.
    At this point, it should be noted that no remarkable DR activity has been noticed
    in the Middle-East and thus no information exists about countries in this region.
    4.6. Africa The African continent is hosting different nations that present significant
    differences in life quality among the population. A very small portion of the
    population has relatively high income, while many others do not even have access
    to electricity. Thus, DR programs in Africa are limited; yet, there are some remarkable
    examples. Eskom Company in South Africa offers different DR programs especially
    to its large customers. The “Standby Generator Program” requests the enrolled
    customers to supply all their load demand by own on-site generators (minimum 1,000
    kW) up to 2 h during any requested day and for up to 100 events per year. The
    control of the generator is not in the responsibility of Eskom. Eskom pre-notifies
    (from 3 p.m. of the previous day to 30 min prior to an event) for the DR event
    period and the end-user is not enabled to use grid power in the mentioned period.
    The end-user is paid a rate for the self-generated power based on the curtailed
    grid power. Another program offered by Eskom is “Supplemental DR Compensation
    Program” for industrial and commercial customers which can reduce their consumption
    by 500 kW or 10% of the average MW of their load demand (whichever is greater)
    during pre-specified critical periods announced by Eskom. The limits are 1–2 h
    reductions on a scheduled day for up to 150 events per year with a pre-notification
    from 3 p.m. of the previous day to 30 min prior the event with a payment for each
    kWh of energy curtailed by the customer [181]. Eskom also started pilot projects
    for residential load management based DR programs. More than 10,000 geyser relays
    have been installed in residential end-user premises to shed appliances remotely
    during a critical peak power period with a credit based compensation for the customer
    [182]. There are also many consulting and technical companies in South Africa
    supporting DR implementations and improvements regionally (e.g. Enerweb Company
    [183]). The DR market is growing in Africa with new pilot studies across the continent,
    especially in the most developed countries. A more complete analysis of the DR
    status in Africa can be found in [184]. 5. Barriers to the development of DR The
    potential benefits of DR and the intensive research recently have been the drivers
    for initiating and developing DR programs around the world. However, one may notice
    considerably asymmetric progress in enabling the active participation of demand
    in the power system procedures between different regions. This situation is related
    to a series of challenges and barriers that limit the active participation of
    demand in electricity markets. In this section the challenges towards the adoption
    of DR, as well as the barriers that are present in different regions are critically
    compiled and discussed. The challenges and barriers are classified in six distinct,
    yet intersecting, categories. 5.1. Barriers associated with the regulatory framework
    The first obstacle towards the integration of DR resources in the electricity
    markets structures is the absence of rules that implicitly consider their participation
    in the provision of different services, or the presence of rules that limit their
    potential. Power system service definitions or security of supply standards refer
    to the way that an ISO, a reliability organization or a balancing authority define
    the services that are required in order to maintain the secure operation of the
    power system. These technical definitions directly define which resources are
    eligible to provide a given service. These definitions may explicitly exclude
    or effectively limit the participation of demand side resources in ancillary services
    markets. In the U.S. the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)
    has provided definitions that are functionally based and technology neutral in
    order to include DR participation. However, several regional reliability organizations
    in the U.S. such as the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) do not
    currently allow the provision of reserves from DR resources [185]. Furthermore,
    ISO New England does not allow DR resources to participate in the regulation markets
    [186]. It is to be noted that although most regional reliability council definitions
    comply with NERC''s standard, there are several issues that could be viewed as
    important challenges yet to be overcome, such as issues of fair treatment of DR
    in comparison with generation when it comes to the qualification of capabilities
    in resource adequacy planning such as in MISO [187]. Despite the fact that in
    the U.S. these issues have been long recognized and are being addressed, the situation
    in Europe is different. The EU policies have generally been more focused on energy
    efficiency and DSM, rather than DR. Evidently, until recently, EU was more interested
    in climate change actions, promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy growth
    and did not perceive DR as a key solution to address its environmental objectives
    [188]. With the Third Energy Package and especially with the Energy Efficiency
    Directive (EED) the European Commission has demonstrated strong interest in DR.
    The main driver seems to be the fact that DR may play an effective role in supporting
    higher penetration levels of the intermittent renewable generation [189] and therefore
    has the potential of becoming a catalyst in achieving the EU''s 2030 and 2050
    energy policy and decarbonisation targets [190]. Article 15.4 of the EED explicitly
    states that DR participation in balancing and reserve markets and ancillary services
    procurement should be promoted, while Article 15.8 states that national energy
    regulatory authorities should encourage DR resources to participate alongside
    supply in wholesale and retail markets and guarantee that DR is treated in a non-discriminatory
    manner, on the basis of its technical capabilities [96]. Although the phrasing
    of the EED could be viewed as progressive and direct, the implementation of DR
    across Europe is not homogenous. This is due to two reasons: firstly, the directives
    of the EU have to be adjusted to national level, considering the particularities
    and the constraints of each system, that is a task that will definitely need time,
    and secondly, the EU does not have an adequate system in place to monitor the
    market [188]. Currently, fewer than 5 out of the EU 27 Member States have created
    regulatory and contractual structures that support DR. France and the UK are the
    only countries with developed DR programs, while Finland, Belgium, Austria, Ireland
    and Germany are undergoing fundamental regulatory reviews; however, they are still
    in the formative stage of this process. The rest of the Member States follow national
    regulations that prohibit consumer participation in balancing, reserve and energy
    markets, as opposed to the countenance of the EED. The Third Energy Package has
    also set common rules for the organization of the energy markets in Europe in
    order to facilitate the completion of the Internal Energy Market [191]. In this
    context, the absence of homogenous DR products in different European countries
    could potentially constitute a barrier for DR. For example, capacity mechanisms
    are considered an attractive market opportunity for DR resources and countries
    such as France, Italy and the UK are currently developing their own national implementations
    [192]. Different motivations and priorities could raise conflicts and confusion
    in contrast with the harmonization targets at European level [193] and as a result
    the development of DR could be hindered. 5.2. Barriers associated with the market
    entry criteria Historically, the qualifications regarding the entrance of new
    market participants into various types of markets (energy, reserve and ancillary
    services markets) have been developed considering that the sole resources of the
    system are large centralized generators, which present similar operational characteristics.
    As a result, the relevant rules are not in position to reflect the diverse technical
    and qualitative characteristics of other resources such as DR and as a result
    the market structures cannot integrate such resources without a revision of the
    existing market entrance criteria. The following issues associated with the requirements
    that a resource should satisfy in order to participate into several markets, if
    not addressed, may constitute a direct practical barrier to the development of
    DR: • Minimum resource bid size. • Possibility of aggregation of multiple small
    consumers and geographic boundaries of aggregation. • Bid direction. • Number
    of call events (e.g. on a weekly, yearly basis). • Load recovery period. • Response
    time. • Duration of response. • Fixed trading charges, membership and entrance
    fees. Traditional generators have relatively large capacities (tenths of MWs)
    and as a result the minimum resource bids that have been set in order to participate
    in several market structures are high in comparison with the individual consumption
    of the majority of the loads, explicitly disqualifying DR to participate in these
    markets. This barrier has been recognized by many ISOs and efforts have been made
    in order to relax this prerequisite. For example, the ERCOT and PJM have set the
    minimum bid size to 0.1 MW, while the requirement in MISO is 1 MW [186]. In contrast
    with the U.S. markets, in Europe this issue is yet to be addressed. Several countries
    have decreased the minimum size that qualifies the participation of a resource
    in a variety of services. Finland provides a good example of a DR friendly country.
    The minimum bid size in order to participate in normal operation reserve program
    is 0.1 MW while in order to participate in the frequency controlled disturbance
    program the minimum bid size is 1 MW. Similarly, in Italy the resource must render
    available at least 1 MW in order to be eligible. In the Netherlands and in the
    UK the minimum allowed resource capacity is 4 MW (regulation, reserves) and 3
    MW (short-term operating reserve-STOR), respectively. In order to evaluate whether
    the minimum resource capacity size constitutes a barrier, the characteristics
    of the system loads should be taken into account. For example, in the Canary and
    Baleares Islands the minimum required reduction potential is 0.8 MW; however,
    the fact that an insular power system structure differs from the mainland grids
    should be taken into account during the evaluation. In contrast with these relatively
    positive developments in some countries, in Denmark and Norway, participation
    in tertiary reserves requires a capacity of at least 10 MW since the instructions
    are manual (the participants are notified by telephone). One could argue that
    this barrier will not be radically addressed in the near future as regards the
    majority of European countries since the entry criteria have been only recently
    revised [156]. Another important factor to consider together with the high minimum
    capacity requirements is whether the market rules allow the aggregation of multiple
    small consumers and to what geographical extent the aggregations are possible.
    In several markets, aggregation is not legal (e.g. ERCOT, MISO, Austria, Spain)
    or it is legal but not practically feasible due to other legislation issues (e.g.
    in Denmark). Furthermore, restricting the geographical extent of the aggregation
    can further bound the capability of aggregators to participate in markets because
    of not meeting the minimum capacity requirements. The combination of high capacity
    requirements and the unavailability of aggregation options exclude residential,
    commercial and small industrial consumers and limit the DR provision option only
    to large industrial consumers, such as in Denmark and the UK [194], [195]. Several
    market structures require that the bids are symmetric. This means that resources
    should provide equal capacity to change in both directions that in the case of
    DR would mean that the loads should be equally able to decrease and increase their
    consumption. This is a requirement that directly restricts the pool of eligible
    DR resources since only a few types of load would be equally flexible in both
    directions. Examples of markets that require symmetric regulation capacity offers
    are MISO, PJM while in Denmark, for this reason DR is not allowed to participate
    in secondary reserves. In Switzerland tertiary control allows asymmetric bids,
    while secondary reserves require symmetric capacity. The German market allows
    asymmetric bids but consumers cannot practically participate in reserves because
    negative deviations (load increase) bear significant penalties. Other service
    attributes such as the number of call events, time between two calls, response
    time and duration of response can potentially hinder the deployment of DR resources.
    The primary aim of demand is not to provide flexibility to the power system but
    to serve the specific needs of the end-user. Furthermore, the existing emergency
    DR programs strictly limit the number and the duration of DR calls per year since
    the deployment of such resources entails interruption of service for the consumers.
    In order not to demotivate the consumer participation, utilities have been conservative
    with the utilization of DR calls. For example, in 2007, California ISO (CAISO)
    has issued DR calls spanning less than 1% of the year, while only in less than
    60% of the highest load periods DR calls were issued. Most markets require the
    resource to maintain its response from 4 to 12 h (e.g. Austria and Germany, respectively)
    during a call. There are also examples of markets that require permanent availability
    of regulating resources such as the Swiss market, which is a barrier for most
    consumers to provide DR except for the case of a few large industrial consumers.
    Nevertheless, it is generally reported that reserves are not typically required
    for more than 1–2 h. This is aligned with the requirement of STOR service in the
    UK in which a call must have duration of 2 h. However, even in this case commercial
    consumers are practically excluded [193]. The majority of existing market structures
    allows the participation of these resources either through direct bidding or through
    bilateral contracts in the day-ahead market. This fact implies that the planning
    of the use of such resources should be performed hours ahead of the real-time
    operation of the system. As a result, the use of such resources is limited to
    emergency situations that can be predicted by the ISO the day before the actual
    operation of the power system, while several calls for DR prove to be unnecessary
    in the real-time. Day-ahead market decisions are connected with high uncertainty
    and ineffective scheduling of DR calls impairs the forecast error as regards the
    generation and load response in comparison with dispatch decisions that are made
    closer to real-time. This situation reduces the competitiveness of demand side
    resources in comparison with flexible generation resources (such as open cycle
    gas turbines - OCGT plants) that have the ability of fast start-up and ramping,
    despite the fact that several load types are capable of adjusting their demand
    instantaneously, and therefore limits their value for the ISO. Furthermore, the
    need for advanced notification for DR calls hampers the participation of demand
    side resources in contingency reserve markets that require short-term response,
    typically between 10 and 30 min, an interval which is shorter than the minimum
    notification time for DR. ERCOT is one of the few examples of markets that allow
    the efficient participation of load in reserves [196], together with the recently
    revised market rules in Norway that require activation of reserves in 15 min.
    Finally, the entrance fees for aggregators or DR providers are generally considered
    to be reasonable, and thus they do not constitute a direct barrier. For example,
    in Finland the aggregators have to pay €200 per month to the TSO, while they have
    to guarantee a bank deposit in order to reduce the risk of bankruptcy [156]. In
    order to effectively revise these rules, the ISOs should firstly realize a fundamental
    difference between the impacts of large centralized generation and highly dispersed
    DR resources on the reliability of the power system, in case that the resource
    fails to respond to an instruction. Currently, the ISOs require stringent monitoring
    of the response of both generation side and demand side resources. However, as
    it was demonstrated in [197], this last requirement may not be necessary for the
    case of DR since the aggregation of small-scale consumers (e.g. residential) statistically
    presents a more reliable response in comparison with a large generator. Furthermore,
    according to [198] several DR resources may have faster response than generators,
    be more resilient to rapid changes in consumption than generators are to changes
    in production (cycling) and do not suffer from increased losses such as generators
    when operating partially loaded. Given these favourable capabilities of DR, not
    revising the existing market entry criteria in order to reflect the diverse technical
    capabilities of loads constitutes a severe underutilization of available system
    resources. 5.3. Barriers associated with market roles and interaction implications
    Competition in electricity markets has been promoted in the past decades. Unbundling
    within electricity markets refers to the separation of electricity generation,
    transmission, distribution and retail sales that have been vertically integrated
    structures. The rationale behind unbundling is the promotion of competition by
    guaranteeing access to the power system for all participants on a non-discriminatory
    basis. Unbundling can be realized in terms of accounting, legislatory framework
    and ownership rights [199]. The liberalized environment has enabled several entities
    in electricity markets that have different roles, responsibilities and objectives.
    This situation may impose barriers towards the uptake of DR, especially because
    of the contrasting views and the absence of an aligned position as regards the
    use of flexibility between TSOs and DSOs. The majority of DR resources are connected
    in the distribution system and as a result the collaboration between TSOs and
    DSOs is important in order to exploit DR. However, issues regarding the purpose
    of DR deployment may complicate the development of DR programs. For instance,
    TSOs would view the flexibility provided by DR as a means of balancing the system,
    while DSOs would use it in order to mitigate local congestions. This implies that
    coordination between these entities should be developed in order to design different
    DR products that would transparently and legally allow the utilization of DR in
    the system and market operations [190]. Another important issue is that despite
    the unbundling process, in many regions TSOs and DSOs are still regulated entities,
    responsible for the technical management of the system and as such, the only entities
    permitted to intervene in investment decisions, excluding the participation of
    private initiatives. However, the investments of a TSO/DSO are limited by the
    allowed remuneration that in general limits the expenses on R&D, having a negative
    effect on the development of new technologies, especially in Europe [200]. The
    effective business/market scheme under which the demand side would participate
    in electricity markets is yet debatable and remains in the forefront of the barriers
    to the uptake of DR. Three main business models can be identified: direct contracts
    with the TSO, aggregation of small consumptions and real time response of demand
    to market prices. There are several challenges associated with each of these demand
    participation options. First, the direct contracts with the TSO allow only the
    participation of a few capable large industrial consumers that are able to meet
    the market entry qualifications as it was previously discussed. Second, aggregating
    demand may compromise the fundamental benefits of dynamic pricing tariff schemes,
    such as RTP, which is the pricing of the end-user with the market price. The reason
    for this is that an aggregator has to bid in the market and fulfil its obligations
    through its portfolio. In order to achieve its targets, this kind of entity could
    alter the prices in order to reflect not the market prices but the requirements
    of the market as regards the behaviour of the aggregator [201]. Given that aggregation
    is an option that would allow the participation of smaller consumers (residential,
    commercial) in the market, unclear definition of the role and the responsibilities
    of an aggregator constitutes a barrier to be addressed. Besides, aggregation of
    consumers is currently illegal or practically infeasible in several markets. Third,
    the response of demand to real-time market prices [202] raises concerns regarding
    the demand and price volatility. This is the result of the asymmetry of information,
    i.e. the time span between the communication of the price and the response of
    the load and as a result the ISO should perform a prediction. Generally, flexible
    consumers tend not to contribute to the mitigation of volatility since they can
    achieve their economic targets, in contrast with relatively inflexible consumers
    that would have incentive to inform the ISO about their intended consumption pattern.
    To deal with this issue, appropriate control regulations should be developed in
    order to define the interaction between demand and the market in order to reduce
    the volatility of demand and price; however, this would deteriorate the economic
    efficiency [203]. Finally, it is important to highlight several implications that
    emerge due to the individual objectives of the different market participants as
    regards the integration of DR resources into the market [18]. The TSOs and the
    DSOs will utilize this flexibility in order to facilitate the satisfaction of
    operational constraints at critical moments. A competitive retailer will use DR
    in order to reduce the risk of being exposed to high prices in the spot market
    [204]. On the other hand, commercial aggregators will focus on maximizing their
    profits, thus expressing their preference to a specific market, a fact that is
    likely to prohibit the participation of DR resources in other markets such as
    in France. The absence of a coordinative framework could provoke competitiveness
    over the utilization of DR. For example, the behaviour of responsive consumers
    may benefit also consumers that are not flexible by inducing lower electricity
    rates, implying transfer of wealth from the generation side to the demand side
    [113]. It is evident that within the liberalized market context, each individual
    entity would more likely aim at utilizing the flexibility of DR for its own benefit
    that is not necessarily aligned with the maximization of the social benefit (improved
    reliability, economic efficiency, no comfort loss for consumers etc.). The diverse
    and conflicting views for DR are the source of a series of further challenges
    such as difficulties in perceiving DR as a crucial system resource, justifying
    and allocating the required investment costs, and finally engaging consumers.
    These issues are covered in the following sub-sections. 5.4. Barriers associated
    with DR as a system resource There is also a category of barriers that is related
    to the effects of the widespread integration of DR resources in the electricity
    markets and power systems. These challenges may be compelling since generator
    shareholders would oppose to the introduction of such resources and the ISOs would
    perceive DR as a complicating factor for the system operation rather than a beneficial
    addition to the system. The most promising application of DR is the balancing
    of the fluctuations that come from the high penetration levels of intermittent
    renewable generation. The response characteristics and the availability of several
    DR resources qualify them for such utilization. However, significant response
    of the load would probably limit the capacity factors of peaking and intermediate
    generators that are currently responsible for regulation, load following and ramping.
    This situation would be favourable for the economic efficiency of the system since
    the services from these units are expensive and base units operate more efficiently
    at constant output. However, the revenues of these generators would significantly
    decrease and therefore it would be harder for their owners to recover their investments,
    leading to a potential decommissioning of such power plants. This outcome would
    not be viewed positively by the ISO since several ancillary services (e.g. voltage
    support, system restoration) cannot be provided by loads [196]. Furthermore, these
    units would be required in order to meet unsatisfied fluctuations that DR fails
    to mitigate. The drop in reserve market clearing prices is another potential outcome
    that would not be viewed positively by the existing stakeholders. Some types of
    DR have little or no opportunity cost to provide certain types of reserves. Thus,
    the entry of a large amount of low cost resources would potentially cause a decrease
    in the clearing price of these services that are an important source of income
    for flexible generators in several regions [205]. From the point of view of the
    ISOs there are three major concerns regarding the introduction of DR in their
    operational practice. The first is the justification of DR as a valuable system
    addition in comparison with other technologies. Strbac [18] argues that the value
    of DR lies both in system operation and system development. The key towards assessing
    the value of DR is the operational status of the system. In a system that is stressed,
    i.e. the system''s loading is close to its maximum capacity, the value of DR could
    be high. Another factor that determines the value of the addition of DR resources
    is the flexibility of the existing generation mix. It is more likely that DR will
    have greater value in systems with significant penetration of non-dispatchable
    renewable generation and relatively inflexible base load generation. Furthermore,
    even in such cases the DR based solutions are not always competitive in comparison
    with traditional approaches such as the OCGT units that are technically proven
    and significantly flexible generation side resources. The economic compensation
    of DR participation in the energy market is the second issue to be addressed by
    the ISOs. This discussion is controversial in most markets around the world [196].
    One argument is that DR providers should be compensated at the full market price,
    similarly to the generators, since the two services are identical, which is the
    case in ISO New England (ISO-NE) and NYISO. However, the decision not to purchase
    energy is not the same as physically supplying energy. The loads participating
    in wholesale markets would receive dual benefits, being paid at the market price
    for their service and achieving retail bill savings because of the reduced consumption.
    In order to promote a more efficient DR compensation from the point of view of
    the ISO, in MISO and PJM the DR is compensated at the full market price minus
    the retail rate [187]. On the other hand, DR providers argue that DR creates positive
    externalities such as economic and environmental benefits, and thus they should
    be granted payments higher than the market prices. The CAISO [206] identifies
    the problem of the compensation of DR as one of the main barriers as well. Insufficient
    compensation of DR may limit its investment recovery capability and thus demotivate
    its development, while excessive subsides may jeopardize the economic stability
    of the market. The third challenge for the ISOs is the lack of suitable and transparent
    tools in order to evaluate, measure and verify the demand reductions [15]. The
    European Network of TSOs for Electricity (ENTSO-E) recognizes that inefficient
    data handling in European electricity markets is a hindrance that may limit the
    growth of DR [190]. Currently, stakeholders have limited access to data that prevents
    them from fulfilling their role, while rendering difficult the coordination and
    the verification of the realization of DR. Furthermore, the existing forecasting
    and planning methodologies are not adequate to investigate the capability of DR
    to serve as an alternative to conventional system expansion approaches [207].
    The absence of standard methodologies to study the cost-effectiveness of DR hinders
    the decisions to perform investments. There are also two problems in identifying
    the size of DR resources. First, it is difficult to evaluate the number of customers
    that are willing to be involved in a DR program and therefore its potential capacity
    [208]. Second, there is not a standard way to determine the customer consumption
    baselines in order to accurately depict the normal consumption of a customer.
    A flawed methodology bears the risk of consumers gaming with their baselines in
    order to get paid without providing real load reductions and would render the
    deployment of DR resources economically unreliable [187]. 5.5. Barriers associated
    with infrastructure and relevant investment costs The key technologies for the
    implementation of DR have already been developed. However, the current levels
    of penetration of control, metering and communication technologies in the power
    systems should be increased in order to enable widespread DR activities [18].
    A range of DR activities may require a small number of limited duration interruptions
    and could be performed manually (e.g. light dimming, equipment shut down, etc.).
    Nevertheless, participation of demand in ancillary services would require more
    frequent and much shorter interruptions. Control and automation technologies must
    be adopted by the consumers to provide such services, especially regulation. This
    implies that consumers, with the potential of being subsided by a utility, would
    have to uptake such investments that bear operating and maintenance costs. Furthermore,
    metering equipment that allows real-time data transmission should be placed in
    order to comply with service verification requirements and this constitutes another
    significant economic burden since telemetry equipment has costs that tend to increase
    with the required speed of response [185]. Stakeholders in MISO [187] and CAISO
    [206] have raised concerns regarding the costs, especially to install equipment
    in order to comply with the telemetry requirements of the available DR programs
    that have been characterized as unreasonable. For example, Alcoa, a metal industry
    that participates as a DR resource in MISO region has reported a total cost for
    the telemetry infrastructure, the EMS, the bidding interface and the database
    system of $750,000. It is evident that such costs are bearable only for large
    industrial consumers, explicitly excluding smaller resources from the participation
    in DR activities. Similarly, the commercial sector perceives the capital costs
    of manual and automatic DR as prohibitive in order to participate in DR programs
    [209]. Finally, the increased cost of residential EMSs is a barrier to the development
    of residential DR [35], while the limited savings from consuming energy in low
    price periods would not meet the investment costs. Currently, automated residential
    DR is viable only for longer term home owners who have the income to support such
    an investment, unlike low income social groups and tenants living in rented residences
    [210]. 5.6. Barriers associated with electricity end-users When it comes to DR
    the greatest challenge is related to the successful engagement of customers in
    DR programs. Despite the fact that in the U.S. DR has been developing for more
    than a decade, only 23% of customers were enrolled in available DR programs in
    2012 [211]. Evidently, lack of customer interest and support is a definite factor
    limiting the development of DR [212]. There is a series of reasons for which the
    engagement of consumers is an impediment towards the evolution of DR programs.
    The first challenge is that unlike the generation side, the electricity consumers
    do not necessarily follow an economically rational behaviour and, therefore, their
    response cannot be predicted using conventional economic models. The majority
    of electricity consumers view energy as a good rather than a commodity and as
    a result minimizing their electricity bill by responding to price signals or raising
    revenue by participating in other types of DR programs may not be their primary
    concern. O’Connell et al. [6] have compiled the main results of studies regarding
    residential customers enrolled in TOU and RTP programs that demonstrate evidence
    for the lack of economic rationality and the need to develop more advanced economic
    models in order to predict the response of the consumers considering factors such
    as the effect of weather on consumption and the asymmetry between information
    and response. There are also several limitations as regards the non-residential
    customers. The basic challenge for this sector is that loss of comfort because
    of consumption limiting or interruption may negatively affect their primary intentions.
    For example, according to a field test in the U.K., hotels are likely to provide
    a considerable short-term response through managing the AC unit load; however,
    the duration of this response is limited by the thermal comfort of hotel guests.
    Also, shopping centers theoretically present comparable DR potential, but perceive
    the loss of comfort linked with DR as a negative factor for the commercial gain
    [193]. Another factor that renders commercial customers reluctant to enrol in
    DR programs is the relatively short warning period that does not allow for efficient
    decision making to take place [209]. Finally, in many regions, especially in Europe,
    the majority of end-users are accustomed with a uniform price of electricity and
    therefore the awareness about the volatile cost of electricity is limited. As
    a result, exposing them to dynamic electricity prices raises concerns about the
    value of postponing the usage of electricity in contrast with the immediate satisfaction
    of their needs as a result of consuming electricity [204]. The second challenge
    is related to the contract design. Different consumers should be offered appropriate
    contracts, tailored to their consumption profiles. Without appropriate and transparent
    information, consumers could be confused with too many unclear offers, complex
    contract handling and the multiple parties involved. The consumer acceptance could
    be raised in the presence of a single billing scheme in which the retail supplier,
    network charges and DR payments are all included in the same bill [190]. As a
    result, absence of tools and mechanisms such as price comparison tools and standardization
    of contract design may pose difficulties to the end-users deliberately choosing
    the most suitable contract for them [213]. Issues regarding the deployment of
    smart meters and consumer protection relate further the end-users to the challenges
    that need to be overcome in order to facilitate the development of DR programs.
    Currently there exists a broad legal framework on privacy and data security at
    the EU and international level regarding data processing for billing purposes.
    However, DR is not specifically covered by this legal framework, since it would
    require a significant increase in processing frequency and data granularity. The
    EU is currently promoting the active deployment of smart meters because of the
    perception that it constitutes the core element towards transparency, yet fixed
    tariff and several varying pricing schemes such as TOU pricing do not require
    two-way communication [204]. Overall, the low physical security of the meters
    and control equipment, the prospect of using the internet for communication and
    services and the increased number of intervening parties should be covered by
    clear privacy laws. The absence of a common framework fosters an instable regulatory
    environment for investors and confines consumers’ acceptance [191]. 6. Conclusions
    The current advancements in metering, communication and control infrastructure
    allows for the development of DR programs targeting at different types of customers
    through appropriate incentives. Engaging consumers in order to shift or forego
    energy during periods of system stress can prove beneficial in many aspects. Mostly,
    DR is likely to prove an important resource in order to enhance the flexibility
    of power systems in order to accommodate increasing amounts of intermittent renewable
    generation. The thorough review of existing DR programs around the world demonstrated
    a highly asymmetrical development between different regions. The U.S. is evidently
    leading in the adoption of DR, offering diverse programs in order to exploit the
    response from various types of consumers. Europe and Oceania are also taking important
    steps towards engaging demand side resources in the system practices. It is interesting
    to notice that despite the lack of homogeneity, efforts to develop DR programs
    are pursued globally, clearly indicating that utilities are starting to perceive
    DR as a useful resource rather than a complicating factor. Given that the required
    infrastructure to implement DR programs targeting at any customer type is nowadays
    available, in order to further promote the activation of the demand side a series
    of barriers, mainly regulatory and economic, are yet to be addressed. Acknowledgement

    future of communication that has transformed Things (Objects) of the real world
    into smarter devices. The functional aspect of IoT is to unite every object of
    the world in such a manner that humans have the ability to control them via Internet.
    Furthermore, these objects also provide regular as well as timely updates on their
    current status to its end user. Although IoT concepts were proposed a couple of
    years ago, it may not be incorrect to quote that this term has become a benchmark
    for establishing communication among objects. In context to the present standings
    of IoT, identification of the most prominent applications in the field of IoT
    have been highlighted and a comprehensive review has been done specifically in
    the field of Precision Agriculture. This article evaluates contributions made
    by various researchers and academicians over the past few years. Furthermore,
    existing challenges faced while performing agricultural activities have been highlighted
    along with future research directions to equip novel researchers of this domain
    to assess the current standings of IoT and to further improve upon them with more

    of the term Internet has been constantly expanding its wings in every aspect of
    life. It has become a challenging task for researchers to clearly identify the
    optimal potential of Internet usage. With the passage of time, the term of Internet
    has been associated with things and is now being identified as IoT. As the name
    depicts, things are associated thorough Internet via Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification (RFID), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN),
    Bluetooth, Near-field communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE) and various
    other smart communication technologies. Hence, IoT can be defined as “things that
    are associated over the Internet.” This association helps in transfer of information
    gathered from various devices to destined places over the Internet. Since IoT
    is the most reliable term of the technological world in today’s date, it still
    lacks through the potential compliance that it is actually capable of. In such
    a complex scenario, this article aims to assist to all those who want an easy
    and through an approach to understand the concept and further wishes to contribute
    towards its channelization to serve in the best optimal manner. This article depicts
    research articles related to the field of Precision Agriculture research using
    IoT, with maximum number of citations, in order to extract the most valuable content
    and distinct researches over the years. The most relevant among them have been
    addressed and discussed by length in this research article. This article has been
    prorated in a total of five sections. Section 1 of the article is the introductory
    phase which sheds light on IoT, along with the reason for the motivation of going

    This survey article highlights the key findings from previous surveys and presents
    a fresh methodical literature review that evaluates and discovers the possible
    potentials on the basis of available research in the field of IoT. 1.4. Research
    methodology and classification method The objective of this survey article is
    to correctly identify the current standings of IoT in Precision Agriculture. Research
    has been done thoroughly by examining the existing literature work done in the
    context. To give a firm foundation to the review article, the study depicts the
    origin of IoT, along with current standings, trends and technologies as well.
    The foundations of IoT had been accessed in an order to identify and to stay as
    close to the objective. Furthermore, the objective was to clearly identify how
    the concept came into existence with respect to agriculture domain and what is
    its current standings. The last objective of conducting an extensive research
    was to correctly identify the future directions for IoT by adding concerns of
    current enthusiasts in the field of IoT in agriculture. This comprehensive reference
    acts as a benchmark that assists in understanding the basics of the domain in
    a crystal clear manner and leads new age researchers in further excelling in this
    domain. Hence to attain the objective, a thorough comprehensive review of all
    the identified literature has been done. The framework for the existing study
    is based on reviewing manuscripts from various conferences, journals, and edited
    volumes. Vital literature was identified and extracted by querying scholarly databases
    by searching keywords like “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Precision Agriculture”,
    and “Smart Agriculture.” 58 papers out of a total database of 272 papers were
    shortlisted after thorough reading. Each paper was discussed, analyzed, and classified
    to a specific domain category. The literature was distributed among both the authors
    on the basis of interest. Fig. 2 depicts the selection procedure for extraction

    It is clearly visible that, since the day term “Internet of Things” came into
    existence, the search volume for the same has been consistently increasing in
    contrast to its miniature term, “IoT”. However, there has been a mixed response
    for the terms, “Precision Agriculture” and “Smart Agriculture”. As per Google’s
    search forecast, this trend for both is likely to continue for another couple
    of years and would be scaling newer heights, as more and more devices are being
    connected over the Internet on daily basis. 2. Internet of Things (IoT): an overview
    During mid 80’s the communication was either limited to voice over telephone lines
    or letters. With, passage of time, the term Internet came into being and communication
    got a new platform. The possibility of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) was
    also achieved over the years. Today’s era has left the concept of Internet far
    behind and has come up with the concept of IoT. IoT is a technique that combines
    existing resources to the Internet for obtaining control over the devices. The
    introductory concept of IoT was proposed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    (MIT) Auto-ID Labs in the early 1990s. However, Trojan Room coffee pot was the
    first IoT application; that was developed in 1999 (Jia et al., 2012). Later during
    the same year, world’s first Internet controlled device, a toaster that could
    be remotely turned on and off over the Internet was developed (Welbourne et al.,
    2009, Zhang et al., 2012). Over the years, there have been several definitions
    derived by various organizations working on IoT domain, across the world. Each
    organization has termed the definition of IoT in context to its functional advancement
    obtained over the years. ITU-T has termed IoT as, “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interpolatable information and communication
    technologies” (Elkhodr et al., 2013). Although IoT is all about a synchronization
    of Things (Objects) over the Internet. It is the intervention of humans that makes
    this concept a possibility. Fig. 5 depicts the Tri-sectional relationship among
    the three aspects of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (66KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 5. Tri-sectional relationship among the three aspects
    of IoT. With the passage of time and constant advancements in the field of Internet,
    many refined terms for Internet came into existence. The first phase was the Pre-Internet
    phase, where communication was possible over a fixed telephone line and via Short
    Message Service (SMS). Later the communication medium was upgraded with mobile
    telephony devices. The second phase was of Internet of Content phase. This phase
    was capable of sending large sized messages, i.e., an e-mail that was capable
    of associating attachments, information, entertainment, etc. were the basic possibilities
    of this phase. The third phase was of Internet of Services, that focused on electronic
    applications like e-productivity, e-commerce, etc. The fourth phase, i.e., Internet
    of People was the phase were people got associated with each other through social
    media and numerous other mediums like Facebook, Orkut, Skype, Youtube, etc. The
    ongoing era is of IoT. The functional aspect that has the capability of connecting
    devices over the Internet. Hence these devices can communicate among each another
    and perform a number of activities as directed/programmed according to design
    and functional capabilities of various objects. However, the existing era might
    not be considered to be as the end of the road for the concept. Researchers are
    trying to incorporate the concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) upon these
    interconnected devices so that they can take necessary decisions and act upon
    without intervention of humans. It may not be incorrect to term the upcoming phase
    as Internet of Things powered by Artificial Intelligence (IoTAI). Transformation

    of Internet from Pre-Internet to IoT. 2.1. Evolution of Internet to IoT Internet
    has undoubtedly become a benchmark in terms of communication. This terminology
    in today’s date has taken control over billions of devices by incorporating sensor(s)
    based on their functional capabilities. These devices when connected via sensor(s)
    over the Internet, generate enormous data that is further processed for decision
    making. During the last few years, there has been a steep inclination towards
    adaptation of new age communication technologies. To date, the world is deployed
    with around 5 billion smart devices. It has been predicted that over 50 billion
    devices will be connected over the Internet by the year 2020 (Mainetti et al.,
    2011). It has been estimated that the incremental value of IoT would surpass $300
    billion by the end of the decade. This boosts vision for the development of newer
    communication technologies and finding out new modes of getting synchronization
    of newer devices to sensors over the Internet. However, it may be incorrect to
    directly evaluate the functional capabilities of IoT, before understanding time
    to time changes and advancements in the field of IoT. Fig. 7 depicts a constant
    increase of devices being associated over the Internet during the last few years.

    and Zikmund, 2015). Since research on IoT is an area of interest for both academic
    and industrial sector, the outcomes depict the urge for constantly finding new
    methodologies for associating various devices over the Internet with help of additional
    sensors. This concept is now being looked upon as a roadmap for development in
    many of the areas of concern towards society, e.g., Smart Mobility, Smart Grid,
    Smart Homes and Buildings, Public Safety and Environment Monitoring, Medical and
    Health care, Industrial Processing, Agriculture and Breeding, Independent Living
    are few of them. Fig. 8 depicts the constant increase of devices being associated

    chart with respect to peak inflated expectations; that had initiated through an
    innovation trigger and has reached the maximum level of expectation, where the
    dependency rate and increased expectations persuade researches for newer developments.

    Working of RFID. These tags are embedded with electronically stored information
    which can be read by RFID reader when the object came in the proximity of the
    reader (Dominikus et al., 2010). RFID allows monitoring objects in real-time,
    without the need of being in line-of-sight. From a physical point of view, RFID
    tag or a label is a tiny microchip combined with an antenna as a compact package.
    The tag antenna picks up signals from an RFID reader and then returns the signal,
    usually with some additional informative data. An RFID tag comes in three configurations.
    The first one is the Passive Reader Active Tag (PRAT) in which the reader is passive
    and receives the signal from the battery operated active tags, whereas the second
    one is the Active Reader Passive Tag (ARPT), which is most commonly used for communication
    purposes (Lapide, 2004). This tag does not have onboard power supplies, hence
    it harvests the energy required to send data from the query signal sent by the
    RFID reader. The last one is an Active Reader Active Tag (ARAT). An Electronic
    Product Code (EPC) is the most common set of data stored in a tag. EPC’s are coded
    on RFID tags because of which objects can be tracked and identified uniquely.
    RFID is categorized in 4 different segments as depicted in Table 2. Table 2. RFID
    categories. RFID type RFID operating frequency Low frequency 125–134 kHz High
    frequency 13.56 MHz Ultra high frequency 860–960 MHz Super high frequency 2.45 GHz
    2.3.2. IEEE 802.15.4 It is a standard which specifies the physical layer and media
    access control for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs). The original
    version of IEEE 802.15.4 supported 826 and 915 MHz frequency bands, while the
    working model supports 2.4 GHz ISM band. The basic framework conceives a 10 m
    communications range with a transfer rate of 250 kbit/s (Jiang, 2015). 2.3.3.
    Zensys Wave (Z-Wave) Z-Wave is a low-power wireless communication protocol for
    Home Automation Networks (HAN). It is used widely in the remote control applications
    for smart homes, as well as small-size commercial domains. In Europe, it operates
    at 868.42 MHz, whereas in Canada and the USA it uses 908.42 MHz bandwidth for
    communication. The distance between two nodes should not be exceeding 30 m. 2.3.4.
    Long Term Evolution (LTE) LTE is a standard wireless communication protocol for
    high-speed data transfer between mobile phones based on Global System for Mobile
    Communication (GSM) network technologies. It supports up to a maximum of 100 MHz.
    Data upload and download often encounter lower latency rate and higher throughout
    (YangDacheng, 2010). 2.3.5. LongRange (LoRa) LoRa is a digital wireless data communication
    technology, developed by Cycleo of Grenoble, France, and acquired by Semtech back
    in 2012. It is mainly used in long-range connectivity for various IoT devices
    used in rural, remote as well as in offshore industries. Apart from the above,
    LoRa is also used in various applications like supply chain management, transcontinental
    logistics, mining, natural resource management, etc. (Centenaro et al., 2016).
    2.3.6. Near-field communication (NFC) NFC is quite similar to RFID. It is overlooked
    as an integration of RFID reader onto on a mobile phone. NFC is also be seen as
    a unique kind of a radio communication device that is enabled on mobile devices
    either by tracing inbuilt options that need to be activated or by the two devices
    close in the proximity (Bravo et al., 2007). From a technical point of view, NFC
    operates within a licensed radio frequency band of 13.56 MHz. The typical operating
    range of NFC device is 20 cm precisely. The operating range directly depends upon
    the size of the antenna within the device. NFC is a short range, low power wireless
    link evolved from RFID that can transfer small amounts of data between two devices
    held in proximity. Unlike Bluetooth, no paring is required before the actual transfer
    of data. NFC enables communication between two smart objects, that is safe, as
    this cannot be done from a remote location (He et al., 2015). NFC technology significantly
    contributes to the future development of IoT. It provides all the necessary attributes
    required for creating a wireless connection to smart objects. Furthermore, NFC
    also has the potential to transform the mobile headsets into different types of
    smart objects. 2.3.7. Ultra-wide band (UWB) UWB communication technology is designed
    to support communications within low range coverage areas, that is similar to
    NFC that uses low energy. However, high bandwidth is used for applications to
    connect sensors for communication. It is capable of a maximum of 500 MHz bandwidth.
    It was earlier known as radio pulse. 2.3.8. Machine to Machine (M2M) M2M refers
    to the communications either between computers, embedded processors, smart sensors,
    actuators or with mobile devices. Usage of M2M communication has been increasing
    at a fast pace during the last recent years (Wu et al., 2011). For instance, researchers
    predicted that, by the year 2020, there will be 2.5 billion wireless connected
    devices (excluding mobile phones). There are a total of five basic components
    of M2M communication technique: sensing, heterogeneous access, information processing,
    applications, and services (Severi et al., 2014). M2M is a five-part structure
    that constitutes of following parts: • M2M Device: A device capable of replying
    to request data contained within that device. • M2M Area Network (Device Domain):
    Provide connectivity between M2M Devices and M2M Gateways. • M2M Gateway: Use
    M2M capabilities to ensure M2M Devices inter-working and interconnection to the
    communication network. • M2M Communication Networks (Network Domain): Communications
    between the M2M Gateway(s) and M2M application. • M2M Applications: Contains the
    middleware layer where data goes through various application services and is used
    by the specific business-processing engines. 2.3.9. IPv6 Low-power Wireless Personal
    Area Network (6LoWPAN) A key IP is based on technology is 6LowPAN. This network
    protocol defines encapsulation and header compression mechanisms. The standard
    has the freedom of frequency band and physical layer and can also be used across
    multiple communications platforms, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.15.4 and
    sub 1 GHz ISM. This concept is specially designed for home or for building automation
    systems where it provides a basic transport mechanism to control complex control
    systems and to communicate with devices in a cost-effective manner via a low-power
    wireless network infrastructure. Difference among various communication techniques
    of IoT on basis of standard, year of discovery, downlink/uplink of data, Table
    3 depicts various comparative table for various communication technologies. Table

    potential for social, environmental and economic impact towards its adaptation.
    IoT concepts have been adopted in a variety of domains ranging from Mobility,
    Smart Grid, Smart Homes/Buildings, Public Safety and Environment Monitoring, Medical
    and Healthcare, Industrial Processing, Agriculture and Breeding and Independent
    Living are some of them. All these applications are associated to us in one way
    or another. Usage of these applications and vivid benefits have an important role
    and now there is a huge dependency on their existence. They have indeed become
    an integral part of our lives. During the recent years, their existence and usability
    has attained visionary scale and have become of paramount importance. It may not
    be incorrect to state that the future of Internet is purely based on the concept
    and vision of IoT, which drives us into the future practically. Various application
    areas of IoT have been depicted in Fig. 12. Download : Download high-res image

    study, research work has only been carried out on basis of functional aspects
    in Agricultural domain based on prominent work done by various researchers and
    academicians over the past few years. 3.1. Agriculture and breeding Precision
    Agriculture is an approach to farm management that uses Information Technology
    (IT) to ensure that the crops and soil receive exactly what they need for optimum
    health and productivity. The goal of Precision Agriculture is to ensure profitability,
    sustainability, and protection of the environment. Precision Agriculture is also
    known as Satellite Farming and Site-Specific Crop Management. Apart from the above
    said, there have been enormous changes in the techniques and methodologies of
    performing agricultural activities. The new age farmer has now moved from traditional
    farming to modernized concepts. Researchers working under this domain have come
    up with theories and practices that incorporate smart devices in order to evaluate
    the parameters that contribute towards the growth of plants and according to the
    observations, the agricultural activities are performed. Some of the major contributions
    under this domain are as follows: Zhao et al. (2010) projected the benefits of
    performing agricultural activities within a greenhouse technology. Furthermore,
    the process of automating the zone by incorporating the concepts of IoT technology.
    The authors highlighted incorporating of control through information networks
    within the test bed. Hence, a framework that combined both Remote Monitoring System
    (RMS) with Internet and Wireless Communications was proposed. The framework resulted
    in good growth and health of plants cultivated in greenhouse, which was easy to
    operate as compared to open fields (Zhao et al., 2010). Bo and Wang (2011) proposed
    the usage of Cloud Computing techniques and its significant importance for IoT.
    The study proposed collaboration of two techniques in order to analyze the feasibility
    and future prospect of combination among both techniques. The experimentations
    carried out proved that a combination of these two technologies could successfully
    resolve problems and could eliminate development bottlenecks (Bo and Wang, 2011).
    Bandyopadhyay and Sen (2011) proposed a state-of-the-art framework that highlighted
    the key technological drivers of IoT. The study also visualized the help farmers
    could obtain from IoT applications for acquiring information for delivering of
    crops directly to customers within small region (Bandyopadhyay and Sen, 2011).
    Kaloxylos et al. (2012) in his study highlighted the importance of precision farming
    systems that played an important role in improving farming activities. A Farm
    Management System (FMS) has been proposed in the study (Kaloxylos et al., 2012).
    TongKe (2013) highlighted the issues concerning agriculture. The study depicted
    one solution to the problems encountered for agricultural modernization. The authors
    proposed usage of IoT concepts and cloud computing techniques for performing agricultural
    activities. SOA and RFID technologies were also incorporated in the study (TongKe,
    2013). Ojha et al. (2015) depicted the advent of WSN techniques that spurred a
    new direction of research in the field of farming domain. The study highlighted
    the potential WSN applications along with various challenges and issues associated
    in the deployment of WSN for improved farming. Various case studies have been
    that presents the existing standings in the field of agriculture and furthermore,
    solutions have been proposed with regard to various problems (Ojha et al., 2015).
    Bauer et al. (2016) in their study highlighted the scope of deployment of WSN
    for deriving vital crop information as it serves as a valuable indicator for yield-limiting
    processes. The study depicts the usage of Photosynthetically Active Radiation
    (PAR) sensors as it significantly enhances the potential performance of WSN technology
    for non-destructive in-situ Leaf Area Index (LAI) assessment (Bauer et al., 2016).
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016) in their study presented a low-cost sensor/actuator
    internetwork platform based on IoT that had integrated M2M and human-to-machine
    interface protocols. Although the experimentation was conducted within a greenhouse,
    the results of experimentation depicted that Internet technologies and Smart Object
    patterns could be combined to encourage development and further enhance Precision
    Agricultural activities (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Jayaraman et al. (2016)
    in their study emphasized on a collection of agricultural data through various
    IoT devices such as WSN, network-connected weather stations, cameras, and smartphones.
    Furthermore, the study proposed a SmartFarmNet, an IoT based platform that was
    capable of automating the process of data collection from various parameters related
    to agriculture e.g. environmental, soil, fertilization, irrigation, etc. The proposed
    framework was also capable of correlating the data and filtering out invalid data
    from the perspective of assessing crop performance and further computation crop
    forecasts (Jayaraman et al., 2016). Paustian and Theuvsen (2017) in their research
    article highlighted the importance of various techniques available in precision
    agriculture. The study also tends to gain insight into the relevant aspects of
    adoption of precision farming among various farmers in Germany on the basis of
    various characteristics and farmer demographics. The result of regression analysis
    depicts a positive influence on the adoption of precision farming among farmers.
    The results of the research article’s study provided manifold starting points
    for the further proliferation of precision agriculture in various directions (Paustian
    and Theuvsen, 2017). Balducci et al. (2018) aimed at managing heterogeneous data
    coming from various datasets by virtue of sensory values. The study also depicts
    how productive companies (large scale or small scale, public or private) are in
    a race of increasing profitability by virtue of costs reduction, discovering appropriate
    ways to exploit data that are continuously recorded and made available can be
    the right choice to achieve subjective goals. The study suggested usage of Neural
    network, Linear and Polynomial Regression Machine Learning models for decision-making
    and data handling (Balducci et al., 2018). Hamad et al. (2018) highlighted the
    role of usage of smartphones for accessing agricultural information on various
    parameters and its advantages in the field of agriculture. A total of 230 farmers
    across the region were interviewed and primary structured questionnaires were
    filled. The study highlighted that most of the farmers suggested usage of smartphones
    for acquiring data on current farm conditions and also relied on adopting newer
    agricultural techniques depicted on videos available in the field of Precision
    Agriculture (Hamad et al., 2018). Table 4 presents various Technique/Methodology

    among farmers and end consumers A wider spectrum of various challenges and techniques
    to overcome them was depicted in the study Non-availability of channel leads to
    an indirect connectivity among farmers and end users Kaloxylos et al. (2012) Farm

    Topics of interest related to research articles for existing study. 4. Open issues,
    challenges & future research directions 4.1. Open issues Irrespective of the rise
    that IoT has attained over the past few years, there are several conceptual and
    fundamental issues pertaining to its proper management and performance. 4.1.1.
    Availability Realization of IoT must be on the basis of existing hardware and
    software, so that they can provide anytime, anywhere access as well as services.
    IoT at times is misunderstood by many as a software application that is capable
    of providing services. The hardware part is equally important and is indirectly
    associated that functions with the help of various protocols such as 6LoWPAN,
    IPv6, CoAP, RPL, etc. The entire setup is often understood as a different unit.
    Hence an awareness of association among hardware and software by its end users
    can contribute towards channelizing the vision in a much more effective way. 4.1.2.
    Reliability The basic aim of having an enhanced reliability is to increase the
    success rate of IoT service, by virtue of its capability of delivering information.
    Hence a series of checks are required to be implemented over the hardware and
    the software part of the IoT framework. A shortcoming due to system failure or
    threats from intrusion always keeps the reliability of the framework as one of
    the major challenges in IoT. 4.1.3. Mobility Mobility is another challenge for
    smooth implementation of IoT as most of the applications are based on mobile interface.
    Since connectivity also plays a vital in the mobility of data. Hence, a failure
    in connectivity among non-stationary devices is often taken as an incapability
    on IoT for not being capable enough to transfer the data from origin to destination.
    4.1.4. Data confidentiality Another challenging issue in the field of IoT is securing
    the data on all parameters. With the usage of various communication devices, the
    data travels over the Internet medium from source to destination. Issues related
    to data breach are always persistent. Hence maximum emphasis is given securing
    the data on all parameters. 4.1.5. Management of Network and its resources As
    projected over the next few years, everything that physically exists will be connected
    over the Internet. Hence managing numerous devices over a variety of networks
    and maintaining its resources will be a challenging task. 4.1.6. Scalability It
    refers to the concept of adding newer devices over the existing infrastructure
    without affecting the services and functional capabilities of the existing framework.
    Hence, scalability always remains a challenging task to achieve with collective
    consensus. 4.1.7. Interoperability To handle a large number of heterogeneous devices
    it is indeed a difficult task. Moreover, issues are also faced at the time of
    establishing a synchronization among different platforms. Hence, interoperability
    often remains an issue with respect to IoT. 4.1.8. Security and privacy Since
    the concept of IoT is designed to transmit information over the Internet, data
    privacy always holds a special significance. A lot of research works goes in making
    the data transmission completely secured, however, shortcomings do occur at times
    (Alaba et al., 2017). 4.1.9. Software Defined Network (SDN) Over the years, the
    concept of SDN has been incorporated in many aspects on many of the aspects of
    life. It is an approach that allows network programmers to initialize, control,
    change and manage the work behavior dynamically via interfaces. These concepts
    work on simulation and or real-time basis. SDN function-ability is based on responses
    from Data Center Networks (DCNs) and available IoT environments (Qin et al., 2014).
    Although the network is effective, flexible, and efficient; there persist some
    associated threats and challenges that cannot be overlooked. 4.1.10. Virtualization
    There are a lot of concerns related to the creation of a virtual version in order
    to eliminate the ongoing concerns of modern day applications. Its development,
    proper deployment and adaptability to existing scenarios are one of the biggest
    issues faced by IoT (Nastic et al., 2014). 4.1.11. Standardization process Standards
    are incorporated so that they can support numerous range of applications. Even
    with the use of semantic ontologies, machine-readable codification does occur
    at times which initially results in differences and misinterpretation due to different
    scenarios encountered from time to time. Still, there is a need to develop standards
    for an appropriate usage of IoT in various applications (Bandyopadhyay and Sen,
    2011). 4.1.12. Working ability and performance Evaluation of functional capability
    and performance of IoT services are considered to be a big issue. Since performance
    is directly associated with the underlying technologies, it is very much mandatory
    to keep services updated from time to time so as to meet the requirements of the
    end users. Another factor is the evaluation of performance which is directly associated
    with the price and quality of underlying technology. However, the end user wants
    the best of performance with less of investment, the issue of evaluation of the
    performance of any IoT application remains an open issue. 4.1.13. Compatibility
    with fifth generation (5G) communication Even though when the high-speed communication
    system is facing a rapid transformation, major innovations always rebuked by some
    of the commonly faced issues by 5G communication technique for IoT based implementations.
    Some of the most commonly faced issues are enabling physical layer techniques
    of modulation, timely handling of multiple input multiple output and error control
    coding (Yilmaz et al., 2016). Although a lot of efforts have been carried out
    in the name of IoT. There are still a number of aspects on which IoT needs to
    Díaz et al. (2016). A constant increase of interest by various academic, industries
    and other related bodies associated directly or indirectly with the field of IoT
    keeps on adding expectations that often leads to enhancement of challenges without
    realizing the basic requirements and functional capabilities of IoT. All the issues
    may be related to existing pitfalls of IoT. Constant advancements have been incorporated
    from time to overcome the ongoing issues as an extended face of lessons learned
    in terms of development of IoT. 4.2. Challenges Most of the IoT applications within
    themselves allow identification of research and development challenges after outlining
    a roadmap for the future research activities in order to attain a reliable as
    well as practical solution. The road map has been formed on the basis of correct
    identification of research priorities based on evaluation on following identifiers:
    • Complete understanding of IoT Architecture. The biggest challenge in SOA is
    to become imperative for the providers and requesters to communicate meaningfully
    with each other irrespective of being heterogeneous nature. • Identification of
    correct technology for establishing the communication interface. Its main challenge
    is to map a unique identifier (globally unique or unique within a particular scope),
    to an entity so as to make it without ambiguity identifiable and retrievable.
    • Establishment of a robust communication interface Some of the biggest challenges
    faced while establishing a well-oriented communication among the object and interface
    are: – Proper deployment of devices on objects. – Constraint free communication
    environment. – Cost. – Heterogeneity. – Communication modality. • Correct identification
    and implementation of network technology. Correct implementation of the vision
    in order to reach out to objects of the physical world so as to bring them onto
    the Internet. • Ability to identify and pair to a correct network. Overcoming
    the existing network dynamically so as to change the continuous evolving of things,
    so that they can feature varying degrees of autonomy. • Correct identification
    of data received and further signal processing There is an enormous data generation
    when objects are synchronized over the Internet with the help of communication
    devices. Hence following concerns are of paramount priority: – Semantic interoperability.
    – Correct service discovery. – Service composition. – Data sharing and collaboration.
    – Correct identification of autonomous agents. • Standardization Standards are
    to be designed so that they support a wide range of applications and address common
    requirements of all the possible applications that are inter-related to IoT. Since
    IoT mainly evolves around synchronization of devices over the Internet, constant
    advancements from time to time in every domain indirectly invites some associated
    issues along with updates, which can neither be ignored nor can be overlooked
    (Wu et al., 2010). Based on the roadmap of identification of correct technologies
    (Khan et al., 2012, Gan et al., 2011), most basic encountered challenges are described
    as follows: • Uninterrupted network connectivity. • Acquisition of complete informational
    service. • Uninterrupted operational service. • Security related issues. • Proper
    management of on-going services. • Correct identification of services. • Standardization.
    • Inter-portability. • Information Privacy. • Physical safety of objects. • Data
    confidentiality. • Data encryption. • Dedicated spectrum. On the basis of the
    most commonly encountered issues, some of the most prominent challenges have been
    identified specifically in the field of precision agriculture. They are as under:
    • Sensor placement is at physical locations. • Need to be cautious while performing
    agricultural activities. • Lack of awareness among farmers. 4.3. Future research
    directions The concept of IoT has come a long way, over the past few years. Resources
    available under the hood of IoT have fallen short and the existing scenarios further
    initiate to a number of queries that in one way or another, needs to be addressed
    before scaling newer dimension. Keeping in view of ever-increasing spectrum of
    IoT, some future related queries have been presented that needs to be addressed
    before we find ourselves enclosed within a new horizon. • What would be the next
    big step to correctly identify and handle the huge range of devices that are being
    added over the Internet? • How will the next generation of information systems
    work in synchronization with IoT, specifically when the technology is not constant?
    • How will the newer concepts overcome the inherent complexity and data volume
    for providing a useful Decision Support Systems? • Which IoT business model will
    drive the next generation’s global business and commerce? • Will the objects (things)
    only rely upon only Internet services for communication, in near future? • What
    is the next big thing post IoT era? 5. Conclusion This research article brings
    forth a comprehensive literature survey on the concept of IoT specifically in
    the field of precision agriculture. Furthermore, the study represents a detailed
    literature review keeping IoT as the supporting backbone for the concerned application
    highlighting author’s viewpoint on issues faced, proposed methodology with various
    other informative details related to research articles under study. The following
    conclusions can be further drawn from the study: • IoT is contributing significantly
    in the area of modern agriculture. • It helps farmers to control their farms remotely
    and manage agricultural activities in a more effective way. • Since technology
    is not static, a newer dimension of IoT would be overtaken in near future. • Data
    generated by various sensors is of paramount importance and needs to be managed
    and evaluated with a high level of precision. • In the next few years, major agriculture
    sensors, actuators and devices would be connected over the Internet with the basic
    objective of interaction, controlling, and decision making. This will minimize
    human effort, save time, increase yield and profits. • Extensive research in the
    field of IoT and Precision Agriculture will take a gigantic leap for the betterment
    of mankind. Acknowledgment The authors would like to acknowledge Council of Scientific

    Get rights and content Abstract Within the research field of urban water demand
    management, understanding the link between environmental and water conservation
    attitudes and observed end use water consumption has been limited. Through a mixed
    method research design incorporating field-based smart metering technology and
    questionnaire surveys, this paper reveals the relationship between environmental
    and water conservation attitudes and a domestic water end use break down for 132
    detached households located in Gold Coast city, Australia. Using confirmatory
    factor analysis, attitudinal factors were developed and refined; households were
    then categorised based on these factors through cluster analysis technique. Results
    indicated that residents with very positive environmental and water conservation
    attitudes consumed significantly less water in total and across the behaviourally
    influenced end uses of shower, clothes washer, irrigation and tap, than those
    with moderately positive attitudinal concern. The paper concluded with implications
    for urban water demand management planning, policy and practice. Previous article

    An escalating demand on potable water resources resulting from increasing populations,
    droughts and unpredictable weather patterns due to climate change is commonplace
    in many parts of the world (Bates et al., 2008, Commonwealth of Australia, 2008b).
    As a result, the sustainable management of urban water has become imperative,
    particularly for countries prone to severe droughts such as Australia. Australia
    receives the lowest average annual rainfall of all inhabited continents and is
    experiencing strong population growth in urban areas (Birrell et al., 2005, Commonwealth
    of Australia, 2008a). In response a range of sustainable water management practices
    and principles have been introduced to ensure the secure supply of urban water.
    Notably, water demand management (WDM) initiatives are utilised to assist in shifting
    consumers towards sustainable water consumption behaviour. WDM is defined as the
    practical ‘development and implementation of strategies aimed at influencing demand’
    (Savenije and van der Zaag, 2002, p. 98). It is characterised by reducing average
    water consumption to ensure efficient and sustainable use of the resource (Tate,
    1993, Deverill, 2001, Brooks, 2002, Brooks, 2006). WDM measures are generally
    the most sustainable solutions across environmental, social and economic factors,
    in the range of options presented for water supply security (White et al., 2007).
    WDM measures focus on reducing end use consumption hence offsetting the need for
    additional water supply and wastewater treatment measures which are costly and
    can be environmentally and socially detrimental. Initiatives for WDM are focused
    on supplying tools, mechanisms and knowledge to enable residents to continually
    reduce their potable water consumption (through the reduced use of water-using
    devices or uptake of water efficient devices). The WDM approach relies heavily
    on consumers to understand how to reduce their water consumption and to apply
    this understanding to everyday activities to consume sustainably. Past research
    has determined that water consumption within households is dependent on numerous
    factors, which include: the number of people in the house, the age of residents,
    education levels of residents, lot size of properties, residents’ income, efficiency
    of water consuming devices (i.e. clothes washers, shower heads, tap fittings,
    dishwashers and toilets) and the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of consumers
    (Nieswaidomy and Molina, 1989, Renwick and Archibald, 1998, Mayer and DeOreo,
    1999, Renwick and Green, 2000, Inman and Jeffrey, 2006). The pricing of water
    was initially predicted to influence consumption but this belief has more recently
    been dispelled, with research demonstrating that in most cases residential water
    demand is largely price inelastic because of its low relative cost when compared
    to other life essentials (Worthington and Hoffman, 2008, Barrett, 2004). Barrett’s
    (2004) investigation of 30 residential water price demand studies revealed that
    most indicated price inelasticity, with evidence that only very large external
    users being more likely to be sensitive to price changes. Earlier end use studies
    have demonstrated that households with very high incomes consume more water externally
    while, the variation of internal water consumption remains similar and is not
    statistically significant between income levels (Mayer and DeOreo, 1999, Loh and
    Coghlan, 2003). External consumption is the end use detailed to be most effected
    by income and the cost of water (Mayer and DeOreo, 1999). Mayer and DeOreo (1999)
    have reported a positive relationship between larger lot sizes and higher outdoor
    water consumption in the USA while, Loh and Coghlan (2003) found that this was
    not the case in Australia. In fact there was no evidence of a relationship between
    irrigable area and external household usage present (Loh and Coghlan, 2003). Elements
    which were found to increase external water use in both studies were the ownership
    of automated irrigation systems and swimming pools (Mayer and DeOreo, 1999, Loh
    and Coghlan, 2003). In relation to WDM, the last group of factors (i.e. attitudes,
    beliefs and actual behaviours of consumers) are particularly relevant as water
    management initiatives often include pressure on residents to reduce household
    water consumption through undertaking more sustainable water consumption practices.
    Shifting residents towards sustainable water consumption practices thus requires
    the instilling of awareness, understanding and appreciation of the environment
    and water. Establishing a connection between attitudes and beliefs concerning
    water and the environment and their relationship on actual water consumption behaviour
    has been undertaken previously (Nancarrow et al., 1996, Hassell and Cary, 2007).
    However, empirical studies that quantify the nature of such a relationship are
    still largely lacking within the current body of knowledge. To fill this gap,
    the herein described research was aimed to empirically investigate how attitudes
    and beliefs influence urban end use water consumption behaviour. The objectives
    of this research include: •Developing measurable research propositions relating
    to attitudes and domestic end use water consumption behaviour; •Undertaking a
    field-based smart metering study and subsequent flow trace analysis process to
    disaggregate domestic water end uses for a statistically significant sample; •Exploration
    of the characteristics of consumers with respect to their attitudes towards the
    environment and water conservation; •Investigation on the relationship between
    a confirmed taxonomy of attitudinal constructs and end use water consumption;
    and, •Confirming the environmental and water conservation attitudes of residential
    households that significantly affect behaviourally influenced (i.e. lifestyle
    choice such as longer than required showers) end use water consumption levels.
    Meeting these objectives will enable water professionals to effectively target
    WDM education and awareness programs, thus yielding higher water savings for such
    initiatives. Ultimately, research outcomes could be subsequently integrated into
    national water planning and management strategies to enhance long term WDM practices.
    The paper presents the theoretical background relevant to understanding the attitudes
    and behaviours that affect domestic water consumption and conservation. Following
    this is a description of research propositions. The adopted research method is
    detailed along with data analysis and results. Key findings are discussed with
    the paper concluding by deliberating on managerial implications. 2. Theoretical
    background 2.1. Water consumption attitudes and behaviour Determining motives
    for saving water are key when designing educational urban water saving strategies;
    hence at the outset, an understanding of consumption and attitudes towards water
    is vital (Corral-Verdugo et al., 2003). It has been previously established that
    the attitudes and beliefs of consumers directly impact on water use behaviours
    which are closely linked to water demand (Hassell and Cary, 2007). To understand
    the embodiment of people’s attitudes and behaviour, and their association with
    water consumption, Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1980) theory of reasoned action was adopted
    as a point of departure. Ajzen and Fishbein’s theory conceptualises the linkages
    between beliefs, attitudes, perceived social norms and behaviours by building
    on the expectancy value theory through the incorporation of normative social influence
    on behavioural intention (Hassell and Cary, 2007). This theory was employed to
    assist in the establishment of a baseline model to undertake attitudinal analysis.
    Several earlier research studies adopted the same approach to investigate attitudes
    and their impact on water consumption behaviour. For example, Syme and Nancarrow
    (1992) and Po et al. (2005) have applied Ajzen and Fishbeins’ theory of reasoned
    action to explain the extent to which intended behaviour could predict actual
    consumer responses to water supply systems. When considering risks and other social
    elements, the model was particularly useful for predicting behaviour associated
    with the delivery of potable water (Hassell and Cary, 2007). To better understand
    and capture the above attitudinal concept, two main factors were identified as
    having an influence on water consumption from a review of earlier research, being:
    (1) Concern for Environment (CE); and (2) Water Conservation Awareness and Practice
    (WC). Following Nancarrow et al. (1996), these two primary attitudinal factors
    can be used to assess the ‘way in which people think about water’. Past research
    on the effect of such attitudinal factors on water consumption is examined in
    the following sections. 2.1.1. Concern for environment The link between general
    environmental beliefs and conservation behaviour has been detailed by DECC, 2007,
    Korfiatis et al., 2004 and Corral-Verdugo et al. (2003). Surveys undertaken by
    Korfiatis et al. (2004) determined that attitudes towards environmental issues
    were in fact reliable predictors of environmental behaviour. Corral-Verdugo et
    al. (2003), drawing on the instrument commonly used to measure general environmental
    beliefs, namely, the New Environment Paradigm-Human Exception Paradigm (NEP-HEP),
    exclusively investigated the relationship between general environmental beliefs
    and water conservation behaviour. In Sonora, Mexico, surveys were undertaken to
    establish environmental beliefs in general as well as environmental beliefs specific
    to the connection of water as a natural resource, along with demographic details
    with water consumption recorded and estimated through a diary approach (Corral-Verdugo
    et al., 2003). The results supported the hypothesis that general environmental
    beliefs significantly influence domestic water consumption behaviour when beliefs
    and behaviours are assessed at a corresponding level of specificity (Corral-Verdugo
    et al., 2003). More recently, Gilg and Barr (2006) carried out a study of 1265
    households in Devon, UK exploring the relationship between environmental attitudes
    and behaviours focussing on total urban water use as the primary interest. The
    research examined if there were substantive links between environmental actions
    and water saving behaviour to determine behavioural variations associated with
    environmental activist classification (Gilg and Barr, 2006). Results indicated
    that committed environmentalists and main stream environmentalists were most likely
    to engage in energy and water saving activities regularly. Recent longitudinal
    research by DECC (2007), assessing public attitudes to the environment including
    water related issues across Australia, has determined a growing concern for environmental
    and water issues with respondents identifying a willingness to undertake sustainable
    actions or behaviours. The review of prior research assisted in establishing a
    derived factor representing environmental concern consisting of eight indicators
    being: protection of natural environment for future generations; community responsibility
    for reducing water consumption; concern for environmental problems; joint responsibility
    of government and community to ensure water security; acknowledgement of water
    being a valuable resource; acknowledgement of one’s role in creating a sustainable
    water future; valuing recycling, composting and other environmentally sustainable
    activities; and acknowledgement of humans role as caretaker for environment. Details
    of these indicators along with their associated references are presented in Table
    1. These listed elements are refined and confirmed in the latter part of the paper
    to ensure they are appropriate measurable indicators of the derived environmental
    concern factor. Table 1. Measurement items for concern for environment factor.

    role as caretaker for environment Viewpoint on humans being responsible for sustaining
    the environment in its natural form. Corral-Verdugo et al. (2003); Syme et al.
    (2000). 2.1.2. Water conservation awareness and practice Water conservation awareness
    and practice involves understanding the efficiency, opportunities and impacts
    of certain water saving activities as well as the desire to continually reduce
    consumption (Nancarrow and Syme, 1989, CSIRO, 2002, Gilg and Barr, 2006, Heinrich,
    2007). Water conservation relating to concern for water as a scarce resource was
    investigated in a major study by Nancarrow et al. (1996), who determined from
    the investigation that the ways people think about water does not predict their
    water consumption, contradicting the findings from other studies in the field
    (Middlestadt et al., 2001, CSIRO, 2002). Nancarrow and colleagues reasoned that
    this outcome may be due to the adopted method of recording water consumption data
    at a household level through a diary approach, while survey data was collected
    as individual responses. Middlestadt et al. (2001) similarly explored the relationship
    of knowing or having the knowledge on how to conserve water and whether this translated
    into actual behaviour. The research determined that students who were taught and
    understood water conservative behaviours more regularly performed these behaviours.
    The CSIRO (2002) carried out an extensive study in Perth, utilising both diary
    and end use monitoring methods, to determine attitudes of consumers and water
    consumption with investigations indicating that attitudinal variables affect external
    or outdoor water consumption (CSIRO, 2002). Unfortunately, the link between attitudinal
    factors and indoor end use water consumption was not reported on. Hence, this
    study set out to examine the influence of attitudes on indoor and outdoor domestic
    water end use. Through an extensive review of literature, nine indicators were
    uncovered that serve to represent the derived water conservation awareness and
    practice factor, being: awareness of opportunities to save water in household;
    awareness of the water saving benefits of retrofitting to water efficient fixtures
    and appliances; water metre reading competency; monitoring of water use; awareness
    of the relationship between behaviour and water consumption; water saving knowhow;
    perception on efficiency of household water use practices/behaviours; seeking
    continuous savings in water consumption over the longer term; and regular water
    metre reading. These items are described succinctly in Table 2, and are assessed
    in the latter part of the paper to ensure they are appropriate measurable indicators
    of the derived water conservation and practice factor. Once confirmed, this, along
    with the environmental concern factor were subsequently utilised to determine
    the effect of attitudes on domestic end use water consumption. Table 2. Measurement

    Water end use monitoring Effective water monitoring techniques are essential for
    understanding domestic water consumption behaviour (Stewart et al., 2010). Many
    water authorities provide information on how to read a water metre to consumers
    with the belief that knowledge of water consumption will assist in conserving
    water. Determination of water consumption within a household, however, requires
    specific knowledge on how, where, when and who consumes water within them. Initially,
    determining such elements of consumption relied on the honesty and vigilance of
    residents through diary recording methods. Water consumption studies utilised
    a diary recording method to establish end water usage. The diary method involves
    a member of the household noting down every water consuming event i.e. a shower,
    toilet flush or tap use. The nominated recorder would also note who carried out
    the event and the event duration (CSIRO, 2002, Cordell et al., 2003). Issues such
    as the subjectivity of measurements, consistency of people to record all information
    and the influence on behaviour through recording methods led to the development
    of a less intrusive and more accurate measurement method in the form of smart
    metering (Cordell et al., 2003). The development of smart metering technology
    has eliminated the error of the older end use recording methods being, diary records,
    resulting in accurate records of end use water consumption within residential
    households (Giurco et al., 2008). The advent of smart water metering enabled water
    consumption to be monitored at an end use level, resulting in the identification
    of individual water use events, such as shower, toilet flushing, tap use or irrigation,
    through the use of appropriate software (Willis et al., 2009, Willis et al., 2011).
    Smart metering involves the application of a high resolution water metre and a
    data logger to obtain a continuous record of accurate water consumption data.
    This smart metering approach has been utilised in many water end use studies conducted
    worldwide. Details of the results of the more significant end use studies conducted
    throughout the world are presented in Table 3. Table 3. Results from completed
    domestic end use studies. Previous studies End use category USA (1999) Mayer &

    per household and end use break downs. Table 3 shows that in the Australia-Pacific
    region, the highest residential end uses are showers, clothes washing, irrigation,
    toilet and tap use (Loh and Coghlan, 2003, Roberts, 2005, Heinrich, 2007). These
    earlier studies established end use water consumption in their respective regions
    and undertook analysis exploring the differences in end use consumption due to
    the influence of socio-demographic variables. These studies, however, did not
    demonstrate or provide any statistical indication of the influence of the abovementioned
    attitudinal factors on various types of end use water consumption. Understanding
    water consumption at the end use level is critical due to the fact that overall
    domestic water consumption is made up of different water end use events. Broadly,
    water use can be categorised into two main areas: non-discretionary and discretionary
    end uses (Actcoss and Ccserac, 2003). Traditionally, non-discretionary water use
    is defined as the water used within the house to meet daily consumption and sanitation
    needs (e.g. shower, clothes washing); whereas discretionary end uses are additional
    non-essential water use activities (e.g. irrigation, pool use). However, lifestyle
    changes towards over consumption have shifted many essential water end uses to
    include a large discretionary component, where use can be well beyond what is
    required or considered publically acceptable for the activity. For example, showering
    is now often utilised as a leisure or relaxation activity rather than simply being
    used for sanitation needs. This behavioural shift epitomises the ‘Human Exception
    Paradigm’, a belief that humans are above nature and therefore do not have to
    regard the environment when they consume resources (Bechtel et al., 1999). Therefore,
    this research argues that discretionary water end uses should refer to those end
    use events that are likely to be dependent and influenced by the lifestyle and
    behaviour of an individual. While certain volumes of use are required for basic
    sanitation needs in shower, clothes washing and tap end uses, usage above and
    beyond a reasonable sanitation requirement is argued to be discretionary. The
    World Health Organisation (WHO) stipulates that basic long term sustainable water
    consumption for emergencies requires between 40 and 70 L per person per day (L/p/d)
    for personal drinking, sanitation and additional activities such as house cleaning,
    growing food and waste disposal (WHO, 2005). A detailed investigation into basic
    water requirements to meet human needs by Gleick (1996) also determined that 50
    L/p/d of clean water is a fundamental human right. While everyday living and consumption
    in a developed country cannot be based on WHO guidelines, these figures emphasise
    that modern households in developed nations consume far more than what is reasonably
    required for basic sanitation and consumption needs. Based on the core end use
    categories mentioned above, irrigation, shower, tap, and clothes washing could
    be considered uses that have a significant discretionary component, and toilet
    non-discretionary when considering this refined definition of discretionary end
    uses (i.e. toilets are a fixed consumption end use with limited behavioural influence).
    Leakage is not considered discretionary or non-discretionary as this use is neither
    a basic need nor is it influenced by behaviour. 2.3. Research propositions It
    is evident from the preceding sections that several investigations have established
    the importance of environmental and water conservation attitudes on consumption
    behaviour. Most demonstrate that positive attitudes and commitment towards the
    environment and water conservation result in undertaking sustainable water conservation
    behaviours which, in turn, results in lower water consumption. Hence, the following
    research proposition was developed: Proposition 1 Households with higher levels
    of environmental concern and positive attitudes towards water conservation will
    have significantly lower levels of total water consumption. In addition, since
    smart metering techniques allow for the accurate recording of water consumption
    in specific end use categories, the relationships between behavioural attitudes
    and various household end uses were further examined. Theoretically, because certain
    water consumption end uses tended to be highly influenced by attitudes and behaviour,
    additional propositions were formulated to provide specific understanding on the
    impact of attitudinal factors on end use water consumption behaviour: Proposition
    2a Households with higher levels of environmental concern and positive attitudes
    towards water conservation will have significantly lower levels of water consumption
    across behaviourally influenced end uses (i.e. there is a significant discretionary
    component to particular water end use such as showering, irrigation, etc.). Proposition
    2b There is no significant difference in the consumption of water end uses which
    have a lower behavioural influence (e.g. toilet flushing), between households
    that have different levels of environmental concern and attitude towards water
    conservation. These end uses generally have a fixed and/or low water consumption
    volume per event. The following section presents the research method undertaken
    to test the above detailed research propositions. 3. Research method The research
    forms a component of the Gold Coast Watersaver End Use (GCWSEU) study. This element
    of the study integrates and compares end use water consumption data and attitudinal
    questionnaire survey data to obtain an understanding of the influence of attitudes
    on actual water end use consumption. Two concurrent research activities were carried
    out being: (1) water end use data collection and analysis, utilising smart metering
    technologies and flow trace analysis software for event disaggregation, respectively;
    and (2) the development, application and statistical analysis of an attitudinal
    and demographic questionnaire survey. 3.1. Situational context Water security
    is of critical concern in the urbanised South East Queensland (SEQ) region of
    Australia. SEQ includes the populations in and between Brisbane, the Gold Coast,
    Sunshine Coast and Toowoomba, with the total current population of above 2.8 million
    people. In the Gold Coast (population half a million people), residential water
    consumption accounts for approximately 75% of the City’s total supply (2008/2009)
    compared with 57% in nearby Brisbane City (population 1.8 million people). These
    high residential water consumption percentages triggered a focus on residential
    water users to continually reduce consumption. Relative to the SEQ water supply
    situation, the water restriction level and awareness messages on water are constantly
    changing hence it is important to set the context during the data collection period.
    Leading up to the data collection period, the Gold Coast had been on Level 6 water
    restrictions which dictate a total outdoor watering ban and encourage residents
    to consume 140 L/p/d. Drought breaking rainfalls then occurred, which led to all
    water restriction levels being lifted before the data collection period. This
    relaxation of restrictions was due to the Hinze Dam, the Gold Coast’s primary
    water source, being at greater than 95% capacity. Leading up to and during the
    data collection period, frequent messages on saving water in the home, using 140
    L/p/d and rebates programs for installing water efficient devices such as the
    ‘Home Watersaver’ were in place. End use data was collected from the sampled single
    detached households in July 2008. There were no water restrictions in place during
    the data collection period. The month of July saw 129.8 mm of rainfall, with ten
    rainfall days above 1 mm recorded. Bulk supplied single detached residential consumption
    in the Gold Coast for July was 161.9 L/p/d. 3.2. Research sample Data collection
    was undertaken in four suburban regions within the Gold Coast City. These four
    regions were selected based on their apparent differences in socioeconomic classification.
    The dates of estate development of all the regions were similar thus ensuring
    the fixtures and fittings within homes were relatively comparable. In total, an
    initial end use study sample of 151 single detached residential households was
    obtained. The extensive research sample was obtained through a multi-staged process
    of letters and door knocking. Selection of participants was based on a number
    of criteria including: household ownership status (renting/owning) and household
    make up (i.e. number of householders, age of occupants, etc); willingness to be
    part of the research for a period of two years; acceptance of multiple water consumption
    monitoring periods and several surveys with potential interventions; as well as
    involvement in a household water appliance stock audit (Willis et al., 2009).
    Historical household volumetric readings for the consenting sample were also analysed
    to ensure that the recruited sample’s water use frequency distribution was representative
    of the region and City. As a final note, the useable sample for the purposes of
    this specific mixed method study was 132, due to the requirement for aligned questionnaire
    survey responses, as detailed in a later section. 3.3. End use smart metering
    approach Standard water metres in the Gold Coast study area were exchanged with
    Actaris CTS-5 high resolution water metres. These metres pulse at 72 counts/litre
    which accounts to a pulse read every 14 mL of water used. DataCell D-CZ21020 data
    loggers were attached to water metres to record end use water consumption data
    (Willis et al., 2010). Data loggers were set to record data points in ten (10)
    second intervals. Data were downloaded from data loggers manually with laptops
    via infrared cables. The data were then checked for validity with a two week timeframe
    selected for analysis. In home stock inventory surveys, water consumption behaviours
    and basic demographic descriptive statistic reports were undertaken to ascertain
    water devices and usage behaviours in households. The acquired end use data were
    analysed with the Trace Wizard™ software in order to disaggregate flow data into
    a repository of individual end use water consumption records for each home. Data
    analysis involves trained researchers conducting the end use analysis process
    of verifying signature traces for each water use activity occurring in the household,
    the stock and behavioural surveys aided this process. 3.4. Questionnaire development
    and survey In addition to monitoring water end use consumption, demographic and
    attitudinal surveys were developed and distributed to all the sampled households.
    The main purpose of the survey was to solicit respondent ratings for the two attitudinal
    constructs, namely CE and WC, and to obtain an understanding on the demographic
    characteristics of residential water consumers making up each household. Measurement
    items contained in the questionnaire evolved from the abovementioned literature
    review and factor operationalisation process (Table 1, Table 2). A five-point
    Likert-type measurement scale was adopted for the respondents’ rating of attitudinal
    items, with 1 representing strongly disagree and 5 representing strongly agree.
    Postal mail was the method for questionnaire distribution. It is important to
    note that only one questionnaire survey was completed per household. The head
    of each household was requested to convene a meeting with other residents, and
    consultatively respond to the questionnaire items, thus providing a response which
    was representative of the group. In cases where members could not attend or were
    young children, they were requested to provide a perceived rating which reflects
    their perception of the household’s overall attitude to the listed items. Data
    obtained from the survey together with the logged water metre data disaggregated
    into a repository of all end use events, were compiled into SPSS version 17.0
    for the purpose of statistical analysis, as presented in the following section.
    4. Data analysis and results 4.1. Descriptive statistics Of the 151 surveys sent,
    a total of 132 usable responses were received, representing an effective response
    rate of 87%. This response rate was high as participants had already consented
    to being a part of a two year end use study and had their water metres replaced
    with those of a higher resolution and loggers connected. It should be noted that
    only the water end use data from these usable 132 survey respondents was used
    in the subsequent analyses since this was a mixed method study, whereby both a
    completed questionnaire survey and water end use data was required. The demographic
    characteristic of survey responses was classified based on household types and
    socioeconomic areas. In terms of household types, the majority were made up of
    small and large families (67%), followed by couples (25%). The remaining 8% was
    a mix of households with a single person, share house and family with border.
    The four research regions included in the sample were predominately from the middle
    class range (i.e. lower to upper middle class). Some socioeconomic descriptive
    variables have been provided in Table 4 to shed light on the characteristics of
    the sample. Table 4. Socioeconomic descriptive statistics for sampled regions.

    descriptive statistical analysis was firstly performed on factor measurement items
    to examine the mean, standard deviation, as well as the reliability of the measurement
    scale used in the questionnaire. The results are presented in Table 5. The Cronbach’s
    Alpha coefficient of 0.91 calculated from the complete set of items indicates
    a high level of internal consistency (i.e. reliability) of the scale used in the
    survey (Hair et al., 2006). Table 5. Measurement items mean value and standard

    the consistency of the scale presented in the preceding section, Confirmatory
    Factor Analysis was employed to assess the scale’s construct validity and unidimensionality.
    In essence, CFA is a way of testing how well a priori factor structure and its
    respective pattern of loadings match the actual data (Hair et al., 2006). CFA
    can be used to refine an existing theoretical perspective, support an existing
    structure, and test a known dimensional structure in an additional population
    (DiStefano and Hess, 2005). For the purpose of this study, CFA was used to confirm
    the developed factor structure (referred to as “measurement model”) that represented
    the set of attitudes towards the environment and water conservation, respectively,
    for the study sample (Table 1, Table 2). To achieve this, CFA requires an assessment
    of model fit, and an indication of how well the hypothesised measurement model
    (i.e. the factors and associated indicators presented in Table 1, Table 2) represents
    the data obtained from the survey. This was conducted on the basis of five common
    model fit indices: normal chi-square (χ2/df); goodness-of-fit index (GFI); comparative-fit
    index (CFI); incremental-fit index; and root mean square error of approximation
    (RMSEA). To be considered as having an adequate fit, all the indices were measured
    against the following criteria: χ2/df < 3.00; GFI, CFI, and IFI > 0.90; and RMSEA
    < 0.08 (Hair et al., 2006). CFA was conducted using AMOS version 17.0, employing
    the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for parameter estimation. The initial
    results indicated that the measurement model did not fit the data well. To improve
    the model fit, a refinement procedure was carried out, which mainly involved removing
    items that had insignificant or low factor loading (<0.50), and low reliability
    (R2 < 0.50). This procedure led to the elimination of items WC3, WC4 and WC5.
    Table 6 presents the results of the refined measurement model analysis, showing
    the loading, t-value and R2 of each item along with the composite reliability
    and average variance extracted of each factor. As shown in the table, all of the
    remaining items have loadings on their respective factors greater than 0.50, with
    all t-values being significant at p < 0.001, indicating convergent validity of
    the model (Hair et al., 2006). In terms of item reliability, several items had
    R2 values lower than the common acceptable level of 0.50, suggesting potential
    for elimination. However, since their loadings were meaningful (greater than 0.50)
    and highly significant, these items were retained in the measurement model (Koufteros,
    1999). Furthermore, both factors were shown to have a composite reliability well
    above 0.60, and average variance extracted being greater than 0.50 (Bagozzi and
    Yi, 1988). The fit indices of this model (presented underneath Table 6) also show
    an acceptable level of fit according to the criteria mentioned above (χ2 = 140.59;
    df = 76; χ2/df = 1.85; GFI = 0.86; CFI = 0.93; IFI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.08). Therefore,
    the model was deemed the final measurement model, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The
    figure shows the model’s structure of the factors and their associated items,
    correlation between both factors, and the final loadings of all items on their
    respective construct. Table 6. Measurement model analysis results. Items Loading

    Fig. 1. Final Measurement Model. It should be further noted that the high correlation
    between the two factors (0.95) indicated their ability to represent aligned concepts
    (Kline, 2005). However, combining them proved to weaken the model fit indices.
    Furthermore, the discriminant validity of the model (i.e. CE and WC existed as
    two separate factors rather than one) was supported by the significant Chi-Square
    difference statistic between the models with unconstrained and constrained (fixed
    at 1.00) correlation coefficients between the two factors (Koufteros, 1999). All
    of the above results suggested that this final measurement model (Fig. 1) possesses
    adequate convergent validity (i.e. all items reliably represented their respective
    factor), unidimensionality (i.e. all items only represented their respective factor
    not the other) and discriminant validity (i.e. two factors rather than one). The
    final measurement model’s underlying factor structure was therefore used in the
    subsequent analyses. 4.3. Exploration of clusters Once the factor structure had
    been refined and confirmed by the CFA, all the retained items were used as a basis
    for determining whether there were any distinct groupings evident in the sample
    that shared similar patterns of ratings for both the concern for the environment
    and water conservation awareness and practice factors. To achieve this objective,
    cluster analysis was adopted. According to Hair et al. (2006), cluster analysis
    is an exploratory data analysis tool for solving classification problems. Its
    purpose is to categorise cases into groups or clusters so that each case is very
    similar to others in its clusters. Two major stages of the cluster analysis procedure
    were carried out in this research: (1) partitioning; and (2) interpretation. The
    partitioning stage is the process of determining the number of clusters that may
    be developed. The interpretation stage is the process of understanding the characteristics
    of each cluster and developing a name or label that appropriately defines its
    nature (Hair et al., 2006). SPSS version 17.0 for Windows was employed to perform
    the analysis. 4.3.1. Number of clusters and final centroids The hierarchical cluster
    analysis procedure, incorporating Ward’s method, was conducted on all fourteen
    (14) items included in the final measurement model as presented in Fig. 1. This
    clustering procedure involves a combination of the objects into a hierarchy or
    a treelike structure, as represented by a dendrogram. A dendrogram provides an
    indication of heterogeneity change (average within-cluster distance) for all possible
    combinations of clusters. A decision on the final number of clusters is usually
    based on the combinations that do not yield a substantial increase in heterogeneity
    (Hair et al., 2006). From an inspection of the dendrogram, it was found that a
    division of two clusters represented the best solution. The final centroids of
    the two clusters based on the fourteen items are plotted in Fig. 2. The cluster
    centroids are the mean values for each item that represent the general characteristics
    of a cluster (Yeung et al., 2003). Additionally, the results from One-way Analysis
    of Variance (ANOVA) showed that the final centroids of both clusters were significantly
    different across all items. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Profiles
    of clusters’ final centroids. 4.3.2. Interpretation of clusters The characteristics
    of both uncovered clusters were interpreted through the cluster profiles presented
    in Fig. 2. From the figure, it can be observed that the centroids within Cluster
    1 are consistently very high across all items, indicating that this group of respondent
    had a very high concern for environment and water conservation. Thus Cluster 1
    was labelled VHC. For Cluster 2, the centroids value for both factors ranged between
    moderate to high levels, suggesting that this group of respondents had a moderate
    to high level of concern for the environment and water conservation. Hence, Cluster
    2 was labelled MHC. To better understand the characteristics of the clusters,
    socio-demographic information for the households categorised within each cluster
    was subsequently examined with the goal to extract any distinctive features that
    could explain the two groups. Examination of the demographic information for both
    clusters revealed that the VHC group has a higher proportion of small and large
    family households (74%) than that of the MHC cluster (62%). On the other hand,
    the percentage of households with couples in the VHC group (21%) was lower than
    that of the MHC group (27%). The average household lot sizes for the two clusters
    were very similar, being 683 m2 and 691 m2, for MHC and VHC, respectively. The
    VHC cluster had a lower average income (AUD$1584; USD$1628 March 2011) than the
    MHC cluster (AUD$1744; USD$1792). Whilst, this difference is not statistically
    significant due to the relatively small sample size (F = 1.370; p = 0.244), it
    could provide some indication that environmental and water conservation concern
    may become less important to greater proportions of people in the upper middle
    and higher classes. An attempt to shed some light on the influence of socioeconomic
    factors on the relationship between attitudes and water consumption behaviours
    is provided later. 4.4. Water consumption end use analysis 4.4.1. Overall end
    use consumption The breakdown of end use water consumption for the total sampled
    households in the Gold Coast (n = 132) is presented in Fig. 3. The overall average
    consumption for the sampled Gold Coast households (n = 132) was 152.3 L/p/d. It
    should be noted, that while attitude ratings and water end use comparisons are
    made at the household entity level, total water consumption and end use break
    downs are necessarily presented as L/p/d in order to level consumption volumes
    considering household size. The highest end use is showering, with each person
    consuming just over 47.1 L/p/d or 31% of total use. The next highest end use is
    clothes washing accounting for 20% of total consumption or 30 L/p/d. Tap use,
    toilet flushing and irrigation follow with end use percentages of 17%, 14% and
    12%, respectively. Bath use, dishwashing and leaks make up a small component of
    water end use with percentages ranging from 1% to 4%. Fig. 4 demonstrates the
    end use water consumption breakdown for each of the measured 132 households. Download

    use: total sample (n = 132). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Household
    daily per capita consumption distribution with water end use break down: total
    sample (n = 132). 4.4.2. Clustered water end use consumption Two attitudinal clusters
    for the sampled households, namely VHC and MHC, were determined earlier based
    on the household residential perceptions regarding their concern for environment
    and water conservation awareness and practice. The VHC cluster denotes the group
    of households with a very high level of concern, whereas the MHC cluster represents
    the group with a moderate level of concern for the environment and water conservation
    awareness and practice. Further examination and comparison of the end use consumption
    levels, between the two clusters, could thus provide a basis for understanding
    the relationship between the herein measured environmental and water conservation
    attitudinal levels of concern and the actual end usage of water. To achieve this,
    the flow trace analysed average daily per capita end use consumption (i.e. L/p/d)
    for each household associated with the two extracted clusters (i.e. VHC and MHC)
    was assigned and compared. Fig. 5 shows the break down of average daily per capita
    consumption (L/p/d) of the households in the VHC cluster (n = 54). The VHC average
    total water use was 128.2 L/p/d, which is less than that for the combined 132
    household sample (152.3 L/p/d). When considering individual end use activities,
    it was found that the volumetric consumption for all categories was lower than
    that of the total sample, with the exception of dishwasher. It can be further
    observed that the proportion of average daily per capita consumption (i.e. percentage)
    of most end use categories between the VHC cluster and the total sample is similar.
    However, of note is the proportion of irrigation use for the VHC cluster (8%),
    which is considerably less than that of the total sample (12%); as discussed the
    lot sizes of the two clusters is not significantly different. Fig. 6 presents
    the VHC clusters’ descending profile for each individual households’ water end
    use consumption break down, indicating that the majority of households in this
    sub-sample consumed water less than 150 L/p/d. Two excessively high users are
    present, whose average consumption was in the order of 350 L/p/d. These two outliers
    potentially represent households whose reported attitudes do not adequately reflect
    their actual behaviours. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Average daily

    Fig. 6. Household daily per capita consumption distribution profile: VHC cluster
    (n = 54). The break down of average daily per capita consumption (L/p/d) for the
    households in the MHC cluster (n = 78) is presented in Fig. 7. It can be observed
    that the proportion of all the average end use categories of this cluster is similar
    to that of the total sample presented in Fig. 3. For this cluster, the average
    total water use was 169.0 L/p/d, being higher than that of the total 132 sample
    consumption (152.3 L/p/d). Similarly, the end use consumption for all categories,
    except dishwasher, is also higher than that of the total sample. Fig. 8 presents
    the MHC clusters’ descending profile for each individual households’ water end
    use consumption break down. It can be seen that more than half of the households
    in this sub-sample consumed more than 150 L/p/d. Download : Download full-size

    profile: MHC cluster (n = 78). 4.4.3. Clustered comparative analysis Results from
    the preceding section provided illustrative evidence that end use water consumption
    varies depending on the environmental attitudes of consumers. Further investigation
    was undertaken to determine the level of statistical difference for each end use
    category. To achieve this, an independent sample t-test was carried out using
    the two extracted clusters as input samples. The results from this test, as presented
    in Table 7 show that total water consumption volumes for these two clusters are
    statistically different, with the VHC cluster having 24.1% lower consumption (128.2
    L/p/d) than that of the MHC (169.0 L/p/d). Furthermore, consumption levels for
    the four defined discretionary end use categories (i.e. shower, clothes washer,
    tap and irrigation) are all significant at 0.05 level, suggesting that there is
    a relationship between the households’ levels of water conservation and environmental
    concern, and actual water end use consumption. Irrigation represents the most
    significant difference, where the VHC cluster (i.e. 10.8 L/p/d) has a 12.2 L/p/d
    or 53.0% reduction from the MHC cluster (i.e. 23.0 L/p/d). Expectedly, Table 7
    also shows that the two non-discretionary end uses such as dishwasher and toilet,
    which are largely not affected by household behaviours due to their mechanical
    nature, were not significantly different. A discussion on total, behaviourally
    influenced water consumption end use differences, along with an exploratory analysis
    on the socio-demographic factors underpinning these differences, is outlined below.

    and attitudes Cluster analysis results indicated that survey respondents could
    be classified into two environmental attitudinal groups, namely VHC and MHC. Residents
    clustered in the VHC group reported very high levels of understanding and concern
    for the environment and water conservation, whereas those in the MHC cluster reported
    only a moderate level. Total water consumption, as well as the disaggregated water
    end uses categories that sum to this total, were aligned with household attitudinal
    ratings and compared. Three propositions were established and the calculated statistical
    results support the view that water end use consumption levels can significantly
    differ depending on the resident’s level of concern towards the environment and
    water conservation. Both the VHC and MHC groups displayed differing end use water
    consumption levels and possessed divergent characteristics. The following sections
    provide further discussion, which outlines the supportive evidence for the listed
    propositions as well as proposes some of the underlying factors contributing to
    the current situational context. 5.1.1. Relationship between attitudes and total
    water consumption It was hypothesised in this research that households with higher
    levels of environmental concern and attitude towards water conservation will consume
    significantly less water in total. The analysis results provided empirical evidence
    which supports the first proposition (Proposition 1) by demonstrating that the
    VHC cluster households consumed significantly less water than the MHC cluster
    households. This finding provides further support to previously reported research
    studies (Nancarrow et al., 1996) by revealing the link between positive attitudes
    and commitment towards the environment and water conservation. These supportive
    attitudes often result in improved water conservation behaviours which, in turn,
    lead to lower levels of total water consumption in households. 5.1.2. Relationship
    between attitudes and behaviourally influenced end use consumption The smart metering
    approach employed enabled the monitoring of water end use events. Of these end
    uses, five were considered to be strongly influenced by behavioural aspects: shower,
    clothes washer, tap, bathtub and irrigation. Results from the clustered comparative
    analysis indicated significant differences in water consumption in all behaviourally
    influenced end uses, with the exception of bathtub, demonstrating that VHC residents
    consumed significantly less water in these end uses than the MHC residents. This
    finding provides empirical support for Proposition 2a, demonstrating that households
    with higher levels of environmental concern and positive attitude towards water
    conservation have significantly lower levels of consumption in behaviourally influenced
    water end uses. It should be noted that the reason water use in bathing, despite
    being considered moderately influenced by behaviours, showed no significance difference
    between the two clusters could be due to the fact that only a few households in
    the sample undertook this activity, thus making statistical comparisons less reliable.
    Importantly, the above findings imply that there is a positive relationship between
    attitudes towards the environment and water conservation and water end use consumption
    across behaviourally influenced end uses. As discretionary end use consumption
    varies entirely based on the decision of water users to consume beyond what is
    necessary, those water users with positive attitudes towards environmental sustainability
    would tend to be more cautious when using water than those who do not highly value
    or consider the environment. Examples of sustainable activities potentially undertaken
    by the VHC residents could include: (1) showering over smaller durations with
    high efficiency shower heads; (2) washing clothes in water efficient washing machines
    and residents waiting until they have a full load before commencing washing; (3)
    only watering outdoors when absolutely necessary; (4) not continuously running
    taps for rinsing dishes; and (5) turning off taps when brushing teeth or washing
    vegetables. The potential water savings achievable across certain end uses, through
    transforming households’ attitudes, is highly evident (Table 7). Improving the
    attitudes of MHC residents could mean the reduction in water consumption across
    discretionary end uses, ranging from approximately 18.6%–53.0%. Such savings,
    when translated across entire cities, would ensure greater urban water security
    in a time where climate variability is becoming more prevalent. This benefit,
    however, needs to be further examined in future research through a longitudinal
    study implementing and monitoring the influence of education programs to improve
    the attitudes of water users. 5.1.3. Relationship between attitudes and non-discretionary
    end use consumption Because non-discretionary end uses are those water use activities
    that tend to be consumed to satisfy basic need or function without being much
    affected by the users’ behaviour, it was hypothesised in this research that there
    will be no significant differences in non-discretionary water end uses between
    households having different attitudes towards the environment and water conservation
    (Proposition 2b). The two end use events that considered as non-discretionary
    are toilet and dishwasher. As anticipated, these end uses did not have any significant
    difference across the VHC and MHC clusters, thus providing empirical support for
    this proposition. This finding demonstrates that differences in attitudes towards
    the environment and water conservation are not associated with the consumption
    of non-discretionary water end uses. Leakage was not classified as either a discretionary
    or non-discretionary end use. It is worthwhile noting that the levels of leakage
    did not differ between the two clusters. Some visible components of leakage such
    as rectifying continuously running cisterns are affected by behaviours, but less
    visible leakage was not considered to be affected by behaviours. Due to the small
    number of households with significant leakage, and the resulting low volumes within
    each cluster, it is difficult to reliably assess this relationship in the present
    study. Nonetheless, some of the urban water researchers associated with this study
    is examining such an issue in a separate investigation (Britton et al., 2008,
    Britton et al., 2009). 5.2. Linking socio-demographic variables with attitudes
    In addition to examining the relationship between attitudes and water consumption,
    the interpretation of clusters revealed some demographic characteristics that
    had higher representation in each identified cluster. The VHC residents consisted
    of a larger proportion of families whereas the MHC cluster had a lower proportion
    of families and higher proportion of singles and couples. This suggests that families
    may have higher awareness or understanding of the environment and water conservation
    practices and higher application of such knowledge. The study indicated that there
    was no difference between the average lot sizes of the two clusters, indicating
    that irrigable area was not a contributing factor to the difference in irrigation
    end use volumes. As discussed previously there was a difference between the average
    incomes for the two clusters, albeit not statistically significant. Nonetheless,
    this difference does provide some persuasion for future research to explore whether
    households that have higher disposable incomes (i.e. upper middle and high classes)
    are more likely to have less regard for resource conservation, particularly low
    cost resources such as potable water. Other studies have indicated that affluence
    may play a significant part in higher water consumption behaviours (CSIRO, 2002,
    Kim et al., 2007, Kenney et al., 2008). In summary, whilst the authors acknowledge
    that a wide range of other contributing factors, beyond environmental/water attitudes
    such as pricing or demographics, contribute to water consumption behaviours, the
    study provides strong indications that attitudes play a predominant role in water
    conservation. Further research on attitudes towards environment and water conservation
    across different socioeconomic groups could provide additional insight into domestic
    water consumption behaviour and would assist in triggering the development of
    targeted awareness messages. 6. Conclusions and implications This paper presented
    findings from a component of the GCWSEU study. The herein discussed component
    of the greater research program was focused on establishing if attitudes influence
    a range of end use water consumption levels; such a mixed method study has not
    been reported in the literature. The research findings provided empirical support
    to the propositions that pro-environmental and water conservation attitudes result
    in household total water savings, and across the majority of discretionary end
    uses, respectively. Two attitudinal constructs, concern for the environment and
    water conservation awareness and practice, were statistically validated following
    a measurement reliability and scale analysis process. Subsequently, cluster analysis
    uncovered two distinct groups of households, being those with very high concern
    (VHC) and those with moderate to high (MHC) concern. Smart metres were utilised
    to collect high resolution (0.014 L/pulse) flow data, which was then disaggregated
    into end uses for the 132 households involved in the study. Three research propositions
    were developed and tested. Overall, it was established that strong positive environmental
    and water conservation attitudes resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) lower total
    water consumption as well as for the behaviourally influenced end use categories
    (i.e. shower, clothes washing, irrigation and tap use). Bath use was not affected
    by attitudes potentially due to the small number of household residents partaking
    in this activity. Non-discretionary toilet and dishwasher use was not influenced
    by attitudes as predicted. Leakage being categorised as neither a discretionary
    or non-discretionary use was also not shown to be impacted by attitudes; however,
    examining this end use category was outside the scope of this research. Residents
    with a high level of concern or attitude towards the environment had a higher
    representation of families than couples and slightly higher incomes, although
    this was not at a significant level. The results from this research provide water
    demand management professionals with an understanding on where educational programs
    should be targeted to obtain the highest effective household water savings. Significant
    water savings in high end uses within homes can be achieved if pro-environmental
    attitudes can be effectively instilled. This research supports the development
    of directed awareness information focused on improving the current level of understanding
    of sustainable shower, clothes washing, irrigation and tap use behaviours. Such
    targeted programs will result in significant reductions in water consumption within
    residential households. The study provides empirical evidence to support the view
    that if society at large values water and is actively concerned with how it is
    being consumed, significant reductions in consumption levels can occur. This in
    turn will lead to a reduced requirement for environmentally adverse water supply
    alternatives (e.g. desalination plants) to support demand. As a final note, the
    findings and herein described research methods could also be applied to investigate
    relationships between attitudes and resources (i.e. water, energy and materials)
    and conservation in the commercial and industrial sectors. Acknowledgements The

    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,
    “agribusiness”, “agriculture safety”, “agriculture security”, “agriculture traceability”,
    “food safety”, “food security”, “food traceability”, “food supply”, “food trade”,
    “food value chain management”, “agriculture value chain management”, “agri-food
    value chain management”, “agricultural trade” Databases ScienceDirect, Web of
    Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library, Emerald, Google
    Scholar, IEEE Xplore Search strings (“blockchain” OR “information security” OR
    “information transparency”) AND (“agriculture” OR “agricultural” OR “agribusiness”
    OR “agriculture safety” OR “agriculture security” OR “food safety” OR “food security”
    OR “food traceability” OR “food supply” OR “food trade” OR “agriculture traceability”
    OR “food value chain management” OR “agriculture value chain management” OR “agri-food
    value chain management” OR “agriculture trade”) 3.3. Study selection and evaluation
    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    studies. Note: Node size depends on the quantity of connected components. From
    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    A review [45]; How blockchain technology along with other technologies such as
    AI, IoT, Big Data revolutionize the current agri-food industry As blockchain technology
    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction
    data, transaction transparency were improved. (1) May have regulation problem
    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value
    chain information security. Authors Involved technologies Architecture Advantages

    and data would be increased Hybrid approach (1) Part of the data are stored in
    the blockchain, and the rest are direct shared with other partners (1) High cost
    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. Main challenges Possible solutions

    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future studies in the
    area of blockchain technology and agri-food value chain management. Acknowledgment

    \ are scarce and urban areas consume the vast majority \nof these resources, it\
    \ is vital to make cities greener and more sustainable. Advanced \nsystems to\
    \ improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart\
    \ \ncities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later\
    \ use, to intelligent \ncontrol systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously,\
    \ the possible \nimprovements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous\
    \ sensing poses \nnumerous challenges, which are of a technological or social\
    \ nature. This paper presents an \noverview of the state of the art with regards\
    \ to sensing in smart cities. Topics include \nsensing applications in smart cities,\
    \ sensing platforms and technical challenges associated \nwith these technologies.\
    \ In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies \nplay a\
    \ role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated\
    \ with \nthese applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies\
    \ belong to \ndifferent disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts\
    \ to bridge these to provide \na broad overview, which can be of help to researchers\
    \ and developers in understanding \nhow advanced sensing can play a role in smart\

    A smart city is a city which functions in a sustainable and intelligent way, by\
    \ integrating all its \ninfrastructures and services into a cohesive whole and\
    \ using intelligent devices for monitoring and \ncontrol, to ensure sustainability\
    \ and efficiency [1]. In a world where population numbers are constantly \nrising,\
    \ significantly driving the consumption of resources causing resource shortages\
    \ and climate \nchange, the incentive for innovative solutions is evident. Urban\
    \ areas, in particular, are responsible for \nthe major part of resource consumption,\
    \ instigating an increasing need to create smarter infrastructures, \nin search\
    \ of greener and more energy efficient urban dynamics. Solutions to these issues\
    \ comprise of \nimprovements to a majority of components of urban dynamics, as\
    \ illustrated in Figure 1. \nFigure 1. Sensing in smart cities. \nThe Smart \n\
    City\nSmart \nInfrastructures\nSmart Electricity \nand Water \ndistribution\n\
    Smart \nTransportation\nSmart \nBuildings\nSmart \nSurveillance\nSmart Services\n\
    Smart \nHealthcare\n \nIt is predicted that the global economy will be significantly\
    \ disproportionate due the growth of \ncities, with forecasts that by 2050 more\
    \ than 6 billion people will live in urban areas [2]. This growth \nwill aggravate\
    \ further existing energy and climate related challenges. To solve these challenges,\
    \ cities \nwhich are more resource efficient and technology driven, are necessary.\
    \ \nSensing is at the heart of smart infrastructures, which can monitor themselves\
    \ and act on their own \nintelligently. Using sensors to monitor public infrastructures,\
    \ such as bridges, roads and buildings, \nprovides awareness that enables a more\
    \ efficient use of resources, based on the data collected by these \nsensors.\
    \ Real-time monitoring eliminates the need for regular scheduled inspections,\
    \ therefore \nreducing costs; measuring energy consumption in households allows\
    \ for accurate load forecasting; and \nsensors deployed in roads for traffic monitoring\
    \ collect data which is necessary for the implementation \nof intelligent transportation\
    \ systems (ITS). \nFor these approaches to be effective, sensors have to be deployed\
    \ in very large numbers and they \nhave to be interconnected, so that the collected\
    \ data can be sent to a central information system, where \nintelligent decisions\
    \ based on this data can be made. This poses a number of challenges. Firstly,\
    \ there \nneeds to be a communication infrastructure in place for these sensors\
    \ to communicate with each other. \nSecondly, what is the most efficient way to\
    \ aggregate and process this data? \nSensors 2013, 13 \n395 \n \n \nAspects related\
    \ to sensing in smart cities as well as efficient processing of data collected\
    \ by these \nsensors is discussed in the remainder of this paper. It is organized\
    \ as follows: Sections 2 and 3 review \nthe current state of sensing and enabling\
    \ technologies, respectively. In Section 4 existing sensing \nplatforms for smart\
    \ cities are discussed, and in Section 5 sensing applications in smart cities\
    \ are \ndiscussed. Some ongoing and future pilot projects for smart cities are\
    \ described in Section 6. \nChallenges and future directions are discussed in\
    \ Section 7, and the paper is concluded in Section 8. \n2. The Sensing Evolution\
    \ \nSensors are a crucial component of any intelligent control system. A process\
    \ is improved based on \nits environment and for a control system to be aware\
    \ of its environment, it is typically fitted with an \narray of sensors, from\
    \ which it collects the required data. It then uses the appropriate variables\
    \ to \ncharacterize its environment and adjusts its operations accordingly.  \n\
    The availability of a multitude of different sensors and continuously evolving\
    \ technology enable \napplications that were infeasible in the past due to high\
    \ costs and limited availability. Technology \nadvances not only drive the innovation\
    \ behind sensors, they also enable sufficient processing power for \nsmall-scale\
    \ devices to which these sensors can be interfaced to at a relatively low cost.\
    \ From the \nperspective of the requirements for smart cities, wide availability\
    \ of these technologies translates to a \nlarge number of opportunities in terms\
    \ of sensing. \nAs an example within the context of the smart city, meters to\
    \ determine gas, electricity and water \nconsumption have traditionally been mechanical.\
    \ However, smart metering implies a new generation \nof technologies [3]. As with\
    \ mechanical solutions, they must be robust, cheap, easy to maintain and \nreliable,\
    \ as their readings will be used to determine billing. Electricity meter readings\
    \ have evolved \nfrom the manual procedure of reading the mechanical meter, to\
    \ automatic meter reading (AMR) which \nwere deployed to reduce costs and improve\
    \ the accuracy of meter readings, eventually to an advanced \nmetering infrastructure\
    \ (AMI) which differs from the AMR in that it enables two-way communications \n\
    with the meter, driven by a growing understanding of the benefits of two-way interactions\
    \ between \nsystem operators, consumers and their loads and resources. \nA sensor\
    \ is a converter which converts parameters of a physical nature to an electronic\
    \ signal, \nwhich can be interpreted by humans or can be fed into an autonomous\
    \ system. These signals for \nconventional sensors, amongst others, include light,\
    \ pressure, temperature, humidity, moisture and a \nvariety of other parameters.\
    \  \nMore sophisticated sensors include accelerometers which can be used to measure\
    \ acceleration and \nvibration. In the context of structural health monitoring\
    \ (SHM), for instance, sensors like corrosion rate \nsensors (working on the principle\
    \ of an increase in electrical resistivity due to corrosion); acoustic \nemission\
    \ sensors (used to detect propagation of sound waves); and magneto-strictive sensors\
    \ (detects \nthe change in magnetic induction in the material caused by strain\
    \ or stress). An even later generation of \nsensors is based on semiconductor\
    \ physics and nano-technology, and intelligent sensing devices \ninclude, amongst\
    \ others, smart phones. \nCMOS based sensing, due to the relative low cost, enables\
    \ a range of smart sensors. In [4], a smart \ntemperature sensor with a one-point\
    \ calibration technique and MOSFET circuits is proposed. This \nsensor is primarily\
    \ aimed at low-power devices. Other CMOS-based sensor applications include \n\
    Sensors 2013, 13 \n396 \n \n \nmonitoring the quality of food products, by observing\
    \ the temperature and time of exposure, which are \nparameters related to the\
    \ quality of food products [5]. Within the context of the smart city, these \n\
    devices can also sense air and water quality, amongst others. \nIn particular,\
    \ stick-on or printed sensors can be attached to devices as labels to measure\
    \ various \nphysical parameters, such as humidity [6], temperature [7] and gas\
    \ [8]. Also, sensors have been \nproposed in plastic foil, e.g., chemical gas\
    \ sensors, implemented on a variety of substrates, coated with \na sensing film.\
    \ These enable sensing of multiple parameters from a single sensor. For instance,\
    \ on a \nsingle flexible foil, a multi-parameter sensor for temperature, humidity\
    \ and gas, using flexible \npolyimide foils, is proposed in [9], with the capability\
    \ of sensing propane and similar gases. A possible \napplication for these sensors,\
    \ as indicated in [9], is humidity monitoring, by embedding these sensors \ninto\
    \ construction materials, or environmental monitoring [10], an important capability\
    \ for smart cities. \nNano-technology, although mostly applicable for bio-sensing\
    \ applications, is a key enabling \ntechnology for sensor development, as advances\
    \ in nano-technology will undoubtedly drive \ndevelopment in MEMS and photonics,\
    \ inevitably leading to the development of highly sophisticated \nbut low-cost\
    \ sensors. This technology will enable applications where not only an individual’s\
    \ \nsurroundings can be sensed, but also the person’s health, at high granularity,\
    \ for instance, and linked to \nsocial networks. \nThe ever increasing number\
    \ of smartphones opens up a totally new sensing scenario. Smartphones \nare fitted\
    \ with a variety of sensors such as GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses,\
    \ enabling a \nvariety of crowd sourcing applications, which will eventually be\
    \ augmented by the Internet of Things. \nIn particular, collaborative data collection\
    \ is a popular crowd sourcing application. Crowd sourcing \nwill be discussed\
    \ in Section 5.10. \n3. Enabling Technologies \nSome technical issues regarding\
    \ communication between sensor nodes still have to be resolved. In \nthe context\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), the communication between sensors nodes has\
    \ to be \nwireless, as cabling costs for millions of sensors is impractical and\
    \ extremely expensive. Low power \ncommunication standards, suitable for an extremely\
    \ large number of devices and their heterogeneity, \nare necessary. In particular,\
    \ depending on location and necessary coverage, there are a number of \ndifferent\
    \ networks in smart cities. Depending on location and coverage, these can be classified\
    \ as [11]: \nHome Area Networks: these typically use short range standards, with\
    \ operating frequencies in \nthe ISM bands. Standards include ZigBee, Dash7 and\
    \ Wi-Fi (802.11 g/n), or wired standards \nsuch as Ethernet. All the monitoring\
    \ and control system’s components in a home are connected \nby the HAN. \nWide\
    \ Area Networks: these provide for communication between utilities and customers’\
    \ \npremises, which requires a much broader coverage than HANs, with infrastructure\
    \ such as \nleased lines based on optic fiber or broadband wireless, e.g., 3G\
    \ and LTE, and managed by \nservice providers. \nField Area Networks: typically\
    \ used in a smart grid to connect customers’ premises to substations. \nTable\
    \ 1 compares the different communication standards listed in this section. \n\

    \ ZigBee \nWith the advent of ubiquitous computing, one of the concepts of smart\
    \ cities is to have sensors \ndeployed virtually everywhere, in the millions,\
    \ such as in PlanIT Valley, where the aim is to have  \n100 million sensors. As\
    \ sensor nodes are typically designed to be low-power devices, the communication\
    \ \nstandard has to take that into account, as communication consumes the most\
    \ energy. \nLow power standards like IEEE 802.15.4 have limited range and a significant\
    \ number of repeaters \nwould have to be deployed in a city for full coverage.\
    \ Additionally, addressing schemes would have to \nsupport billions of devices.\
    \ 6LoWPAN defines mechanisms which allow transmission of IPv6 packets \nover IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 based networks. Although this certainly presents itself as a solution\
    \ to the \naddressing issue, the coverage issue is tightly coupled to the communication\
    \ technology itself, which is \ninherently short range (in the order of hundred\
    \ meters). \n3.2. Dash7 \nDash7 is a promising standard for WSNs and is aimed\
    \ at long distance, low power sensing \napplications. Some of these applications\
    \ include building automation and logistics, to name a few. This \nprotocol stack\
    \ has a very small footprint; its communication range is in the order of kilometers;\
    \ and it \noperates at 433 MHz, a frequency which allows better penetration than\
    \ 2.4 GHz [12]. For home area \nnetworks (HANs), for instance, this frequency\
    \ is appealing, as it allows better penetration through \nwalls than 2.4 GHz.\
    \ For wide area networks (WANs), Dash7 is also appealing because of the long \n\
    ranges. Dash7 has received considerable attention for military applications, including\
    \ substantial \ninvestments. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there\
    \ is no significant active academically \ndriven research focused on Dash7. \n\
    3.3. 3G and LTE \nIn terms of existing wireless communication infrastructures,\
    \ 3G and LTE, have available \ninfrastructures worldwide, even in third world\
    \ countries. These technologies are meant for broadband \nconnectivity, and were\
    \ not designed for short range, low power operation. Although they have been \n\
    adopted by mobile devices such as smartphones, these devices operate on a rechargeable\
    \ battery, in \ncontrast to sensor nodes which are ideally deployed sparsely,\
    \ with no intention of charging or \nreplacing batteries. Furthermore, these services\
    \ are provided by service providers and the data cost is \nstill relatively expensive\
    \ compared to their fixed line counterparts such as ADSL. With millions of \n\
    sensors uploading gigabytes or even terabytes (in case of video) of data to the\
    \ cloud, these \ntechnologies are rendered infeasible for IoT. Furthermore, these\
    \ standards are not optimized for use in \nSensors 2013, 13 \n398 \n \n \nsensor\
    \ networks (i.e., low power). Hence, for these technologies to be adopted for\
    \ sensor networks, \npower consumption has to be considered. In the absence of\
    \ embedding these technologies into the \nsensor node (i.e., integrating LTE or\
    \ 3G into the sensor platform), gateways can be used between the \nsensor devices\
    \ and the web, as shown in [13]. LTE, in particular, has been a main enabler of\
    \ high \nperformance M2M applications, due to coverage, high throughput and low\
    \ latency. \n3.4. RFID and NFC \nWith regards to short range communication, there\
    \ are two prominent technologies in the context of \nsmart cities. Radio Frequency\
    \ Identification (RFID) consists of an RFID tag (which can be either \npassive\
    \ or active), where data is stored, and an RFID reader, which induces an electromagnetic\
    \ field \nwhen in near proximity to passive tags and by this means provides power\
    \ to the devices (longer ranges \nfor active tags), enabling it to read data from\
    \ the tag’s memory. RFID enables a range of applications \nfor smart cities, such\
    \ as localization and tracking of objects [14], healthcare applications [15],\
    \ asset \nmanagement [16] and smart parking [17], to name a few. As the circuitry\
    \ in tags is printed, it is natural \nto integrate these tags with smart label\
    \ sensors, therefore creating RFID tags which do not only \ncontain data which\
    \ has been manually written, but they also capture environmental data as described\
    \  \nin [9]. Hence, each tag can also act as a sensor. Additionally, because passive\
    \ tags are inexpensive, \nthese can be deployed in very large numbers for pervasive\
    \ sensing. Furthermore, the passive nature of \nthese tags translates to low cost\
    \ and low power consumption, as these tags only need to be powered \nwhen needed.\
    \ \nNear Field Communication (NFC) is used in mobile and similar devices, for\
    \ a very short  \nbi-directional communication range (in contrast with RFID which\
    \ is unidirectional). These ranges are \nusually in the centimeter range. The\
    \ recent integration of NFC into smartphones has enabled a range of \napplications\
    \ which facilitate day-to-day activities and enable smart living. A selection\
    \ of general \napplications which have emerged with NFC is given: \nThe most predominant\
    \ application of NFC is the digital wallet. This allows customers to use their\
    \ \nsmartphones as a substitute for their cards, which can be for public transportation,\
    \ bank, access control \nor identification [18]. \nSince NFC is bidirectional,\
    \ it is possible to use it to share data between devices, multimedia as well \n\
    as documents, such as business cards or similar contact information [19]. \nOccupancy\
    \ and user context in smart homes are accomplished by placing NFC tags at strategic\
    \ \nlocations in a house and have these tags interface with the central information\
    \ system It is possible to \ndetermine whether a user has entered a room and to\
    \ change the settings according to the location  \n(e.g., switch on Wi-Fi if the\
    \ user enters the house) [17]. \nThe following are real-world examples of NFC\
    \ application within the context of the smart city: \nSmart energy metering: NFC-enabled\
    \ post-pay electricity meters were deployed in the city of \nChongqing, China,\
    \ which enable consumers to read their smart meters with an NFC phone. \nPayment\
    \ for the electricity is automatically done after the encrypted reading has been\
    \ send \nover-the-air to the service’s banking back-end [20]. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n399 \n \n \nData acquisition and control: NFC enabled smartphones can be\
    \ used to interface with control \nsystems for remote control [21] and can be\
    \ used as platforms for advanced measurement and \nprocessing [22]. \nCity touristic\
    \ surfing: with an NFC enabled smart phone and smart posters disseminated \nalong\
    \ the city, the user can navigate through points of interest within the city [23].\
    \ \nSmart car parks: motorists can use their NFC enabled smart phone as an electronic\
    \ ticket to \nenter the parking lot and when leaving as an electronic wallet to\
    \ affect payment [24]. \nWith the addition of NFC to smartphones and the widespread\
    \ of smartphones, NFC is envisaged as \na key enabling technology in smart cities.\
    \ \n4. Sensing Platforms \nWith the advent of ubiquitous sensing, various devices\
    \ and platforms are currently available  \nfor this purpose. Although ideas to\
    \ implement these platforms have been around for decades, only \nrecently have\
    \ these systems been feasible from a cost perspective, driven by reduced manufacturing\
    \ \ncosts as well as low-cost electronic components such as radio transceivers,\
    \ microcontrollers, \nmicroprocessors and sensors. Sourcing these components in\
    \ bulk becomes increasingly less expensive \nas technology progresses. \nSensor\
    \ nodes can be interfaced to a number of sensors. The most common include humidity,\
    \ light \nand temperatures sensors. These platforms are built in such a way that\
    \ the sensed data is collected by \nthe sensors, sometimes pre-processed, and\
    \ then transmitted to a sink node via other sensor nodes; \nhence they are usually\
    \ set up in a network, also known as a wireless sensor network (WSN). \nAdditionally,\
    \ these systems will be deployed outdoors and thus have to cope with the harsh\
    \ \nenvironmental conditions. In this context, properties from industrial control\
    \ networks can be applied in \nthese sensor networks for added robustness and\
    \ reliability [25]. \n4.1. Wireless Sensor Networks \nWireless sensor networks\
    \ consist of wireless sensor nodes, which are devices equipped with a \nprocessor,\
    \ a radio interface, an analog-to-digital converter, multiple sensors, memory\
    \ and a power \nsupply. The general architecture of a wireless sensor node is\
    \ illustrated in Figure 2. \nA range of open source sensor nodes are available\
    \ to the research community. Some of the most \nwidely used sensor nodes recently\
    \ in research are Mica, Mica2, IMote, Telos, TelosB, Stargate and \nIMote 2. Table\
    \ 2 contains details on available sensor motes used in research and commercial\
    \ \napplications. The utopia of WSNs is an extremely tiny low-power, low-cost\
    \ sensor node which can be \ndeployed in any environment, with sufficient battery\
    \ power to last for a few years, with the capability \nto continuously sense its\
    \ surroundings. In reality, even with recent advances in microelectronics, these\
    \ \nhave still not been realized. The only project to come close to this idea\
    \ was Smart Dust, which was \nactive up to the early 2000s [26]. \nSensors 2013,\

    \ are characterized by severe resource constraints, one of which is the \nreliance\
    \ on battery life. With the deployment of sensor nodes in very large numbers in\
    \ smart cities, it is \ninfeasible to replace or recharge batteries in these devices.\
    \ Creating energy efficient solutions from \nprotocol design to sophisticated\
    \ power management schemes are efficient and necessary methods, but \nnot sufficient.\
    \ A popular way of supplementing power includes solar panels, but sunlight is\
    \ not always \navailable and it is not the most cost effective solution. The harvesting\
    \ of energy from alternative \nsources in the environment is actively being researched\
    \ and developed. Examples of these energy \nsources include thermal, light (solar),\
    \ wind, mechanical (vibration) and many others. However, \nefficient ways of capturing\
    \ this energy are vital, as the energy from these sources is usually available\
    \ \nin extremely small quantities. \nHence, ways to scavenge energy from the environment\
    \ to prolong the nodes’ lifetimes and improve \nmarket adoption are essential.\
    \ Sources are typically from light, heat and sources of kinetic energy such \n\
    as vibrations, etc. Of course, this technology can also be applied to drive any\
    \ other low-energy device.  \nMethods of energy harvesting, in the context of\
    \ smart cities include: \nWind energy: small scale turbine rotation is converted\
    \ to electrical energy. Such turbines can \nbe located in open places where wind\
    \ is easily accessible. For instance, nodes used for \nstructural health monitoring,\
    \ deployed in bridges and similar structures, can readily use this \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n401 \n \n \nkind of harvesting. Other methods involve the use of piezo-electric\
    \ materials [27] or vibrating \nmembranes [28]. \nRF energy: an antenna receives\
    \ RF signals and an RF-DC converter module converts the RF \nsignals to DC voltages.\
    \ With multiple antennae emitting signals, this type of harvesting is \nworth\
    \ exploring [29]. \nElectric field: electric and magnetic fields around power\
    \ lines, for instance, can be exploited \nfor energy scavenging, as shown in [30,31].\
    \ Sensors deployed in the near proximity of these \noverhead lines can exploit\
    \ these electric or magnetic fields. \nVibrations and movement: kinetic energy,\
    \ from vibrations for instance, can be harvested in \nmany different locations.\
    \ For instance, at utility’s facilities, nodes deployed for condition \nmonitoring\
    \ can exploit vibrations for energy scavenging, as shown in [32]. Vibration is\
    \ probably \nthe most efficient energy sources for scavenging, as well as HVAC\
    \ ducts in office buildings. \nLight and Thermal Sources: these are common both\
    \ indoors and outdoors. In houses for \ninstance, these can be ambient artificial\
    \ light or heat from appliances [33]. \nPiezo-electric harvesters in bridges and\
    \ highways: to meet the demands in power requirements \nfor sensor nodes for SHM,\
    \ the structure’s vibration, in case of bridges or highways, is a good \nenergy\
    \ scavenging source [34]. \nAlthough there is a lot of research and development\
    \ ongoing in this domain, these techniques are \nstill not completely mature for\
    \ powering of low-power devices, and even when they are used, it should \nbe for\
    \ ultra low duty cycles only, to preserve as much energy as possible. Amongst\
    \ these scavenging \ntechniques, harnessing energy from vibration is probably\
    \ the most efficient approach. \n4.2. Internet of Things Systems \nSensor nodes\
    \ described in the previous section, typically send their data to a sink node,\
    \ which in \nturn sends it to some sort of processing centre. These two components\
    \ (sensing and processing) are not \nexplicitly unified, from a WSN perspective.\
    \ Some unified solutions include:  \nThingspeak [35]: Thingspeak is a platform\
    \ which enables users to upload information from \ntheir sensor nodes to the Cloud.\
    \ Users create an account on the platform, register their devices, \nand get access\
    \ to their sensor data as desired. The system allows querying by location, allowing\
    \ \nthe user to have access to data from various locations in the world. \niOBridge\
    \ [36]: in contrast to Thingspeak and Cosm, where libraries for different sensing\
    \ \nplatforms are available, iOBridge develops its own hardware modules that are\
    \ connected to the \nCloud, which in turn can be accessed through web interfaces,\
    \ for remote monitoring and API’s \nallow integration of the collected information\
    \ into other web services or third-party \napplications, for example mobile applications\
    \ for controlling these ioBridge devices remotely \nfrom smartphones such as Android\
    \ and iPhone. \nIn contrast to the systems described above, there are also proprietary\
    \ solutions. These include \nHPCense [37] and Smarter Planet [38]. HPCense’s ultimate\
    \ goal is to deploy more than a trillion \nsensors around the planet to collect\
    \ a range of information such as seismic activity. Smarter Planet is \nan IBM\
    \ initiative which encourages companies to adhere to their solutions to improve\
    \ the efficiency of \nSensors 2013, 13 \n402 \n \n \ntheir current systems. These\
    \ include building management solutions and IT infrastructures for scalable \n\
    data storage. \n4.3. Cloud of Things \nThe Cloud is a vital component of smart\
    \ cities. As sensors collect terabytes of information, this data \nneeds to be\
    \ aggregated and processed. With the recent technological advances in mobile computing,\
    \ in \nthe form of smartphones, the Cloud has become a critical element for data\
    \ storage and processing. In \nsimple terms, the Cloud is a collection of platforms\
    \ and infrastructures on which data is stored and \nprocessed, allowing users\
    \ to retrieve and upload their data for a specific mobile application or \ncomputer\
    \ program, at any location with available Internet access. Hence, the Cloud is\
    \ a pool of \nresources accessible via the Internet. \nThe ability of outsourcing\
    \ processing power is particularly appealing, because resource intensive \napplications\
    \ can be dispatched to the Cloud instead. From the perspective of ubiquitous computing\
    \ and \nsensing, the Cloud is essential. \nFor smart cities, combining the Cloud\
    \ and sensors is crucial, so that the sensing data can be stored \nor processed.\
    \ In [39], a high-level architecture to interface sensors and the Cloud is described.\
    \ The \nexchange of data follows the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard. \n\
    In the context of Cloud computing, all these platforms can be classified as either\
    \ infrastructure as a \nservice (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) or software\
    \ as a service (SaaS). Infrastructure as a service \n(IaaS) consists of providing\
    \ storage or processing capabilities through the use of virtual machines; \nplatform\
    \ as a service (PaaS) comprises a platform with execution environment and databases;\
    \ and \nsoftware as a service (SaaS) provides facilities for users to access their\
    \ applications or personal files on \nthe cloud. The integration of sensor devices\
    \ into the Internet requires IP compatible protocol stacks. \nThe Constrained\
    \ Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application layer protocol, specifically for\
    \ \nenergy constrained devices, described in [40]. The device in question (in\
    \ this context, a sensor node) \ncommunicates with a CoAP client, which in turn\
    \ communicates with a web server. CoAP and \n6LoWPAN allow sensor nodes to be\
    \ integrated into the web, through the use of proxies for HTTP to \nCoAP conversion.\
    \ In this context, if sensor nodes running CoAP are connected to the network,\
    \ sensing \ndata could be retrieved by a web browser through GET requests, in\
    \ the same way a HTTP agent is \nqueried. Figure 3 illustrates how CoAP and HTTP\
    \ co-exist. \nFigure 3. CoAP to HTTP conversion through a proxy in the Cloud.\
    \ \n \nSensors 2013, 13 \n403 \n \n \nEfforts are made to integrate these services\
    \ into each layer of the protocol stack, such as in \nSensinode [13], where these\
    \ are combined in the protocol stack. IoT standardizing efforts are also a \n\
    challenge as a large number of companies are involved with IoT development. \n\
    Other standardizing efforts include the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework\
    \ [41], by the \nOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC), with the goal of seamlessly\
    \ integrating sensor nodes independent \nof hardware platform, and defining structures\
    \ for describing measured data from sensors to a suite of \nweb services available\
    \ to the platform.  \nWhen using smartphones as ubiquitous sensing tools, standards\
    \ have to put in place for efficient \ndata exchange between devices. In [42]\
    \ a performance analysis on Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) \nprotocols for data exchange\
    \ between mobile devices for environmental monitoring applications is \npresented.\
    \ SWE protocols are based on XML, which introduce a considerable amount of overhead.\
    \ By \nanalyzing the execution speed of the XML parsing process, and comparing\
    \ to alternative formats, such \nas JSON, or EXI, with reductions in the file\
    \ size in the order of 40% to 90%, as well as faster parsing \ntimes, it was concluded\
    \ that EXI-C, even though it adds considerable overhead in processing times, \n\
    results in greatly reduced message lengths. Apart from the integration of sensor\
    \ devices onto the Web, \nanother issue is the large volume of data due the large\
    \ number of sensors. \nAn example of Cloud architecture to solve the high volume\
    \ data issue, named CLEVER, is \npresented in [43]. This architecture allows the\
    \ virtualization of different types of sensing structures so \nthat a common interface\
    \ can be used for multiple sensor networks. It provides services for sensing,\
    \ \nstorage and computation. From a cloud perspective, CLEVER is mainly an IaaS\
    \ solution. A module \nnamed C-SENSOR is responsible for managing the sensors’\
    \ physical resources and abstraction/ \nvirtualization. C-SENSOR is compliant\
    \ with SWE and it interacts with sensor data in an event-based \nor on-demand\
    \ fashion. A Host Manager directly interfaces with the sensor network and a Cluster\
    \ \nManager, which interacts with the system’s front-end and database. Each sensor\
    \ network is virtualized \nas a virtual pervasive element (VPE), which is an integral\
    \ part of the Host manager. \n5. Applications \n5.1. Water Distribution Systems\
    \ \nWater (along with electricity) is one of the most important resources in urban\
    \ areas. From supplying \nresidential customers to public infrastructures, such\
    \ as public parks, the distribution of water has to be \ndone efficiently and\
    \ has to be regulated. Furthermore, efficient quality control has to be performed\
    \ to \nensure that water is safe for human consumption. A typical water distribution\
    \ system consists of a \nwater collecting point (such as a river or lake), storage\
    \ facilities (such as reservoirs) and a distribution \nnetwork, which typically\
    \ consists of pipes (placed either above or underground and underwater) \nconnecting\
    \ water collecting points, storage facilities, to the customers’ premises. \n\
    These distribution systems are in essence non-intelligent. For instance, if there\
    \ is a leak in one of \nthe distribution pipes, it can be tricky to diagnose the\
    \ system early enough to detect the fault, \nespecially if it is not readily visible\
    \ (in case of underground pipes for instance). Advanced sensing \nenables a more\
    \ reliable fault detection system. Possible locations to deploy sensors and parameters\
    \ of \ninterest, from a monitoring perspective, in water distribution systems,\
    \ are shown in Figure 4. Examples \nSensors 2013, 13 \n404 \n \n \nof such applications\
    \ include monitoring the content level in reservoir tanks, leak detection and\
    \ \nmonitoring the water quality at specific points along the distribution system.\
    \ \nFigure 4. Applications of sensing in water distribution systems. \n \nFor\
    \ pipeline monitoring, the method shown in [44] consists of sensors deployed around\
    \ the pipeline \nfor continuous monitoring. Typically, three parameters used to\
    \ indicate faults in pipelines are \nvibration, pressure, sound (made by the liquid\
    \ as it leaks) and water flow [45]. By monitoring these \nparameters, a leakage\
    \ can be successfully detected. In [46], a WSN monitors hydraulic, flow and \n\
    acoustic data, as well as water quality, with nodes deployed at strategic locations\
    \ along the pipeline \nand also in sewers to determine content levels. \nFor pressure\
    \ sensing, this system uses a piezo-resistive sensor and for measuring water pH\
    \  \n(for quality monitoring purposes), a glass electrode is used. For water level\
    \ monitoring, an ultrasonic \nsensor was placed on top of the collector, and two\
    \ pressure transducers were placed at the bottom [45]. \nAdditionally, using dual-axis\
    \ accelerometers, vibration data is collected. These sensors are deployed \nalong\
    \ the pipes as shown in Figure 5. \nFigure 5. Vibration, pressure, and flow sensors\
    \ in a pipeline. These are used to monitor the \nintegrity of the pipeline, as\
    \ described above. \n \nSensors 2013, 13 \n405 \n \n \nThe collected data is then\
    \ analyzed to search for leaks. By analyzing the pressure data using Haar \nWavelet\
    \ transforms, pressure pulses along the pipe can be detected to determine whether\
    \ bursts \noccurred and their approximate location. High magnitude noise in the\
    \ acoustic signal is also an \nindication of a leak. Since sensors are typically\
    \ placed apart and by cross-correlating the data collected \nby neighbor nodes,\
    \ and considering time differences due to the sensors’ spatial positioning, the\
    \ \nlocation of a leak can be determined. As these analysis methods require considerable\
    \ processing \nresources, the data collected is analyzed remotely and not locally\
    \ on the sensor nodes. A device to \nmitigate effects from the leak can be activated\
    \ when an anomaly is detected. In the context of pipeline \nmonitoring, this could\
    \ consist of a device that would instruct an electro-mechanical device (i.e.,\
    \ \nactuator) to act in order to restrict the flow of water to sections of the\
    \ pipe which could have been \ncompromised by the leak. Other methods consist\
    \ of placing meters inside the pipe to determine liquid \nflow [47]. \nHence,\
    \ integrated sensing, processing and actuators results in an intelligent structure,\
    \ where the \nactuator’s decisions do not require human intervention. The data\
    \ is collected by the sensing agent, \nanalyzed, classified and an intelligent\
    \ decision is carried out by the actuator. \n5.2. Electricity Distribution Systems\
    \ \nConventional electricity distribution systems are in essence non-intelligent.\
    \ Typically, these energy \ndistribution infrastructures provide unidirectional\
    \ flows, from the generating station to the customers. \nThe amount of supplied\
    \ electricity is estimated or predicted, through previous available data, in order\
    \ \nto perform load shedding for instances where the demand exceeds the supply.\
    \ \nAn improvement to the conventional distribution scheme is a bi-directional\
    \ system, in the sense that \nelectricity flows from the utility to the client’s\
    \ premises and vice versa. A more efficient use of energy \nis then possible,\
    \ whereby electricity can flow back to the utility (to be stored for later use)\
    \ in cases of \nlow demand. These systems are collectively known as smart grids.\
    \ The concept of distributed \ngeneration enables a scenario where, instead of\
    \ having a centralized generation scheme, additional \nelectricity generation\
    \ points can be located closer to customers, therefore reducing the impact of\
    \ losses \non electricity transportation over long distances. Additionally, this\
    \ enables more innovative demand \nresponse programs to be put into action. \n\
    In contrast to conventional power grids, smart grids introduce many improvements.\
    \ Firstly, smart \ngrids have self-monitoring capabilities [48], where sensors\
    \ can be deployed anywhere along the \ndistribution network, in locations such\
    \ as substations or overhead transmission lines, for instance. \nSensor data can\
    \ then be used to report relevant events (in terms of performance and reliability)\
    \ back to \nappropriate entities. An important sensing application in smart grid,\
    \ amongst others, is the monitoring \nof overhead transmission lines. By monitoring\
    \ the lines, utilities ensure that power delivery occurs \nwithin safe limits.\
    \ For instance, systems like STAMP [49] sense the temperature, sag and tension\
    \ \nvalues of an overhead line in real time and determine the state, or health,\
    \ of the line from these \nmeasurements (illustrated in Figure 6). STAMP achieves\
    \ this using a distributed temperature system \n(DTS) and thermocouples for temperature\
    \ measurements, a laser range finder to detect sag and ground \nclearance, and\
    \ two load cells to monitor tension. These parameters have to be carefully monitored\
    \ to \nensure that the conductor is operating at its ampacity rating, which is\
    \ dependent on temperature. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n406 \n \n \nFigure 6. Location\
    \ of current sensors in a transmission line to monitor the line’s state. \n \n\
    Furthermore, parameters such as voltage, current and phase can be determined through\
    \ voltage and \ncurrent sensors, such as medium voltage (MV) sensors [50], placed\
    \ directly on the transmission lines, \nor non-intrusive sensors, which measure\
    \ magnetic field variations. An example of a stick-on, low-cost \nsensor for such\
    \ purposes is proposed in [51], which can be readily deployed in transformers\
    \ and \noverhead conductors. \n5.3. Smart Buildings and Homes \nIn an effort to\
    \ promote green living and sustainability, there are various initiatives to decrease\
    \ \nenergy consumption in buildings. In this context, methods to significantly\
    \ reduce energy consumption \nin buildings are various, from intelligent systems\
    \ to smart design. These are necessary because \nbuildings (especially with the\
    \ easy accessibility to inexpensive electrical appliances or other electronic\
    \ \ndevices such as computers, etc.) consume a very large portion of generated\
    \ electricity. In particular, \nheat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)\
    \ constitutes the largest contributors to increased \nconsumption. Hence, sensing\
    \ is crucial in buildings for appropriate actions to reduce consumption can \n\
    take place. For building automation systems, for instance, before an appropriate\
    \ action can take place \n(which could be dimming lights or switching of air conditioning)\
    \ the state of the environment has to be \nproperly assessed. At the heart of\
    \ household energy sensing are smart meters. Energy sensing \nmeasurements are\
    \ interfaced with a smart meter for accurate consumption reports. Sensing can\
    \ also aid \nin demand prediction. \n5.3.1. Approach to Energy Sensing \nAccurate\
    \ power usage measurement at the load side requires appropriate sensing. Additionally,\
    \ the \nexistence of a bi-directional grid enables the use of smart meters at\
    \ customer premises. Determining \nhow much power electrical appliances and electronic\
    \ devices are utilizing is crucial. To this end, \nsensors can be placed on these\
    \ electrical appliances for accurate measurements. \nThree different approaches\
    \ for energy sensing at the customer’s premises are: distributed direct \nsensing,\
    \ single point sensing and intermediate sensing [52]. With distributed sensing,\
    \ a sensor is placed \non each appliance, which means that although measurements\
    \ will be more accurate, it is an expensive \napproach due to installation and\
    \ maintenance costs. Single-point sensing, in contrast to distributed \nSensors\
    \ 2013, 13 \n407 \n \n \nsensing, measures voltage and current entering a household.\
    \ Although not as accurate as distributed \nsensing, it lowers costs significantly.\
    \ By monitoring raw current and voltage waveforms, and \nsubsequently performing\
    \ feature extraction on these measurements, a classification algorithm can be\
    \ \nused to determine which appliances are on or off, by comparing the measurements\
    \ to existing device \nsignatures. Intermediate sensing falls between direct and\
    \ single-point sensing. For intermediate \nsensing, smart breaker devices are\
    \ installed in a household’s circuit panel to provide a more detailed \nanalysis\
    \ of consumption. Other sensing approaches described in [52] are based on voltage\
    \ signatures, \nwhere voltage noise signatures or current signatures are used\
    \ to classify operation of electrical \nappliances, by observing the spectral\
    \ envelope of the harmonics and comparing these observations to \nexisting templates.\
    \  \n5.3.2. Correlation between Demand Prediction and Weather Conditions  \nThe\
    \ concept of Smart World as an interconnection of smart infrastructures is introduced\
    \ in [53]. \nThis concept includes sensing a range of parameters describing the\
    \ earth’s state, such as environmental \npressure, temperature, radiation and\
    \ similar parameters which can be exploited by the global \ncommunity to improve\
    \ the efficiency of services provided to the community. \nFor instance, accurate\
    \ demand prediction is necessary to avoid rolling blackouts or similar measures\
    \ \nwhen demand exceeds supply. With regard to demand prediction, the correlation\
    \ between weather \n(which is typically characterized by temperature, pressure,\
    \ humidity and wind speed and direction) and \ndemand, or human behavior, is of\
    \ particular interest. In [53], the effect of weather on electricity \nconsumption\
    \ is investigated. It is found that the highest correlation weather variables\
    \ with power \nconsumption are temperature, global solar radiation and humidity\
    \ [53], for different times of the day \nand seasons. The work in [53] specifically\
    \ focuses on smaller areas, such as micro-grids. This is \ncorrelated with the\
    \ usage of appliances, as heaters, geysers and air conditioners tend to comprise\
    \ a \nlarge percentage of a house’s electricity consumption, and the use of these\
    \ appliances is correlated \nwith seasons. By using environmental data and intelligent\
    \ agents to help predict load, it is possible to \nachieve greatly improved demand\
    \ prediction. \n5.3.3. Occupancy and User Context \nThe most basic action when\
    \ it comes to occupancy is to determine whether there are people in a \nroom or\
    \ not. Typically, this can be achieved through a combination of sensors, as shown\
    \ in [54]. These \nsensors include passive-infrared (PIR) sensors [54] or more\
    \ sophisticated camera based methods such \nas the methods shown on [55], where\
    \ people can be actively counted to determine occupancy numbers \nand locations.\
    \ PIR detectors are used in home alarm systems for motion detection (i.e., to\
    \ detect \nwhether there is a person in a room). Apart from occupancy, another\
    \ important feature is the user \ncontext, as highlighted in [56]. This can be\
    \ achieved by behavior activity classification using video \ncameras for instance,\
    \ as shown in [57]. The data from these sources enables an appropriate plan of\
    \ \naction with regards to the people in the room. For instance, lights in corridors,\
    \ elevators, and or other \nfacilities can be dimmed if there is no human activity,\
    \ hence reducing the overall energy consumption. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n408 \n \n\
    \ \n5.3.4. Indoor Monitoring \nOf interest are also the buildings’ ambient temperature\
    \ and ambient lighting. For instance, with \nlight emitting diodes (LEDs) lamps,\
    \ the intensity can be reduced in cases where ambient light, from \nopen windows\
    \ for instance, is sufficient. These windows are made of tintable material which\
    \ reacts to \nchanges in the environment [58], and can reflect or absorb light,\
    \ depending on an external electrical \nstimulus. This is a simple example of\
    \ how energy consumption can be reduced by smart design. \nIndoor temperature\
    \ can also be monitored so that parameters in the HVAC system can be adjusted\
    \ \nto meet specified temperatures, described by predefined set-points. For these\
    \ purposes, humidity and \ntemperature are deployed in strategic positions to\
    \ collect the required data for actuation. \nThe smart thermostat proposed in\
    \ [59] is an example of a combination of sensors and actuators in \nthe smart\
    \ building context. The thermostat is coupled with motion sensors to detect occupancy\
    \ and \nthen creates an optimal setback schedule based on this collected data\
    \ for autonomous operation. \nIn [60] a ZigBee based HVAC control system is described\
    \ for ensuring an adequate comfort level in \nbuildings, using machine learning\
    \ techniques. Sensor nodes are equipped with temperature and \nhumidity sensors,\
    \ from which data is collected at one-minute intervals and sent to a logging system.\
    \ \nThis data is clustered and matched to user feedback, where users can indicate\
    \ their current comfort \nlevel. In the control phase, the control system and\
    \ clusters classified as uncomfortable can be moved to \nthe closest comfortable\
    \ cluster. \nApart from monitoring and controlling HVAC systems, it is also necessary\
    \ to monitor electrical \nappliances, to detect any faults and to be able to assess\
    \ current operating status remotely, and having \nthe appliances wirelessly connected\
    \ to each other in a home area network (HAN). Furthermore, these \nsystems can\
    \ be connected to social networks to share notifications, enabling remote monitoring.\
    \ An \nexample of such a system is described in [61]. All appliances have a set\
    \ of sensors (to measure \nhumidity, temperature or pressure) mounted on them,\
    \ which are connected to a local sensor host \n(LSH), and are equipped with 802.3\
    \ u and 802.11 g interfaces, so that these nodes can be connected to \nan available\
    \ wired or wireless network, which is connected to the Internet. Each appliance\
    \ is fitted \nwith a specific set of sensor types. For instance, a refrigerator\
    \ can be fitted with pressure and acoustic \nsensors on each tray to determine\
    \ the quantity of food. Examples of notifications from appliances \ninclude warnings\
    \ from washing machines upon completion of a washing cycle. \n5.3.5. Smart Building\
    \ Evacuation \nAnother aspect of smart buildings is smart evacuation systems.\
    \ Conventional evacuation systems \nactivate an alarm when an alert for an emergency\
    \ situation is triggered. This model assumes that \npeople within the building\
    \ are aware of the routes to exit the building. A more efficient way to perform\
    \ \nbuilding evacuation is to count the number of people and direct them through\
    \ the quickest routes by \nconsidering congestion information, obtainable from\
    \ a variety of sensors, such as beam sensors or \nvideo cameras. Examples of such\
    \ WSNs are described in [62] and [63], using beam sensors and \ndetection of tags\
    \ worn by the people in the building, respectively. Although not as accurate,\
    \ these \nmethods are preferable to video camera based methods, from a processing\
    \ cost perspective. Instead of \nusing these systems stand-alone, they can be\
    \ interfaced to the building’s infrastructure, to obtain an \nSensors 2013, 13\
    \ \n409 \n \n \nestimate of the number of people through existing occupancy and\
    \ user context functionality, typically \nbased on motion sensors or video cameras,\
    \ if available. \n5.4. Monitoring Bridges and Seismic Activity \nAll public infrastructures\
    \ have to be monitored to assess their condition. Even if these \ninfrastructures\
    \ are monitored by personnel through scheduled visits, a visual inspection is\
    \ often not \nsufficient, as anomalies may still go undetected. A more efficient\
    \ approach to monitoring is to install a \nvariety of sensors across the structure\
    \ to continuously monitor its state and determine its health. \nThere are a variety\
    \ of parameters which characterize a structure’s state. In [64], the most common\
    \ \nparameters for monitoring of structures are listed as chemical (pH, oxidation,\
    \ and corrosion), \nmechanical (strain, stress and deformation) and physical (temperature\
    \ and humidity). A variety of \nsensors capable of measuring these parameters\
    \ can be deployed in large numbers across a structure for \naccurate monitoring,\
    \ but these can incur a significantly high cost. Recently, fiber optic sensing\
    \ (FOS) \nhas received substantial attention from the research community. \nRecent\
    \ approaches for SHM include using sophisticated fiber optic sensors [65]. In\
    \ bridges, for \ndamage detection, optic fiber sensors can be used for structure\
    \ monitoring. An optic fiber sensor works \nby detecting the change in the detected\
    \ signal from a transmitted signal, after it has passed through the \nstructure\
    \ of interest, and is able to measure strain, pressure and temperature, by interpreting\
    \ changes in \nwavelength. This typically requires the installation of fiber into\
    \ the structure to be monitored. These \ndistributed sensors work on the basis\
    \ of back-scattering. As light propagates through the fiber, some of \nit is scattered\
    \ back along the length of the fiber. Since the properties of the back-scattered\
    \ light depend \non the strain, deformation or temperature of the fiber, by using\
    \ this information one can determine the \nstate of the structure where the fiber\
    \ is installed. A fiber distributed sensor is equivalent to having a \nlarge number\
    \ of sensors deployed along a line with high resolution, since all points along\
    \ the fiber can \nbe considered sensing points, as described in [66]. Other approaches\
    \ to sensing for SHM use WSNs \nwith sensor nodes equipped with multiple accelerometers\
    \ to sense vibration along a 1,300 m long \nbridge [67]. The appeal of these systems\
    \ is the relatively low cost and ease of installation in \ncomparison to more\
    \ sophisticated sensing solutions. These sensors were deployed over the main span\
    \ \nand tower, and collected information of structural accelerations from wind\
    \ load. Additional approaches \ninclude the use of thermal responses and combination\
    \ of multiple sensors such as strain gauges,  \nstrain-gage displacement and force\
    \ sensors, as well as non-intrusive sensing methods using video \ncameras [68].\
    \ These computer vision based systems can be used for instance for structural\
    \ crack \ndetection [69]. \nAnother important application of sensor networks in\
    \ smart cities is monitoring the ground to detect \nany anomalies. These allow\
    \ early detection of earthquakes or landslides, which can be used for early \n\
    warnings in emergency situations. In [70] a wireless sensor network is suggested\
    \ to monitor sub-soil \nactivity. Sensor nodes are buried underground. In contrast\
    \ to other monitoring techniques, which rely \non sensors attached to the sensor\
    \ node, the technique proposed in [70] relies on how the propagation \nsignal\
    \ is affected by soil conditions. By considering changes in the received signal\
    \ strength (RSS), it is \npossible to infer events based on how each soil parameter\
    \ affects the signal. In particular, water \nintrusion, detection of relative\
    \ motion and relative density change can be detected using this technique. \n\
    Sensors 2013, 13 \n410 \n \n \n5.5. Environmental Monitoring \nTo ensure quality\
    \ of life, as well as safety, environmental monitoring is of utmost importance.\
    \ By \nmonitoring the quality of air, quality of water, and other parameters such\
    \ as humidity, temperature and \nambient carbon dioxide level, as well as other\
    \ harmful gases, it is possible to assess anomalies in the \nenvironment; therefore\
    \ ensuring pollution is kept to an acceptable level. In particular, reducing the\
    \ \nlevel of carbon emissions, which is a serious threat to our planet is one\
    \ of the main goals of smart \ncities. Environmental monitoring requires deploying\
    \ a variety of sensors outdoors, in locations such as \nparks and rivers, etc.\
    \ With the proliferation of smartphones, it is possible to use them for collaborative\
    \ \nenvironment monitoring. Furthermore, it is necessary to better understand\
    \ how human behavior is \ninfluenced by weather conditions, with regards to mobility\
    \ and other aspects. \nIn [71], the relationship between human behavior and weather\
    \ is studied, in an attempt to gain a \nbetter understanding of the dynamics of\
    \ an urban system. Data characterizing air quality and weather \nwas collected\
    \ from environmental monitoring stations and analyzed in conjunction with network\
    \ \nmobile traffic data generated during a period of 20 days. It was demonstrated\
    \ that by combining data \nfrom different ubiquitous sensing sources (environmental\
    \ data and mobile traffic data), it is possible to \nanalyze environmental and\
    \ social dynamics, which can be used to improve on a lot of aspects in the \n\
    context of smart cities, such as public transportation and other services. \n\
    5.6. Intelligent Transportation Systems \nWith the steep increase in car numbers\
    \ over recent years, there is an increasing need for efficient \ntraffic management,\
    \ to avoid traffic jams and optimize traffic flow, especially at intersections.\
    \ A \nconventional way to regulate traffic flow is through the use of traffic\
    \ lights. These typically have fixed \nswitch interval times (i.e., from red to\
    \ green and to yellow), which are not adjustable to traffic \nconditions. Traffic\
    \ jams have significant impacts on fuel consumption due to the frequent starts\
    \ and \nstops, as well as increased carbon emissions. An adaptive scheme, dependent\
    \ on traffic conditions, is \nmore attractive. In this context, a method to estimate\
    \ the number of cars approaching an intersection \ncould generate information\
    \ for switch interval times to be dynamically adjusted based on traffic \nconditions.\
    \ For such an intelligent system to be realized, efficient methods to detect traffic\
    \ (i.e., count \nthe number of cars) are required. Approaches where traffic lights\
    \ and stop signs are completely \nremoved have also been proposed, as described\
    \ in [72]. Such an approach is based on an intelligent \nintersection where vehicles,\
    \ which are wirelessly connected to each other, can communicate with each \nother\
    \ and use decision-making for collision avoidance. Using a time-slot for each\
    \ vehicle, crossing of \nintersections is coordinated amongst vehicles [73]. A\
    \ vehicle which misses its time-slot has to stop \nwhen it reaches the intersection\
    \ and wait for a new time-slot. The wireless communication can be \nperformed\
    \ through RFID, as proposed in [74]. In [74] a system to control a vehicle’s speed\
    \ \nautonomously based on the traffic signs is described. RFID was used for communication\
    \ between the \nvehicle and traffic signs, with RFID tags placed on traffic signs\
    \ and RFID readers placed on the side of \nthe doors of the car, and a Hall Effect\
    \ sensor placed on the vehicle’s wheels for speed control. \nInexpensive methods\
    \ of sensing cars involve induction loop detectors which are buried in roads.\
    \ \nLoops detectors can be used to detect the presence of metals. When a vehicle\
    \ approaches the loop, the \nSensors 2013, 13 \n411 \n \n \nloop’s resonant frequency\
    \ increases, and this change in frequency is interpreted as a vehicle. The \n\
    increase in frequency differs according to car size (or height), enabling an estimate\
    \ of the kind of car \nwhich has been sensed. This information can then be used\
    \ to estimate vehicle speed or other \nparameters, which can be useful for traffic\
    \ flow management. To estimate a vehicle’s weight, other \nmethods such as weight\
    \ in motion (WIM) can be used. A WIM system captures vehicle gross and axle \n\
    weights using sensor mats on road surfaces. Various types of WIM systems are discussed\
    \ in [75]: \npiezoelectric systems (which detect changes in voltage due to pressure);\
    \ capacitive mats (two inductive \nloops and one capacitive weight sensor); bending\
    \ plates (which record the strain on the plate due to the \ndynamic load of the\
    \ vehicle); load cells (which use a single load cell with two scales for each\
    \ side of \nthe vehicle’s axle); and optical WIM (where pressure on the optical\
    \ fiber creates a phase shift in \npolarization modes which is directly related\
    \ to the load on the fiber). All methods highlighted above \nusually carry significant\
    \ installation and maintenance costs. A WIM system is illustrated in Figure 7.\
    \ \nLess intrusive (but not as accurate) and more sophisticated methods involve\
    \ video cameras. These \napproaches are more attractive mainly because cameras\
    \ can be easily installed and the level of required \nmaintenance is low, compared\
    \ to previously described approaches. Furthermore, in instances where \nthere\
    \ are surveillance cameras installed, these can be used for intelligent transportation\
    \ applications. A \nwireless real-time traffic monitoring system is proposed in\
    \ [76]. The system consists of multiple \nstandard CCTV cameras and personal computers\
    \ (PCs), which process the captured data from the \ncameras. Each camera is controlled\
    \ by the PCs, and each PC implements all the necessary algorithms \nfor recognition\
    \ and tracking. \nThe system was tested in different environments, such as airports\
    \ and tunnels. One of the \ndrawbacks of computer vision-based methods is their\
    \ performance dependency on environment \nconditions, such as lighting and occlusions.\
    \ Dealing with occlusions or weather conditions is \nchallenging in computer vision,\
    \ so such scenarios have to be handled with care. For instance, in the \npresence\
    \ of fog or rain, vehicle detection or counting is more challenging. For night-time\
    \ scenarios, \nstreet lamps and vehicle lights also have to be considered [77].\
    \ In particular, street lamps, traffic lights \ncan be used for vehicle sensing,\
    \ as vehicles can be detected by considering the distance between \nvehicle’s\
    \ headlights. \nFigure 7. Weight in motion system. Weight information recorded\
    \ by the weight detectors \nis sent to the controller via wired connectors, such\
    \ as a fiber optic cable, for storage  \nand processing. \n \nSensors 2013, 13\
    \ \n412 \n \n \n5.7. Surveillance \nWith the availably of conventional CCTV systems\
    \ for surveillance purposes, an infrastructure for \nsmart surveillance systems\
    \ already exists. Security, especially in urban areas, is of paramount \nimportance.\
    \ Although these cameras are typically connected to a digital video recorder (DVR),\
    \ most \nonly record and do not have any built-in intelligent processing capabilities.\
    \ Furthermore, these systems \nare run by human operators who are prone to loss\
    \ of concentration. The benefits of using smart \nsurveillance are obvious. For\
    \ instance, by monitoring peoples’ actions, it is possible to determine \nwhether\
    \ violent actions are taking place, and even trying to identify and recognize\
    \ the people involved. \nIn this context, smart surveillance systems could alert\
    \ users by triggering alerts when events of \ninterest take place. Additionally,\
    \ monitoring people’s behavior can help in determining pedestrian \ntraffic patterns\
    \ which can be of help in the design of future pedestrian facilities or modification\
    \ of \ncurrent facilities. \nIn the instance of gatherings, it is important to\
    \ have crowd control schemes in place, especially in \ncases where there are large\
    \ numbers of people, such as in concerts, or other public areas such as \nairports.\
    \ This is especially relevant in emergency management systems or pedestrian crowd\
    \ \nmonitoring, especially at night-time. To track and detect pedestrians at night,\
    \ an infrared video can be \nused [78], as infrared cameras work on the basis\
    \ of temperature and not on reflected light, hence \ninfrared based computer vision\
    \ techniques are less susceptible to lighting. \nAnother important aspect of crowd\
    \ surveillance, especially in security applications, is to determine \nwhether\
    \ people are carrying any objects, such as suitcases, etc. This allows determining\
    \ whether a \nperson, for instance, is entering a restricted area while carrying\
    \ an object which they are not allowed \ncarrying in specific facilities. A framework\
    \ to detect objects carried by people from video sequences is \npresented in [79].\
    \ This method works by considering irregularities in a person’s silhouette. This\
    \ is \nperformed by comparing a template of an individual walking in the same\
    \ direction as the individual \nbeing observed, with any protrusions noticed considered\
    \ as possible pixels for carrying objects. \nAnother important aspect of crowd\
    \ control is determining violent behavior. Monitoring of fights, \nriots and similar\
    \ events is important for safety reasons. A crowd behavior classification algorithm\
    \ is \nproposed in [80]. \nA semantic video surveillance system able to autonomously\
    \ detect abnormal situations, able to run \non low resolution (320 × 240) cameras\
    \ is described in [81]. The system’s cameras run motion \ndetection algorithms\
    \ with are used to extract information from the video and format it in XML, \n\
    aggregating several frames, which are then used to perform route detection, which\
    \ consists of \nextracting information of objects which enter or exit the scene.\
    \ Finally, a semantic reasoning module is \nused to classify the semantic data\
    \ obtained from semantic translation to determine whether there are \nanomalies\
    \ such as cars driving on the sidewalks or similar situations which could indicate\
    \ abnormal \nsituations. This system can be used to detect pedestrians crossing\
    \ streets without using crosswalks or \nwalking on railways and vehicles going\
    \ in the wrong direction. Hence, this system can be deployed in \ndifferent scenarios\
    \ only changing its rules’ set to fit that specific environment. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n413 \n \n \n5.8. Public Services—Law Enforcement and Fire Fighting \nThe\
    \ conventional law enforcement model is impractical and inefficient. Investigations\
    \ and other \nprocesses within law enforcement are aggravated by human incompetency\
    \ and lack of automation in \nprocesses. For law enforcement, IBM has solutions\
    \ within the Smarter Planet initiative, integrating \ninvestigations, geographic\
    \ information systems (GIS) and intelligence analysis [82], enabling \ninformation\
    \ sharing across agencies, resulting in a more efficient and more coordinated\
    \ law \nenforcement scheme. Another public service that can be improved by use\
    \ of technology is  \nfire-fighting. Fire fighters risk their lives in the line\
    \ of duty, due to the harsh conditions in which they \nhave to carry out their\
    \ work. \nConventional fire-fighting can also be improved, as shown in [83]. This\
    \ system consists of a TelosB \nbased wireless sensor network, where the nodes\
    \ are placed on firefighters’ bodies. Each TelosB mote \nis equipped with sensors\
    \ to measure temperature, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen and hydrocarbon \nconcentration.\
    \ Using RSSI based localization, firefighters are aware of their position relative\
    \ to other \nfighters within the network. This also enables computation of escape\
    \ paths, so that firefighters can exit \nthe work location safely. \n5.9. Health\
    \ Care \nOne of the most important applications of sensor networks is in healthcare.\
    \ To facilitate \nmanagement in hospitals or clinics, sensors can be used in these\
    \ environments for various applications. \nIn particular, wireless body area networks\
    \ (WBANs), is a very active research field. Body area \nnetworks consist of inter-connected\
    \ sensors placed in different parts of the human body. Hence, with \nsensors attached\
    \ to one’s body, either internally or externally, it is possible to monitor an\
    \ individual’s \nvital signs remotely. Examples of parameters which can be monitored\
    \ include electrocardiography \n(ECG), respiration, skin conductance and skin\
    \ temperature [84]. The advantage of WBANs is their \ncapability to upload this\
    \ data to remote logging systems so that the collected data can be viewed by a\
    \ \nmedical practitioner in real-time. Individuals with heart problems, for instance,\
    \ can be constantly \nmonitored and alerted if there are signs of an anomaly.\
    \ Activity monitoring and classification, which is \nuseful in health monitoring,\
    \ can also be performed by WBANs. But healthcare applications using \nsensing\
    \ technology are not limited to WBANs. \nOther examples of sensing applications\
    \ in healthcare involve emergency response [85]. In [85], a \nprotocol for emergency\
    \ reporting using cognitive wireless sensor networks is proposed. This protocol\
    \ \nis modeled after ants’ behavior and is used to coordinate cluster-heads actions\
    \ more efficiently, which \nresults in a decrease in reporting time delays. \n\
    A framework for long-term activity monitoring is proposed in [86]. The system\
    \ is able to recognize \nuser activity in real time and classifying activities,\
    \ using an array of sensors deployed in the home \nenvironment and attached to\
    \ doors, refrigerators and cupboards, as well as light sensors. From activity\
    \ \nclassification, it is possible to infer whether the person has a certain disease\
    \ or not. For instance, if \nfrequent sleep is detected, it is possibly due to\
    \ fatigue, which could indicate that an individual has \ndiabetes, for instance.\
    \ This framework can be used for disease prediction based on day-to-day activities.\
    \ \nSensors 2013, 13 \n414 \n \n \nA user-context recognition system is presented\
    \ in [87]. It uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to \nassess users’ stress levels.\
    \ Users insert their stress levels into a questionnaire through a smartphone \n\
    application. The entered data is matched to smartphone’s context data, such as\
    \ location and activity \ninformation, which is then used for HMM training. Stress\
    \ levels can then be classified after the \ntraining phase. \n5.10. Crowd Sourcing\
    \ \nCrowd sourcing consists of outsourcing tasks to a group of people, or crowd,\
    \ in an attempt to \ncollaboratively completing tasks quickly. The smart city\
    \ not only consists of smart infrastructure and \nsustainability: smart people\
    \ are also an integral part of the smart city. With the recent proliferation of\
    \ \nsocial platforms and mobile computing, crowd sourcing becomes a viable medium\
    \ for exchange of \nskills and services. Workflows, in crowd sourcing, consist\
    \ of tasks which have been unified. For crowd \nsourcing to be effectively carried\
    \ out, workflow processes have to be designed so that jobs can be \nbroken into\
    \ tasks and efficiently dispatched to human actors, and these workflow processes\
    \ have to be \nideally integrated into social platforms. To this end, various\
    \ tools have been developed. In [88], a \ncollaborative workflow tool for Amazon\
    \ Mechanical Turk is described. It allows requesters to view \ntasks’ current\
    \ status and reduces required planning by requesters. CrowdScape [89] attempts\
    \ to include \nuser behavior into the crowd sourcing process, in an attempt to\
    \ improve work efficiency. User \nbehavior whilst completing a task is considered\
    \ in conjunction with worker outputs, using machine \nlearning. Actions considered\
    \ to characterize user’s behavior include frequency of mouse click events, \n\
    key presses and scrolls. By correlating the user behavior with good work outputs,\
    \ it is possible to \nidentify traits of good workers, helping make crowd sourcing\
    \ task assignments more efficient. \nWith smartphones becoming increasingly more\
    \ powerful in terms of resources, crowd sourcing \nusing smartphones phones has\
    \ been thoroughly investigated. For instance, as users regularly update \ntheir\
    \ location status on social networks like Twitter and Facebook, based on this\
    \ location information, \nit is possible to aggregate this data, enabling tasks\
    \ to be dispatched to people in specific locations. \nFurthermore, by using sensor\
    \ data on a smartphone, it is possible to determine a person’s state (i.e., \n\
    whether the user is stationary or not), as well as environment. This data can\
    \ be collaboratively used to \nobtain information regarding the weather with location\
    \ information [90]. \nGiven the number of smartphones users in the world, this\
    \ enables pervasive sensing. With \nsmartphones fitted with a variety of sensors\
    \ such as GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses, \nsmartphones enable\
    \ a variety of crowd sourcing applications, which will be eventually augmented\
    \ by \nthe Internet of Things. In particular, collaborative data collection is\
    \ a popular crowd sourcing application.  \nExamples include MobSens [91], which\
    \ combines four applications: PollutionSpy to monitor air \npollution; NoiseSpy\
    \ which captures noise levels; MobAsthma, a personalized asthma monitoring \n\
    application; and Fresh, an application which provides a platform to let users\
    \ discuss issues regarding \ntheir environment. \nAlthough crowd sourcing is typically\
    \ outsourcing work tasks to people, crowd sourcing can also be \nused for sensing,\
    \ as described in [92]. Crowd reporting, as described in [92], consists of collecting\
    \ \ninformation from sources such as mobile devices and social networks. The data\
    \ reported can be in the \nform of messages which are aggregated and converted\
    \ into a uniform format, for processing. The data \nSensors 2013, 13 \n415 \n\
    \ \n \nis collected from Twitter as using a set of keywords to select relevant\
    \ information. This data is then \npre-processed, filtered and clustered so that\
    \ event correlation can be determined. \nAlthough sensing through crowd sourcing\
    \ (i.e., pervasive sensing) is appealing to a number of \npromising applications,\
    \ there are still a number of challenges, which are not necessarily of a  \ntechnical\
    \ nature. Privacy, in particular, is possibly the biggest challenge. Additionally,\
    \ involving the \nnot-so-evident risks related to large-scale data collection\
    \ as well as legal issues such as data ownership, \nuser protection [93] and trust\
    \ needs to be insured as entities responsible for analyzing the collected \ndata,\
    \ can abuse the collected information or use it to harm the user. \n5.11. Summary\
    \ of Benefits of Smart Sensing \nFrom the content presented in this section, it\
    \ is evident that advanced sensing applications in cities \nenable improvement\

    \ \nThe concept of a smart city as a system that is highly intelligent and autonomous\
    \ is far from being \nrealized. Even with recent breakthroughs in technology,\
    \ available technology is still not sufficiently \nmature for smart cities to\
    \ be truly autonomous. Nevertheless, there are currently pilot projects of smart\
    \ \ncities in development worth mentioning. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n416 \n \n \n\
    Development for Songdo [94], a fully ubiquitous 1,500 acre city in South Korea,\
    \ started in 2001 \nand is predicted to be complete by 2015. Smart systems in\
    \ every building are used to monitor the water \nand electricity, which also allow\
    \ residents to connect remotely using their smartphones. Sensing \ntechnologies\
    \ include RFID tags on vehicles, which send signals to sensors on the road to\
    \ monitor \ntraffic flow, surveillance systems as well as smart street lights,\
    \ which can be adjusted to pedestrian \ntraffic. Some of the innovative technologies\
    \ in Songdo [95] include home and building automation \nwhere users will be able\
    \ to control the systems in their houses remotely. Ubiquitous sensors are \ndeployed\
    \ virtually everywhere, from buildings, (for safety purposes, for fire, etc.)\
    \ to flow sensors, \nwhich control the canal in Songdo’s Central Park, and on\
    \ street lights to adjust the level of  \nlighting according to the pedestrians’\
    \ flow. Smart power in Songdo is generated by natural gas and \ndistributed through\
    \ a smart grid. Tele-presence facilities are being installed in homes, hospitals\
    \ and \nshopping centers. \nPlanIT Valley [96] in Northern Portugal is another\
    \ pilot project for a fully ubiquitous city built from \nthe ground up, which\
    \ will accommodate 225,000 residents once it is completed. Completion is \nscheduled\
    \ for 2015. Ultimately, PlanIT has a goal of having 100,000,000 sensors deployed.\
    \ \nFujisawa Sustainable Smart Town (SST) [97] in Japan is also another project\
    \ which is currently \nunder development. Fujisawa is scheduled to be completed\
    \ by 2014 and fully inhabited by 2018, and \ndevelopment has started in September\
    \ 2012. It is being developed on 19 ha of land, with the goal of \naccommodating\
    \ 1,000 residents. Targets of 70% reduction of carbon emission are planned. \n\
    Amsterdam, unlike the previously mentioned fully ubiquitous cities which are being\
    \ built from \nscratch, has seen some recent developments en route to make it\
    \ a smart city. The main driver of this \ndevelopment is Amsterdam Smart City\
    \ project [98], which started in 2009, with the main goal of \nincreasing green\
    \ growth using technology. Currently, there are various initiatives within the\
    \ scope of \nAmsterdam Smart City; these services are tested in specific city\
    \ locations, such as IJburb. It includes \ninnovations such as West Orange (a\
    \ residential energy management system, which is able to let users \nknow about\
    \ their energy consumption on a per appliance basis) and a smart grid initiative\
    \ in Nieuw \nWest which services about 10,000 households. In Groningen, there\
    \ is a pilot project aiming to develop \na system which will use GPS data for\
    \ real time information of bus locations, readily available to users’ \nmobile\
    \ phones through a downloadable application [99]. \nThe city council of Norfolk\
    \ has also pilot projects which aim to make data services delivery to \ncitizens\
    \ more efficient, through the improvement of their data collection and data analysis,\
    \ to \nultimately gain improved customer insight [100]. This project also aims\
    \ to develop schemes of \ndelivering data to groups of users through localized\
    \ and personalized web services, based on users’ \ngeographical location. \nAnother\
    \ pilot project which has recently received significant attention is in Santander\
    \ [101]. This is \ncollaboration between academia and industry players which aims\
    \ to conduct IoT research in available \nlarge scale test-beds. Currently, various\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed in the city. A backbone provides the \narchitecture\
    \ necessary for all communication between these sensor nodes.  \nExamples of applications\
    \ enabled by sensor networks in Smart Santander include traffic \nmanagement,\
    \ irrigation optimization for parks and gardens, augmented reality and waste management.\
    \ \nEventually, it is envisaged that 12,000 sensors and actuators will be deployed\
    \ throughout the city by \n2013. Currently, there are approximately 2,000 nodes\
    \ deployed. Examples of implemented trial \nSensors 2013, 13 \n417 \n \n \napplications\
    \ include outdoor parking area management, real time monitoring of light, temperature\
    \ and \nenvironmental noise, as well as participatory sensing using sensors in\
    \ mobile phones. \nIn Barcelona, there are also important initiatives [102]. As\
    \ part of this initiative, for instance, \nsensors have been deployed in garbage\
    \ bins. Firstly, these allow remote monitoring of the content of \nbins, which\
    \ enable the development of an improved garbage collection system, therefore optimizing\
    \ \ngarbage collection services. Additionally, built-in sensors monitor the content\
    \ type in bins and smart \nhumidity sensors enable an automated intelligent water\
    \ use for public park irrigation. Panels \nstrategically placed announce free\
    \ parking places, saving residents’ time in locating parking spots. \nSensors\
    \ on streetlights detect presence and adjust the light intensity accordingly as\
    \ well. \nIn Malaga, another smart city initiative in Spain, smart city initiatives\
    \ aim to achieve a reduction of \nmore than 6,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually\
    \ [103]. To this end, Malaga has invested significantly \nin the city infrastructure,\
    \ including investments in a fiber optic network, municipal Wi-Fi networks and\
    \ \ngeographic information systems for the virtualization of urban indicators.\
    \ The current deployment \nincludes more than 17,000 deployed smart meters. \n\
    Vienna is another city with a number of initiatives from the smart city perspective.\
    \ The main \ninitiatives in Vienna deal primarily with energy efficiency, carbon\
    \ footprint reduction and climate \nprotection [104]. A large number of projects\
    \ are currently underway in Vienna. Table 4 summarizes \nthe goals of the cities\
    \ discussed in this section. \nTable 4. Current smart city pilot projects. \n\

    There are various challenges related to sensing in smart cities, both of a technical\
    \ and social nature. \nSome of these challenges are: \nAddressing and coordination\
    \ issues between sensor nodes: when nodes are deployed in \nmillions, how can\
    \ they be efficiently managed? Although 6LoWPAN enables IPv6 addressing \nsupport\
    \ on IEEE 802.15.4, efficient coordination (in terms of routing, for instance)\
    \ between \nsuch a high number of devices is a big challenge. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n418 \n \n \nSecurity: enabling technologies for sensing applications have\
    \ a number of issues which have  \nto be considered within the context of smart\
    \ cities. These networks will be prone to  \ncyber-terrorism and cyber-vandalism.\
    \ Some of these issues are highlighted in [105] and [106]. \nData ownership and\
    \ privacy: who will own the rights for all data collected by these sensing \n\
    applications? For instance, if the electricity utility has access to an individual’s\
    \ energy \nconsumption data, can that data be used without one’s consent? \nTrust:\
    \ can individuals trust the entities responsible for aggregating and storing their\
    \ data? For \ninstance, the Cloud can be considered a central information system\
    \ where access to data is \ntypically controlled by the company which owns the\
    \ infrastructure. Can these companies  \nbe trusted? \nSocial Issues: residents\
    \ have always been actively involved in a city. For instance, there are \ncollaborative\
    \ initiatives where people come together and help keeping the city clean by \n\
    promoting no littering, etc. Will smart cities (with all the automated processes\
    \ and sophisticated \ntechnology), create some sort of disconnect between the\
    \ people and the city? Then there is the \nissue of education as well. Is the\
    \ average person educated enough to use and understand all \nthese systems? \n\
    Centralized control: it is evident from the content of this paper that we are\
    \ moving towards a \ncentralized control scheme, where all services are being\
    \ progressively aggregated, to be \nmanaged by one huge central system. This translates\
    \ to complete control by the governing \nbodies, which can be used to illegally\
    \ track people or invade someone’s privacy. This is related \nto the trust and\
    \ privacy issues previously mentioned. \nCosts incurred in upgrading current cities:\
    \ how expensive will it be to upgrade current cities \nto make them smart cities?\
    \ As smart cities are heavily dependent on communication and other \ninfrastructures,\
    \ it will certainly be very expensive to update all the current systems. \nThe\
    \ reader is referred to [48], where the authors discuss the major technical challenges\
    \ of WSNs in \nsmart-grid applications. \n8. Conclusions \nIn this paper, the\
    \ role of advanced sensing in smart cities was discussed. An array of applications\
    \ in \nsmart cities which can benefit from advanced sensing were described. These\
    \ include infrastructure \nhealth monitoring, electricity and water distribution\
    \ systems, transportation systems and surveillance, \namongst others. The state\
    \ of the art in each of the considered applications is reviewed and inherent \n\
    challenges are highlighted. In a world where carbon emissions have to be reduced\
    \ for greener living \nand sustainability is promoted, there are a still a lot\
    \ of challenges to be resolved. \nIt is evident that the evolution of technology\
    \ will play a major role in advanced sensing, as the \nevolution of hardware required\
    \ for sensing applications will certainly be driven by these technological \n\
    advances. Even though there are pilot projects for smart cities, there are various\
    \ challenges. These \nchallenges require a holistic approach for solving, which\
    \ will involve multi-disciplinary collaborations. \nFor instance, standardization\
    \ efforts should consider all involved parties, such as municipalities, \nutilities\
    \ and other services providers so that unified solutions in terms of sensing and\
    \ communication \ninfrastructures are put in place. It will be inefficient to\
    \ have separate infrastructures (in terms of \nSensors 2013, 13 \n419 \n \n \n\
    sensing platforms), but it will also be challenging to unify these services under\
    \ a single infrastructure \n(i.e., have the same network on the water distribution\
    \ system as well as the electricity system). \nFurthermore, non-technical challenges\
    \ regarding social issues, like education, also need to be \nconsidered. In the\
    \ context of smart city, it is expected that people will have a certain level\
    \ of skill to \nunderstand these systems and be able to use them. For instance,\
    \ the innovative solution brought about \nby advances in sensing technologies,\
    \ such as improved demand prediction and smart metering, result \nin a more efficient\
    \ electricity distribution system, where the customer also plays a role, by adhering\
    \ to \nincentive programs. But to what extent does the customer want to be really\
    \ involved? Some \nindividuals might not even take advantage of such services.\
    \ These factors should be taken into \nconsideration before services are implemented.\
    \ \nAlthough there are already existing systems and initiatives for smart cities,\
    \ the infrastructure to \nimplement a fully ubiquitous city will be costly. Furthermore,\
    \ the cost of restructuring existing cities to \nfit the fully ubiquitous city\
    \ model will incur much higher costs. \nThe first pilot projects mentioned in\
    \ this paper will serve as a model for fully ubiquitous cities to be \nimplemented\
    \ in future, and will provide insights into additional challenges in the realization\
    \ of smart \ncities. Still, there are numerous challenges to be solved before\
    \ fully ubiquitous cities become a reality. \nAcknowledgment \nThe research was\

    Environmental Science & Technology Abstract Pursuit of sustainable development
    requires a systems approach to the design of industrial product and service systems.
    Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual
    development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range
    of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across
    the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate
    and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative
    is to design systems with inherent “resilience” by taking advantage of fundamental
    properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous
    work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements.
    For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity
    and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders
    as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design
    protocol is presented that involves the following steps:  identifying system function
    and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies,
    developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a
    practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration
    of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they
    are embedded. This publication is licensed under the terms of your institutional

    joseph@eco-nomics.com. Connected, distributed systems, from power grids to business
    firms to even entire economies, are both more fragile and more robust than populations
    of isolated entities. Duncan J. Watts ( 1) Overview ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To We
    live in a small world of ever-increasing connectivity, with both cooperation and
    conflict occurring on a global scale. Individuals, companies, and communities
    are linked through worldwide systems of communication, transportation, and commerce.
    Similarly, individual products and services are linked to the global value chains
    in which they are created, delivered, and used. This connectivity presents daunting
    challenges to the design and commercialization of new systems. Instead of focusing
    purely on the function and form of a product or service, design teams today must
    consider a broad range of system-level issues, including safety, security, manufacturability,
    serviceability, material and energy ef ficiency, end-of-life recovery, environmental
    emissions, and even long-term impacts upon quality of life for future generations
    ( 2). In the face of such complexity, traditional methods for analyzing costs,
    benefits, and risks can become overwhelm ing. Instead, it is helpful to delve
    more deeply into the fundamental properties of successful systems in the biologi
    cal, social, and commercial arenas. What do such systems have in common? They
    are complex, adaptive, and unpredictable. They exhibit self-organizing behavior
    that enables continuity in response to external stress. They can survive unexpected
    disruptions, although they can also fail catastrophically. Likewise, engineered
    systems cannot be designed to anticipate all future possibilities, as evidenced
    most recently by the Columbia shuttle disaster and the Northeast electrical power
    blackout of 2003. Nevertheless, engineered systems can be endowed with intrinsic
    characteristics that improve their robustness and adaptability. This paper considers
    how an industrial enterprise can work toward sustainability by adopting a fresh
    perspective based on systems thinking. The concept of “resilience”, borrowed from
    the field of ecology, enables sustainability to be viewed as an inherent system
    property rather than an abstract goal. Already, existing design practices have
    demonstrated many useful techniques for enhancing system resilience. Building
    on these insights, a generalized approach to sustainable systems design is presented,
    including explicit consideration of system boundary conditions and external impacts.
    Toward Sustainable Systems ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In industries ranging from
    resource extraction (e.g., petroleum, lumber) to conversion and processing (e.g.,
    chemicals, electric power) to consumer goods (e.g., packaged foods, electronics),
    shareholders and analysts have become sensitized to a company''s ecological and
    social “footprint”, including global issues such as climate change and poverty.
    Many leading corporations have adopted the concept of sustainable development
    ( 3), recognizing that environmental protection and social responsibility are
    important to both shareholders and other stakeholders ( 4). Yet, despite their
    heightened awareness and commitment, most companies have found it difficult to
    translate broad goals and policies into day-to-day decision-making. There are
    several barriers that limit the practical applica tion of sustainable development
    principles. For one thing, the notion of protecting future generations seems remote
    in the face of contemporary business pressures. The concept of “sustainability”
    is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of status quo rather
    than with opportunities for continued innovation, growth, and prosperity. In addition,
    the popular metaphor of the “triple bottom line” ( 5) seems to imply that economic
    profits need to be “balanced” against environmental and social benefits, whereas
    in truth these three aspects of corporate performance are inseparable and contribute
    synergistically to shareholder value ( 6). Finally, sustainability is often misinterpreted
    as a goal to which we should collectively aspire. In fact, sustain ability is
    not an end state that we can reach; rather, it is a characteristic of a dynamic,
    evolving system. And systems thinking offers a potential means to overcome the
    above barriers. Alternative definitions of sustainability abound, but for system
    design purposes the following definition is useful:  A product, process, or service
    contributes to sustainability if it constrains environmental resource consumption
    and waste generation to an acceptable ( 7) level, supports the satisfaction of
    important human needs, and provides enduring economic value to the business enterprise
    ( 8). Note that a product cannot be sustainable in an absolute sense; rather,
    it must be considered in the context of the supply chain, the market, and the
    natural environment. Therefore, the key practical challenge of sustainable design
    is to understand how products, processes, and services interact with these broader
    systems. As illustrated in Figure 1, full exploration of this question would extend
    beyond the enterprise, even beyond the conventional “product life cycle”, to the
    underlying economic flows as well as ecosystem services derived from “natural
    capital” ( 9). How, then, does one establish realistic boundaries for system design?
    Figure 1 Extending the boundaries of system design ( 8). The challenge of boundary
    definition is evident in a “sustainable mobility” study being conducted by an
    international group of automotive and energy companies working with the World
    Business Council for Sustainable Develop ment. Their goal is for humans to “move
    freely, gain access, communicate, trade and establish relationships without sacrificing
    other essential human or ecological values, today or in the future” ( 10). A key
    issue is how future transportation technologies and demand patterns will evolve,
    together with their supporting infrastructures (e.g., adoption of hydrogen fuel
    cells for automotive vehicles will require development of a new refueling network).
    The infrastructure question is especially challenging since it encompasses roads,
    railways, airports, intermodal freight terminals, and maintenance and guidance
    systems. Ultimately, the evolution of mobility systems will be influenced by urban
    and regional planning policies as well as competing supply chain management strategies.
    The vast scope of these interlocking systems is bewildering for any business enterprise
    seeking to develop a sustainable business strategy for mobility-related products
    and services. What Is a Sustainable Enterprise? ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To During
    the 1990s, Royal Dutch Shell conducted a historical study of corporations in an
    effort to understand what drives corporate longevity ( 11). They found that the
    average life expectancy of large corporations worldwide was less than 50 yearsin
    effect, most companies die prematurely. Furthermore, they identified four factors
    that distinguished long-lived companies: (i) sensitivity and adaptability to the
    business environment (ii) cohesion and sense of identity (iii) tolerance of diversity
    (decentralization) (iv) conservative use of capital Profitability was conspicuously
    absent from this list and was considered to be an outcome rather than a predictor
    of longevitymany companies have delivered spectacular profits for short periods
    of time and then vanished abruptly. From this study emerged the notion that the
    real purpose of a corporation is to learn, grow, and survive in the long run and
    that a corporation is best understood as a living organism rather than as a machine
    engineered to deliver profits. More recently, a decade-long study of 160 companies
    indicated that the main determinants of superior financial performance were not
    technology-based but rather were organic system traitsan achievement-oriented
    culture, a flexible and responsive structure, a clear and focused strategy, and
    flawless execution ( 12). Moreover, the enterprise system needs to encourage recognition
    that the future may not resemble the past since individuals often tend to cling
    to the familiar status quo ( 13). This organic view of the corporation is consistent
    with an emerging recognition by the business community of “intangible” value drivers.
    Company characteristics such as human capital, innovation, alliances, and brand
    equity are increasingly viewed as leading indicators of shareholder value ( 14).
    Moreover, paying attention to social and environmental performance strengthens
    many of these intangibles, including reputation, stakeholder relationships, employee
    pride, ef ficient technology, and license to operate. In short, an enterprise
    that contributes to sustainable development enhances its own sustainability as
    a business. Unfortunately, the term sustainability has become both ambiguous and
    laden with ethical connotations. The following definitions offer a logical framework
    of “nested” systems that may be helpful to system designers. (i) A sustainable
    society is one that continues to satisfy the current needs of its population without
    compromising quality of life for future generations. (ii) A sustainable enterprise
    is one that continues to grow and adapt in order to meet the needs and expectations
    of its shareholders and stakeholders. (The enterprise system is a component of
    the overall socio-economic system.) (iii) A sustainable product (or service) is
    one that continues, possibly with design modifications, to meet the needs of its
    producers, distributors, and customers. (The product system is a component of
    the overall enterprise system.) The above definitions imply that social responsibility
    is a characteristic of the enterprise, not of the product or service, and requires
    continuous adaptation to ensure transparency and responsiveness to the changing
    needs of stakeholders. Ecological integrity and quality of life, however, are
    often influenced by characteristics of a product or service and thus can be addressed
    through sustainable design principles. Finally, sustainable development, in the
    sense of addressing the needs of future generations, can only be addressed meaningfully
    at the level of a collective society. Individual products or enterprises cannot
    be deemed sustainable in isolation, although they can make important contributions
    to the fulfillment of specific human needs. Nor can corpora tions alone be held
    accountable for sustainable developmentsupply and demand are coupled. Achieving
    a sustainable society will require cooperative efforts among industry, government,
    and public interest groups to ensure not only sustainable production systems but
    also sustainable consumption patterns on the part of individuals and institutions
    ( 15). In effect, product/service systems are the offspring of corporations and
    acquire important characteristics from their “parents” including branding, technology,
    distribution chan nels, and stakeholder perception. Today, corporations are increasingly
    expected to disclose the origins of products, including raw materials, and the
    conditions under which they were manufactured. Do they employ forced labor or
    child labor? Do they utilize recycled material content or renewable energy? Were
    chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in the manufacturing process? Do they contain
    genetically engineered constituents? As we broaden the scope of product/service
    design, we inevitably begin to consider the higher-order characteristics of the
    systems in which they are embedded. Resilience and Sustainability ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To Systems theory is the study of how complex entities interact openly with their
    environments and evolve continually by acquiring new, “emergent” properties (
    16). Rather than reducing an entity (e.g., the human body) to the properties of
    its parts or elements (e.g., organs or cells), systems theory focuses on the relationships
    (e.g., feedback loops) between the parts that connect them into a whole. It turns
    out that many system properties are independent of the concrete substance of their
    elements (e.g. particles, cells, transistors, people). Complex systems are generally
    dynamic, nonlinear, and capable of self-organization to sustain their existence.
    For example, by pollinating flowers, bees create a feedback loop that reinforces
    the production of nectar. Similarly, by supporting social and philanthropic activities,
    corporations strengthen the vitality of the communities to which their employees
    belong. By the laws of thermodynamics, closed systems will gradually decay from
    order into chaos, tending toward maximum entropy. However, living systems are
    “open” in the sense that they continually draw upon external sources of energy
    and maintain a stable state of low entropy that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium
    ( 17). Perhaps the essence of sustainability is resilience, the ability to resist
    disorder ( 18). Figure 2 provides a simplified illustration of thermodynamic changes
    that characterize different types of resilience. Each system has a stable state
    representing the lowest potential energy at which it maintains order, and each
    is subject to perturbations that shift it along a trajectory of adjacent states.
    Figure 2 Examples of system behavior. (i) System a is typical of engineered, highly
    controlled systems. It operates within a narrow band of possible states and is
    designed to resist perturbations from its equilibrium state. It recovers rapidly
    from small perturbations, but it may not survive a large perturbation. We call
    this a resistant system. (ii) System b is typical of social and ecological systems.
    It can function across a broad spectrum of possible states and gradually tends
    to return to its equilibrium state. Through adaptation and evolution, it is capable
    of surviving large perturbations. We call this a resilient system. (iii) System
    c is even more resilient than system b in that it can tolerate larger perturbations.
    Under certain conditions it may shift to a different equilibrium state, representing
    a fundamental change in its structure and/or function. The contrast between resistant
    and resilient systems is exemplified by China and India, both sophisticated civiliza
    tions that have flourished for centuries. Whereas China has tended to resist foreign
    influences and preserve homogeneity of language and religion, India has accepted
    and integrated foreign influences into a diverse tapestry of religious and cultural
    variants. The concept of resilience and its applicability to ecological, social,
    and management systems has been investigated extensively by an international group
    of researchers led by two noted ecologists, Lance Gunderson and C. S. Holling.
    They have developed a general theory of adaptive cycles, arguing that all systems
    exhibit similar patterns of slow accumulation of resources, increasing connectedness,
    and decreasing resilience, punctuated by periods of crisis, transformation, and
    renewal ( 19). Based on an understanding of these patterns, humans may be able
    to intervene in appropriate ways that take advantage of the system dynamics rather
    than merely resisting change. Applying Resilience to System Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To The design of engineered systems, including both hardware and software, has
    been approached traditionally as a process of hierarchical decomposition (i.e.,
    the overall system func tion and architecture are developed first and then the
    systems and subsystems are designed accordingly). Complex, hierarchically organized
    systems (e.g., aircraft, nuclear plants) tend to have rigid operating parameters,
    are resistant to stress only within narrow boundaries, and may be vulnerable to
    small, unforeseen perturbations. Alternatively, distributed systems composed of
    independent yet interactive elements may deliver equivalent or better functionality
    with greater resilience. For example: (i) A collection of distributed electric
    generators (e.g., fuel cells) connected to a power grid may be more reliable and
    fault-tolerant than a central power station. (ii) A swarm of miniature unmanned
    surveillance drones may be less costly and more robust than a single conventional
    surveillance aircraft. (iii) A network of autonomous software agents operating
    asynchronously may be more effective and speedier than a monolithic software program.
    (iv) A geographically dispersed workforce linked by telecommunications may be
    less vulnerable to catastrophic events that could destroy a single facility. While
    such distributed systems may not always represent a superior solution, they typify
    a novel approach to systems engineering, sometimes called “biomimicry”, that more
    closely resembles the patterns seen in living systems ( 20). In addition to mimicking
    nature, system designers need to be aware of their impacts upon nature. It is
    often said that “nature is resilient”. Some argue that we should not impose unreasonable
    regulatory burdens upon industrial activities since we cannot predict their impacts
    upon complex ecosystems. Indeed, many regulatory restrictions are based on admittedly
    inadequate methodologies, such as the models used for extrapolating from laboratory
    studies to predict human cancer incidence due to chemical exposures. These models
    use “conservative” assumptions intended to overstate the true risk. In some cases,
    this precautionary approach may impose economic burdens that distort the economy.
    In other cases, the models fail to account for phenomena such as multi-pollutant
    synergies and may actually understate the risk. Similarly, the worldwide elimination
    of CFCs was undertaken without a clear understanding of the their impacts upon
    atmospheric ozone. Scientists may never be able to predict accurately the impacts
    of perturbations upon biological or ecological systems. The emergent properties
    of open systems give them the capacity to tolerate perturbations and to evolve
    into new, unimagined forms. However, it is possible to explore the properties
    of both natural and engineered systems that make them more or less resilient.
    As shown in Table 1, there are several key characteristics of living systems that
    can also be extended to industrial systems. For example, it is commonly argued
    among ecologists that a decrease in biodiversity will tend to reduce ecosystem
    stability ( 21). As mentioned earlier, a similar observation was made in the Shell
    study of corporate longevitya decrease in managerial diversity reduces a company''s
    ability to survive upheavals. Table 1.  Characteristics of Resilient Systems   diversity

    1 identifies four major system characteristics that contribute to resilience and
    interprets them in the context of the nested systems discussed earlier. These
    characteristics are as follows: (i) Diversityexistence of multiple forms and behaviors;
    (ii) Efficiencyperformance with modest resource consumption; (iii) Adaptabilityflexibility
    to change in response to new pressures; (iv) Cohesionexistence of unifying forces
    or linkages. An understanding of system resilience becomes important when significant
    disruptions or discontinuities occur that shift the system away from its current
    equilibrium state. Such disruptions could include the introduction of new technolo
    gies, the emergence of new regulatory and market forces, or changes in the availability
    of resources. For example, will the broad introduction of low-cost electronic
    devices in developing nations create an excessive flow of post-consumer wastes,
    and how will local governments respond? Some believe that emerging sustainability
    issues will catalyze innovations that will change the basis of competition in
    many industries ( 22). Those that wish to reap the benefits of these changes must
    also be alert to the riskscomplex systems may be vulnerable to small, unforeseen
    perturbations that cause catastrophic failures. Already, practitioners of enterprise
    risk management are beginning to adopt resilience concepts as a way to “withstand
    systemic discontinuities and adapt to new risk environments” ( 23). There are
    numerous instances of system design practices that have contributed to sustainability
    improvements, especially with regard to ecological issues. For example: (i) Sustainable
    Building Systems. Many architects and engineers have embraced the concepts of
    “green” or sustainable buildings. According to the U.S. Department of Energy,
    buildings consume about 33% of all the energy used in the United States and 66%
    of all electricity, thus accounting for about 35% of all carbon dioxide emissions
    ( 24). Examples of sustainable design practices include energy efficiency, use
    of local materials, respect for natural surroundings, utilization of ecological
    services (e.g., heating and cooling), and sensitivity to human well-being ( 25).
    Apart from the obvious energy and environmental benefits, studies suggest that
    sustainable buildings also improve employee satisfaction and productivity ( 26).
    The LEED protocol, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is widely used
    to evaluate environmental performance from a “whole building” perspective over
    a building''s life cycle. At a higher system level, a number of academic and research
    institutions, such as University of California at Berkeley, have developed plans
    and guidelines for sustainable campuses. (ii) Sustainable Process Systems. Over
    the past decade, the field of process systems engineering has gradually expanded
    from a traditional focus on process technology and economics to incorporate sustainability
    issues such as process safety and environmental emissions ( 27). The synergy between
    process performance and sustainability is well captured in the concept of eco-efficiency,
    which measures the value produced as output per unit of resource input ( 28).
    Reductions in labor intensity, energy consumption, process hazards, and waste
    generation tend to translate into lower capital requirements, lower economic risks,
    and lower operating and maintenance costs. New technologies such as process intensification
    and microreactors have demonstrated the potential for order of magnitude increases
    in process yield and capital productivity. At the same time, significant advances
    have occurred in the field of green chemistry, also known as sustainable chemistry,
    which seeks new pathways and catalysts for environmentally benign chemical synthesis
    and processing ( 29). For example, Dow Chemical and other companies are using
    novel processing methods to convert renewable biomass (e.g., soybeans, corn, cellulose)
    into useful materials such as adhesives and plasticizers. (iii) Sustainable Supply
    Chain Systems. Products such as automobiles and computers, which involve a series
    of discrete manufacturing and assembly processes along the supply chain, can generate
    a significant ecological footprint in terms of material, energy, and land use
    as well as industrial wastes and emissions. Manufacturers such as General Motors
    and HP have utilized a variety of “design for environment” techniques ( 30) to
    reduce the resource intensity of their manufacturing and logistical systems. These
    techniques include simplifying product architecture to reduce the number of distinct
    parts and assembly operations (which also enables easier maintenance and disassembly);
    utilizing recycled materials or refurbished components; avoiding substances with
    undesirable properties such as carcinogenicity, toxicity, flammability, ozone
    depletion, or environmental persistence; reducing electrical and thermal energy
    use through process modifications or transportation ef ficiency (e.g., improved
    product geometry for pallet loading); utilizing quality improvement and “lean”
    manufacturing techniques (e.g., just-in-time inventory replenishment) to reduce
    work-in-process and scrap; and collaborating with customers and suppliers to streamline
    the supply chain and minimize waste. (iv) Sustainable Product Life Cycle Systems.
    Some companies have begun to look beyond the supply chain that they control and
    consider the full life cycles of their products and services, including resource
    extraction, procurement, transportation, manufacturing, product use, service,
    and end-of-life disposition or asset recovery (see Figure 1). For example, BASF
    Corp. has adopted a new eco-efficiency analysis tool to help identify products
    and processes that consume less energy and generate less waste than alternatives
    while maintaining or improving the products'' commercial value ( 31). The tool
    has been applied to over 100 different products and processes such as asphalt
    microsurfacing, nylon fiber, building materials, automotive coatings, plastics,
    and adhesives. The resulting analyses have influenced BASF business decisions
    regarding capital investments, production techniques, acquisitions, and product
    positioning. BASF''s methodology combines assessment of life cycle ecological
    impacts (including raw material and energy consumption, air and water emissions,
    and potential health risks) with an economic analysis of life cycle costs. Economic
    and ecological data are then plotted on a graph, revealing the eco-efficiency
    of a product or process as compared to competing products and processes. (v) Sustainable
    Industrial Networks. Companies working in isolation may achieve incremental improvements
    in addressing sustainability issues; however, a more powerful approach is for
    companies to collectively optimize their activities as part of an industrial ecology
    network. Stated simply, industrial ecology is a framework for transforming industrial
    systems from a linear model to a closed-loop model that resembles the cyclical
    flows of ecosystems, in which one creature''s waste becomes another creature''s
    nutrients ( 32). Rather than exporting industrial and consumer wastes for disposition
    outside the system, industrial ecology suggests elimination of the very concept
    of waste by designing innovative pathways for conversion of wastes into useful
    byproducts. The scope of the “system” then encompasses all participating companies
    as well as the natural environment in which they operate. Simple examples are
    common:  cement manufacturers incinerate contaminated wastes in cement kilns as
    a substitute for fossil fuel, effectively reducing global warming emissions; electric
    utilities recycle fly ash from their boilers for blending into cement and capture
    waste heat for local applications; electronic equipment recyclers recover parts
    and materials from discarded devices and recycle them into a variety of secondary
    uses. A more advanced example of industrial ecology is a complex at Kalundborg,
    Denmark, where “symbiotic” relationships have developed among several large facilities
    and a host of smaller ones. The main partners are a coal-fired power plant, a
    refinery, a plasterboard factory, and a pharmaceutical and enzyme plant operated
    by Novo Nordisk ( 33). The main focus of the above design efforts has been upon
    a particular system characteristicecological efficiency. It is likely that companies
    will discover additional opportunities for value creation by expanding their scope
    to include other dimensions of Table 1 (i.e., finding ways to enhance the diversity,
    adaptability, and cohesion of engineered systems and the related systems with
    which they interact). A Generalized Approach to Sustainable System Design ARTICLE
    SECTIONSJump To Among the vast range of systems that we encounter, there are many
    well-bounded systems that are truly “designed”. Clothing, appliances, aircraft,
    and buildings, for example, are designed and then manufactured or assembled through
    a rigorously controlled series of processes. On the other hand, we participate
    in social and ecological systems that are not at all designed; yet we can still
    design policies and interven tions that influence the system behavior and evolution.
    The latter case typifies virtually all of our environmental protection effortswe
    introduce changes such as soil remediation, pollution reduction, reforestation,
    or streamflow diversion in an effort to enhance the health of the overall ecosystem.
    Controlled design is the dominant focus of the product and process development
    community, and companies have made huge investments in design technology in order
    to improve the creativity, quality, and speed of system development. For example,
    the system acquisition processes utilized by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
    engage dozens of organizations in a controlled design effort that encompasses
    the full life cycle of military systems. Inevitably, such efforts turn out to
    have unforeseen, inadvertent impacts upon related systems. For example, the DoD
    is currently examining the sustainability of domestic artillery test ranges in
    terms of their impacts upon surrounding communities, an issue that was overlooked
    for many years. The unforeseen secondary impacts of system design may be trivial
    or profound. For example, in the case of automotive design: (i) A structural design
    change that improves vehicle performance may have virtually no significant secondary
    impacts; (ii) A change in the materials of construction may have substantial impacts
    on economic and ecological systems within the manufacturer''s supply chain; (iii)
    A new engine design may have not only supply chain impacts but also economic,
    environmental and social impacts that affect entire markets. Thus, certain design
    decisions may constitute interven tions in broader systems. From this perspective,
    “green engineering” and “design for environment” are efforts to anticipate and
    consider broader ecological system impacts within a controlled design process.
    More generally, “design for sustainability” represents an effort to consider both
    environmental and socio-economic systems. We cannot design a perfect natural environment
    or an ideal society, but we can try to modify the controllable characteristics
    of our designed artifacts (e.g., factories, products) in ways that create environmental
    and social benefits. Individual companies, especially market leaders, can exert
    powerful influences through such system interventions. Regulatory agencies can
    also exert powerful influences, but a more promising approach is collaborative
    partnerships whereby industry, government, and other interested parties jointly
    design interventions for the benefit of society. Without such partnerships, well-intentioned
    efforts may go awry; for example, airborne emissions might merely be shifted to
    waterborne effluents elsewhere in the supply chain, or the distribution of risks
    and benefits among workers and consumers might be inequitable. Perhaps the most
    ambitious example of collective system intervention is the worldwide effort to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To encourage systems design that incorporates
    sustain ability thinking explicitly, it is useful to have a systematic protocol.
    Consideration of related (parent or sibling) systems and their resilience can
    be accomplished through an expan sion of existing design protocols, as illustrated
    in Figure 3. At one extreme, if there are no important interactions anticipated
    with related systems, the protocol reduces to a standard “stage-gate” development
    process, commonly used in industry. At the other extreme, the external interactions
    may be so significant that the majority of the design effort is spent trying to
    understand related systems, including impacts and boundary constraints. Each of
    the steps in Figure 3 is described below. Figure 3 Expanded design protocol including
    system considerations. Defining System Function and Boundaries ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To The sustainable mobility problem mentioned at the begin ning of this paper
    illustrates the difficulty of establishing the scope for a system design effort.
    Every open system interacts with its environment and, hence, is part of a larger
    system. Carried to the extreme, this type of reasoning leads to the “Gaia hypothesis”,
    which claims that the world is a single giant organism ( 34). This is not a very
    helpful perspective if one is trying to design an electronic appliance. However,
    a more practical application of systems thinking is to consider the related systems
    in which a design artifact is embeddedliterally thinking outside the box. This
    may lead to surprising innovations. For example, the development of a telephone-answering
    device might be seen from several alternative related system perspectives: (i)
    It is part of a home system from the consumer use perspective and can become a
    network appliance as well a communication device. (ii) It is part of a material
    flow system from a supply chain perspective and can become a source of reusable
    components at end-of-life. (iii) It is an enabling technology from a developing
    economy perspective and can serve as an element of an entrepreneurial communication
    service business. It follows that one of the most important steps in system design
    is establishing a clear, practical definition of the function and boundaries of
    “the system”. For example, are we creating a voice recording device, a telephone-answering
    system, or a voice mail service? Are we designing a physical device, a human interface,
    or a total solution delivery system? Depending on the system scope, the design
    methodology and technological options can vary greatly. A common way to define
    systems, for purposes of customer value analysis and life cycle analysis of competing
    designs, is in terms of a unit of functional value. In the above example, the
    functional unit chosen might be a “message capture event” including both recording
    and playback. Then alternative designs could be analyzed in terms of cost, reliability,
    ease of use, and resource efficiency per message capture event. A good illustration
    of how system boundaries become broadened is in the field of industrial carpeting,
    which surprisingly has become a hotbed of sustainable design. Collins & Aikman
    Floorcoverings (now part of Tandus Group) has developed a closed-loop recovery
    process whereby customers return their carpet with assurance that 100% of it will
    be recycled into new carpet. Another industry leader, Interface, has pledged to
    offset the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its floorcovering products with
    investments in GHG reduction projects such as installing energy-efficient boilers
    and lighting in public schools or planting trees that absorb greenhouse gases.
    Developing System Requirements ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In systems engineering,
    requirements definition and management has traditionally focused on observable
    product characteristics such as cost, structure (e.g., size, geometry), and functional
    performance. A requirement can be defined as a set of testable conditions applicable
    to products or processes ( 35). The conditions may be represented in various forms,
    ranging from qualitative statements (e.g., “system shall shut down when left idle”)
    to quantitative metrics (e.g., power rating). Testing of requirements typically
    involves some human interpretation, and the broader the scope of the system, the
    more difficult it becomes to apply definitive tests. The requirements management
    process generally consists of three main functions that are performed in an iterative
    fashion: (i) Requirements analysis involves interpreting customer needs and deriving
    explicit, verifiable requirements. (ii) Requirements tracking involves analysis
    of design tradeoffs, including project risk, schedule, cost constraints, and performance
    goals. A traceability hierarchy is frequently used to keep track of changes in
    system and subsystem requirements. (iii) Requirements verification involves determining
    whether a system design will meet the specified requirements. The earlier verification
    can be performed, the more likely it is that gaps or flaws will be detected before
    a large investment is made. To incorporate sustainability issues, as shown in
    Figure 3, system requirements definition should take into account the boundary
    conditions derived from related systems. This may require thinking beyond the
    usual supply chain considerations to consider the broader industrial and social
    context. For example, recent European Union directives are requiring both electronics
    and automotive manufacturers to take responsibility for end-of-life vehicle recovery,
    stimulating reconsideration of the design assumptions for systems and their components.
    Another recent trend is the interest of multi-national companies such as Dow,
    HP, and Procter & Gamble in addressing the large, heretofore untapped markets
    at the bottom of the economic pyramid ( 36). They have found that designing products
    as well as marketing and distribution systems to serve low-income populations
    in developing nations requires a deep understanding of local conditions, resources,
    and behavior patterns. For example, in India, consumables such as detergent can
    now be purchased in one-cent single-serving pouches made of biodegradable plastic.
    The life cycle issues that need to be emphasized in requirements definition vary
    greatly across different industries. Natural resource extraction industries such
    as mining, oil production, agriculture, and forest products might emphasize appropriate
    land use, ecosystem protection, and worker safety. Industries farther downstream
    in the supply chain such as petroleum refining, metals, chemicals, and electric
    utilities might emphasize process safety, conversion efficiency, and waste minimization.
    Industries close to the end-customer such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals,
    automotive, and electronics might emphasize environmentally conscious packaging
    (for consumable products), end-of-life recovery (for durable products), and responsiveness
    to social needs. Finally, service industries such as transportation, communication,
    and retailing might emphasize efficient logistics, product certification (e.g.,
    lumber), and human resource development. To develop sustainability requirements,
    it is helpful to consider a “mental map” of human needs, presented in Figure 4.
    Basic survival needs are associated with the physical realm, while higher-order
    needs are associated with the socio-economic realm. These two realms are closely
    intertwined, with energy needs playing a pivotal rolein fact, energy is the one
    essential input for all living systems. The current status of these needs, including
    significant gaps, may provide boundary conditions for system design; for example,
    in a region with severe water shortages, industrial depletion of water should
    be avoided. Practically speaking, the needs of society must be clarified and prioritized
    through stakeholder engagement, including a dialogue among corporations, government
    policy-makers, and public interest groups. Thus, there is no universal set of
    performance conditions that defines sustainability, even within a particular industry.
    Figure 4 present and future human needs. This ambiguity may be perplexing to a
    system designer accustomed to having performance-based requirements. For example,
    one might intuitively believe that a “zero-emission” factory was a worthwhile
    goal. Yet the technologies required to reduce plant emissions to zero might be
    both complex and costly. Instead, a combination of throughput reduction and partial
    conversion of wastes to useful byproducts might result in a superior environmental
    profile for the larger economic system in which the plant operates. Furthermore,
    a business strategy that encourages diversity in adjacent industrial development
    might create additional markets for waste materials. Selecting Technologies and
    Creating a Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Recent innovations in genomics, materials
    science, nanosystems, and information technology can contribute directly to sustainability
    by increasing the efficiency and adaptability of existing products and processes.
    For example, increased use of electronic communication and information storage
    may reduce the need for physical transportation and record-keeping, although we
    have yet to achieve a “paperless office”. DuPont, for one, encourages its businesses
    to substitute intellectual capital for physical capital by measuring product performance
    in terms of shareholder value per pound of product sold. However, there are hidden
    tradeoffs to consider. Systems that are smaller, faster, cheaper, and more flexible
    may actually have a larger environmental footprint than their bulkier, slower
    predecessors. In the semiconductor industry, for example, the precision manufacture
    of a tiny microchip consumes large amounts of energy and materials ( 37). Nanosystem
    production may prove even more resource-intensive, and some scientists are concerned
    about the potential hazards associated with inhalation of nanoparticles. Due to
    such system-level considerations, no technology can be deemed intrinsically sustainable.
    Renewable or bio-based materials are not necessarily preferable to inorganic materials.
    Recycled materials are not necessarily preferable to virgin materials. Biodegradable
    materials are not necessarily preferable to durable materials since industrial
    ecology networks may recycle spent materials into new applications. It all depends
    on the system boundaries and requirements. The system design process itself is
    undergoing consider able evolution ( 38). Traditional, hierarchical design has
    proved cumbersome and “brittle” in the sense that a single deviation can disrupt
    the entire process. Many organizations are experimenting with new techniques such
    as cooperative, distributed, asynchronous design. Again, this approach is patterned
    after the self-organizing behavior of living systems. Through advanced communication
    and groupware technologies, design teams can be distributed geographically and
    share their ideas and progress via interactive computer displays. For design of
    complex systems, the ability to iterate rapidly is especially important since
    design teams need to assess the robustness of alternative designs under a variety
    of different scenarios and assumptions. In the automotive industry, for example,
    it is common for the major automakers to co-locate design engineers from their
    principal “Tier 1” suppliers together with their in-house design teams, enabling
    a tightly integrated development process. As mentioned earlier, the design of
    sustainable systems may benefit from including requirements that address inherent
    resilience. Characteristics such as diversity and adaptability may not have an
    obvious relationship to system performance but may contribute to the system''s
    longevity and ultimate success. For example, vehicle designers have increasingly
    stressed adaptability issues such as reliability and maintainability under extreme
    conditions, which influ ence both life cycle performance and cost of ownership.
    Sometimes the greatest resilience is achieved through design simplicity, which
    reduces the chances of unexpected failure or disruption. Evaluating System Performance
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To A key part of any iterative system development effort
    is evaluating the anticipated performance of a partially or fully completed design.
    In many industries this evaluation process is supported by automated tools, known
    as computer-aided design and manufacture (CAD/CAM), which can perform highly detailed
    simulations before the system is ever built. Boeing, for example, has honed this
    approach to the point that its engineers can design a complete aircraft without
    ever physically building and testing a prototype. However, as the design focus
    shifts from form and function to the impact on related systems, the evaluation
    task becomes immensely more challenging. Theoretical computer simula tions can
    be performed to model interventions in biological organisms, ecosystems, or socio-economic
    systems, but we can seldom ensure their validity. One alternative approach is
    life-cycle assessment, a systematic method for identifying and quantifying the
    environmental burdens associated with the life cycle of a product or process (
    39). The approach has also been extended to support life cycle cost accounting
    ( 40). A life cycle inventory can be used to profile the system-wide energy and
    material consumption and waste generation in terms of flows per functional unit.
    Life cycle impact assessment attempts to evaluate the actual significance of these
    flows in terms of human effects and ecosystem perturbations, although uncertainties
    abound. Despite data quality issues, life cycle methods can be useful for relative
    comparisons of alternative system design options, thus supporting business decisions.
    Other evaluation methods include integrative modeling approaches such as systems
    dynamics that attempt to characterize system behavior and anticipate potential
    evolutionary paths ( 41). For example, recent applications of generalized economic
    equilibrium models have been helpful in projecting the impacts of different energy
    technologies upon global climate change ( 42). However, such models cannot be
    predictive in the classical sense and are often controversial. Recognizing the
    scientific challenges of integrated system evaluation, the National Science Foundation
    has initiated a program in biocomplexity, which addresses “the dynamic web of
    often surprising interrelationships that arise when components of the global ecosystembiological,
    physical, chemical, and the human dimensioninteract” ( 43). The needed linkages
    among the natural, social, and mathematical science disciplines are still at an
    embryonic stage. The usual objective of system evaluation is to quantify selected
    performance indicators that portray the consequences of design choices. Although
    integrated modeling is not always feasible, the identification of such indicators
    can be extremely helpful. Even in the absence of quantitative models, it may be
    possible to develop subjective or qualitative assessments of the directional impacts
    on key indicators. Table 2 provides example of sustainability indicators that
    have commonly been used to characterize the performance outcomes of system design
    or system intervention ( 44). The Global Reporting Initiative has developed a
    more exhaustive catalog of performance indicators as part of its guideline for
    sustainability reporting ( 45). Table 2.  Examples of Conventional Sustainability

    is important to assess not only performance outcomes but also the intrinsic characteristics
    that contribute to system resilience. Recent studies of energy flows in ecological
    and industrial systems suggest that new, more elegant, sustainability indicators
    may be developed based on thermodynamic analysis. For example, it has been conjectured
    that systems with lower entropy (i.e., higher degree of order) will have a larger
    life cycle impact on their surroundings ( 46). Calculation of exergy (useful energy)
    appears to offer a promising method for comparative assessment of the ecological
    efficiency associated with industrial processes ( 47). Planning System Deployment
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The final step in system design is the development of
    a plan for the release, introduction, and deployment of the system. In the past,
    product development teams often released their specifications to the manufacturing
    organization without considering downstream issues associated with component procurement,
    product distribution, customer support, maintenance, waste disposition, and potential
    upgrades of the original design. The introduction of “simultaneous engineer ing”
    methods and more rigorous stage-gate reviews has helped to shift these considerations
    back into the design process, thus avoiding delays and unnecessary costs. However,
    the question of broader system impacts is still poorly understood, and it is rare
    for design teams to consider them explicitly. Companies wishing to pursue sustainable
    system design have a strong motivation to consider the broad implications of an
    innovative system upon all of the enterprise stakehold ers. Each stakeholder group
    will be touched by the system in different ways and will have their own particular
    expecta tions. For example, employees expect the system to be safe and easy to
    operate. Shareholders expect the system to streamline existing operations and
    provide an improved return on an investment. Customers expect efficacy and convenience.
    Public interest organizations expect environmental and social benefits. To understand
    and manage all of these expectations, it is critical for the company to engage
    with its stakeholders, understand their concerns, and develop mutual trust so
    that the system can be introduced success fully. Indeed, the design team should
    begin considering the deployment phase as early as possible. The importance of
    stakeholder engagement is evident in the life sciences field, where companies
    are developing a host of biotechnology-based products that they claim will enable
    a shift to sustainable agriculture. One class of these new agricultural products
    is genetically engineered pest-resistant crops. Proponents claim that this technology
    will reduce pesticide use, increase agricultural productivity, and lower consumer
    costs, while opponents are concerned about unforeseen health and environmental
    impacts ( 48). An open dialogue among interested parties is necessary to establish
    agreement on the value of these products and the appropriate technical, legal,
    and ethical conditions for their use. History has shown that it is wise for designers
    to consider not only the product technology but also the socio-economic system
    into which it will be introduced. The need to consider the broader systems context
    is especially great in developing nations, where agriculture is often central
    to the indigenous culture. An example is wet rice cultivation in Bali, Indonesia,
    whose hills are covered with graceful, terraced rice paddies. The rural Balinese
    lifestyle represents a harmonious equilibrium between society and nature that
    has persisted for centuries. Rice has long been the island''s most important crop
    and is deeply embedded in the Balinese social structure. Village life centers
    around a rice growing association called a subak, which organizes community work
    on irrigation and cultivation systems. Festivals and religious rituals are intertwined
    with the rice planting, growing, and harvesting seasons. Thus, no matter how promising
    a new technology may be, any effort to modify the practice of rice growing must
    begin with a thorough understanding of the ecological and social boundary condi
    tions ( 49). Conclusion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To This paper has provided but a
    glimpse of the challenges encountered as system design moves from the bounded,
    controllable scope of traditional products and services to the boundaryless, unpredictable
    realm of industrial, ecologi cal, and social systems. The increasing connectedness
    of these systems creates new opportunities but also exposes society to greater
    risks. Economic threats such as the collapse of markets, political threats such
    as military aggression, biological threats such as mutant viruses, or ecological
    threats such as global warming have become the concern of all nations. Moreover,
    system complexity keeps increasingserious proposals are being raised for development
    of sustainable systems on a much larger scale, such as entire cities or regions
    ( 50). The classic reductionist tools that served so well in a simpler age are
    no longer adequate. Complex, nonlinear systems cannot be modeled by linking together
    a fragmented collection of linear models. What is needed is a new language and
    new metaphors to describe the relation ships and dynamic behaviors that characterize
    these exquisitely complex systemsa new, multi-disciplinary toolkit that begins
    with connectivity and integration as fundamental themes rather than afterthoughts.
    Einstein reputedly said, “Individuality is an illusion created by skin”. Indeed,
    separateness is a convenient assumption that enables the analysis of objects,
    people, or companies as if they were independent of their surroundings. However,
    in practice, this assumption is invalid. System design should proceed with a constant
    awareness of related systems, boundary conditions, external effects, and potential
    feedback loops. As design teams continually expand the system boundary, they will
    need to address new technical challenges in creative ways, for example: (i) Requirements
    will include system behaviors rather than just outcomes; (ii) Predictive modeling
    will give way to exploratory scenario building; (iii) Design strategies will rely
    upon intervention rather than control; (iv) Robustness will be achieved through
    resilience rather than resistance; (v) Risk management will draw upon new concepts
    such as adaptivity and diversity; (vi) System state indicators will be based on
    fundamental energy attributes. The resilience perspective has important implications
    for companies that wish to become more sustainable. It is not sufficient for a
    company to redesign only those systems that it fully controls. At best, this will
    result in incremental changes that do no harm but do not create substantial benefits
    either for the enterprise or for society. Instead, companies that wish to ensure
    their long-term resilience must reach beyond their own boundaries, develop an
    understanding of the intricate systems in which they participate, and strive for
    continuous innovation and renewal. In this broader playing field, the rules are
    different:  Strategic adaptation becomes more important than strategic planning,
    and decision makers need to embrace uncertainty rather than trying to eliminate
    it. As stated in a recent Harvard Business Review article: Any company that can
    make sense of its environment, generate strategic options, and re-align its resources
    faster than its rivals will enjoy a decisive advantage. This is the essence of
    resilience ( 51). The history of technological progress has emphasized the conquest
    of nature, using brute force and standardization to overcome nature''s infinite
    diversity ( 52). Today, scientists and engineers are learning from nature, discovering
    patterns that they can apply for the benefit of both humans and the environment.
    In business as in science, the old Newtonian view of an orderly, machine-like
    world is giving way to a new view of a chaotic, evolving world. Designing systems
    that are inherently resilient will support our collective quest for sustainability
    in this ever-changing, unpredictable universe. Author Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump

    Get rights and content Nanoscale science and nanotechnology have been demonstrated
    to have great potential in providing novel and improved solutions to many grand
    challenges facing agriculture and society today and in the future. This review
    highlights some of the most promising and important nanotechnology applications
    in agriculture; and recommends several strategies for advancing the best scientific
    and technological knowledge presently being examined. In addition, implications
    for human and environmental health, and technical, financial and capacity-related
    challenges as they relate to developing countries are identified. Finally, some
    suggested mechanisms for partnerships and collaborations are also identified and
    suggested. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Science and technology
    in agriculture: opportunities and challenges for the developing world Presently,
    the agricultural sector is facing various global challenges: climate change, urbanization,
    sustainable use of resources, and environmental issues such as run-off and accumulation
    of pesticides and fertilizers. These situations are further exacerbated by the
    growing food demand that will be needed to sustain an estimated population growth
    from the current level of about 6 billion to 9 billion by 2050. In addition, considering
    the world’s diminishing petroleum resources, agricultural products and materials
    will soon be viewed again as the foundation of commerce and manufacturing, hence
    additional demands on agricultural production. At the same time there are new
    opportunities emerging. For example, the use of agricultural waste for the generation
    of energy and electricity could be a viable solution pending workable economics
    and encouraging policy. This aforementioned scenario of rapidly evolving and yet
    complex agriculture system is, and will pose even greater challenges to developing
    countries. The agricultural sector and commodity production in developing regions
    are the backbone of the national economy where multitude critical issues such
    as lack of new arable soil, reduction of the current agricultural land due to
    competing economic development activities, commodity dependence, poverty and malnutrition
    are closely intertwined. Over the last several decades, the rapid growth in technological
    innovations have led to profound structural changes in the agricultural sector,
    including a transition from smallholder mixed farms toward large-scale specialized
    industrial production systems, a shift in the geographic locus of demand and supply
    to the developing world, and an increasing emphasis on global sourcing and marketing.
    The latter present challenges to the agricultural sector to provide possible improvements
    to its production sustainability in ways that promote food security, poverty reduction
    and public health improvement. Advances in science and technology could offer
    potential solutions for developing countries to innovate and add value to their
    current commodities production systems. Many technologies being developed have
    the potential not only to increase farm productivity but also to reduce the environmental
    and resource costs often associated with agricultural production. These include
    technologies that conserve land and water by increasing yields with the same or
    fewer inputs and technologies that protect environmental quality. It will be crucial,
    however, to support these applications even though they may not be commercially
    lucrative while avoiding the risk that some advances in science and technology
    may increase the disparity between developed and developing countries. Therefore,
    serious consideration of the social and ethical implications on new agriculture
    technologies will be necessary. It should also be recognized that while new agri-food
    technologies may deliver efficiencies in some areas, they may not necessarily
    solve existing problems of global food production and distribution. In this regard
    it is essential for developing countries to actively participate in research and
    development while respecting their needs and capacity to utilize these new technologies.
    Therefore, critical to the innovation, capacity building is the establishment
    of relevant, complementary and synergistic partnerships between developing countries
    and more advanced countries. Nanotechnologies in future agriculture Nanoscale
    science, engineering and technology embrace an exciting and broad scientific frontier
    which will have significant impacts on nearly all aspects of the global economy,
    industry, and people’s life in the 21st century (Gruère et al., 2011, Scott and
    Chen, 2003). Nanoscale sciences reveal the properties, processes, and phenomena
    of matters at the nanometer (1 to approximately 100 nm) range. Nanoscale engineering
    renders precise capability to control and/or fabricate matters at this scale to
    render novel and useful properties thus leading to many new applications of nanoscale
    science and nanomaterials that can be used to address numerous technical and societal
    issues. In this section, some potential applications of nanoscale science, engineering
    and nanotechnology for agriculture and food production and related issues are
    discussed. Despite a wide-range of industrial interest in this area, examples
    of available commercial products are few. Most applications are either in research
    and development (R&D) pipeline or at bench-top exploration stage; however, it
    is likely that the agriculture and food sector will see some large-scale applications
    of nanotechnologies in the near future. Some current industrial examples are indicated
    in the sections below. Nanotechnologies in plant-based agricultural production
    and products Plant-based agricultural production is the basis of broad agriculture
    systems providing food, feed, fiber, fire (thermal energy), and fuels through
    advancements in materials sciences, and biomass conversion technologies. While
    the demand for crop yield will rapidly increase in the future, the agriculture
    and natural resources such as land, water and soil fertility are finite. Other
    production inputs including synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are predicted
    to be much more expensive due to the constraints of known petroleum reserve. Precision
    farming is hence an important area of study to minimize production inputs and
    maximize agricultural production outputs for meeting the increasing needs of the
    world sustainability. Given that nanotechnology may allow for the precise control
    of manufacturing at the nanometer scale, a number of novel possibilities in elevating
    the precision farming practices are possible. • Nanotechnology enabled delivery
    of agriculture chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators,
    etc.): Many nanoscale carriers, including encapsulation and entrapment, polymers
    and dendrimers, surface ionic and weak bond attachments and other mechanisms may
    be used to store, protect, deliver, and release by control of intended payloads
    in crop production processes. One of the advantages of nanoscale delivery vehicles
    in agronomic applications is its improved stability of the payloads against degradation
    in the environment, thereby increasing its effectiveness while reducing the amount
    applied. This reduction helps address agricultural chemicals run-off and alleviate
    the environmental consequence. The nanoscale delivery vehicles may be designed
    to “anchor” to plant roots or the surrounding soil structures and organic matter
    if molecular or conformational affinity between the delivery nanoscale structure
    and targeted structures and matters in soil could be utilized (Johnston, 2010).
    Controlled release mechanisms allow the active ingredients to be slowly taken
    up, hence, avoiding temporal overdose, reducing the amount of agricultural chemicals
    used, and minimizing the input and waste. Environmental consideration including
    precision farming can reduce pollution to a minimum. • Field sensing systems to
    monitor the environmental stresses and crop condition: Nanotechnology may be developed
    and deployed for real time monitoring of the crop growth and field conditions
    including moisture level, soil fertility, temperature, crop nutrient status, insects,
    plant diseases, weeds, etc. Networks of wireless nanosensors positioned across
    cultivated fields provide essential data leading to best agronomic intelligence
    processes with the aim to minimize resource inputs and maximizing output and yield
    (Scott & Chen, 2003). Such information and signals include the optimal times for
    planting and harvesting crops and the time and level of water, fertilizers, pesticides,
    herbicides, and other treatments that need to be administered given specific plant
    physiology, pathology, and environmental conditions. • Nanotechnology enables
    the study of plant disease mechanisms. The advancement in nanofabrication and
    characterization tools have enabled studies of physical, chemical and biological
    interactions between plant cell organelles and various disease causing pathogens,
    i.e., plant pathology. A better understanding of plant pathogenic mechanisms such
    as flagella motility and biofilm formation will lead to improved treatment strategies
    to control the diseases and protect production (Cursino et al., 2009). For example,
    spatial and temporal studies of plant pathogenic xylem inhabiting bacteria have
    traditionally been conducted by monitoring changes in bacterial populations through
    destructive sampling techniques of tissues at various distances from inoculation
    sites. This approach seriously limits the information that can be obtained regarding
    colonization, biofilm development, and subsequent movement and re-colonization
    at new areas, primarily because the same region or sample site cannot be followed
    temporally. Micro-fabricated xylem vessels with nano-size features have been shown
    very useful in gaining an appreciation of the mechanisms and kinetics of bacterial
    colonization in xylem vessels such that novel disease control strategies may be
    developed (Zaini, De La Fuente, Hoch & Burr, 2009). • Improving plant traits against
    environmental stresses and diseases: Biotechnological research has been focusing
    on improving plant resilience against various environmental stresses such as drought,
    salinity, diseases, and others. Genomes of crop cultivars are currently being
    extensively studied. The advancement in nanotechnology-enabled gene sequencing
    is expected to introduce rapid and cost effective capability within a decade (Branton
    et al., 2008), hence leading to more effective identification and utilization
    of plant gene trait resources. • Lignocellulosic nanomaterials: Recent studies
    have shown that nanoscale cellulosic nanomaterials can be obtained from crops
    and trees. It opens up a whole new market for novel and value-added nano biomaterials
    and products of crops and forest. For example, cellulosic nano crystals can be
    used as light weight reinforcement in polymeric matrix as nanocomposite (Laborie,
    2009, Mathew et al., 2009). Such applications may include food and other packaging,
    construction, and transportation vehicle body structures. A consortium led by
    North Dakota State University (NDSU) is currently engaged in a project to commercialize
    a cellulosic nano whisker production technology, developed by Michigan Biotechnology
    Incorporate (MBI) International, from wheat straw. The cellulosic nano whiskers
    (CNW) would then be used to make biocomposites that could substitute for fiberglass
    and plastics in many applications, including automotive parts (Leistritz et al.,
    2007). As indicated earlier, nanosized agricultural chemicals are mainly still
    at the research and developmental stage. Natural Nano, a start-up company in Rochester,
    N.Y., has found a way to use Halloysite, a naturally found clay nanotube, as a
    low cost delivery for pesticides to achieve an extended release and better contact
    with plants. It is estimated that using this technology could reduce the amount
    of pesticides applied by 70 or 80 percent, a significant reduction in quantity
    and cost of pesticides as well as less impact on water streams (Murphy, 2008).
    Developing countries like China have been aggressively developing nanotechnology
    based delivery of agricultural chemicals. These technologies are expected to be
    deployed for field applications in next 5–10 years. The success of broad applications
    of nanoscale agricultural chemicals in crop production will largely depend on
    market demands, profit margin, environmental benefits, risk assessment and management
    policy in the background of other competitive technologies. Nanotechnologies in
    animal production and animal health Agriculturally relevant animal production
    (livestock, poultry, and aquaculture) provides society with highly nutritious
    foods (meat, fish, egg, milk and their processed products) which have been, and
    will continue to be, an important and integral part of human diets. There are
    a number of significant challenges in animal agricultural production, including
    production efficiency, animal health, feed nutritional efficiency, diseases including
    zoonoses, product quality and value, by-products and waste, and environmental
    footprints. Nanotechnologies may offer effective, sometimes novel, solutions to
    these challenges (Kuzma, 2010). • Improving feeding efficiency and nutrition of
    agricultural animals: A critical element of sustainable agricultural production
    is the minimization of production input while maximizing output. One of the most
    significant inputs in animal production is feedstock. Low feeding efficiency results
    in high demand of feed, high discharges of waste, heavy environmental burden,
    high production cost, and competing with other uses of the grains, biomass, and
    other feed materials. Nanotechnology may significantly improve the nutrient profiles
    and efficacy of minor nutrient delivery of feeds. Most animal feeds are not nutritionally
    optimal, especially in developing countries. Adding supplemental nutrients is
    an effective approach to improve the efficiency of protein synthesis and the utilization
    of minor nutrients. Other digestive aids such as cellulosic enzymes can facilitate
    better utilization of the energy in plant-based materials. Furthermore, minor
    nutrients and bioactives can help improve overall health of animals so that an
    optimal physiological state can be achieved and maintained. A variety of nanoscale
    delivery systems have been investigated for food applications. They include micelles,
    liposomes, nano-emulsions, bio-polymeric nanoparticles, protein-carbohydrate nanoscale
    complexes, solid nano lipid particles, dendrimers, and others. These systems collectively
    have shown numerous advantages including better stability against environmental
    stresses and processing impacts, high absorption and bioavailability, better solubility
    and disperse-ability in aqueous based systems (food and feed), and controlled
    release kinetics (Chen, Weiss, & Shahidi, 2006). Self assembled and thermodynamically
    stable structures require little energy in processing thereby helping to address
    issues related to sustainability. Nanoscale delivery can be used to improve the
    nutritional profiles of feed and feeding efficiency. In addition, the nanoscale
    delivery systems can also be designed for veterinary drug delivery which protects
    the drug in GI tract, and allows for release at the desired location and rate
    for optimal effect. These advantages help improve the efficiency by which animals
    utilize nutrient resources, reduce material and financial burden of the producers,
    and improve product quality and production yield. Similar to food applications,
    the design of an appropriate nanoscale delivery system will require a full consideration
    of the effectiveness of its intended uses while preventing any adverse effects
    or unintended consequences. The nanoscale particles should be subject to a rigorous
    risk assessment to ensure responsible and safe development and deployment in the
    products. • Minimizing losses from animal diseases, including Zoonoses: Many animal
    diseases cause substantial losses in agricultural animal production. Some of the
    more significant diseases include bovine mastitis, tuberculosis, respiratory disease
    complex, Johne’s disease, avian influenza, and porcine reproductive and respiratory
    syndrome (PRRS). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that animal diseases
    represent as much as 17 percent of animal production costs in the developed world,
    and more than twice this figure in developing nations. On average, one newly identified
    animal infectious disease has emerged each year for the past 30 years of which
    approximately 75 percent have been zoonotic (e.g., mad cow disease; Avian influenza;
    H1N1 Influenza; Ebola virus; Nipah virus) (WHO, 2005). Zoonotic diseases not only
    cause devastating economic losses to animal producers, but also impose serious
    threats to human health, e.g., Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Detection
    and intervention are two important tools of an integrated animal disease management
    strategy that is critical to significantly reducing losses/threats from the disease,
    and/or eradicating disease, or preventing disease introduction into the animal
    production. Nanotechnology has the potential to enable revolutionary changes in
    this area, and some specific technologies may be feasible in near future given
    the current state of research and development (Emerich and Thanos, 2006, Scott,
    2007). Nanotechnology offers numerous advantages in detection and diagnostics
    including high specificity and sensitivity, simultaneous detection of multiple
    targets, rapid, robust, on-board signal processing, communication, automation,
    convenient to use, and low cost. The uses of portable, implantable or wearable
    devices are particularly welcome in agricultural field applications. Early detection
    is imperative so that quick, simple and inexpensive treatment strategies can be
    taken to remedy the situation. Nanotechnology based drugs and vaccines can be
    more effective in treating/preventing the diseases than current technologies,
    thus reducing cost. Precise delivery and controlled release of nanotechnology
    enabled drugs leave little footprint in the animal waste and the environment,
    which alleviate the increasing concern of antibiotic resistance, and decrease
    health and environmental risks associated with the use of antibiotics. The targeted
    delivery and active nanoparticles may enable new drug administrations that are
    convenient, fast, non-intrusive to animals, and cost effective. Theragnostics
    – a new generation of smart treatment combining diagnostics and therapy in a single
    step via nanotechnology – will further improve disease treatment efficiency and
    cost, and eliminate the diseases at early stage, even pre-clinically (Morris,
    2009). The effectiveness of new drug delivery technology platforms must first
    be established using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in vivo to investigate
    the relationship between dose, drug concentration at the site of action, and drug
    response. Only then can a new drug delivery system be deployed. Research and development
    for dealing with zoonotic diseases should collaborate with expertise from the
    human and veterinary medical communities for a more effective advancement. • Animal
    reproduction and fertility: Animal reproduction remains a challenge not only in
    developing countries, but also in developed nations. Low fertility results in
    low production rate, increases in financial input, and reduced efficiency of livestock
    operations (Narducci, 2007). Several technological fronts have been explored in
    order to improve animal reproduction. Microfluidic technology has matured over
    the last two decades, and has been integrated into many nanoscale processing and
    monitoring technologies including food and water quality, animal health, and environmental
    contaminations. The development of efficient microfluidic technology has enabled
    the automated production of large numbers of embryos in vitro, which has led to
    the rapid development of genetic improvement and selection of superior livestock
    for human food and fiber production (Raty et al., 2004). Brazilian animal scientists
    have used Fixed-Time Artificial Insemination (FTAI) technology to effectively
    increase the cattle reproduction rate for many years. However, the technology
    depends on the regulation of progesterone administered through a silicone matrix.
    The procedure has substantial drawbacks including inefficient and irregular dispersion
    of hormone, disposal issues, being labor intensive, and requiring multiple animal
    handlings for each attempt. Nanoscale delivery vehicles are sought to substantially
    improve bioavailability and better control of release kinetics, reduce labor intensity,
    and minimize waste and discharge to the environment (Emerich and Thanos, 2006,
    Narducci, 2007). Another strategy that may be explored is to monitor animal hormone
    level using implanted nanotechnology-enabled sensing device with wireless transmission
    capability, thus the information of optimal fertility period can become available
    in real time to assist the livestock operators for reproduction decision making
    (Afrasiabi, 2010). • Animal product quality, value and safety: Modification of
    animal feeds has been effectively used to improve animal production as well as
    product quality and value. The regulation of nutrient utilization can be used
    to enhance the efficiency of animal production, and to design animal-derived foods
    consistent with health recommendations and consumer perceptions. For example,
    the concepts of nutrient regulation have been used to redesign foods, such as
    milk fatty acids, cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic
    acid (VA), that may have a potential role in the prevention of chronic human diseases
    such as cancer and atherogenesis (Bauman, Perfield, Harvatine, & Baumgard, 2008).
    The biosynthesis and concentration of CLA and VA in milk fat of lactating ruminants
    may be enhanced and efficiently controlled by nanotechnology enabled delivery
    of nutrients. Collaborative research examining the biological benefits of functional
    foods with enhanced CLA/VA content in biomedical studies with animal models of
    human diseases and in human clinical using biomarkers for chronic disease could
    benefit from new technologies based on nanotechnology capabilities. Biomarker
    triggered release mechanisms may be explored for new discoveries of nanoscale
    structural actions. Biotechnology has also been explored in animal and food product
    quality. Nanotechnology research is attempting to sequence a mammalian genome
    in less than 24 h and less than $1000 (Branton et al., 2008). Once this technical
    capability becomes available in the next decade, the pace of biotechnology research
    and development will be substantially accelerated. • Turning animal by-products
    and waste and environmental concerns into value added products: Animal waste is
    a serious concern in the animal production industry. Stricter environmental policies
    will prevent irresponsible discharge of animal waste. The unpleasant odors that
    emanate from intensive animal production facilities adversely affect air quality,
    and in turn, living conditions and the real estate value of the adjacent area.
    However, bioconversion of animal waste into energy and electricity can result
    in new revenue, renewable energy, high quality organic fertilizer, and improved
    environmental quality while value added (Scott, 2002). Nanotechnology-enabled
    catalysts will play a critical role in efficient and cost effective bioconversion
    and fuel cell for electricity production as well as enabling efficient energy
    storage which will greatly facilitate and benefit the development of distributed
    energy supplies, especially in rural communities where infrastructure is lacking
    (Davis et al., 2009, Soghomonian and Heremans, 2009). Such an approach may result
    in the elimination of the need for system wide electricity grids, hence accelerate
    the rural development and improve productivity, and business and living environment
    and will be especially beneficial to developing countries. Nanotechnologies for
    water quality and availability Providing clean and abundant fresh water for human
    use and industry applications, including agricultural and farming uses, is one
    of the most daunting challenges facing the world (Vörösmarty et al., 2010). It
    is estimated that “more than one billion people in the world lack access to clean
    water, and the situation is getting worse. Over the next two decades, the average
    supply of water per person will drop by a third, possibly condemning millions
    of people to an avoidable premature death.” (Savage, Diallo, Duncan, Street, &
    Sustich, 2009). Agriculture requires considerable amount of fresh water, and in
    turn, often contributes substantially to pollution of groundwater through the
    use of pesticides, fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals. Effective technologies
    for remediation and purification will be needed to manage the volume of wastewater
    produced by farms on a continual basis, and be cost effective for all. Technical
    issues in the water challenges include water quality and quantity, treatment and
    reuse, safety due to chemical and biological hazards, monitoring and sensors.
    Nanotechnology R&D has shown great promises in providing novel and economically
    feasible solutions. Several aspects of nanotechnology solutions are briefly discussed
    below. Water quantity, quality and safety – treatment, decontamination, reuse,
    and conservation Accessible water resources are often contaminated with pollutants
    largely due to various human activities, but also natural leaching. These contaminants
    include, but not limited to, water-borne pathogenic microorganisms (Cryptosporidium,
    Coliform bacteria, virus, etc.), various salts and metals (copper, lead, arsenic,
    etc.), run-off agricultural chemicals, tens of thousands of compounds considered
    as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP), and endocrine disrupting
    compounds (EDC), and radioactive contaminants either naturally occurring or the
    result of oil and gas production as well as mining activities. For drinking water,
    sensory attributes (taste, smell, and turbidity) are also important quality indicators.
    Various nanoscale tools have been explored to address these challenges to improve
    water quality and safety. The following sections will give a brief introduction
    of some of the important developments. For more comprehensive coverage of nanotechnology
    applications in water, please refer to the paper by Dr. P. Alvarez in this special
    issue. • Microbial disinfection: In industrialized nations, chemical and physical
    based (chlorine dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet) microbial disinfection systems
    are commonly used. However, much of the world still does not have the industrial
    infrastructure necessary to support chemical-based disinfection of water. Hence,
    alternative technologies that require less intensive infrastructure and more cost
    effective approaches such as nanoscale oligodynamic metallic particles, those
    may exhibit a toxic effect on living cells even in relatively low concentrations,
    may be worthy of attention. Among the oligodynamic metallic nanoparticles, silver
    is considered the most promising nanomaterials with bactericidal and viricidal
    properties owing to its wide-range effectiveness, low toxicity, ease of use, its
    charge capacity, high surface to volume ratios, crystallographic structure, and
    adaptability to various substrates (Nangmenyi & Economy, 2009). Its antimicrobial
    mechanism is due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cleaves
    DNA. Another nanoscale technological development for microbial disinfection is
    visible light photocatalysts of transition metal oxides made into nanoparticles,
    nanoporous fibers, and nanoporous foams (Li, Wu, & Shang, 2009). In addition to
    its effectiveness in disinfecting microorganisms, it can also remove organic contaminants
    such as PPCPs and EDCs. Tubular nanostructures may be embedded into microbial
    cell wall to disrupt its structure integrity and result in leakage of intracellular
    compounds, and eventually cell death. • Desalination: Given the limited fresh
    water supplies both above or underground, it is likely that the desalination of
    sea water will become a major source of fresh water. Conventional desalination
    technology is reverse osmosis (RO) membranes which generally require large amounts
    of energy. A number of nanotechnologies have been attempted to develop low energy
    alternatives. Among them, the 3 most promising technologies appear to be protein-polymer
    biomimetic membranes, aligned-carbon nanotube membranes, and thin film nanocomposite
    membranes (Hoek & Ghosh, 2009). Some of the prototypes have demonstrated up to
    100 times better water permeability with nearly perfect salt rejection than RO.
    Carbon nanotube membranes, owing to its extremely high water permeability than
    other materials of similar size, have desalination efficiencies in the order of
    thousand times better than the current technology. Some of these membranes can
    also integrate other functionalities such as disinfection, de-odouring, de-fouling,
    and self-cleaning. Technical challenges such as scale-up fabrication, practical
    desalination effectiveness, and long-term stability must be addressed before becoming
    successfully commercialized. Some of the above mentioned technologies are currently
    in commercial development stage, which may be introduced in the market place in
    near future. • Removal of heavy metals: Functionalization of ligand-based nanocoating
    which is bonded to the surface of high surface and low cost filtration substrate
    can effectively absorb high concentrations of heavy metal contaminants. The system
    can be re-generated in situ by treatment with bifunctional self-assembling ligand
    of the previously used nanocoating media. A start-up company (Crystal Clear Technologies)
    has demonstrated that multiple layers of metal can be bonded to the same substrate
    (Farmen, 2009). Such a water treatment unit should be available in near future
    for removal of various heavy metals in water. Another approach to remove heavy
    metals and ions is the use of dendrimer enhanced filtration (DEF) (Diallo, 2009).
    Functionalized dendrimers can bind cations and anions according to acidity. Water
    conservation in agricultural crop production The fact that crop production requires
    large amounts of water has resulted in the implementation of policy and regulations
    in limiting agricultural production in many regions. Scientists and engineers
    have been working to improve water usage conservation in agricultural productions.
    For example, drip irrigation has been developed to conserve water. This innovation
    has moved precision agriculture in water usage to a much higher level of control
    than other irrigation technologies such as flood irrigation. New and innovative
    ideas will likely result in the development of more precise water delivery systems.
    Future technology platforms should consider the following: water storage, in situ
    water holding capacity, water distribution near roots, water absorption efficiency
    of plants, encapsulated water released on demand, interaction with field intelligence
    through distributed nanosensor systems, among others (Savage et al., 2009). Detection
    and sensing for pollutants and impurity Nanotechnology based sensing and the detection
    of various contaminants in water has been topical over the last decade. Detection
    level is generally at parts per billion (ppb) for metals and organic contaminants
    in both laboratory and field applications. The state of science and prototyping
    for sensing and devices is among the most advanced in the field of nanotechnology,
    hence it is expected that many new technologies will be readily available in the
    next decade. Sensor applications for water bear many similarity to other applications,
    hence are not repeated here. For the general discussion on nanomaterials based
    biosensors, please refer to the paper by Dr. A. Merkoci in this special issue
    for more details. Nanotechnology for the keeping quality and distribution of agricultural
    and food products Many agricultural products are either perishable or semi-perishable.
    These include fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, egg, milk and dairy products, many
    processed foods, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. The improvement of shelf-life
    is one of the main areas for nanotechnology research to enhance the ability to
    preserve the freshness; quality and safety (see the paper by Dr. Q. Chaudhry in
    this special issue). Nanotechnology and traceability A number of factors contribute
    to an increased demand for the traceability of foods throughout production, processing,
    distribution and consumption. Food safety outbreaks frequently resulted in wide
    spread product recalls. Advanced and improved product traceability is essential
    to ensure food safety by removing all the tainted products in the market and the
    system during the recall process. Also, product authenticity has seen an increased
    value in food marketing throughout the world by validating the origin, and therefore,
    adding to the unique inherent value proposition of the products. Traceability
    must meet the following five essential technical challenges (Nightingale, 2008):
    1. Have sufficient vocabulary to distinguish all products 2. Not compromise the
    products 3. Have the same service life as the marked products 4. Easy to read
    by machines (speed, reliability, and convenience) 5. Should be very inexpensive
    for food and agricultural products In response to this market-driven requirement,
    several systems have been developed to provide consumers with information about
    the origin of agricultural products and the practices used to produce those products.
    Luo and his group at Cornell University have developed nucleic acid engineered
    nanobio barcode technology (Li, Cu, & Luo, 2005) which can address all the five
    requirements discussed above. The technology has been tested in identifying complicated
    non-point pollution sources in underground hydrological pathways. It has potential
    to be used in foods and many other traceability applications. Nanotechnology based
    tracing devices can integrate multiple functional devices that provide other important
    information such as sensors for detection of the presence of pathogens, spoilage
    microorganisms, allergens, chemicals, and other contaminants in food as well as
    nutritional information. Additionally, nanoscale tagging devices can be used to
    record and retrieve information about the product history. These types of applications
    will aid producers, retailers and consumers regarding food safety, food quality,
    nutritional values, and others to assist informed decision making processes. A
    challenge in new technology development is to manage the cost to be acceptable
    for its intended use. The inability to manage the cost will pose substantial barriers
    for many developing countries in producing, using and exporting their products.
    Fortunately, an inherent advantage of precise nanomanufacturing is the minimal
    use of materials which may reduce the production cost. The details in economics
    need to be worked out for actual cases of nanotechnology applications for the
    intended markets. Nanotechnologies and clean energy Access to inexpensive, safe
    and renewable energy is of utmost importance for worldwide sustainable development.
    Flexible and efficient, yet inexpensive solar cells are often highlighted as one
    of the most exciting areas of nanotechnology application in agriculture, as often
    expressed as “green nanotechnology.” Inexpensive systems of solar-powered electricity
    have long been an aspiration for tropical countries, but glass photovoltaic panels
    remain too expensive and delicate. Nanotechnology based photovoltaic currently
    is a high priority of research worldwide, including most industrialized countries.
    Solar energy conversion to electricity, energy storage, and other nanotechnology-enhanced
    solar-thermal energy conversion systems are presently active areas of research
    and development. Cost reduction in photocatalysts and energy materials will be
    critical. As the research and development advances, the economic feasibility and
    hurdles of photovoltaic technologies will become clearer; hence strategies may
    be developed to properly address them. More and more “out-of-box” ideas will continue
    to emerge. Jennings and Cliffel at Vanderbilt University have explored the use
    of photosynthesis protein units from leafy vegetables and plants for direct conversion
    of solar energy to electricity, and have made substantial technical breakthrough
    (Ciesielski et al., 2010). The current prototype can produce a voltage comparable
    to that of an AA battery and can remain functional for about 1 year. The most
    expensive component of this system is the glass microscope slide that serves as
    the cell base (∼30 ). Harnessing solar energy will be a grand challenge that benefits
    humanity, hence the pursuit will likely be persistent and intensified in years
    ahead. Nanotechnology can also contribute to conversion of biomass for fuels,
    chemical intermediates, speciality chemicals and products. As biomass becomes
    an increasingly important industrial feedstock, a new generation of catalysts
    to reduce production cost while being economically feasible will be critical.
    Nanostructures have the inherent advantage as catalysts of their large surface
    area per unit volume, and the capability to precisely control composition, structure,
    functionalization, and other important properties of catalysts (Davis et al.,
    2009). Governance and policies for fair and sound technological development Nanotechnology,
    as has been commonly defined, i.e., the science and engineering at the intermediate
    length scale of 1 to approximately 100 nm, has been actively pursued globally
    for about ten years. While many advances have been made, the development has been
    inconsistent across scientific areas and geographic regions. In agriculture, the
    research is still in its early stage. While the potential for many beneficial
    applications have been demonstrated at concept and bench-top, greater efforts
    are still required for commercialization. At the same time, research on methodology,
    identification and characterization of nanomaterials, testing priorities and regulatory
    guidance on nanoparticle safety are still in their infancy. Increased research
    in potential risk assessment for responsible development by all the stakeholders
    will be required in order to advance the field. Private-public partnership (PPP)
    will also be necessary in order for substantive contributions and advancements
    to be made in nanotechnology development. It will be mandatory that the public
    be engaged to ensure a transparent and constructive discussion of the various
    issues. Good governance for nanotechnology applications in agriculture and food
    systems should be discussed and established on important issues including sustained
    financial investment in nanotechnology research and development, technology transfer
    models, intellectual properties, and efforts to understand and facilitate technology
    adoption and sharing among industrialized and technologically disadvantage countries.
    The International Food Policy Research Institute recently published a policy briefing
    that offers a number of suggestions worthy of consideration and further discussion
    (Gruère et al., 2011). Addressing the above issues in relation to nanotechnology
    innovation and development requires: – Enhancing the role of developing countries
    in responsible nanotechnology development; – Encouraging the development of appropriate
    products targeted to help meet critical human health, nutritional and societal
    needs; – Including methods for addressing the safety, appropriateness, accessibility
    and sustainability of nanotechnology to meet the needs of developing countries.
    Need for partnerships and collaborations for sustainable agriculture development
    Nanotechnology by its very nature will require, and has required, a high degree
    of multidisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration within and between academic
    researchers, industry and government. Applications of nanotechnology involves
    many disciplines in engineering and the natural sciences, including such disciplines
    as physics, chemistry, biology, materials sciences, instrumentation, metrology,
    and others. As nanotechnology progresses from discovery to potential applications,
    it will require a number of tools for visualization, characterization, and fabrication,
    as well as methods for reproducing and controlling properties, scalability, and
    cost. These tools and techniques, too, are typically rooted in multiple disciplines.
    Despite the progress that has been made in developing countries with strong research
    capacity building efforts, many of these countries continue to work on filling
    critical gaps in research infrastructure through contact and access to international
    research and development networks. It will, therefore, be important to undertake
    an evaluation of possible collaboration and partnership mechanisms either between
    public and private or between developed and developing countries in order to meet
    global demands and expectations. Several developing countries have already been
    investing strategically and conducting research in nanotechnology applications
    for agriculture and food systems (Gruère et al., 2011). In particular, Brazil,
    China, India, and South Africa have been noted for their significant investments
    in nanotechnology research and development and the development of national nanotechnology
    strategies focusing on areas of national interest including energy, health, water
    treatment, agriculture, and the environment. The combination of public-private-sector
    partnerships and developed-developing countries collaborations will be useful
    in achieving new goals in agricultural development ultimately resulting in mutual
    and global benefits. In doing so, there are some key aspects that need particular
    attention: – Exploring new ways of working with the agriculture industry by developing
    alternative activities that are of benefit to industry and the country where the
    industry operates. – Developing and promoting regulations that can stimulate private-sector
    research in fields of common interests both to the public and to the industry.
    For example, incentives attempting to protect the environment, food safety, and
    nutrition may encourage research on technologies that are more compatible with
    social as well as business goals. – Education and workforce training are essential
    in enhancing scientific capabilities in all nations. Numerous courses, workshops
    and conferences are organized by academia, professional societies, governments,
    and private entities. Young scientists and students should take the advantage
    of these offerings to acquire new knowledge and skills required to be proficient
    workers and researchers in nanotechnology. One of the most recent examples is
    the International Conference of Food Applications of Nanoscale Science (ICoFANS)
    held in Tokyo from June 8–10, 2010. A number of graduate students and young scientists
    from developing countries participated to learn from plenary session presentations,
    presenting their research posters, and interacting with the leading scientists
    from around the world. A greater emphasis should be placed to making educational
    opportunities more easily accessible to people in developing countries throughout
    the world. The future conference planning should consider meeting locations in
    developing countries to ease the burden of travel costs of the participants, especially
    for young scientists and students. The conference operational budget planning
    should also consider reduced registration fees and travel assistance scholarships
    to the participants. Internet based educational offering has proven to be an effective
    approach to disseminate new and cutting-edge knowledge. Educational institutes
    in developed countries and professional organizations should be encouraged to
    extend these opportunities to participants in developing countries. Finally, learned
    scholars in developed countries should be encouraged to teach others in developing
    countries, i.e., “train the trainers”. This later concept which has proven highly
    effective in the United States and other countries has great potential for success
    as a means of outreach to students and work forces in developing countries. –
    To accelerate research and education in nanotechnology for agriculture, an increased
    intensity in investment is critically needed. Government funding agencies, agriculture
    and allied industries, venture capitals, and other financial institutes should
    consider investing in nanotechnology R&D for agriculture and foods as the agriculture
    and renewable production will be centrally important to the global sustainability
    and will require intensified investment to develop technical capabilities and
    solutions to effectively address numerous technical challenges ahead. – International
    cooperation is germane and essential in an ever increasing globalized economy.
    Each country has limited resources to invest in research and education. Therefore,
    working in a complementary manner and combining resources will allow for the effective
    advancement in nanoscale science and responsible development and deployment for
    the benefit of society. International organizations such as UN/FAO, WHO, IUFoST,
    and others should promote and facilitate international exchanges and cooperation.
    Most recently, the International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFoST)
    has approved the formation of International Society of Food Applications of Nanoscale
    Science (ISFANS), with its vision “to strengthen research, communication, dissemination
    of information and networking for technology transfers and international collaborations
    among interested parties from academia, industry, government, consumers, and other
    participants around the world. “ The formation of ISFANS is but one of many ways
    to effectively promote and improve international cooperation and collaboration.
    In addition, governments can also help bilateral and multilateral scientific cooperation
    through their respective MOUs. Finally, academia has a long history of international
    collaboration through joint research and training graduate students and postdoctoral
    fellows which should be encouraged. Concluding remarks This paper has intended
    to provide a brief overview of nanotechnology applications in agriculture in the
    context of an insight of the current situation around the world, and to form the
    basis of recommendations and future strategies based on some of current scientific
    knowledge. Some potential beneficial applications, implications for human and
    environmental health, challenges (including technical, financial and capacity-related
    challenges) as well as opportunities and strategies for developing countries have
    been identified. Finally, possible mechanisms for partnerships and collaborations
    (e.g., between developed and developing countries, public–private, between research
    institutions and international organizations etc) are also identified and suggested.

    Advanced Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles, Blockchain, Drones,
    Internet of Things, etc.), many companies are developing cyber-physical systems
    that can change the competition landscape. In the midst of this exciting development,
    we examine the strategic role of logistics and transportation services for creating
    economic, environmental and social values. Also, we discuss some new research
    directions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Industry

    1. Introduction Industry 4.0 is a term that originates from a German government
    project that promotes the computerized manufacturing in 2011. Industry 4.0 is
    also referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution” since the industrial revolution
    that took place in the 18th century. The first industrial revolution improved
    the productivity of the iron and textile industries by using steam power; and
    the second industrial revolution took place just before WWI and created reduced
    manufacturing cost by using electric power to create mass production. With the
    development of personal computers and the internet in the 1980s, the third industrial
    revolution transformed the economic landscape (Rifkin, 2011). After the term Industry
    4.0 was revived in 2011 by the German economic development agency, the fourth
    industrial revolution builds on the third, leveraging emerging technologies (or
    Industry 4.0 technologies) such as Additive Manufacturing, Advanced Robotics,
    Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles, Blockchain, Drones, Internet of
    Things, etc. Unlike the previous three, Schwab (2016) argues that the fourth industrial
    revolution is fundamentally different because it leverages connectivity and communication
    among billions of devices. These emerging technologies along with voluminous real-time
    data will transform the manufacturing and service operations along a global supply
    chain, and change the interactions between humans (consumers and supply chain
    partners) and machines. Currently, many companies are exploring ways to create
    value by exploiting these Industry 4.0 technologies. According the McKinsey Global
    Institute, operations and equipment optimization in the factory setting can generate
    up to $3.7 Trillion of value by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). More recently, Frank
    et al. (2019) examine different economic and technological drivers for companies
    to adopt various Industry 4.0 technologies. Based on a survey of 92 manufacturing
    companies, they find that computerized (or smart) manufacturing is a key driver.
    The notion of Industry 4.0 or the Fourth Industrial Revolution has kindled public
    interest. For instance, according to the data obtained from Google Trends, the
    number of google searches (worldwide) that contained the term “Industry 4.0” or
    “Fourth Industrial Revolution” began in 2012 and 2015; respectively, and the number
    of searches continued to increase as of March 2019 (Fig. 1). Most of the searches
    took place since 2016. It is interesting to note that most of the related queries
    are: “what is industry 4.0”, “internet of things,” or “what is the fourth industrial
    revolution?” Based on these queries, it appears that Industry 4.0 is a relatively
    new topic that deserves a better understanding. Currently, consulting firms such
    as IBM, McKinsey, and Deloitte are issuing different reports to explain the term
    Industry 4.0 and its impact (Zhang, 2017, Baur and Wee, 2015; and Deloitte Insights,
    2018). Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download : Download full-size

    2019 that contains the keywords “Industry 4.0” or “Fourth Industrial Revolution”.
    The vertical scale is normalized to 100. We also searched through Scopus citation
    database by using the keywords “Industry 4.0” or “Fourth Industrial Revolution”
    that appear in the title, abstract, or keywords of academic articles published
    between 2012 and 2018. As shown in Fig. 2, there were 2320 published articles
    that contain the keywords “Industry 4.0” (and 329 articles that contain the keyword
    “Fourth Industrial Revolution”). Also, most of the research articles that contain
    the keywords “Industry 4.0” appeared in engineering journals (25%), computer science
    journals (11%) and business journals (8%). We obtain a similar result for those
    articles that contain the keywords “Fourth Industrial Revolution”. Download :

    that Industry 4.0 is an emerging topic and the research in this area is nascent.
    Hence, there is a golden opportunity for the operations management (OM) research
    community to understand the implications of this new revolution, to identity novel
    research questions, and to examine the conditions under which these emerging technologies
    can create economic, environmental, and/or social value. 1.1. A brief description
    of technologies associated with Industry 4.0 We now provide a brief description
    of different technologies associated with Industry 4.0. The reader is referred
    to Berman (2012) for a detailed description about 3D printing, Babich and Hilary
    (2019) for an extensive discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of Blockchain,
    and Olsen and Tomlin (2019) for more discussion on other technologies. • Additive
    manufacturing (also known as 3D printing). This is a technology that uses a digital
    3D representation of an object and produces the physical object by depositing
    layers of materials (plastic, resin, stainless steel, ceramics, etc.). Additive
    manufacturing can enable firms to develop prototypes (product prototypes) and
    personalized products (hearing aids, knee replacements, and even toys) faster,
    cheaper and better (Berman, 2012, Sodhi and Tang, 2017). In the context of spare
    parts, Song and Zhang (2018) find that additive manufacturing creates more value
    to the firm as the number of parts increases. For the design of components, Westerweel
    et al. (2018) found that the higher design cost of additive manufacturing can
    be overcome with reduced logistical cost and reduced lead-time. From the strategic
    perspective, Dong et al. (2018) show that a firm that adopts additive manufacturing
    will offer more product variety to compete. Motivated by RepRap, a company that
    produces 3D printers that can replicate themselves, Hu and Sun (2019) study the
    tradeoff between production and sales of these self-replicable 3D printers. The
    reader is referred to Rogers et al. (2016) for a comprehensive discussion of different
    research questions arising from 3D printing services. More recently, Hedenstierna
    et al. (2019) examine the role of 3D printing in the context of outsourcing. •
    Advanced robotics. The advancements of the communication technologies, sensor
    capabilities, and artificial intelligence are making robots smarter so that they
    can work safely alongside human workers. For example, BMW has robots and human
    workers work alongside on its assembly line in its plant in South Carolina. Also,
    wearable robotics with exoskeletons can aid human workers to reduce repeated motion
    injuries due to lifting heavy boxes in the warehouse or harvesting fruits in the
    field. Companies such as Caterpillar and GE are exploring the adoption of wearable
    robotics to improve worker safety. JD.com, the largest online retailer in China,
    has adopted various advanced robots to stack products on shelves and pack merchandise
    in 500 warehouses (Marr, 2018). By 2019, JD.com implemented the world’s first
    automated warehouse in Shanghai equipped with Mujin robots (Hornyak, 2019). •
    Drones. Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles that can be controlled remotely. These
    drones can carry different sensors to record data (visual and audio) for monitoring
    and surveying operations, to carry certain devices including robotic arms for
    pick up and drop off operations, or automated sprays for farming operations. Drones
    can be viewed as an element of the internet of things. More recently, drones have
    been used for search and rescue operations. • Internet of Things (IoT). The internet
    of things refers to a system of devices (e.g., sensors) that can communicate and
    interact with others over the internet, and this system can be remotely monitored
    and controlled. With drastic reduction in cost and increase in processing speed
    for these sensors and significant improvements in measurement and communication
    technologies, the adoption rate of internet of things is growing exponentially
    in recent years. Columbus (2018) reported that, by 2020, Discrete Manufacturing,
    Transportation & Logistics and Utilities industries are projected to spend $40B
    each on IoT platforms, systems, and services. • Blockchain. A Blockchain is a
    distributed and secure ledger. As articulated by Olsen and Tomlin (2019), it is
    distributed because it can be written and accessed by different (possibly authorized)
    entities and its data is stored on a peer-to-peer network. Also, it is secure
    because once a “block” has been added to the chain (i.e., information written
    by an entity), it cannot be altered unilaterally. Despite these promises, Babich
    and Hilary (2019) identified several weaknesses of blockchain ranging from lack
    of privacy, garbage-in-garbage-out, inefficient, etc. Wang et al. (2019) conducted
    in-depth interviews with 14 supply chain experts to explore how blockchain technology
    may transform supply chain operations in the future. • Artificial Intelligence
    (AI). In contrast to the “natural intelligence” possessed by humans, AI mimics
    natural intelligence using computers to interpret external data, to learn from
    such data, and use those learnings to conduct descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive
    analysis. For example, IBM Watson is an AI system that is capable of answering
    questions posed in natural language. Also, GE uses sensors to collect data from
    its gas turbines or windmills via its Predix Cloud (an online platform), and then
    use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to conduct preventive maintenance
    before a breakdown. As the above technologies are being developing, many firms
    are exploring different ways to exploit these exciting Industry 4.0 technologies.
    At the same time, OM researchers are establishing different research agendas.
    1.2. Logistics: a diamond in the rough Within the context of Industry 4.0, OM
    research has been focusing on the manufacturing applications of these exciting
    technologies (Olsen and Tomlin, 2019). This trend is understandable because the
    term Industry 4.0 was originally intended to promote the computerization of manufacturing
    by the German government since 2011. The manufacturing focus is reflected from
    a recent survey of 1600 C-level executives across 19 countries conducted by Deloitte:
    73% of the respondents reported that they are currently developing Industry 4.0
    based technology initiatives that focus on improving operations (mostly in manufacturing),
    and yet only 6% focus on logistics (Deloitte Insights, 2018). This observation
    implies that many firms undervalue of the strategic role of the logistics function
    as a competitive lever or as a business model1. The minor role that logistics
    plays in the mind of company executives motivated us to examine the strategic
    role of logistics in the Industry 4.0 era in this paper. Specifically, we shall
    argue how companies can leverage Industry 4.0 technologies to create economic,
    environmental and social value by transforming the logistics function as: 1. A
    competitive lever; 2. A social value creator; and 3. An enabler for sustainability.
    In the remaining of this paper, we use some real examples to illustrate how different
    Industry 4.0 technologies can enable a firm, a government, or an NGO to do good
    and do well at the same time. Also, we pose some research questions for OM researchers
    to explore further. 2. Logistics service as a competitive lever Despite logistics
    is an important function that gets the right product to the right customer at
    the right time, many executives tend to view logistics as a cost to be managed
    and often overlook the fact that logistics can cause a company to make or break.
    Consider the downfall of Blockbuster in 2010. Being the world’s largest video
    rental company in 2004 with over 9000 stores world-wide, Blockbuster allowed each
    customer to rent a video from a store for a fixed fee, but the customer must return
    the video tape or DVD back to the same store within a 2-day time window (to avoid
    penalty). As the de facto monopoly, customers tolerated this business model even
    when they have to pay the penalty for being later or for returning the video to
    a different store. However, when Netflix came along in the late 90 s and allowed
    each customer to return his DVD in a pre-paid postage envelope at their own convenience
    and to receive the next DVD in his queue automatically by mail afterwards, Blockbuster
    lost the patronage and filed for bankruptcy in 2010. This example highlights the
    importance of the logistics function from the customer perspective. Another case
    in point, the demise of online grocery store Webvan and online furniture store
    furniture.com was partly due to poor logistics performance: customers complained
    about late deliveries and missing items, and the firm faced high “last mile” delivery
    cost. The above examples suggest that, to compete successfully in the retail sector,
    logistics is key. This may explain why largest online retailers such as Amazon
    and Alibaba’s Tmall invest heavily in logistics. To compete in the e-tailing sector,
    fast (and even free) and reliable delivery services become a competitive lever
    for an online store to differentiate itself from other online stores selling similar
    products at similar prices. By leveraging Amazon’s Whole Foods stores2, Amazon
    offers 2-hour home grocery delivery services (Amazon Prime Now) to its prime members
    at selected locations in the United States. Also, instead of relying on UPS and
    FedEx, Amazon created “Amazon Logistics” delivery service in 2018 to gain better
    control of the last mile delivery performance (speed, reliability, and cost).
    In 2018, the company’s fulfillment and shipping expenses amounted to $34.0 billion
    and $27.7 billion respectively, up from just over $1 billion each in 2007. The
    total logistics cost $61.7 billon accounts for 27.5% of its net revenue (Richter,
    2019). Buchman (2018) reported that Amazon operates 258 distribution and fulfillment
    centers in the United States and additional 486 such centers around the world
    by using thousands of trucks and 32 Boeing 767 aircraft. In China, to compete
    in online retailing, Alibaba took majority ownership of its subsidiary logistics
    unit Cainiao3 in 2017, and pledged to invest $15 billion over five years to build
    out a global logistics network. Based on the recent focus of Amazon and Alibaba
    on logistics, it is evident that logistics should not be viewed as a cost center.
    Instead, logistics service is a weapon that enables firms to compete on speed,
    reliability and cost. The advent of new technologies can affect the logistics
    function in several fundamental ways: 1. Faster Speed: delivery services conducted
    by drones or delivery robots. To speed up the delivery service, Amazon is exploring
    the use of drones for delivering small packages. In China, Alibaba’s food delivery
    unit Ele.me4 started delivering foods by drones in 2018 on 17 different routes
    from over 100 local restaurants in Shanghai’s Jinshan Industrial Park covering
    an area of 58 square kilometers (Tao and Yang, 2018). In 2019, Google got approval
    to use its Wing drones for home deliveries in Australia. In the meantime, researchers
    started to focus on the required operational models to route the drones to different
    customer (e.g. Carlsson and Song, 2018, Agatz et al., 2018). Also on the ground,
    unmanned vehicles are tested for faster deliveries, like the delivery robots of
    Domino’s pizza. To speed things up even further, Amazon filed a patent called
    “anticipatory shipping” in 2014. The key idea is to use predictive analytic tools
    to analyze a customer’s shopping history along with other customers’ shopping
    history to predict what she may need. In theory, anticipatory shipping would enable
    Amazon to ship products (possibly by drones) to consumers even “before” they even
    order them (Kopalle, 2014). 2. Higher Reliability: storage and retrieval systems
    using robots. To automate the storage and retrieval operations at Amazon’s fulfillment
    centers, Amazon spent $775 million in 2012 to acquire Kiva robotic system. The
    Kiva system improves productivity by recording and tracking items within the fulfillment
    center and by bringing the products directly to employees to pick, pack, and ship.
    These systems require careful design choices and operating strategies, for example
    Roy et al. (2019) analyzes the effects of different robot storage zone assignment
    and queue allocation strategies. The development of robotics exoskeletons (as
    wearable robotics along with sensors) can help the employees to improve the speed
    and reliability of their pick and pack operations and reduce repeated motion injury
    at the workplace (Ashley, 2017). 3. Lower Operating Cost: inventory monitor and
    replenishment systems using smart sensors. In physical stores, real time information
    about inventory on the shelves is often inaccurate and costly to obtain (DeHoratius
    et al. 2008). The reduction in cost and the improvement in capability of different
    sensors offer a new opportunity for stores to develop “smart shelves” using weight
    sensors that can monitor the existing quantity of items on the shelves, notify
    stock room staff to refill inventory before the item gets depleted from the shelf,
    and inform warehouse or vendor for immediate replenishment. Besides smart shelves,
    start-up company Wasteless.co is running different pilots with supermarket chains
    (e.g. with Ahold-Delhaize) using electronic tags to implement dynamic pricing.
    In the shelves of fresh products (e.g., meat, cheese, etc.), different items of
    the same product may have different expiration dates, and savvy customers will
    purchase the freshest item that has the longest expiration date. The new price
    tags of Wasteless show different prices depending on the expiration date: items
    with a short expiration date is sold at a discount defined by a smart algorithm
    considering multiple factors like weather (on a rainy day almost expired BBQ meat
    needs more discount than on a sunny day). Some pilot runs conducted in Italy suggest
    a reduction of 89% in food waste, according to Wasteless (Pieters, 2019). In a
    related development, AWM Smart Shelf offers additional value beyond logistics:
    it uses cameras mounted on its smart shelves to gather data on shopper behavior
    and demographics. By using various Artificial Intelligence tools to analyze a
    massive data, AWM can develop personalized videos to display on its smart shelves
    according to age, gender, or ethnicity (Horowitz, 2019). One step further, the
    inventory of a final end consumer in its house can also be measured. Think of
    Samsung’s smart fridges with cameras with which the owners get full information
    about inventory, expiration dates etc. Finally, with real time inventory information
    at different warehouses, an online retailer can make real time decisions about
    product price and the warehouse from which an incoming order is filled (Lei et
    al., 2018). 4. Improve Efficiency: Container shipping enabled by blockchain. Because
    ocean freight operations involve many organizations (exporters, terminal operators,
    trucking companies, customs officers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers, insurance
    companies, banks, importers, etc.) and lots of paper work (bill of lading, invoice,
    certificate of origin, freight shipping forms, inspection certificate, export
    packing list, insurance certificate, etc.) and because many processes are done
    manually, long and uncertain delays are commonly observed. Djankov et al. (2010)
    reported that the average export time in Asia is 25 days with a standard deviation
    of 12 days. When in early 2019 container ship MSC Zoe lost containers in front
    of the Dutch and German coast it took them weeks before the exact number (more
    than 340) of lost containers was known. To improve the efficiency of this archaic
    process of a $200 billion ocean freight industry, IBM and Maersk (the largest
    container carrier in the world) formed a partnership in 2017 to develop a blockchain
    platform to automate the process so that documents for shipping containers can
    be digitalized and containers can be tracked. By leveraging the distributed and
    secure capability of blockchain technology, all updated information and documentation
    can be verified and reconciled by all involved parties without duplication errors,
    and more importantly, without delay (Groenfeldt, 2017). In April 2019, China Shipbuilding
    Industry Company Limited (CSICL), a subsidiary of shipping giant China Shipbuilding
    Industry Corporation, signed an agreement with Shanghai Bank, under which it will
    explore the use of blockchain technology to financing its upstream suppliers.
    Besides ocean freight, Choi et al. (2019) examine the potential benefits of using
    blockchain technology on implementing the mean–variance (MV) theory for risk analysis
    in the context of air logistics. As these Industry 4.0 technologies are helping
    firms to transform their logistics functions as competitive weapons instead of
    cost centers, we propose a few research questions for further studies. 1. How
    should a firm redesign its supply chain structure to align with the transformed
    logistics services in the Industry 4.0 era? 2. How would these emerging technologies
    affect the way supply chain partners communicate, coordinate and collaborate?
    For example, should a retailer (customer) share its smart shelf (fridge) data
    with vendors so that vendors can offer “anticipatory replenishment” services?
    3. How would 3D-printing affect the logistics industry? For instance, instead
    of purchasing a physical product (e.g., a toy), customers can download a digital
    file and print the product at home, by passing the entire physical supply chain
    (except for the transport of the raw materials). 4. Will the economic value created
    by blockchain outweigh its implementation cost? For example, Will the economic
    benefit created by the operational efficiency in container shipping through blockchain
    far exceed its implementation cost? 5. What is the impact of advanced robotics
    on job design of human workers? Will advanced robotics become a complement or
    substitute of a human worker? 6. How would drones and robots take over the home
    deliveries? Will there be drones and delivery robots everywhere? How to organize
    and regulate these unmanned delivery services without crating chaos? 3. Logistics
    as a social value creator Besides transforming the logistics arm of a firm into
    a competitive weapon, various emerging technologies can improve the logistics
    operations by creating social value. Consider the challenges that the World Food
    Program5 (WFP) faces when distributing food and cash to refugees in war-torn countries
    or beneficiaries in disaster zones. Putting aside the challenges of getting the
    supplies, the distribution of food and cash is even more challenging because the
    distribution infrastructure is usually non-existent and the information record
    about legitimate recipients is either incomplete or inaccurate. Consequently,
    fraudulent claims are common and many legitimate recipients end up not getting
    the aid. With the advancements of blockchain technology, WFP worked with Parity
    Technologies, a startup led by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood to develop a blockchain
    platform called “World Food Programme Building Blocks” in 2017 that uses a distributed
    ledger to record the iris image of each refugee6. In doing so, the authentication
    process is only a simple iris scan that is efficient and accurate. This way, each
    legitimate refugee in Jordan can get their rationed food supply, and even cash
    for women who participate in the UN Women’s Cash for Work Programme in Jordan
    (Judkslian, 2018). We now provide a few examples in this section and conclude
    with a few research questions. 1. Faster and safer response and recovery operations
    using drones. After a natural disaster such as hurricane or forest fire, the traditional
    use of helicopters for response and recovery mission can be costly and even dangerous
    for the responders when the mission takes place at difficult terrain and at night.
    For example, one week after the landfall of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, FAA (Federal
    Aviation Administration) authorized 43 small drones to fly below 400 feet and
    away from large crowds of people to enable local authorities, and local transportation
    and utility companies to assess damage to homes, roads, bridges, power lines,
    etc. Also, Allstate insurance deployed drones to collect visual images of homes
    and send footage to Allstate’s claim adjusters so that they can evaluate different
    insurance claims (Marshall, 2017). In the same vein, search and rescue missions
    along rivers and coastlines are labor and resource intensive and inefficient.
    By using a drone equipped with a heat-sensitive infrared camera, it can quickly
    search a given search area and scan for images that fits the outline of a human
    being. In doing so, rescue forces can be sent directly to the exact location to
    perform the rescue function. Finally, on smaller scale accidents, drones can be
    life savers. In several countries such as US and the Netherland, some cities are
    equipped with automated external defibrillator (AED) drones that can be dispatched
    quickly to save patients who suffer from sudden heart attacks. 2. Improve accessibility
    to diagnostic care and drug administration by using wearable medical devices.
    In rural areas of many developing countries, the access of diagnostic care and
    pharmacy services is limited for two key reasons: (a) rural clinics are either
    not available or over-crowded; or (b) rural clinics are perceived as low quality.
    Quite often, many rural patients travel long distance to seek health services
    in cities. With the advancements of different wearable medical devices, patients
    can share their medical data with their online doctors via telemedicine. A wearable
    medical device can be defined as a biosensor that collects physiological data
    (heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen, glucose level, etc.)
    in real time. For example, Apple Watch Series 2 can monitor most data, Dexcom
    G6 is a continuous glucose wearable device that can sync its data with iOS and
    Android smart devices. With wearable medical devices that can sync with various
    smart devices, many Chinese patients are sharing their medical data with their
    online doctors via various telemedicine platforms that are more accessible and
    affordable (Liu, 2018). Besides monitoring various physiological data of a user,
    Covestgro (formerly Bayer MaterialSience LLC) launched a new wearable medical
    device Makroblend M525 in 2015 that can monitor vital signs during physical activity
    or administer drugs. Backed by Sanofi, Enable Injections is developing a wearable
    device that can deliver IV drugs that may connect to smartphones via Bluetooth
    (Muoio, 2018). 3. Improve farmer productivity by using drones and smart sensors.
    As the world population continues to grow and as the size of arable land continues
    to shrink, there is a need to develop ways to improve farmer productivity for
    growing more food in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. This need has
    motivated some startup companies to create innovative business services in agriculture
    (also known as Agriculture 4.0) by developing drones with special sensors and
    cameras that can interact with smartphones and computers. In France, a startup
    company Delair-Tech is developing a drone that can enable farmers to monitor crops
    for diseases, assess yield and identity where fertilizer is needed as in “precision
    farming”. This service is based on a subscription, and the Economist reported
    that it plans to charge 15 Euros per hectare. 4. Improve provenance by using blockchain.
    After a series of food and drug adulteration incidents (milk formula scandal in
    China, Heparin adulterated with melamine, counterfeit drugs) in recent years (Babich
    and Tang, 2012) many companies are under pressure to disclose provenance information
    about names of suppliers, materials used and produced by suppliers, etc. The logistics
    for identifying, monitoring and tracking the operations along a supply chain is
    very costly and time consuming. For this reason, many firms are using blockchain
    technology to track the provenance of products such as fish, pork, coffee, etc.
    Also, Walmart and nine other firms (Nestle, Dole, Tyson Foods, Unilever, etc.)
    partnered with IBM to use blockchain to track and trace provenance so that they
    can improve food safety and be more responsive to food recalls. Besides food,
    Luxury brand conglomerate LVMH, launched a blockchain platform in 2019 to track
    provenance so that it can authenticate certain luxury goods (Allison, 2019). 5.
    Improve mobility via smart transportation. The underlying challenges for the poor,
    the sick, and the elderly to get around result in “social exclusion”. Therefore,
    to improve social inclusion, easy access to affordable mobility is essential.
    With the advent of Internet of Things and the massive adoption of smartphones,
    Mobility as a Service (MaaS) initiatives are popping up at many cities with Helsinki
    in Finland as the leading example (Goodall et al. 2017). The underlying concept
    of MaaS is to provide all mobility options, which include public (trains, busses,
    etc.) and private (taxi, Uber, car/bike sharing) services as an “integrated” service
    provided by a single app (e.g., Whim in Helsinki). This app offers travel suggestions
    to customers based on their personal travel preferences in terms of modes, costs
    and travel time. Once a customer selected a multi-modal travel plan, he can pay
    for this travel plan via mobile payment through this app. As different cities
    are developing different MaaS app, there is hope that these apps can offer accessible
    and affordable mobility options to city dwellers7. 6. Currently, many firms are
    developing autonomous cars/taxis for transporting people; however, due to safety
    concerns, it will still take a long time before autonomous cars are able to drive
    everywhere under all circumstances (especially the interaction with bikers and
    pedestrians and severe weather conditions are challenging). However, autonomous
    buses on dedicated lanes are already employed and NEXT Future Transportation Inc.8
    is even testing autonomous vehicles in Dubai where people can transfer inside
    from one vehicle to another vehicle. It has the potential to make the cost of
    mobility even lower to improve affordable and accessible. There is an on-going
    research stream that examines the impact of the implementation of autonomous vehicles
    on the movement of people (e.g., Gkartzonikas and Gkritza, 2019, Olsen and Parker,
    2019). 7. Finally, in the Industry 4.0 era, traditional public transportation
    systems such as railways are going through different transformations. For example,
    in the Netherlands, Netherlands Railways is using smart sensors to monitor the
    weights of different railcars and to predict the future capacity (sitting and
    standing) of each railcar before the train arrives at the next station. Then Netherlands
    Railways can use its mobile app to notify passengers waiting on the platform at
    the next station about available space on different railcars. This real time information
    can lead to faster dwell times, fewer delays, and better customer service quality.
    To shorten dwell times and reduce unnecessary delays even further, Netherlands
    Railways has equipped all conductors with smart watches informing them the exact
    second at which the train should depart. 8. In the grand scheme of things, Industry
    4.0 technologies enable a smart city to create new social values derived from
    the interconnectivity of smart buildings, smart grid, smart mobility and smart
    retail. Qi and Shen (2019) discuss several research opportunities arising from
    the increasing integration of smart systems and business models at the urban scale.
    The above examples illustrate how Industry 4.0 technologies can create social
    value. At the same time, it raises several research questions. 1. By leveraging
    the data collected by different wearable medical devices, how should the government
    (or an insurance company) develop incentive mechanisms to encourage users to improve
    their health conditions? 2. Precision farming based on drones can certainly provide
    value to farmers. However, to monetize this type of service when farmers are unsure
    about its value, how should a service provider determine its pricing strategies?
    Should it be subscription based? Should the firm consider a risk-sharing pricing
    strategy? 3. As different firms form partnership using blockchain technology to
    track and trace the operations along the supply chain, there is a concern about
    privacy. How can this issue be dealt with? To ensure that the virtual copy corresponds
    to the physical copy of the supply chain operations, who should audit the records
    and how often should the record be audited? 4. Mobility as a Service requires
    synchronization between many stakeholders (municipalities, transportation operators,
    data providers etc.) and the passengers. Which pricing mechanism should one use
    to coordinate supply and demand? How to organize monthly mobility subscriptions
    with a fixed/unlimited amount of miles per month? How to share the profit amongst
    different transportation operators? 4. Logistics as a sustainability enabler Besides
    economic and social values, there is a rising concern about “sustainability” and
    a clarion call for renewable energy, carbon footprint reduction, endanger species
    protection, and ecosystem sustainability. This concern is legitimate because the
    growing demand generated from the world’s growing and ageing population (from
    7 billion in 2017 to over 9 billion by 2050) far exceeds the shrinking supply
    of natural resources (arable land, natural water sources, oil and gas, etc.)9.
    This concern has caused the public to become more aware about environmental issues
    (e.g., climate change, deforestation, and water and air pollution) and social
    issues (e.g., poverty, hunger, income inequality, gender equity, population growth)
    over the last two decades, and this public concern is also reflected in the Millennium
    Development Goals (United Nation 2000)10. For example, by analyzing global data
    on fisheries and ocean temperature maps between 1930 and 2010, scientists from
    Rutgers University in New Jersey discover that global warming has significantly
    affected fish stocks worldwide by 4% (Gerretsen, 2019). To make things worse,
    the ecosystem is damaged even further as fishing trawlers are catching all sea
    foods by pulling huge fishing nets along the bottom of the sea or in midwater
    at a specified depth in West Africa (Adams, 2019). Without immediate interventions
    and strict law enforcements around the world, the planet’s ecosystem is collapsing
    at an alarming rate. As the supply of natural resource is shrinking quickly, many
    firms are concerned about sustainable supply of raw materials in developing countries
    (e.g., coffee beans, cocoa beans, etc.) for their production. Currently, firms
    and governments are exploring ways to apply different emerging technologies to
    address some of the sustainability issues. 1. Protect endangered species from
    extinction by using drones and AI. Across Africa and Asia, illegal trades of endangered
    species that worth $7 to $10 billion annually are threatening the survivals of
    elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, etc. Just between 2007 and 2017, over 7245 African
    Rhinos have been lost to poaching and they will be extinct without immediate human
    interventions. Over the last decade, many organizations such as World Wildlife
    Fund (WWF) and Save the Rhino collected donations and contributed funds to recruit
    more rangers to safe guard these Rhinos. However, this approach is very costly
    and inefficient. Currently, scientists are developing innovative methods to save
    these animals. First, through direct observations obtained from various recording
    from drones, scientists from IBM learned that Zebras normally move along-side
    Rhinos. When facing a predator (e.g., a lion), a herd of zebra will scatter. However,
    when encountering a poacher with a gun, these animals will move in opposite direction.
    Anticipating this behavior, these scientists put radio collars on zebras so that
    they can monitor the location and movement of these zebras. This way, they can
    alert the rangers when the zebras move in opposite direction to reduce poaching.
    Second, by using machine learning and deep learning to analyze historical data
    on poaching incidents, computer scientists can predict when and where Rhinos were
    likely to be poached so that rangers and drones can patrol these target areas
    to prevent poaching. In 2012, Google offered $5 million to support WWF to expand
    its conservation-drone program in Africa and Asia to protect these animals from
    harm’s way (Tang, 2018). 2. Reduce water waste in farming by using drones and
    data analytics. In Chile, researchers are developing drones with spectral sensors
    and cameras that can allow farmers to monitor the condition of their crops from
    their smartphones. By analyzing the data captured by camera using spectral analysis,
    farmers can monitor moisture content, ground water, plant health, and pest infestation
    as well as growth rate of the plant. This way, farmers can “localize” water and
    pest control, saving water and improving yield (Scandella, 2015). Finally, a Spanish
    startup BrioAgro installs underground sensors to collect data on the moisture
    and light levels and the soil nutrients. By analyzing the data transmitted from
    these sensors to BrioAgro, the startup company prescribes “localized” water and
    fertilizer solutions via farmers’ mobile phone. In doing so, farmers can reduce
    water waste via precision farming. 3. Reduce emission via smart transportation.
    By leveraging the ridesharing information technology that enables a platform (e.g.,
    Uber, Didi) to track and trace all vehicles and all customers in the system in
    real time, pooling services such as Uber (Pool), VIA and BlaBlaCar are becoming
    more popular. Also, autonomous vehicles can increase the number of shared rides
    even more in the future: a study in Switzerland indicates that 61% of the respondents
    prefer a pooled shared autonomous vehicle over a private autonomous vehicle (Stoiber
    et al., 2019). In addition to pooling rides among passengers, pooling between
    parcels and drivers (so called “crowd shipping”) is gaining traction. A crowd
    shipping platform assigns drivers (ordinary persons who registered with the platform)
    to parcels for them to deliver to their neighbors on their way back home from
    the office or from a shop. Therefore, by piggybacking the rides that the drivers
    would have taken anyway, this crowd shipping platform reduces the number of deliveries
    via traditional delivery vans and thereby reduces emissions. To push this crowd
    shipping idea further, it is possible for the platform to facilitate transfers
    of goods between crowd shippers reduces the system wide required travel distances
    even further (Sampaio et al. 2018). For a more detailed overview of crowd sourced
    logistics systems, the reader is referred to Sampaio et al. (2019b) for details.
    Crowd shipping is one of the initiatives to better utilize the space in individual’s
    cars. Another initiative is “trunk delivery service” under which a Logistics Service
    Provider (LSP) such as DHL can gain temporary access to the trunk of the customer’s
    car (Volvo, GM, Ford, or Lincoln) so that the LSP can deliver the goods even when
    the customer is not home. Doing so can reduce emissions because it reduces the
    need for the LSP to visiting the customer again or for the customer to pick up
    the goods at a designated collection point (Liu et al, 2019). However, the potential
    is even higher if customers can share their full itinerary with the LSP so that
    the LSP can choose the most convenient time slot and location for their deliveries
    (Reyes et al., 2017, Ozbaygin et al., 2017, and Sampaio et al. 2019a). 4. Sustain
    supply of high quality agricultural products by using blockchain. Many well sought
    after agricultural products (e.g., coffee beans, cocoa beans, shea nuts) are produced
    by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Because the supply chain operations
    is complex and often opaque and the market price of these products tend to fluctuate
    significantly, farmers get low and unstable wages (or prices) for their efforts.
    In many cases, they may abandon one crop and switch to a different crop, making
    the supply even more unstable. To sustain the supply of high quality coffee beans,
    Starbucks launched the C.A.F.E. program that is intended to help farmers to develop
    sustainable farming practices (e.g., organic farming, drip irrigation, etc.) and
    donated millions of disease-resistant trees (100 millions by 2025) to help farmers
    fight different threats such as coffee leaf rust. At the same time, Starbucks
    worked with various NGOs (e.g., Rainforest Alliance) to ensure farmers are compensated
    fairly for their sustainable farming practices. However, such effort is labor
    intensive and often inaccurate. To overcome this challenge, Denver’s Coda Coffee
    partnered with a startup bext360 to develop the world’s first blockchain-traced
    coffee that integrates machine vision, blockchain, cloud computing, and AI to
    trace every step: coffee bean collection, washing, drying, milling, export, roasting
    and retail operations (Philips, 2018). For instance, smallholder farmers in Uganda
    can deposit their collected beans into a “bextmachine” that uses 3D scanners,
    machine vision, and AI (machine learning) to determine the quantity and quality
    of the coffee beans. Then the bextmachine will issue a receipt to farmers so that
    they can collect fair payments. The above examples illustrate how these emerging
    technologies can be used to improve sustainability. As firms and government are
    applying these emerging technologies to improve sustainability, there are some
    research questions that deserve our attention: 1. Various technologies can be
    applied to reduce poaching of endangered species. However, as supply decreases,
    some ethical buyers may be willing to offer an even higher price. As such, more
    poachers will enter the market and create a potentially bigger problem. If one
    examines the supply and demand dynamics, how should the government develop programs
    to curb the demand instead of the supply of endangered species? 2. It is well
    known that approximately 80% of the fresh water withdrawn from rivers and groundwater
    is used to produce food and other agricultural products, what kind of incentive
    programs that the government should use to provide economic incentive for farmers
    to adopt water conservation solutions willingly? 3. Trunk deliveries and crowd
    shipping appear to be promising; however, the issues of trust and safety are two
    obstacles for these innovative ideas to take hold. What are the mechanisms that
    crowd shipping and truck deliveries should develop to ensure trust and safety
    for all involved parties? 4. While blockchain technology appears to be promising,
    there are potential weaknesses that can undermine the good intentions of different
    entities (Babich and Hilary, 2019). Also, because the adoption of blockchain technology
    requires participation and commitment of different entities, conflicts ensue.
    Saberi et al. (2019) propose four blockchain technology adoption barriers and
    future research directions. Therefore, a natural question is: what are the mechanisms
    that can facilitate commitments and self-enforcements for different entities to
    adopt blockchain technology? 5. Conclusion We have discussed the potential use
    of emerging technologies (drones, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, artificial
    intelligence, etc.,) for transforming the logistics function from being mundane
    to exciting, and for enabling the logistics function as a competitive lever, a
    social value creator, and a sustainability enabler. Table 1 characterizes some
    of the research questions raised in this paper. Table1. Some key research questions

    competitiveness of a logistics service provider? How should the government regulate
    blockchain technology that can balance conflicting objectives associated with
    different stakeholders? How would supply chain transparency facilitated by blockchain
    technology improve ethical supply chain practice? We have also raised some concerns
    about the applications of these technologies. Besides many technologies are not
    proven, they may create other problems including: social unrests due to job losses
    to automation (e.g., autonomous vehicles, robots, drones, etc.), social inequality
    due to the fact that these technologies often involve smart phones and smart devices
    that are still inaccessible by the poor, and even more severe income inequality
    especially when the technologies often create more benefits for the educated class.
    Given all these challenges, researchers should also examine the impact of these
    emerging technologies on the welfare of different socio-economic classes of citizens
    (Sodhi and Tang, 2014). Also, despite recent advances of different technologies
    that support the Industry 4.0 movement, companies must take measures to mitigate
    several underlying risks: • Cyberattacks. As supply chains are becoming more digitalized
    and rely on real time communication and coordination of many different devices
    (sensors, robots, drones, etc.), there is a heightened concern about cybersecurity.
    For instance, because industry 4.0 involves many devices communicating via different
    operating systems and different information systems, digitalized supply chains
    can be vulnerable to cyberattacks. These attacks can include industrial espionage,
    IP leakage, or even production sabotage. In some cases, cyberattacks can bring
    an entire logistics/transportation system to its knees. • Faulty data. Smart devices
    are capable of sensing, collecting, sharing, analyzing data, etc. so that they
    can facilitate many supply chain operations smoothly. However, if the system is
    being hacked or if the system is not functioned properly, disasters ensue as we
    witnessed two crashed of Boeing’s 737 Max in 2019 due to faulty readings of a
    key sensor. It is simply too risky to rely on smart devices to manage a supply
    chain; hence, companies must develop a fool-proof protocol with human interventions.
    • Safety regulations. Many firms are exploring the use of advance robotics and
    automated guided vehicles in manufacturing, robotic systems in automated storage
    and retrieval warehouse operations, and autonomous trucks and drones in delivery
    operations. Some standard safety guidelines and regulations must be developed
    to ensure worker and public safety. For instance, the operations of Heathrow and
    Gatwick airports in London airports were disrupted after unauthorized drones were
    flying within the restricted airspace in 2018. • Privacy issues. Many sensors
    record visuals and sounds of different movements of different people in many places.
    For example, many smart shelves record shopper’s demographic data and their shopping
    habits within a shop. As such, there is a legitimate concern over privacy issues
    about this massive data collection. The government must develop regulatory measures
    to ensure companies collect and store this data properly for public safety. In
    summary, the emerging technologies that support the Industry 4.0 movement create
    excitement because they are disruptive so that many new business models can emerge.
    At the same time, they create concerns over employment and safety. However, if
    the private and public sectors can collaborate with the government to establish
    mutually beneficial plans, these technologies can create value for companies and
    the society at large. Acknowledgment We thank Professor T.M. Choi for inviting

    operations, we define logistics more “broadly” and it includes transportation
    of humans and goods. Specifically, in our view, the logistics function deals with
    the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving human, materials, equipment,
    information and finance. In many instances, this coordination entails the movements
    of materials, humans, and/or equipment, the exchanges of information among humans
    and or devices, and the transactions of finance among entities. 2 Amazon acquired

    Logistics is an internet technology company that specializes in “platform services”
    for logistics networks. It offers logistics services to different vendors who
    sell products on Alibaba’s Tmall by using an online platform to coordinate the
    logistics functions provided by different delivery service providers. 4 Ele.me
    is an online platform that offers online food delivery service by coordinating
    customers, restaurants, and meal delivery service providers in China. It was acquired
    by Alibaba in 2018. 5 The World Food Program is the food-assistance branch of
    the United Nations. It is the world''s largest humanitarian organization addressing

    GPS in each bus and widespread adaptation of smart phones, this can be organized
    (especially outside peak hours) in a more flexible way, similar as the ride sharing
    systems (e.g. Quadrifoglio et al., 2006, 2008 and Qui et al., 2015), resulting
    in more people taking the bus and less empty mileage outside rush-hours. 8 https://www.next-future-mobility.com/.

    ways in which water supply companies in England and Wales are adapting to climate
    change, evaluated in the context of a model of the adaptation process. The four
    components of the model are (i) awareness of and concern about the potential impacts
    of climate change, (ii) adaptation strategy, (iii) the concept of an adaptation
    space from which options are selected, and (iv) the notion that three groups of
    factors influence awareness, strategy and option selection: susceptibility to
    change, internal characteristics of the organisation, and regulatory and market
    context. Public water supply in England and Wales is provided by private sector
    companies, subject to environmental and economic regulation. Hydrological simulations
    suggest that climate change has the potential to reduce the reliability of supply
    sources over the next few decades. The industry in December 2004 completed a review
    of investment requirements over the next five years. Awareness of climate change
    is high in the water industry, but by developing assessment procedures and incorporating
    them into the investment review the regulators forced companies to consider explicitly
    the potential impacts of climate change in a consistent and rigorous manner. These
    analyses combined climate change with other pressures on water resources, and
    in practice companies did not attribute specific investment decisions or proposals
    to climate change or indeed any other individual drivers. The broad strategy adopted
    by all water supply companies – to maintain standards of service – is determined
    by regulatory controls and market considerations, but the degree of concern about
    the impacts of climate change and precise adaptation options necessary to address
    supply-demand imbalances varied between water supply companies, reflecting local
    geographic conditions. The water supply companies and regulators have different
    perspectives on the relative merits of supply-side and demand-side measures, reflecting
    different organisational priorities. The 2004 investment review determined that
    no specific actions were necessary to deal with future climate change, but that
    measures set in place – in terms of methodologies and investment in investigations
    into specific resource developments – provided a sound foundation for more specific
    actions in the next investment review in five years time. The paper concludes
    by summarising the factors assisting and constraining adaptation over the next
    few decades. Article PDF Similar content being viewed by others Managing Current

    Get rights and content Abstract The development of industrialization and information
    communication technology (ICT) has deeply changed our way of life. In particular,
    with the emerging theory of “Industry 4.0”, the integration of cloud technologies
    and industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) becomes increasingly important, as
    this will greatly improve the manufacturing chain and business services. In this
    paper, we first describe the development and character of ICPS. ICPS will inevitably
    play an important role in manufacturing, sales, and logistics. With the support
    of the cloud, ICPS development will impact value creation, business models, downstream
    services, and work organization. Then, we present a service-oriented ICPS model.
    With the support of the cloud, infrastructure platform and service application,
    ICPS will promote the manufacturing efficiency, increase quality of production,
    enable a sustainable industrial system and more environmentally friendly businesses.
    Thirdly, we focus on some key enabling technologies, which are critical in supporting
    smart factories. These key enabling technologies will also help companies to realize
    high quality, high output, and low cost. Finally, we talk about some challenges
    of ICPS implementation and the future work. Previous article in issue Next article

    wireless networks 1. Introduction The rapid development of information communication
    technologies (ICTs) has significantly changed design, manufacturing, logistics,
    and service. Especially in the process of Industry 4.0, due to the deep integration
    of micro controller and physical devices, our machines and tools are becoming
    more automated and self-sufficient, increasingly replacing manual labor. The integration
    of computing, communication, and control technologies has led to developments
    in real-time sensing, the dynamic control of large-scale engineering systems,
    information services, and production life cycle management (PLCM). Yet these technologies
    still do not fulfill our needs. The final aims of cyber physical systems (CPS)
    [1], [2], [3] are to realize “intelligent monitoring” and “intelligent control”.
    These are the processes which need to realize real-time information extraction,
    data analysis, decision making and data transmission. On the other hand, the human
    race is meeting two tremendous challenges: global climate change and the energy
    crisis. The demands of sustainable development and green business have become
    more prominent in our daily life, and ICT as a key support to optimize manufacturing
    chain will play an important role in it. So, the work of integration of physical
    world and cyber world is inevitable [4], [5], [6]. And many countries has made
    CPS as a national development strategy and put it on the top of the priority list.
    Germany’s implementation of Industry 4.0 has received great attention in the business
    world, resulting in more companies wanting to improve their manufacturing chains
    to realize it. CPS is effective in combining computation with a physical process,
    thus achieving the goal of integration of industrialization and ICT [7]. Furthermore,
    CPS combines embedded computers, networks, sensors, and actuators [8], [9], which
    are important for smart manufacturing. Such as in the process of PLCM, ICPS will
    help meet customer demand by monitoring every part of production, realizing real-time
    logistics, and providing comprehensive customer services. Additionally, applications
    of CPS will have the giant potential to change the world in many fields [10].
    These include population crisis, environment protection, health care, easing transportation
    pressure, the control of smart grids, saving energy, etc. It is also easy to envision
    new capabilities, such as supply to manufacturing chains, to realize smart production,
    smart logistics, smart grids and real-time services. Currently, due to the increased
    popularity of smart manufacturing and smart factories, ICPS cannot fulfill our
    demand. In the process of Industry 4.0, traditional industries are hard to integrate
    industrial sources, social sources and share them [11]. What is more, companies
    need more hardware and software platforms to optimize their industry chains. Moreover,
    the fast growing data volume is hard to process. But now, the ICPS technologies
    cannot support ultra-fast computing and high throughout reliable networks, which
    are essential for businesses. Without enough resources, it cannot provide real-time
    and reliable services to corporations. Thus, an industrial cloud to support to
    ICPS will be highly beneficial. Industrial clouds will supply all kinds of manufacturing
    services and realize the open collaboration between manufacturing resources and
    services, as well as to enable a high degree of social resource sharing. Moreover,
    this will supply a big platform to generate a series of new service models for
    PLCM, including supply standards, specifications, and sharing resources. Meanwhile,
    industrial cloud will take more optimization to ICPS that now discussed. 1.1.
    Provide distributed fast computing With the development of big data and cloud
    computing, the multi-channel distributed computing method achieves fast computational
    speed. What is more, the cloud can supply a big source pool to store, process,
    and analyze these data, which will generate accurate data information and reduce
    costs. 1.2. Provide flexibility and scalability services Everyday, there are numerous
    data and application uploads on the cloud. These sources can be easily searched
    by enterprises to help them ascertain customers’ demand, design products and manage
    products life cycle. Meanwhile, the cloud can be as a big platform for every company
    to storage their data, analysis their information and utilize these upload application
    to optimize their manufacturing chain, increase their production efficiency and
    reduce cost. 1.3. Provide security Private, public, and hybrid clouds all contain
    many high-reliability security mechanisms to provide safe service. This is similar
    to the scheme of “end-to-end security”, which is used to ensure information security
    in the process of sending and receiving e-mails. Moreover, with the support of
    clouds [12], [13], data storage and exchange become faster and faster, which enables
    the construction of intelligent factories. In the industrial environment, with
    the support of the cloud, the CPS system will promote the objects of production
    directly or via the Internet to achieve independent information exchange, operation
    and mutual manipulation through machine to machine (M2M) communication [14]. This
    model will make great progress in the industrial processes of manufacturing, industrial
    engineering, material utilization, supply chain management and PLCM. Just like
    the expression in the Fig. 1, ICPS will focus on the building of smart factories
    and through cloud to combine them with smart mobility, smart grids, smart buildings,
    smart production and smart logistics. Furthermore, the cloud will augment optimize
    industry chain, increase production efficiency, data exchanges and applications
    [15], [16]. The cloud is like a huge resource pool. In any process of the ICPS,
    we can deploy services via the cloud to acquire our required information and help
    us improve our service chain. Furthermore, the cloud can be used as a storage
    server and information exchange tool, making the manufacturing chain more flexible
    and usable to provide customers with goods of higher quality and personalization

    image Fig. 1. The structure of cloud-assisted ICPS. However, in the implementation
    of ICPS, we can find obvious gaps between the ideal situation and reality. Cloud-assisted
    ICPS needs high integration of the cyber world (which includes communication technologies,
    computing technologies, big data, etc.) and the physical world (which includes
    industrial manufacturing chains, sensors, actuators, etc.) [18]. The development
    of these enabling technologies will determine the realization of ICPS. In this
    paper, we explore the novel service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS model. We express
    the views that against the backdrop of Industry 4.0, this model will substantially
    improve production chains and can realize smart manufacturing and smart factories.
    Next, according to the demand of ICPS, we depict some key enabling technologies
    and show their larger applications in industry. We also discuss challenges that
    will be met in this process and propose solutions. With the support of the cloud
    and integration of the cyber and physical worlds, our approach can actualize smart
    mobility, smart grids, smart logistics and smart products. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 addresses the architecture of service-oriented
    ICPS. Section 3 talks about some key enabling technologies that are used in ICPS.
    Section 4 depicts the challenges that are needed to solve existing challenges.
    In Section 5, we express our predictions and discuss future work. 2. Architecture
    of service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS Due to the fast development of our society
    and fast consumption of resources, sustainability becomes an important issue and
    garners attention. Two key ICT technologies provide an important role in the sustainability
    of industrial systems: service-oriented architectures (SOA) and CPS [19], [20].
    SOA’s advantages make it suitable for a growing number of industrial systems,
    including integration flexibility and the ability for processes to be composed.
    CPS involves the integration of the computational and physical worlds. In factories,
    the same principles apply as in the personal sector [21], [22]. With the perfection
    of infrastructure service platform, it will make automation more easily. All kinds
    of sensors perceive the physical information around them, and transform these
    data to control centers. Then, the control centers will give the order to actuators
    to change a station. It uses the method of embedded systems to integrate computation,
    sensors and actuators in devices [23]. Then, industrial networks supply the support
    of M2M communication, break the limitation of source constraints, and achieve
    resource sharing and distributed computing. Among network layers, numerous devices
    link the Internet. These computers, storage devices and control devices can be
    integrated as services and provide support to accomplish specific tasks, and provide
    virtual computing for terminals [24]. These may also create many applications
    for industries. These software component technologies, including object-oriented
    design and service-oriented architectures, are built on abstractions that match
    software better than physical systems [25], [26]. These features will improve
    convenience in the personal and industrial sectors. In the near future, information
    will be the core resource of every enterprise. Every company will endeavor to
    provide the best services to their customers. By searching customers’ demand,
    data on the manufacture of products, customer service, and PLCM will be available
    to industries, which is just the core of quality of service (QoS). Thus, big data
    and cloud services will inevitably play an important role in our daily manufacturing
    [27], [28]. With these cloud service platform, we can easily storage and analyze
    our data, exchange information among companies, integrate production chain between
    enterprises and transform our production mode. But we must think about several
    questions, such as how to find the demands of customers, what machines should
    cooperate with others, where is the best place for selling, and what is the problem
    with our product. The answers will easily find through cloud and obviously provide
    significant improvement to companies. As we show in the Fig. 2, in the process
    of implement of service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS, we can divide it as three
    steps. The first is to deploy infrastructure to make equipments become smart and
    can communication with others. The second step is to supply them platform for
    processing their data and information. The last is to provide various applications
    to promote their production efficiency and industrial chain. What’s more, cloud
    multimedia services can provide an efficient, flexible, and scalable data processing
    method and offer a solution for the user demands of high quality and diversified
    file formats. We can easily obtain every device’s real-time station and every
    user’s demand, so we can provide high quality, high speed, humanization, individualization
    and real-time service [29]. Download : Download high-res image (582KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The mode of service-oriented ICPS. Our paper
    will focus on the SOA’s following advantages that are essential for industrial
    system. 2.1. Comprehensive and distributed services For every company, these comprehensive
    and distributed services provide support to manage their workflows, optimize their
    manufacturing chains, provide high quality and low price product to their customers,
    etc. With the various kinds and different levels of services to choose from, our
    enterprises can select the most fitting server depending on the timeliness, reliability
    and energy efficiency desired. For instance, a company can accurately find the
    customers’ demand and give them real-time help, which is based on the data that
    was composed from customers’ location, hobby, context-aware searching [30], [31]
    and some others. 2.2. Transparency services In industrial systems, we may often
    encounter equipment that can’t be extended to more applications due to the core
    layer limits. Because, every enterprise prefer selling their products to selling
    their technologies because these data and technologies is their lifeline and they
    do not want to share with others. This is just a problem of protecting private
    information. However, for service-oriented architectures, the services will be
    transparent for all the industries and they can easily monitor the performance
    of all the devices and find problems in a timely fashion. 2.3. Service security
    An increasing number of data attacks and information leakage has influenced the
    core interests of enterprises. It may even destroy the industrial chain just like
    the Iran petroleum system accident. For another part, many companies may spend
    much more money to buy some well-known security mechanisms to protect their workflow.
    However, these mechanisms are not suitable for ICPS networks and systems because
    they can’t provide any fine-grain access control. Service-oriented architecture,
    on the other hand, allows fine grain access control on every service and method
    on a case-by-case basis. This is similar to the end-to-end plugins that are made
    by Google, which provides terminal-to-terminal email encryption. User data will
    be encrypted when it leaves the browsers, and will be decrypted when the message
    is received by the recipient. Comparing the ICPS and traditional manufacturing
    systems, we can find that, with the support of cloud and some other technologies,
    the industrial manufacturing will become more efficient, flexible, fast and humanized.
    Just as show in Table 1, the ICPS will help us to realize sustainable manufacturing
    and green business. Table 1. The compare with traditional manufacturing system
    and ICPS. Type Traditional manufacturing system ICPS Production mode Manual control,
    assembly line operation Remote control, automatic production Single production
    process and production line Flexible production line Semi-mechanical assembly-line

    individual cost and material is the same Flexibility All the designs are determined
    by designers Customer can change their design at any time Real-time Customer cannot
    get their ideal product until the enterprise has designed and produced it Smart
    production and smart logistics provide real-time products Personal-oriented service
    The transaction is terminal after the sale The company monitors the product’s
    life cycle and provides customer service 3. Key enabling technologies During the
    process of ICPS, WSN, internet of things, industrial cloud technologies and some
    other enabling technologies will take so much promotion to it. We can divide ICPS
    into three levels, the first is infrastructure that is aim to connect every device
    and realize smart interoperability. This process can be represented as M2M communication
    that is committed to make all of machines connective. The second level is network
    level, which is to achieve intelligent communication. In which, industrial wireless
    network plays an important role. The top level is cloud, which is a big service
    platform to storage information, analysis data, supply applications, etc. 3.1.
    Industrial cloud technologies ICPS is the process of integrating computation into
    manufacturing chains and other areas of LCM. It is necessary to process the data
    that come from different companies, different devices and various communication
    networks. Then, we need to analyze it and acquire the key information for our
    daily production, which is the format of smart manufacturing. Furthermore, with
    the support of cloud technologies, it will generate an increasing number of applications
    to improve the manufacturing chain. 3.1.1. Industrial cloud computing Due to the
    explosive growth of data volume and real-time service concept, we need more rapid
    methods to deal with these data. Cloud computing will change the traditional way
    of passive market research model and use the active perception, discovery to realize
    accurate insight into market information. In addition, cloud computing is to use
    public servers and network device [32]. It will reduce most cost on equipment
    and allows companies to focus on increasing their core value services. What’s
    more, due to the advantages of cloud platform, most service system is scalability
    and flexibility. It can easy to transplant to another platform. In industrial
    manufacturing chains, due to the demand of manufacturing and PLCM, cloud computing
    is different from traditional cloud technologies and has its own characteristics.
    In the information age, the core competitiveness of a company is fast information
    and real-time responses, which require the cloud technologies to provide fast,
    accurate and uninterrupted computing from social resources and manufacturing resources.
    In another part, Industry 4.0 will generate countless data from various domains
    like sensors, machines, social networks and LCM. This means the cloud computing
    must integrate these data and find the useful information. The growing popularity
    of social computing, which is used to help people understand and study the various
    problems in the social sciences, and promote benefits and an enhanced level of
    human social activities through ICT. In industries, this technology will help
    business to analyze the social behavior and computational system to find social
    demand, and optimize life cycle management. Now, with the increase of social computing
    platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Skype and YouTube, it will speed the development
    of intelligent manufacturing and provide personalized and real-time service to
    customers. 3.1.2. Industrial big data Big data and cloud computing are highly
    interdependent. Without cloud computing, big data is useless and vice versa. Now,
    with the development of industrialization, the quantity of machines have several
    times as many as human beings, and the amount of data generated from manufacturing
    chains continually increases. Industrial sensors, radio frequency identification
    systems, bar codes, industrial automation control systems, enterprise resource
    planning, computer aided design and other technologies are increasingly rich in
    industrial data volume. These data are huge and unstructured, which is difficult
    to process, so we must use some professional tools to solve it. Recently, however,
    applications can process these big data within a “tolerable elapsed time” [33].
    The goal of industrial CPS is to find the customers’ demand and provide personalized
    product and real-time PLCM, so it is necessary to collect and analyze these data
    [34]. The most challenging aspect is to explore the large volumes of data and
    extract useful information or knowledge for future actions [35]. In our survey,
    there are 48 h of video uploaded to YouTube, 100 thousand statuses in twitter,
    and billions of other messages every minute. What’s more, these data have high
    volume, variety data types and formats, so we must use some special database and
    hardware environments to collect and process them. The volume of data is very
    large (as large as exa-bytes), and arises from various domains, including public
    information, sensors, climate and other channels [36], [37], [38]. Several new
    types of “octopus” data collection platforms now exist, the most common tools
    including the following. (1) ScraperWiki [39], a web-based platform for collaboratively
    building programs to extract and analyze public (online) data. (2) Needlebase
    [40], which can schedule a scraper to run at regular intervals, while re-formatting
    data to clarify it, filter it, or make it compatible with other sets of data.
    Then, it visualizes and combines data from more than one source. (3) Hadoop [41]
    contains a distributed file system (HDFS), and supports high error tolerance.
    It can be deployed in low-cost hardware to increase throughput. (4) Thingspeak
    [42] is a free web service hosted by an I/O bridge that lets you collect and store
    sensor data and develop IoT applications. The data from multiple sensors can be
    sent to ThingSpeak from Arduino, Raspberry Pi and some others. Then, ThingSpeak
    can integrate with matlab to analyze and visualize these data, etc. As shown in
    Fig. 3, all kinds of applications collect these initial data and store them in
    different ways. Due to the different structure of data, we need to extract and
    integrate them. Then, we use some professional algorithm to analyze it and find
    the useful information like customers’ demand, transport conditions, weather changes
    and medical status. We can image a scene that when we share our new ideas of some
    products with friends through social networking, we may never wish to realize
    these functions right now. However, with the support of cloud technologies, enterprises
    can use data mining to search your demands, then use 3D printing to produce personalized
    product and deliver the goods to you through smart logistics. Download : Download

    of data processing. 3.2. Industrial wireless networks In the form of modern intelligent
    manufacturing, the maximum demand is to realize collaboration among companies,
    devices and terminals. This corporate synergy takes the form of horizontal integration,
    which is to gather the advantages of various companies to provide better services.
    However, in an enterprise, the demand is to coordinate each device to work together
    and produce better goods. The end-to-end integration aims to use sensors, controllers
    and actuators to realize intelligent monitoring [43], [44], intelligent manufacturing,
    intelligent logistics, and real-time communication. In this process, the most
    important thing is information exchange, which includes information interactions
    between devices, companies, and clouds [45]. Especially in our manufacturing chain,
    where all kinds of machines, sensors, and equipment must work at the same time,
    we don’t have enough workers to perform these tasks. Instead, we transmit some
    program to these machines to make them work by themselves and even some places
    where people can’t reach, which is needed for remote operation. In this scenario,
    wireless networking as a substitute for traditional Ethernet has a big advantage.
    In the ICPS, Industrial wireless networking is an important link and safeguard
    technology between machines, terminals and cloud [46], [47]. It will allow us
    to flexibly communicate with any piece of equipment without any restrictions of
    time and place [48], [49], [50]. Moreover, it will provide support when we want
    to ascertain the demand. A wireless network will also mean much in the PLCM. There
    are many kinds of wireless access point (AP) that suitable for industrial environment.
    Just as shown in Table 2, different AP has his own advantages and characteristic,
    but all of them will supply big promotion to manufacturing chain. In this paper,
    we depict some obvious advantages in industrial systems compared to traditional
    communication technologies. Table 2. The characteristics of some mainstream wireless
    AP. Manufacturers Characteristic Siemens [51] Supply multi band protocol Logic

    long distance communication Advantech [54] Multiple jump technology Fast roaming
    handover Multiple security mechanisms 3.2.1. Reliability In traditional communication
    links, with line constraints and aging, there are always much problems such as
    communication with terminals and areas where lines cannot reach. However, industrial
    wireless networks (IWN) [55], [56] can fulfill our demand of real-time communication
    while maintaining a robust environment. Furthermore, in some special companies,
    the environment is corrosive and IWN is the only substitute to communicate. 3.2.2.
    Flexibility The IWN requires no cable ties, and the worker can easily configure
    the placement of sensors and meet different demands of smart monitors [57]. Furthermore,
    it also requires a large amount of support to control the machines (especially
    the mobile AGV). 3.2.3. Usability Compared to traditional Ethernet, distributed
    intelligent wireless sensor systems can realize the control of the industrial
    processes independently [58]. The AP can dynamically change depending on the environment
    and machines, and monitor every part of the manufacturing chain. It can help to
    improve the manufacturing chain to realize QoS and low cost. 3.2.4. Security Data
    attacks and information loss are an ever-increasing problem. Security has become
    a big issue and interest is growing everywhere. New forms of encryption will require
    companies to provide more support during the transmission of information and business
    dealings. 3.3. M2M communications In the traditional manufacturing chain, every
    machine was isolated and worked independently. In the time of intelligent manufacturing,
    M2M technologies will integrate these devices and realize cooperative work [59],
    [60]. It can also include limited human intervention. All of the equipment is
    connected to the Internet and is more valuable when it works interdependently
    than individually. Additionally, more and more autonomous and smart services can
    be generated based on the interconnected devices. WSNs are the basic supplements
    of M2M [61], and M2M is the foundation of CPS. With all machines connected to
    the Internet through ICT and WSN, the physical world has been connected to the
    cyber world. However, CPS needs the cyber world and physical world to interact
    with each other, which is an evolution of M2M in intelligent information processing
    [62]. In the development of ICPS, M2M will play a significant role. The development
    of communications will include human-2-human, human-2-machine, and machine-2-machine.
    This is points to the development of a number of application cases that are service-oriented
    and exposed from physical devices, such as sensors, RFIDs, actuators, and machines.
    With the integration of these equipment and terminals, the cyber world and physical
    world can be linked together and generate many kinds of service-oriented applications
    to industries. 3.3.1. M2M area networks M2M area networks aim to furnish connection
    and communication between all kinds of smart machines and sensors and some other
    smart terminals. They can be divided into personal area networks, which include
    IEEE 802.15, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and local networks, which include WIFI, wireless
    M-Bus, and power line communication. According to the range of radiation, transmission
    speed and energy constraints, the area network can supply different services like
    file sharing, video, smart grids, and RFID. 3.3.2. M2M application With the development
    of economy and the improvement of social information level, how to build a ubiquitous
    network society has become a great concern of the government, academia and enterprises
    in many countries. In addition, the increasing number of devices and productions
    including the fast development of social network need rapidly deploy solutions
    that can optimize your business processes and help deliver better and faster services.
    The M2M application is delivered as a cloud-based service to reduce complexity
    and maintenance concerns [63]. It will also take companies robust, proven technology
    based on the highly secure, industry-leading network infrastructure. What’s more,
    the M2M application has built to handle large-scale deployments, high transaction
    rates, and support a large number of concurrent users and reporting assets. In
    industry, the key architecture of smart factories is to realize horizontal integration,
    vertical integration and terminal-to-terminal integration. Industries realize
    the interaction of devices and terminals will improve the efficiency of manufacturing
    chains and monitor and maintain every part of it. In another way, smart enterprises
    need to realize the complete product life cycle management. All parts must coordinate
    and connect with each other to realize flexible and sustainable development, from
    design, materials and processes to logistics, employment and customer service.
    What’s more, every product is a smart terminal. It will know where the user came
    from, and predict where the user will go and what can the user can do. M2M communication
    can supply this to us. ICPS is just the evolution of M2M and achieves the goal
    of sustainable development, green businesses and smart manufacturing. 4. Key challenges
    As a whole, researchers have made some progress in the construction of industrial
    CPS, and the development of cloud technologies has played an important role in
    this system. However, CPS remains in the embryonic stage. A variety of issues
    and challenges need to be further solved at different layers of the architecture
    and from different aspects of system design to ease the integration of the physical
    and cyber worlds. In this chapter, we outline some challenges as follows. 4.1.
    Industrial cloud In industrial environments, information islands are an important
    reason to reduce production efficiency. Mutual equipment cooperation is not smooth,
    information cannot interact, the state cannot be notified in a timely manner,
    and these aspects will restrict the development of enterprises. Industrial clouds
    refer to cloud-computing modes that provide software services to industrial enterprises,
    and social resources can share cloud service platforms which can be easily searched
    by companies. Industrial clouds will greatly reduce the threshold of manufacturing
    information construction. In the process of building smart factories and Industry
    4.0, it will be as the pivotal player to help to realize horizontal integration
    between factories and vertical integration in a manufacturing chain. However,
    the data from different factories and different machines have their own characteristics
    and formats. Developing methods to integrate these data and realize sharing among
    factories is therefore very important. Industrial clouds can extract and integrate
    these data to help industrial organizations to overcome the information gap in
    industrial domains by providing information exchange systems. In this way, it
    will reduce conversion and downtime of equipment and increase the production efficiency.
    In another way, it will also provide an efficient solution to search for business
    partners, industrial processes, components, and technologies, as well as to respond
    to industrial issues to strengthen cooperation between plants, and improve the
    interaction and cooperation between the equipment. For example, in the manufacturing
    chain, we can integrate different pieces of information from different enterprises
    and cooperate with each to finish a product. Moreover, we can monitor the product’s
    entire life cycle and collect the information to supply to customer service. What’s
    more, the industrial cloud will also help to monitor the condition of machines
    all the time and report the information to the maintenance department. It will
    find the problems with equipment in advance, reduce equipment downtime, and improve
    production efficiency. In another way, industrial clouds will provide a big cloud
    platform and generate various services to companies to optimize their office business.
    In this cloud platform, they can achieve internal and external collaborative work,
    message synchronization anytime and anywhere, and realize unlimited imagination
    in the office system. Furthermore, in this platform, these services are free and
    are updated frequently, which will save costs and increase their production efficiency.
    4.2. Data mining Due to the popularity of big data, data mining has developed
    much interest in many domains, such as business intelligence, web searching and
    digital libraries. Data mining involves discovering novel, interesting, and potentially
    useful patterns from large data sets and applying algorithms to the extraction
    of hidden information [64]. It can form many usage applications including risk
    analysis, targeted marketing, customer retention, and portfolio management. The
    objective of any data mining process is to build an efficient predictive or descriptive
    model of a large amount of data that not only best fits or explains it, but is
    also able to generalize to new data [65]. Based on a broad view of data mining
    functionality, data mining is the process of discovering interesting knowledge
    from large amounts of data stored in either databases [66], data warehouses, or
    other information repositories. Based on the definition of data mining and the
    definition of data mining functions, a typical data mining process includes data
    preparation, data mining and data presentation [67]. In factories, everywhere
    and every time has data generation, the main data resources come from designing,
    manufacturing chains, logistics information, equipment condition monitoring, and
    social network information. Different kinds of data present big challenges to
    process, store, transform and analyze to represent the desired result, which is
    very essential to industries. Moreover, much of these data are semi-structured
    or unstructured, which is different from traditional structured data. All of these
    characteristics determine that we must use different algorithm to analyze them.
    For instance, we must use classification modeling to analyze discrete data while
    we use regression modeling to process continuous data. For another part, with
    numerous data arising from different data sources and in different formats, big
    challenges may arise that will vitally affect our analysis result. In this paper,
    we will focus on the following aspect of data sources, and talk about some of
    their key problems for data mining [68]. Just as we show in Table 3, all of these
    problems will cause distortion of data, which will reduce the value of its analysis.
    Furthermore, data security and privacy have become an essential task for every
    corporation to solve. Data assault and leakage have deeply affected the interests
    of many enterprises. So, data mining will also a big problem in the industry.
    Table 3. The challenges in data mining. Data source Challenges Sensors (e.g. equipment
    condition) Low accuracy, various error Noise affecting the test result Machines
    (e.g. manufacturing chain) Much variable, too much adjust data Unstructured data
    Office system (e.g. logistics transportation) Data record is not accurate Important
    data missing or ignored Cloud service (e.g. social network information) Data security,
    privacy, authority and accuracy 4.3. Real-time processing and reliability Industrial
    wireless networks are essential for industrial systems to realize smart monitoring
    and timely control. In different industrial systems, due to different requirements,
    companies need various qualities of service, which are reliability, energy efficiency,
    low latency and high throughput [69], [70], [71]. These are especially important
    in real-time control systems, which need the data to be transmitted in a timely
    manner. This is similar to mobile automated guided vehicles, which are used to
    transport and load commodities in the manufacturing chain. Sometimes, IWNs must
    cooperate with the machines and production transfer belts to realize seamless
    connection. Thus, the control signal must be transmitted to the components timely
    and accurately. The real-time processing and reliability will also be exhibited
    by remote maintenance capability. In the new process of ICPS, all of machines
    are automated and unmanned. They need to equip self-detection equipment to monitor
    its condition. While some indicators of the machine over the warning line, we
    must adjust it as soon as possible to avoid downtime and mechanical damage. Due
    to less people participate in the manufacturing chain, so all of these sensor,
    actuator and network infrastructure must keep reliability for a long time. Although,
    every AP supplier has its own distinctive advantage, in our survey, we can find
    that all of these advantages are insufficient to realize reliability and real-time
    communication. The most important requirements for reliability and real-time processing
    are latency and packet loss rate, but none of the current systems can achieve
    low delay and loss-free packet transmission. In fact, according to our experience,
    we use some APs to realize wireless roaming to reduce latency to acceptable levels,
    but when we use a computer to connect the AP and communicate with it, the latency
    and packet loss rates increase significantly. However, in manufacturing chains,
    some work steps are needed to achieve perfect synchronization, and this latency
    and data loss can destroy the entire production chain. 4.4. Information security
    and privacy Currently, information security and privacy has grown popular and
    caused more and more interest [72], [73]. Now, we can use cloud tools and other
    resources to search and analyze multimedia files. The final goal of big data is
    to share information for all systems and people. However, increased information
    disclosure and privacy violations have generated concerns [74]. In the time of
    fast development of information, ICT and ICPS aim to integrate everything in the
    big Internet of things system and make them interact with each other. This is
    a big chance to make systems more intelligent and automated, but it is imperative
    for humans to maintain security. 4.4.1. Retention of network security Ethernet
    and wireless networks are the most important information transfer channels in
    the world. In the time of Industry 4.0, it is the foundation technology of ICPS.
    With more and more devices connected to networks, it will cause network congestion
    and the increase of network latency. For another part, if the network is assaulted,
    all of the machines will experience downtime. 4.4.2. Maintaining industrial information
    security In intelligent manufacturing chains, all of the machines are embedded
    into microcomputers and work by themselves through some programs. This will save
    manual work but acquires a threat of information security. If someone invades
    the industrial system and modifies programs to control these machines, it could
    give the factory a devastating blow, similar to the case of the intrusion incident
    of government office systems, which has caused a breach the government can’t handle.
    4.4.3. Maintain data security Recently, most companies have connected to a cloud
    server and deployed its applications. The cloud is a source pool so big that no
    company can control it. Data explosions and attacks have become a big threat to
    many domains. With limited storage space, we can’t store and analyze all of the
    data. Furthermore, most of the rubbish information will cause high latency or
    even destroy our system. Thus, it is inevitable to maintain data security. 5.
    Conclusions In this paper, we addressed the architecture of cloud-assisted industrial
    CPS, and highlighted some key enabling technologies in this process. Then, we
    reviewed some challenges that need to be solved in the future. Cloud-assisted
    CPS is a service-oriented technology. CPS aims to link anything to the Internet,
    but the cloud will provide work after this is achieved. It will be based on cloud
    services and big datasets to realize the integration of devices with devices,
    devices with products, and the cyber world with the physical world. Then, it will
    supply real-time services and PLCM to customers and products. It is an important
    part of smart manufacturing and smart factories. In this process, enabling technologies
    will play an important role in data mining, data analysis and data transformation.
    It will provide support for information and communication to achieve the integration
    of the industrialization and serialization of data. It will always provide support
    for optimizing production efficiency, optimizing production and optimizing service
    quality. However, some challenges will affect the efficiency and quality of services.
    The solution of these problems will play an important role in the future. Then,
    these factories can be directly linked with users to fulfill their real-time demand.
    In the era of Industry 4.0, the use of some enabling technologies to link the
    cyber world and physical world is essential and these key enabling technologies
    supply a big support to the system of ICPS. However, in the future, we also have
    many problems to solve, such as the challenges of security and privacy. Cloud
    computing and big data require many more applications and data sources, but they
    will also encumber us with much rubbish data and data violation. In another way,
    the building of Industry 4.0 is a long way off, some years or even some decades.
    We should follow the direction of the road and develop more technologies to achieve
    it. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Rural areas in South Africa and Zambia face a number
    of similar issues in the domains of agriculture, connectivity, water, transport,
    health and education etc., which calls for potentially similar solutions to be
    directed towards solving these issues. The intention of this research is to investigate
    the potential contributions of internet of things technologies (IoT) towards poverty
    reduction in these rural areas, in line with the needs identified in these communities
    and with emphasis on agriculture. The paper identifies examples of IoTs to mitigate
    the agricultural needs of these communities for the domains of crop farming, weather
    forecasting, wildlife management, forestry, livestock farming, market identification
    and rural financing. Published in: 2015 International Conference on Emerging Trends

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Windhoek, Namibia I. Introduction Agricultural
    informatics, also referred to as e-agriculture, is a field which combines the
    advances in agricultural information, agricultural development and entrepreneurship
    to provide agricultural-services-enhanced-technology, dissemination and information
    delivery through information and communications technologies (K''Ts) and the internet
    [9]. E-agriculture focuses on enhancing agricultural and rural development through
    improved information and communication processes. More specifically e-agriculture
    involves the conceptualisation, design, development, evaluation and application
    of innovative ways to use ICTs in the rural domain with a focus on agriculture
    [11]. ICT is an umbrella term that includes anything from radio to satellite technology
    to mobile phones or electronic money transfers. There is growing interest in the
    potential of internet of things technologies (loT) to support poverty alleviation
    and the upliftment of the living standards of people in rural areas. The contribution
    of this research is the investigation of the potential contributions of loTs to
    the domain of agriculture for rural environments of Zambia and South Africa. IoT
    on the other hand is the connecting of physical things to the internet which makes
    it possible to access remote sensor data and control the physical world from a
    distance [13]. The loT has the purpose of providing an ICT-infrastructure facilitating
    the exchange of ‘things’ in a secure and reliable manner, i.e., its function is
    to overcome the gap between objects in the physical world and their representation
    in information systems [23]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors References Citations

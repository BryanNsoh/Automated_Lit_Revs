    diagram Show All D. Design of Power Supply Module In this research project, the
    red plum apricot planting site is located in the desertified sandy land. Due to
    the remote location, there is no electric equipment that can provide stable power
    supply to the nodes, therefore, in order to meet the long-term requirements of
    the agricultural irrigation monitoring system, it is necessary to design a power
    supply module that can cope with the harsh environment of the construction site,
    has a long service life, and has less influence on the harsh environmental factors.
    In order to ensure the stable operation of the network system, a solar power supply

    together with a 15AH battery and a 12V 10A solar controller. The installation
    site of the equipment in this study is located in the desertification sandy land
    in Wuzhong City, Ningxia, with little rain all year round, drastic temperature
    changes and frequent sandy weather. In order to meet the field application requirements
    while protecting the terminal node and power supply module can work normally,
    so as to guarantee the accurate monitoring of environmental parameters, this study

    site installation Show All SECTION III. DESIGN OF SOFTWARE A. IoT Cloud Platform
    Design Based on relevant open source components, this study designs and builds
    a miniaturized IoT cloud platform that can support multiple heterogeneous IoT
    products at the same time, which contains the main functions similar to those
    of IoT cloud platforms such as Ali Cloud and Someone Cloud. Before proceeding
    to build the IoT cloud platform, the basic workbench should be built first, the
    relevant development environment should be configured, the necessary open source
    components should be installed, and then the basic framework of the project code
    should be built [6]. The relevant open source components selected for this study
    are as follows: MongoDB: A distributed database for storing IoT cloud data. Redis:
    This study uses Redis as a caching tool for the IoT cloud platform. Node.js: JavaScript
    runtime environment based on Node.js engine. RabbitMQ: AMQP (Advanced Message
    Queue) protocol based on Erlang language. Mosquino MQTT Client: In this study,
    the Mosquino MQTT Client is selected to be downloaded and installed together with
    the Mosquino Broker. EMQ X: Open IoT MQTT Message Server. For the irrigation monitoring
    system software side of the functional requirements, the system of the IoT cloud
    platform component architecture design, first build a good cloud platform required
    open source components, components and project structure. Then the three major
    functional modules of the IoT cloud platform, namely device lifecycle management,
    uplink data processing and downlink data processing system, are designed and built,
    and finally the PC terminal and WeChat applet are built using the open source
    components. This research uses the cloud configuration editor to easily drag and
    drop to draw the display interface to effectively bind to the data on the cloud
    server side for a more intuitive display. Using the open source cloud configuration
    editor function, combined with the above already implemented using EMQ X''s Hook
    mechanism to achieve the equipment uplink data receiving function, calling the
    API interface, can achieve more intuitive data monitoring function. The PC-side
    interface of the agricultural irrigation monitoring system implemented using the
    cloud configuration editor is shown in Figure 7. The interface of WeChat applet
    side is shown in Figure 8. Fig. 7. PC side interface diagram Show All Fig. 8.
    WeChat applet side interface diagram Show All The agricultural irrigation monitoring
    system designed in this study can process and store environmental parameters and
    equipment control information of the red plum apricot plantation to help red plum
    apricot growers better manage their soil conditions, and collect and store environmental
    parameters and equipment control information in real time through the IoT cloud
    platform. With powerful data storage function, the system can better manage the
    growth environment of red plum apricot and provide more effective decision support.
    In this paper, soil temperature and humidity data is used as an example. The soil
    temperature and humidity data display is designed in such a way that not only
    the current soil temperature data can be monitored in real time, but also converted
    into a curve graph to better understand the changes in the environment. The time
    period of 2023-03-08 00:00:00 to 2023-03-10 23:59:59 is intercepted. For example,
    the comparative curves of soil temperature data for node 1, node 2 and node 3
    are shown in Figure 9. Fig. 9. Soil temperature data comparison graph Show All
    B. Water Demand Prediction Model Design In this research, the agricultural irrigation
    monitoring system is designed for field application in desertification sandy environment,
    where irrigation water resources are severely scarce, and advance knowledge of
    crop planting water demand can better plan the irrigation water consumption in
    advance [7]. In this research, a time series prediction model based on BP neural
    network and a time series prediction model based on genetic algorithm optimized
    BP neural network are designed to address the practical needs of crop water demand
    prediction. The data set was constructed by collecting the actual water consumption
    during the irrigation operation of the system, and the two prediction models were
    trained. Based on the model training test accuracy results, the time series prediction
    model based on genetic algorithm optimized BP neural network was selected as the
    prediction model for water demand of red plum apricot planting. The final output
    of the prediction model is the irrigation water demand of red plum apricot, and
    the irrigation operation can be arranged according to the predicted water demand
    of the model, which can meet the actual water demand of the crop and save water
    and improve the utilization rate of water compared with the manual experience
    control of irrigation water. The number of nodes in the hidden layer can improve
    the prediction accuracy of the model. When designing the topology of the BP neural
    network, the number of neurons in the hidden layer should be determined first.
    15 historical water consumption data are chosen as the independent variables in
    this study, so the number of nodes in the input layer of the BP neural network
    is 15. The number of nodes in the output layer is 15, and the number of nodes
    in the output layer is 1. After formula calculation and program debugging, the
    number of nodes in the hidden layer is determined to be 5, so the BP neural network
    structure designed in this study is 15×5×1, and the structure diagram is shown
    in 10. Fig. 10. BP neural network architecture diagram Show All The implicit layer
    transfer function uses Sigmoid type transfer function, the maximum number of iterations
    is 1000, the learning rate is 0.01, the target error (error threshold) is 10\"6,
    and the training function and simulation function are trainlm and sim respectively.
    15 historical water consumption data are used as a time step in this study, and
    a total of 937 sets of historical water consumption data are selected, of which
    the training set accounts for 0.7 of the data set, the number of samples in the
    training set is 656, and the number of samples in the test set is 266. In order
    to evaluate the prediction effect of BP neural network model more accurately,
    this study is designed to quantitatively evaluate the model prediction effect
    by using root mean square error (RMSE), which is obtained by summing the absolute
    value of the square of the difference between the predicted value and the true
    value, and then taking its average value and opening the square, and is an excellent
    evaluation index to evaluate the accuracy of the model. When the genetic algorithm
    is set, the coding range and length are determined first, and the coding range
    of chromosomes in the genetic algorithm is between [-1,1] and the same range of
    weights and thresholds set for the BP neural network. In this study, the number
    of nodes in the input layer of BP neural network is set to 15, the number of nodes
    in the hidden layer is 5, and the number of nodes in the output layer is 1, so
    there are 15×5+5×1=80 weights and 5+1=6 thresholds, so the individual coding length
    of genetic algorithm is 80+6=86. Secondly, determine the coding method as real
    number coding, determine the fitness function, and calculate the fitness value.
    Then determine the selection operation formula, the crossover operation formula
    and the variation operation formula. The number of iterations, population size,
    crossover probability and variation probability also need to be set before the
    genetic algorithm starts. Since the number of iterations and population size directly
    affect the search accuracy and algorithm efficiency, the number of iterations
    was finally set to 50 and the population size to 5. Fig. 11. Prediction results
    of the training set model Show All The model is built using MATLAB software, and
    the initial weights and thresholds of the network are firstly searched by genetic
    algorithm, and after the global optimal solution is calculated by genetic algorithm,
    the weights and thresholds are assigned to the BP neural network, and the BP neural
    network is trained and predicted based on the optimized weights and thresholds,
    and the prediction results of the training set and test set of the optimized BP
    neural network model based on genetic algorithm are shown in Figure 11 and Figure
    12 show. Fig. 12. Prediction results of the test set model Show All As shown in
    Figure 11 and Figure 12, the RMSE value of the training set of the genetic algorithm-based
    optimized BP neural network model is 0.0077408 and the RMSE value of the test
    set is 0.0099119. After the model is trained, the test effect is better and the
    accuracy is higher. The genetic algorithm optimized BP neural network is more
    reliable and stable in water demand prediction, and its prediction results have
    practical reference value. SECTION IV. Conclusion With the continuous development
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and the restructuring of the agricultural
    planting industry, it is the trend to combine IoT technology with agricultural
    production to build a modem agricultural production, and informationization, precision
    and wisdom of agricultural production are the inevitable development trend of
    modem agriculture. In this study, an agricultural irrigation monitoring system
    based on IoT cloud platform and a time series water demand prediction model based
    on genetic algorithm optimized BP neural network are designed and implemented
    in a pilot application demonstration of red plum apricot intelligent drip irrigation
    project in Ningxia desertification sandy land improvement, and combined with the
    field planting environment and irrigation demand. For the hardware side of the
    agricultural irrigation monitoring system, the communication network networking
    architecture, terminal nodes and power supply module are developed and implemented.
    For the software side of the agricultural irrigation monitoring system, starting
    from the functional requirements of the software side of the irrigation monitoring
    system, the component architecture of the IoT cloud platform was designed, and
    the open source components, components and project structure required to build
    the cloud platform were determined. The three major functional modules of the
    IOT cloud platform, namely equipment life cycle management, uplink data processing
    and downlink data processing system, were built using open source components for
    PC and WeChat applets to realize the data visualization operation interface. It
    can improve the water utilization rate and water saving efficiency, which can
    promote agricultural farming and water saving irrigation in desertified sandy
    land. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was funded by the Ningxia Desertification Sand
